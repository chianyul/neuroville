J	Petrides, M				Petrides, M			Lateral prefrontal cortex: architectonic and functional organization	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						prefrontal cortex; frontal cortex; cytoarchitecture; monkey	COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTION PATTERNS; PRIMATE FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; WORKING-MEMORY; MACAQUE MONKEYS; PARIETAL CORTEX; VISUAL-STIMULI; EYE FIELDS; SYSTEM	A comparison of the architecture of the human prefrontal cortex with that of the macaque monkey showed a very similar architectonic organization in these two primate species. There is no doubt that the prefrontal cortical areas of the human brain have undergone considerable development, but it is equally clear that the basic architectonic organization is the same in the two species. Thus, a comparative approach to the study of the functional organization of the primate prefrontal cortex is more likely to reveal the essential aspects of the various complex control processes that are the domain of frontal function. The lateral frontal cortex appears to be functionally organized along both a rostral-caudal axis and a dorsal-ventral axis. The most caudal frontal region, the motor region on the precentral gyrus, is involved in fine motor control and direct sensorimotor mappings, whereas the caudal lateral prefrontal region is involved in higher order control processes that regulate the selection among multiple competing responses and stimuli based on conditional operations. Further rostrally, the mid-lateral prefrontal region plays an even more abstract role in cognitive control. The mid-lateral prefrontal region is itself organized along a dorsal-ventral axis of organization, with the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex being involved in the monitoring of information in working memory and the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal region being involved in active judgments on information held in posterior cortical association regions that are necessary for active retrieval and encoding of information.

By recording basal forebrain units in association with electroencephalographic activity across the sleep - wake cycle and labeling individual neurons with Neurobiotin for immunohistochemical identification, we show for the first time that cholinergic neurons discharge in bursts at maximal rates during active waking and paradoxical sleep, when gamma and theta electroencephalographic activity are maximal. They virtually cease firing during slow-wave sleep. Notably, their bursting discharge is synchronized with theta oscillations. Through their maximal firing and rhythmic theta discharge during active waking and paradoxical sleep, the cholinergic neurons can thus modulate the cortex to promote activation along with plasticity during these two states.

We previously reported that PIMT expression and activity are reduced by half in human epileptic hippocampus. Here we investigated PIMT regulation in astrocytic tumors, which are the most common human brain tumors. PIMT expression and enzyme activity were significantly decreased in all grades of human astrocytic tumors. More precisely, PIMT levels were significantly lower by 76% in pilocytic astrocytomas (grade I), 46% in astrocytomas (grade II), 69% in anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III), and a marked 80% in glioblastomas (grade IV) as compared to normal brains. RT-PCR analysis showed that levels of type I PIMT mRNA were up-regulated while those of type II PIMT mRNA were down-regulated in glioblastomas. Furthermore, the reduced PIMT levels correlated closely with a decrease in the number of neuron cells in astrocytic tumors as assessed by measuring the neuron-specific enolase level. Many proteins with abnormal aspartyl residues accumulated in brain tumors and some were specific to individual grades of astrocytic tumors. Similar results were obtained; either by measuring the reduction in PIMT activity and expression or by measuring the formation of abnormal proteins, in an orthotopic rat brain tumor model implanted with invasive CNS-1 glioma cells. The novelty of these findings was to provide the first evidence for a marked reduction of PIMT expression and activity during stage progression of astrocytic tumors in humans. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, in Rb knock- out mice, these cells develop tumors with high frequency. To understand the implication of limiting Rb expression in these cells, we investigated the action of Rb and its related pocket proteins, p107 and p130, on POMC gene transcription. This led to the identification of the neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, NeuroD1, as a target of Rb action. Rb and to a lesser extent p107, but not p130, enhance NeuroD1-dependent transcription, and this activity appears to depend on direct protein interactions between the Rb pocket and the helix-loop-helix domain of NeuroD1. In vivo, NeuroD is found in a complex that includes Rb and also the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B, which mediates corticotropin-releasing hormone activation of POMC transcription. The formation of a similar complex in vitro requires the presence of Rb as a bridge between NeuroD and NGFI-B. In POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells, Rb and p107 are present on the POMC promoter and inhibition of their expression through small interfering RNA decreases POMC mRNA levels. The action of Rb and its related proteins on POMC transcription may contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of the differentiation phenotype.

A prominent way in which Eph receptors sculpt cellular morphology is by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton and the surrounding plasma membrane through the regulation of Rho family GTPases. Two articles in this issue of Neuron (Sahin et al. and Cowan et al.) shed light on how Eph receptors recruit guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho family GTPases to modulate growth cone dynamics.

However, these findings were based on acute administrations of 5-HT4 receptor agonists and antagonists, which were active only in a subpopulation of 5-HT neurons. We bad no evidence that this influence was significant when considering the entire DRN, nor if it was persistent after chronic treatments. In addition, the poor distribution of 5-HT4 receptors within the DRN raised the question of the neuroanatomical bases underlying this control. Methods and Results. Here we show that the subacute intraperitoneal (IP) injection of the 5-HT4 receptor agonists prucalopride (2.5 mg/kg) and RS 67333 (1.5 mg/kg) 30 minutes before the beginning of recordings augment the mean firing rate of DRN neurons by 40916 and 66%, respectively. These increases remain stable when the compounds are administered continuously during 3 and 21 days; the effects of the 3-day treatment are blocked by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist GR 12548 7 (1000 mu g/kg, intravenous [i.v]). in addition, stereotaxic microinjections of herpes simplex viruses, transformed to overexpress 5-HT4 receptors, increase DRN 5-HT neuronal mean activity when performed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but not in the striatum or in the hippocampus. Conclusions. This finding suggests the existence of a 5-HT4-dependent activation of DRN that may involve the mPFC, unveiling the 5-HT4 receptor as a putative player in the physiopathology of several disorders related to central 5-HT dysfunction.

We have investigated the origin and characteristics of reactive microglia in the acute phase of their activation in the dentate gyrus following transection of the entorhino-dentate perforant path projection. To investigate the possible link between microglia and hematopoietic precursors, we analyzed the expression of the stem cell marker CD34 by lesion-reactive microglia in conjunction with the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and the use of radiation bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice. We found that CD34 is upregulated on early-activated resident microglia, rather than by infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells. The number of CD34+ microglia peaked at day 3 when 67% of the resident CD11b/Mac-1+ microglia co-expressed CD34, and all CD34+ cells co-expressed Mac-1, and decreased sharply toward day 5, unlike Mac-1, which was maximally expressed at day 5. Approximately 80% of the CD34+ cells in the denervated dentate gyrus had incorporated BrdU into their nuclei at day 3. We also showed that CD34 is upregulated on early-activated microglia in the facial motor nucleus following peripheral axotomy. The results suggest lesion-reactive microglia to consist of functionally distinct subpopulations of cells; a major population of activated resident CD34+Mac-1+ microglia with a high capacity for self-renewal, and a subpopulation of CD34-Mac-1+ microglia which has a mixed extrinsic and intrinsic origin and whose proliferative capacity is unknown. 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Database searches reveal two other Crumbs homologs on chromosomes 9q33.3 and 19p13.3. The purpose of this study was to characterize the Crumbs homolog 2 (CRB2) gene on 9q33.3, to analyze its expression pattern, and to determine whether mutations in CRB2 are associated with RP and LCA. METHODS: The CRB2 mRNA and its expression pattern in human tissues were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cellular expression of Crb2 in the mouse eye was determined by mRNA in situ hybridizations. The open reading frame and splice junctions of CRB2 were analyzed for mutations by single-strand conformation analysis and direct nucleotide sequencing in 85 RP patients and 79 LCA patients. RESULTS: The CRB2 gene consists of 13 exons and encodes a 1285 amino acid transmembrane protein. CRB2 is mainly expressed in retina, brain, and kidney. In mouse retina Crb2 expression was detected in all cell layers. Mutation analysis of the CRB2 gene revealed 11 sequence variants leading to an amino acid substitution. Three of them were not identified in control individuals and affect conserved amino acid residues. However, the patients that carry these sequence variants do not have a second sequence variant on the other allele, excluding autosomal recessive inheritance of CRB2 sequence variants as a cause of their disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that CRB2 sequence variants are not a common cause of autosomal recessive RP and LCA. It is possible that a more complex clinical phenotype is associated with the loss or altered function of CRB2 in humans due to its expression in tissues other than the retina.

Here, we test this hypothesis for a major animal group (birds) by examining whether large-brained species show higher survival than small-brained species when introduced to normative locations. Using a global database documenting the outcome of >600 introduction events, we confirm that avian species with larger brains, relative to their body mass, tend to be more successful at establishing themselves in novel environments. Moreover, we provide evidence that larger brains help birds respond to novel conditions by enhancing their innovation propensity rather than indirectly through noncognitive mechanisms. These findings provide strong evidence for the hypothesis that enlarged brains function, and hence may have evolved, to deal with changes in the environment.

Here, we demonstrate that aftiphilin is expressed predominantly in brain where it is enriched on clathrin-coated vesicles. In addition to eight gamma-ear-binding motifs, aftiphilin contains two WXXF-acidic motifs that mediate binding to the a-ear of clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and three FXXFXXF/L motifs that mediate binding to the alpha- and beta 2-ear. We demonstrate that aftiphilin uses these motifs for interactions with AP-1 and AP-2 and that it immunoprecipitates these APs but not AP-3 or AP-4 from brain extracts. Aftiphilin demonstrates a brefeldin A sensitive localization to the trans-Golgi network in hippocampal neurons where it co-localizes with AP-1. Aftiphilin is also found at synapses where it co-localizes with synaptophysin and AP-2. Our data suggest a role for aftiphilin in clathrin-mediated trafficking in neurons.

Multiple candidate genes have been studied in ADHD, including the norepinephrine transporter (NET1) and dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1). NET1 is implicated in ADHD because of the efficacy of atomoxetine, a selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of ADHD. DRD1 is primarily implicated through mouse models of ADHD. DNA from 163 ADHD probands, 192 parents, and 129 healthy controls was used to investigate possible associations between ADHD and polymorphisms in 12 previously studied candidate genes (5-HTlB, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, ADRA2A, CHRNA4, COMT, DAT1, DRD1, DRD4, DRD5, NET1, and SNA-P-25). Analyses included case-control and family-based methods, and dimensional measures of behavior, cognition, and anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Of the 12 genes examined, two showed a significant association with ADHD. Transmission disequilibrium. test (TDT) analysis revealed significant association of two NETI single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with ADRD (P < 0.009); case-control analysis revealed significant association of two DRD1 SNPs with ADHD (P < 0.008). No behavioral, cognitive, or brain MRI volume measurement significantly differed across NET1 or DRD1 genotypes at an alpha of 0.01. This study provides support for an association between ADHD and polymorphisms in both NET1 and DRD1; polymorphisms in ten other candidate genes were not associated with ADHD. Because family-based and case-control methods gave divergent results, both should be used in genetic studies of ADHD.

In this study, we use functional imaging to demonstrate that a subregion of MT/V5 is more strongly activated by unidirectional motion with speed gradients than by other motion patterns. Our results suggest that like the monkey homolog middle temporal area (MT), human MT/V5 contains neurons selective for the processing of speed gradients. Such neurons may constitute an intermediate stage of processing between neurons selective for the average speed of unidirectional motion and neurons selective for different combinations of speed gradient and different motion directions such as expanding optical flow patterns.

Methods A literature review of mortality and morbidity studies related to suicide among pesticide-exposed populations, and of human and animal studies of tentral nervous system toxicity related to organophosphate (OP) pesticides was performed. Results Suicide rates are high infarming populations. Animal studies link OP exposure to serotonin disturbances in the central nervous system, which are implicated in depression and suicide in humans. Epidemiological studies conclude that acute and chronic OP exposure is associated with affective disorders. Case series and ecological studies also support a causal association between OP use and suicide. Conclusions OPs are not only agents for suicide. They may be part of the causal pathway. Emphasizing OPs solely as agents for suicide shifts responsibility for prevention to the individual, reducing corporate responsibility and limiting policy options available for control. Am. J. Ind.

When given early, interferon beta also reduces the rate of development of brain atrophy and improves axonal integrity. Nerve growth factor (NGF) can retard the severity and course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Objective: To determine whether interferon beta effects on patients with MS could be related to modulation of neurotrophin production within the central nervous system. Design: We studied neurotrophin production by human glial and brain endothelial cells in response to coculture with MS patient-derived lymphocytes, and correlated levels of NGF secretion with clinical and magnetic resonance imaging-defined markers of disease. Results: We demonstrate that production of NGF by human brain microvascular endothelial cells is triggered by interaction with T lymphocytes derived from MS patients. No such response was observed. using human adult microglia or human fetal astrocytes. Nerve growth factor production by endothelial cells was potentiated by pretreating lymphocytes with interferon beta in vitro, and by using lymphocytes derived from MS patients treated with interferon beta in vivo. By using this assay, we show that levels of NGF induced by lymphocytes from MS patients inversely correlate with magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain atrophy and axonal injury, Conclusion: These findings suggest that interferon beta-mediated production of NGF at the level of the blood-brain barrier, whether acting as an immunomodulator or directly on neural cells, is another potential mechanism contributing to the magnetic resonance imaging-defined effect of interferon beta on brain atrophy when given early in the course of MS.

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material							IMITATION; IMPAIRMENT; CHILDREN	The notion that manual gestures played an important role in the evolution of human language was strengthened by the discovery of mirror neurons in monkey area F5, the proposed homologue of human Broca's area. This idea is central to the thesis developed by Arbib, and lending further support to a link between motor resonance mechanisms and language/communication development is the case of autism and congenital blindness. We provide an account of how these conditions may relate to the aforementioned theory.

Photosensitive patients may have seizures when exposed to environmental stimuli producing appropriate flickering light or geometric patterns. Some children with benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy have seizures triggered by unexpected touch or noise. Seizures induced by thinking have been reported in response to non-verbal higher mental activity such as mental arithmetic. Praxis-induced seizures are triggered by similar mental activities accompanied by the use of the hands. Language-induced seizures are usually triggered by verbal higher mental activity. Functional imaging and other methods have contributed to understanding how these seizures arise. Patients with these generalized reflex seizures appear to have regions of cortical hyperexcitability overlapping or coinciding with areas physiologically activated during specific sensory stimulations and cognitive or motor activities. When these areas receive appropriate afferent volleys and a critical mass of cortex is activated, an epileptic activity is produced that ultimately involves cortico-reticular or cortico-cortical pathways resulting in a generalized or bilateral epileptic event.

BRAIN			English	Article						selective attention; conflict monitoring; frontal lobes; lesion; human	STROOP TASK; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FRONTAL-LOBE; CONFLICT; REWARD; INTERFERENCE; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; BRAIN; DISSOCIATION	Functional neuroimaging studies in normal humans suggest that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays an important role in cognitive control. This brain area is reliably activated when tasks require the ongoing adjustment of the allocation of attention. The dACC has come to occupy a central role in theories of attention and cognitive control, which hold that dACC either monitors response conflict, signalling the need for adjustments in cognitive processes, or directly mediates such adjustments. However, functional imaging results cannot establish that a brain area is necessary for a particular cognitive process. This requires evidence from loss-of-function studies. Here we assessed cognitive control in four human subjects with damage to dACC and 12 age- and education-matched control subjects using several measures drawn from the functional imaging literature. All four subjects with dACC damage showed normal adjustments in performance following manipulation of response conflict in both Stroop and go-no go tasks. Furthermore, damage to the dACC did not impair the phenomenon of post-error slowing, nor alter the ability to adjust performance in response to explicit speed or accuracy instructions. Thus, cognitive control, as assessed by four different measures in two different tasks, appears to be intact in these subjects, arguing against a necessary role for dACC in this process.

Two partially segregated systems of functional integration were highlighted: the tool condition was associated with an enhancement of connectivity within left hemispheric regions, including the inferior prefrontal and premotor cortex, the inferior parietal lobule and the temporo-occipital junction; the animal condition was associated with greater coupling among left visual associative regions. These category-specific functional differences extend the evidence for anatomical specialization to lexical search tasks, and provide for the first time evidence of category-specific patterns of functional integration in word-retrieval.

This may represent a maladaptive strategy; suppression may result in language improvement. We applied slow, 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to an anterior portion of R Broca's homologue daily, for 10 days in four aphasia patients who were 5-11 years poststroke. Significant improvement was observed in picture naming at 2 months post-rTMS, with lasting benefit at 8 months in three patients. This preliminary, open trial suggests that rTMS may provide a novel treatment approach for aphasia by possibly modulating the distributed, bi-hemispheric language network. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It was hypothesized that those patients having participated in this programme would show a shorter PTA than those patients that did not. Method: Duration of PTA for 12 patients with TBI who were part of the North Star Project was compared with that of 26 patients matched for initial GCS and age for whom this approach was not available (control group). Results: Length of PTA was shorter by 5 days for the North Star patients. This result was not statistically significant (p=0.19) but is clinically relevant. No between-group difference was found for Glasgow Coma Scale. Conclusions: Consequences of shorter PTA would include increased and more appropriate patient interaction and earlier transfer to rehabilitation. The North Star project also allows the family to become more actively involved in the treatment of their loved one. Further study is required to evaluate this intervention strategy to improve orientation for the patient with TBI.

We discuss here the role of immune cytokines and chemokines as mediators of innate glial responses in the central nervous system. Glial responses to axonal degeneration in the hippocampus dentate gyros are initiated independently of immune involvement, following transection of afferent entorhinal (perforant path) axons. The glial responses that we measure involve early microglial and somewhat later astrocyte activations. Among the earliest responses are the expression of a wide profile of chemokines, and of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) is not normally produced in the CNS, but TNF alpha levels are enhanced if it is present. Viral vector-derived IFN gamma directly induces the expression of chemokines in the CNS, in the absence of any other inflammatory event, but the profiles differ from those induced by axotomy. Chemokines that bind the CCR2 receptor are implicated in traffic of macrophages and T cells to the denervated hippocampus. Innate responses in the immune system are directed by Toll-like receptors (TLR). Our recent studies focus on specific TLR signals as upstream on-switches for glial cytokine and chemokine responses. The biological activity of chemokines is regulated by matrix metalloproteinase enzymes (MMPs) and specific members of this family are expressed in response to axonal lesioning. These findings strengthen the case for the sharing of signals between the immune and nervous system. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Following aneurysmal SAH, three patients arrived at our institution with haemodynamic instability requiring vasoactive drugs and with pulmonary oedema. Transoesophageal echocardiographic study during aneurysm surgery documented mild to severe left ventricular SD and DD. Right ventricular SD and DD were also present. Documented biventricular systolic and diastolic myocardial dysfunctions may contribute to haemodynamic instability and pulmonary oedema following SAH due to intracranial aneurysmal rupture.

Methods: Data compiled for the US Consumer Product Safety Commission were used to generate estimates for the total number of neck injuries and the more specific diagnoses of neck fractures, dislocations, contusions, sprains, strains, and lacerations occurring nationally from 1990 to 1999. These data were combined with yearly participation figures to generate rates of injury presenting to emergency departments for each sport. Results: There were an estimated 5038 neck injuries from ice hockey, 19 341 from soccer, and 114 706 from American football. These could be broken down as follows: 4964 contusions, sprains, or strains from ice hockey, 17 927 from soccer, and 104 483 from football; 105 neck fractures or dislocations from ice hockey, 214 from soccer, and 1588 from football; 199 neck lacerations for ice hockey, 0 for soccer, and 621 for football. The rates for total neck injuries and combined neck contusions, sprains, or strains were higher for football than for ice hockey or soccer in all years for which data were available. Conclusion: The rate of neck injury in the United States was higher in football than in ice hockey or soccer in the time period studied.

Method: We reviewed literature on cognition, remediation, smart homes, as well as on objects and utilities, using medical and computer science electronic library and Internet searches. Results: These technologies provide solutions for disabled Persons with respect to care delivery, workload reduction, and socialization. Examples include home support, video conferencing, remote monitoring of medical parameters through sensors, teledetection of critical situations (for example, a fall or malaise), measures of daily living activities, and help with tasks of daily living. One of the key concepts unifying all these technologies is the health-smart home. We present the notion of the health-smart home in general and then examine it more specifically in relation to schizophrenia. Conclusion: Management of people with schizophrenia with cognitive deficits who are being rehabilitated in the community can be improved with the use of technology; however, such technology has ethical ramifications.

We provide the first report that a DNA sequence (NBL2) can be either extensively hypermethylated or hypomethylated in cancer. Previously, it was shown that NBL2, a complex tandem DNA repeat in the acrocentric chromosomes, is hypomethylated at Nod sites in >70% of neuroblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas and in cells from ICF syndrome (DNMT3B-deficiency) patients. Unexpectedly, by Southern blot analysis of 18 ovarian carcinomas, 5 1 Wilms tumors, and various somatic control tissues, we found that >70% of the cancers exhibited large increases in methylation at Hhal sites in NBL2 compared with all the controls. In contrast, 17% of the carcinomas showed major decreases in methylation at Hhal and Nod sites. The intermediate levels of methylation at Hhol sites in somatic controls enabled this discovery of cancer-linked hypermethylation and hypomethylation in NBL2. In a comparison of ovarian epithelial carcinomas, low malignant potential tumors, and cystadenomas, NBL2 hypermethylation at Hhal sites was significantly related to the degree of malignancy, and hypomethylation was seen only in the carcinomas. By RT-PCR, we found NBL2 transcripts at low levels in a few cancers and undetectable in various normal tissues. In the tumors there was no association of NBL2 hypomethylation and transcription, but this may reflect NBL2's lack of identifiable promoter elements and our evidence for run-through transcription from adjacent sequences into NBL2. The propensity of NBL2 sequences to become either hypermethylated or hypomethylated in cancer suggests that these opposite epigenetic changes share an early step during carcinogenesis and that cancer-linked hypermethylation might be spontaneously reversible.

Here, we have examined the expression and localization of agrin during development of the rodent urinary bladder, as a first step to examining its possible role at autonomic neuroeffector junctions in smooth muscle. We have found that agrin is expressed on the surface of developing smooth muscle cells and in the basement membrane underlying the urothelium. More importantly, agrin is progressively concentrated at parasympathetic varicosities during postnatal development and is present at virtually all junctions in mature muscle. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction analysis has shown that pelvic ganglion neurons that innervate the bladder express LN/z8 agrin, whereas bladder smooth muscle expresses LN/z- agrin. Together, these results demonstrate that nerve and/or muscle agrin becomes localized at cholinergic parasympathetic varicosities in smooth muscle, where it could play a role in the maturation of the neuroeffector junction.

However, current standard techniques are often impossible in such groups due to cognitive difficulties. This study is a validation of several variables read from standardised video recordings of mastication as indicators of masticatory function. Methods: Fifteen healthy, fully dentate mate subjects were recorded using EMG and by video simultaneously. An evatuation was undertaken of the video parameters (i) to compare their validity against the etectromyographic parameters, (ii) to test intra-rater and inter-rater reliability and (iii) to test the ability to discriminate between four model foods differing in hardness. Results: Masticatory time and the number of masticatory cycles counted on video were found to be valid and reliable indicators. In addition, the number of active chewing cycles performed with an open mouth and identification of the chewing side, were found to have reasonable validity and reliability. The former may allow discrimination between food types. Conclusion: As an alternative to the complex evaluation of masticatory function, observation of certain parameters from video recording could be an alternative for use in uncooperative patients.

This theoretical framework makes several testable predictions with regards to the contribution of these neural systems based on the phase (fast, slow, consolidation, automatization, and retention) and nature of the motor learning processes (motor sequence versus motor adaptation) acquired through repeated practice. There has been recent behavioral, lesion and additional neuroimaging studies that have addressed the assumptions made in this theory that will help in the revision of this model.

Recent findings Although JME is a well defined clinical syndrome among the idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs), recent studies suggest that JME is distinct from other IGE syndromes and must be considered separately fro the purposes of genetic studies. Clinical morphological and metabolic data suggest a preferential role for frontal regions in this syndrome. However, JME is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Although several major genes for JME have been identified and pathogenetic mechanisms suggested based on these findings, these genes account for only a small proportion of JME cases, suggesting multifactorial or complex inheritance in most. The roles played by other major genes, susceptibility genes and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of JME remain to be defined. Summary JME is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and should be considered separately from other IGE syndromes. Proposed mechanisms, such as those involving microdysgenesis or altered neuronal inhibition, may be related to different genetic abnormalities in different patients. Major genes account for relatively few cases, and most cases appear to involve multifactorial or complex inheritance.

Gonadal differentiation does not depend on the presence of gonadotropin receptors but development is affected to varying degrees in both sexes. In both knockouts the null females are infertile with severely underdeveloped gonads and accessory structures. Sexual maturity and/or pubertal delay occur depending on the sex and knockout. Male null FSH-R mice have reduced fertility but null LH-R males are sterile due to cryptorchid testes and deficient spermatogenesis. In null FSH-R females hormonal imbalances are due to deficient estrogen and hyperandrogenemia. LHR deficient females have low estrogen and testosterone. Females in both knockouts display phenotypes such as obesity, bone deficiency, and changes in brain structure and function in addition to manifestation of different types of reproductive tract tumors. Both types of mice represent good models for testing hormone replacement therapy in different combinations. The FSH-R heterozygous females could also be useful for studying age-dependent phenotypes.

J	Stewart, LS; Leung, LS				Stewart, LS; Leung, LS			Hippocampal melatonin receptors modulate seizure threshold	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Mel(1b) receptor; Dorsal hippocampus; seizure latency; GABA; pilocarpine; rat	PILOCARPINE-INDUCED SEIZURES; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; ACTIVITY STATE; PINEAL-GLAND; MALE-RAT; EPILEPSY; NEURONS; MODEL; AMYGDALA; BRAIN	Purpose: The pineal hormone melatonin has been shown to enhance hippocampal excitability. We therefore investigated whether inactivation of hippocampal melatonin receptors affects behavioral seizures. Methods: Intrahippocampal infusions were performed in rats to study the effect of different melatonin receptor antagonists on behavioral activity, EEG, and seizure susceptibility. Experiments were conducted at 2 times of the day that coincided with the peak and trough of the daily melatonin rhythm. Results: Local infusion of the Mel(1b) receptor antagonist 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin (4-P-PDOT) into the hippocampus, but not the overlying neocortex, significantly increased seizure latency and in some cases provided complete protection against seizure development. In addition, 4-P-PDOT suppressed open field activity and hippocampal EEG amplitude. The mixed Mel(1a)/Mel(1b) receptor antagonist luzindole also increased seizure latency but to a lesser degree than 4-P-PDOT. The behavioral effects of Mel(1b) receptor inhibition were comparable to those of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor agonist muscimol and were observed during the dark phase (2400-0200 h) but not the light phase (1200-1400 h) of the daily photocycle. The anticonvulsant effect of intrahippocampal infusion of 4P-P-DOT was blocked by coadministration of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline. Conclusions: Our results suggest that nocturnal activation of hippocampal Mel(1b) receptors depresses GABA(A) receptor function in the hippocampus and enhances seizure susceptibility.

Such increased responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) was not associated with any change in hippocampal acetylcholine or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content, GABAergic inhibition or density of ACh innervation, but was blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. We therefore turned to quantitative radioligand binding autoradiography, in situ hybridization and the [S-35]GTP gamma S method to assess the properties of hippocampal and neocortical muscarinic receptors in adult rats having experienced a PTZ seizure at P20. The densities of M1 and M2 receptor binding sites, respectively labeled with [H-3]pirenzepine and [H-3]AFDX-384, as well as the amount of m1, m2 and m3 receptor mRNAs, did not differ from control in the hippocampus and neocortex of these rats. In contrast, in PTZ rats, both brain regions displayed a marked increase in [S-35]GTP gamma S incorporation stimulated by ACh, bethanechol and particularly oxotremorine. This finding indicates that a generalized seizure in immature rat can entail a long-term and presumably permanent increase in the efficacy of G-protein coupling to muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus and neocortex of the adult. By analogy, such a mechanism could account for the susceptibility to epilepsy of human adults having suffered from prolonged convulsions in early life.

Over 24 family members have been identified in vertebrates. Despite being well-studied with respect to their function in tight junction selectivity and permeability, the embryonic expression patterns of most claudin family members have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report the cloning and expression pattern of a novel chick claudin family member that is most closely related to human claudin-1. Chick claudin-1 was expressed throughout the ectoderm of stage 4-6 chick embryos. Claudin-1 expression was particularly high in the neural epithelium and open neural tube, but decreased as the neural tube closed. High levels of claudin-1 expression were also observed in the developing otic vesicle, nasal placode, ectodermal component of the pharyngeal arches, and in the apical ectodermal ridge of the limb bud from stage 17 onwards. Claudin-1 expression was also detected in scleral papillae, feather buds and migrating primordial germ cells. Lower levels of claudin-1 expression were observed in the endoderm, the ventral pharynx, and several of its derivatives including the bronchi, developing lung epithelium, esophagus, and gut. Claudin-1 expression was detected in the nephric duct and the mesonephros, which are epithelialized derivatives of the intermediate mesoderm, but not in any other mesodermal derivates, including the heart, somites and developing muscle. With the exception of the migrating primordial germ cells and the primitive streak, all other tissues that expressed significant levels of claudin-1 were epithelialized. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In regions of intense &beta;-gal staining, mononuclear infiltrates abounded, and muscle fibers showed strong extrasynaptic utrophin immunostaining, restoration of dystrophin-associated protein complex, and a marked reduction of the prevalence of centronucleation. Immunoblot analysis confirmed an increase of endogenous utrophin without an increase of the mRNA of the major muscle isoform utrA. Significantly better maximal tetanic force values were demonstrated in the inflammatory versus control mdx muscles. The resistance to lengthening contraction-induced damage was also significantly increased in the former. In muscles of mice lacking TNF-&alpha; gene, AV vector did not induce inflammation and extrajunctional utrophin increase did not occur. In the inflammatory mdx muscles, proteolytic activity of calcium-activated calpain was reduced, and in mdx myotubes in vitro, incubation with NO donors also reduced calpain-mediated utrophin proteolysis. Since utrophin was shown to be a natural substrate of calpain and known inhibitors of calpain in cultured mdx myotubes increased utrophin levels, the above results were consistent with the following conclusions: ( 1) extrasynaptic utrophin increase is mainly responsible for the antidystrophic effect; ( 2) extrasynaptic utrophin increase is a result of posttranscriptional mechanism(s) related to proinflammatory factors; and ( 3) reduction of endogenous muscle calpain activity by inflammatory cytokines has an important role in the stabilization and increase of the extrasynaptic utrophin.

One of the most well known such rules is the k-nearest-neighbor decision rule (also known as lazy learning) in which an unknown pattern is classified into the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the training set. Several questions related to this rule have received considerable attention over the years. Such questions include the following. How can the storage of the training set be reduced without degrading the performance of the decision rule? How should the reduced training set be selected to represent the different classes? How large should k be? How should the value of k be chosen? Should all k neighbors be equally weighted when used to decide the class of an unknown pattern? If not, how should the weights be chosen? Should all the features (attributes) we weighted equally and if not how should the feature weights be chosen? What distance metric should be used? How can the rule be made robust to overlapping classes or noise present in the training data? How can the rule be made invariant to scaling of the measurements? How can the nearest neighbors of a new point be computed efficiently? What is the smallest neural network that can implement nearest neighbor decision rules? Geometric proximity graphs such as Voronoi diagrams and their many relatives provide elegant solutions to these problems, as well as other related data mining problems such as outlier detection. After a non-exhaustive review of some of the classical canonical approaches to these problems, the methods that use proximity graphs are discussed, some new observations are made, and open problems are listed.

No study has been published focusing on immediate extubation after aortic valve surgery. This study examines the feasibility and hemodynamic stability of immediate extubation after simple or combined aortic valve surgery using either thoracic epidural analgesia or opioid-based analgesia. Design: Prospective audit, pilot study. Setting: Single-institution university medical center. Participants: Adult patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (N = 45). Interventions: Forty-five patients undergoing aortic valve surgery with an ejection fraction of more than 30% were included in this prospective audit. Induction of anesthesia was done using fentanyl, 2 to 4 mu g/kg, propofol, 1 to 2 mg/kg, and endotracheal intubation facilitated by rocuronium; anesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane titrated according to bispectral index (BIS [BIS target: 50]). Perioperative analgesia was provided by high thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA group, bupivacaine 0.125%, 6 to 14 mL/h) or fentanyl, up to 10 mu g/kg, followed by patient-controlled analgesia with morphine (OPIOID group). Measurements and Main Results: Success of extubation within 30 minutes after surgery was recorded. Hemodynamic data during surgery were compared by using an analysis of variance test; p < 0.05 was considered as showing a significant difference. Data presented as median (25th-75th percentile). In the TEA group, patients underwent simple aortic valve replacement (N = 21) or combined aortic valve surgery (N = 14), with additional coronary artery bypass grafting (N = 10) and replacement of the ascending aorta (Bentall, N = 4). In the OPIOID group, patients underwent simple aortic valve replacement (N = 5) or combined aortic valve surgery (N = 5), with additional aortocoronary bypass grafting (N = 2), replacement of the ascending aorta (Bentall, N = 2), and reconstruction of the mitral valve (N = 1). All 45 patients were extubated within 15 minutes after surgery. There was no need for reintubation; pain scores were lower in the TEA group than in the OPIOID group immediately after surgery and at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery. For the TEA group and OPIOID group, the pain scores were 0 (0-2), 0 (0-2), 0 (0-1.5), and 0 (0-0) and 5 (4-5.75), 4 (3-4.5), 4 (3.25-4), and 1 (0-2.5), respectively. During and up to 6 hours after surgery, there was no significant hemodynamic difference between the TEA and OPIOID groups. Eighteen of 45 patients needed temporary pacemaker activation. There were no epidural hematoma or neurologic complications related to TEA. Conclusion: Immediate extubation is feasible after aortic valve surgery using either high thoracic epidural analgesia or opioid-based analgesia; both techniques maintain hemodynamic stability throughout surgery. TEA provides superior pain control. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Typical and atypical development of oculomotor control	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; DENDRITIC SPINES; SACCADES; DEFICITS; MATURATION; MOVEMENTS; FIXATION; CORTEX; MALES	The ability to inhibit saccades toward Suddenly appearing peripheral stimuli (prosaccades) and direct them to contralateral locations instead (antisaccades) is a crucial market of eye movement control. Typically developing infants as young as 4-month-olds can learn to inhibit reflexive saccades to peripheral stimuli, but they do not produce antisaccades, whose development later in infancy and its underlying neural cornputations remain unexplored. Here we tested oculomotor control in typically developing toddlers and toddlers with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disorder of known genetic origin that allows the investigation of the neurocomputational properties contributing to the development of saccadic control. Typically developing toddlers decreased looking toward peripheral cues that predicted contralateral rewards, whose appearance they anticipated. Furthermore, this correlated with age, indicating a gradual development of saccadic control. In contrast with the typical case, toddlers with FXS did not decrease their looks to peripheral onsets that predicted contralateral events. importantly, the atypical pattern of performance was also evident in the elimination of the correlation with mental or chronological age found in controls. Taken together, the findings suggest that control of saccades and its developmental trajectory is atypical in toddlers with FXS, consistent with inhibitory deficits previously shown at later ages in this condition. Potential implications for the neural mechanisms underlying the typical and atypical development of oculomotor control are discussed.

We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess neural correlates of item and associative encoding and retrieval of simple images in 18 healthy subjects. During encoding, subjects memorized items and pairs. During retrieval, subjects made item recognition judgments (old vs. new) and associative recognition judgments (intact vs. rearranged). Relative to baseline, item and associative trials activated bilateral medial temporal and prefrontal regions during both encoding and retrieval. Direct contrasts were then performed between item and associative trials for each memory stage. During encoding, greater prefrontal, hippocampal, and parietal activation was observed for associations, but no significant activation was observed for items at the selected threshold. During recognition, greater activation was observed for associative trials in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobules bilaterally, whereas item recognition trials showed greater activation of bilateral frontal regions, bilateral anterior medial temporal areas, and the right temporo-parietal junction. Post hoc analyses suggested that the anterior medial temporal activation observed during item recognition was driven mainly by new items, confirming a role for this structure in novelty detection. These results suggest that although some structures such as the medial temporal and prefrontal cortex play a general role in memory, the pattern of activation in these regions can be modulated by the type of information (items or associations) interacting with memory stages.

Previous studies have demonstrated changes in cardiac output during feeding and other behaviors. Here, we describe a short latency, transient cardiac response that accompanies withdrawal reflexes. When evoked by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, the response was detected within one or two heartbeats. Beat amplitudes increased on average 11.6%, and inter-beat intervals decreased on average 2.1%. The mean duration of the response was 28.1 s. A transient inhibitory phase often preceded the excitatory response. Results from testing various nerves and tissues show that the cardiac responses invariably occur whenever contractions of the tentacle retractor muscle are elicited. Even stimulation of the ovotestis and the kidney elicit responses despite their protected locations within the mantle cavity. Three excitatory cardioactive neurons are identified in the central nervous system of Helix aspersa, and their involvement in the reflex response is documented. The results suggest that the heart output is initially inhibited to relax the hydroskeleton and thereby aid withdrawal movements. A delayed increase in cardiac output then facilitates the re-inflation, hence eversion, of the withdrawn body parts.

Using information theory, we find that the ON1 of G. texensis encodes higher amplitude-modulation frequencies than that of T. oceanicus. Bilateral differences in ON1 responses are also more pronounced in G. texensis, particularly for rapid, G. texensis-like stimuli. We show that brief silent intervals in a pulse train, such as those that occur in the natural calling song of G. texensis, enhance the representation of the stimulus pulse pattern as well as bilateral differences in activity. Our results suggest that the characteristics of an identified neuron vary, across cricket species, in accordance with the temporal structures of their communication signals.

The intracellular signaling mechanisms used by neurotrophins to regulate survival and axon growth in the mature CNS in vivo are not well understood. The goal of this study was to define the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) pathway in the survival and axon regeneration of adult rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a prototypical central neuron population. We used recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) to selectively transduce RGCs with genes encoding constitutively active or wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), the upstream activator of Erk1/2. In combination with anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques, we monitored neuronal survival and axon regeneration in vivo. MEK1 gene delivery led to robust and selective transgene expression in multiple RGC compartments including cell bodies, dendrites, axons and targets in the brain. Furthermore, MEK1 activation induced in vivo phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in RGC bodies and axons. Quantitative analysis of cell survival demonstrated that Erk1/2 activation promoted robust RGC neuroprotection after optic nerve injury. In contrast, stimulation of the Erk1/2 pathway was not sufficient to induce RGC axon growth beyond the lesion site. We conclude that the Erk1/2 pathway plays a key role in the survival of axotomized mammalian RGCs in vivo, and that activation of other signaling components is required for axon regeneration in the growth inhibitory CNS environment.

Pre-treatment with Epo has been shown to protect neurons in models of ischemic injury. The mechanism responsible for this neuroprotection and the effects of Epo on astroglial and other non-neuronal cell populations remain unknown. In the present study, we determined whether Epo pre-treatment protects neonatal rat astrocytes from apoptotic cell death resulting from treatment with nitric oxide, staurosporine (STS) and arsenic trioxide and possible mechanisms mediating Epo-related cytoprotection. Epo (5-20 U/mL) significantly attenuated multiple hallmarks of apoptotic cell death in astroglia exposed to nitric oxide and STS but not arsenic trioxide. Epo (20 U/mL) induced mild oxidative stress as shown by increases in heme oxygenase (HO)-1 mRNA and protein expression that could be suppressed by antioxidant coadministration. Moreover, coincubation with tin-mesoporphyrin, a competitive inhibitor of HO activity, abrogated the cytoprotective effects of Epo (20 U/mL) in the face of STS treatment. Thus, induction of the ho-1 gene may contribute to the glioprotection accruing from high-dose Epo exposure. Epo may augment astroglial resistance to certain chemical stressors by oxidative stress-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

J	Courtemanche, R; Lamarre, Y				Courtemanche, R; Lamarre, Y			Local field potential oscillations in primate cerebellar cortex: Synchronization with cerebral cortex during active and passive expectancy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							GRANULE CELL LAYER; MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; COHERENT OSCILLATIONS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BEHAVING MONKEYS; PARIETAL CORTEX; CRUS-IIA; RAT; MODULATION	Many brain regions, such as the cerebellum, primary somatosensory cortex (SI), and primary motor cortex (MI), interact to produce coordinated actions. Synchronization of local field potentials (LFPs) in sensorimotor cerebral areas has been related to motor performance, often through 10- to 25-Hz oscillatory LFPs. The macaque cerebellar paramedian lobule (PM) also shows 10- to 25-Hz LFP oscillations, which are modulated in a stimulus-response lever press task to get reward (active condition), but also, albeit differently, in a similarly timed stimulus-reward relation (passive condition). This study focuses on simultaneous UP activity in primate SI or MI and the PM cerebellum during the active (left- or right-hand lever presses) and passive conditions. Results show a similar modulation pattern of 10- to 25-Hz oscillations in the cerebellum. MI, and SI during the active condition (left or right hand), decreasing after stimulus onset, returning, and again decreasing after movement onset. In the passive condition, when the monkey did not move but got reward, all 3 areas show an oscillatory profile where oscillations increase after stimulus onset and last until reward, denoting a role for these oscillations in passive expectancy. However, synchronization between cerebellar LFPs and SI LFPs is higher during the active condition than during the passive condition, and highest for the interested hand. This greater PM-SI synchronization, when the monkey had to press the lever, could represent a form of cerebro-cerebellar communication, perhaps to serve somatosensory processing to accomplish the task; PM-MI synchronization was less selective for the hand used and might carry a more general type of information.

This study examined the possible role of this peptide on the supraspinal locomotor command system in lampreys. Substance P was bath applied or locally injected into an in vitro isolated brain stem, and the effects of the drug were examined on reticulospinal cells and on the occurrence of swimming in a semi-intact preparation. Bath applications Of substance P induced sustained depolarizations occurring rhythmically ill intracellularly recorded reticulospinal cells. Spiking activity was superimposed on the depolarizations and swimming was induced. The sustained depolarizations were abolished by tetrodotoxin, and substance P did not affect the membrane resistance of reticulospinal cells nor their firing properties, suggesting that it did not directly effect reticulospinal cells. To establish where the effects were exerted, successive lesions of the brain stem were made as well as local applications of the drug in the brain stern. Removing the mesencephalon abolished the sustained depolarizations. whereas large ejections of the drug in the mesencephalon excited reticulospinal cells and elicited bouts of swimming. More local injections into the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) also elicited swimming. After an injection of substance P. the current threshold needed to induce locomotion by MLR stimulation was decreased. and the size of the postsynaptic responses of reticulospinal cells to MLR Stimulation was increased. Substance P also reduced the frequency of miniature spontaneous postsynaptic currents in reticulospinal cells. Taken together. these results suggest that substance P plays a neuromodulatory role on the brain stem locomotor networks of lampreys.

Positron emission tomography was used to measure changes in brain activity as subjects tracked a target under the influence of a rotational transformation that distorted visual feedback. The experiment was I week long and consisted of two scanning sessions (obtained on days 2 and 7), aimed at examining early and late stages of learning. On average, visuomotor adaptation was achieved within 3 days. During early stages of adaptation, better performance was associated with greater activity in brain areas related to attention including bilateral dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, frontal eye fields, and the human homologue of area MT. However, as adaptation proceeded, improvements in performance were associated with greater activity in motor regions Such as the left (contralateral) sensorimotor cortex, bilateral anterior cerebellum, left cingulate motor area, right putamen, and a nonmotor region within the middle temporal gyrus. This learning-specific shift in brain activity was associated with a progressive change in the functional connectivity of these regions toward the end of the first session. Interestingly, only the functional connections between the anterior cerebellum, left middle temporal gyrus, and left sensorimotor cortex remained strong once visuomotor adaptation was achieved. Our findings suggest that visuomotor adaptation is not only reflected in persistent changes in activity in motor-related regions, but also in the strengthening and maintenance of specific functional connections.

We have examined the promoter activity of 8.5 kb upstream of the first coding exon of the rat peripheral myelin protein-22 (rPmp22) gene in transgenic mice. We found that the -8.5 kb rPmp22/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)/beta-galactosidase (lacZ) construct directs reporter gene expression in a weakly developmental and tissue-specific pattern, consistent with the expression pattern of the endogenous Pmp22 gene. The -8.5 kb rPmp22/CAT/lacZ transgene responds to loss of axonal signals during Wallerian degeneration but unlike the endogenous Pmp22 gene, the transgene fails to respond to axonal signals during nerve regeneration after a sciatic nerve crush injury. In conclusion, the function of the -8.5 kb rPmp22/CAT/lacZ transgene suggests that there are separable regulatory elements in the rPmp22 gene that respond differently to axonal signals received by Schwann cells during nerve development, and during remyelination.

The endoscopic transsphenoidal approach to the pituitary gland is a current trend because more neurosurgeons are becoming familiar with the use of endoscopes. The use of associated image-guided surgery (or surgical navigation technology; these names are equivalent and are used interchangeably) allows a precise approach that increases the safety and efficacy of a surgical procedure. The InstaTrack system (GE Medical Systems Navigation and Visualization, Inc., Lawrence, MA) is a frameless electromagnetic navigational system used in this study. The objectives of this preliminary and conceptual cadaveric study (three heads) are to get familiarized with the use of image guidance and the study of the endoscopic anatomy of this region and to investigate the technical requirements and benefits of possible future shifting from microscopic towards endoscopic image guidance.

Three such models are reviewed: those of Cloninger, Depue, and Siever. While these proposals have heuristic value, none of them has obtained strong empirical support. Our current understanding of neurobiology is insufficient to develop a model of personality on this basis. At this point, dimensions of personality should be derived from factor analysis rather than from neurobiological theories.

The epidemiology of vascular aging study	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article						cognitive complaints; cognitive decline; white matter lesions; cohort study	MEMORY COMPLAINTS; IMPAIRMENT; HYPERINTENSITIES; INDIVIDUALS; ASSOCIATION; SCALE	OBJECTIVES: To explore whether more cognitive complaints are associated with previous or future cognitive decline. DESIGN: Longitudinal; epidemiology vascular aging study. SETTING: Community in Nantes, France. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred thirty-three subjects, aged 59 to 71. MEASUREMENTS: Subjective cognitive complaints were recorded at 4-year follow-up examination in a prospective study of people aged 59 to 71 at study entry. Participants' cognitive performances were assessed repeatedly at each wave (baseline, 4 years, and 6 years) of the study using a series of neuropsychological tests including the Mini-Mental State Examination. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Subjects also had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scan at 4-year follow-up to evaluate presence and severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). RESULTS: Subjects with more cognitive complaints had greater cognitive decline. This significant relationship persisted after adjusting for potential confounders, including depressive symptoms. Multivariate analysis also showed that, in subjects without measured cognitive decline between study entry and 4-year follow-up, those with more cognitive complaints at 4-year follow-up had significantly greater measured cognitive decline during the subsequent 2 years. In the presence of severe WMH, more cognitive complaints were an even stronger predictor of future cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Cognitive complaints reflect measured cognitive decline, but they also predict cognitive decline at an earlier stage than objective tests that are not able to detect cognitive deficits. They need to be taken into account in clinical practice.

In addition, the immobility response (IR) may be regulated by dopaminergic activity. We investigated the influence of the IR caused by clamping the neck of rats that had received bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral hippocampus at postnatal day 7 (PD7). At both ages, prepubertal (PD35) and postpubertal (PD56), the duration of the IR was significantly increased in animals with lesions when compared to controls. These findings indicate that nVH damage results in behavioral changes, such as enhancement of the IR, related to mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These fascinating issues have inspired us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of information available on class II histone deacetylases (HDACs). In what follows, we will start with a brief description of different classes of HDACs and then compare class II HDACs from yeast and higher organisms in terms of domain organization, function, and regulation. We will also discuss evidence that links class II human HDACs to cardiomyopathy, osteodystrophy, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer and will propose that, in addition to inhibitors, activators of these HDACs are of potential therapeutic value.

Unlike the peripheral nervous system (PNS), central nervous system (CNS) neurons fail to regenerate their axons after injury or in disease. In order to assess the role of RPTP sigma in CNS regeneration, we used the retinocollicular system of adult mice lacking RPTP sigma to evaluate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon regrowth after optic nerve lesion. Quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the number of RGC axons that crossed the glial scar and extended distally in optic nerves from RPTP sigma (-/-) mice compared to wild-type littermate controls. Although we found that RPTP sigma is expressed by adult RGCs in wild-type mice, the retinas and optic nerves of adult RPTP sigma (-/-) mice showed no histological defects. Furthermore, the time-course of RGC death after nerve lesion was not different between knockout and wild-type animals. Thus, enhanced axon regrowth in the absence of RPTP sigma could not be attributed to developmental defects or increased neuronal survival. Finally, we show constitutively elevated activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt kinase in adult RPTP sigma (-/-) mice retinas, suggesting that these signaling pathways may contribute to promoting RGC axon regrowth following traumatic nerve injury. Our results support a model in which RPTP sigma inhibits axon regeneration in the adult injured CNS. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We generated transgenic mice expressing either the wild type or the expanded form of human PABPN1, and transgenic animals with the expanded form showed clear signs of abnormal limb clasping, muscle weakness, coordination deficits, and peripheral nerves alterations. Analysis of mitotic and postmitotic tissues in those transgenic animals revealed ubiquitinated PABPN1-positive intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in neuronal cells. This latter observation led us to test and confirm the presence of similar INIs in postmortem brain sections from an OPMD patient. Our results indicate that expanded PABPN1, presumably via the toxic effects of its polyalanine tract, can lead to inclusion formation and neurodegeneration in both the mouse and the human.

Edema formation was also assessed. MnSOD, CuZnSOD, COX-2 and IL-1 beta mRNA and protein expression were studied 3 h post-ischemia. No changes were observed in MnSOD and CuZnSOD mRNA expression among the groups. COX-2 and IL-1 beta mRNA expression were upregulated by ischemia but were not influenced by the glycemic state. At the protein level, hyperglycemic cerebral ischemia increased MnSOD and CuZnSOD [Bemeur, C., Ste-Marie, L., Desjardins, P., Butterworth, R.F., Vachon, L., Montgomery, J., Hazell, A.S., 2004a. Expression of superoxide dismutase in hyperglycemic focal cerebral ischemia in the rat. Neurochem. Int. 45, 1167-1174] and IL-1 beta expression compared to normoglycemic ischemia. COX-2 protein expression was also significantly higher following hyperglycemic ischemia compared to hyperglycemic shams. DHA administration did not change the pattern of COX-2 or IL-1 beta mRNA expression, but normalized the increased protein expression following hyperglycemic ischemia. DHA administration also normalized MnSOD and CuZnSOD protein expression to the levels observed in normoglycemic ischemic animals. Edema formation was significantly reduced by DHA administration in hyperglycemic ischemic animals. The DHA-induced post-transcriptional normalization of MnSOD, CuZnSOD, COX-2 and IL-1 beta levels and the decreased edema formation suggest that hyperglycemia accelerates superoxide formation and the inflammatory response, thus contributing to early damage in hyperglycemic stroke and strategies to scavenge superoxide should be an important therapeutic avenue.

Using alpha-[(11)C]methyl-L-tryptophan-positron emission tomography (PET), it was demonstrated that brain 5-HT synthesis is increased in patients with IBS, in a gender-specific manner. The aims of the study were to evaluate the effects of alosetron on brain 5-HT synthesis in patients with IBS. Six male and five female non-constipation-predominant IBS patients were enrolled. The subjects received alosetron or a placebo for 14 days, separated by a 2-week washout period. On day 14, rectal distensions commenced just prior to the PET scan (which was performed for 80 min), and continued for 20-min periods. The functional images were analysed with SPM99. Alosetron vs placebo treatments, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover manner, were studied. 5-HT synthesis was greater in several regions in the males than in the females during the alosetron treatment, whereas there was no region in which the females had greater synthesis. There were significant gender-treatment interactions of synthesis in the cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. The gender differences in the efficacy of alosetron.

Deoiled gourd seed (an extremely rich source of tryptophan-22 mg tryptophan/1 g protein) was combined with glucose, a carbohydrate that reduces serum levels of competing LNAAs which was then compared to pharmaceutical grade tryptophan with carbohydrate as well as carbohydrate alone. Method: Objective and subjective measures of sleep were employed to measure changes in sleep as part of a double blind placebo controlled study where subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) Protein source tryptophan (deoiled gourd seed) in combination with carbohydrate; (2) pharmaceutical grade tryptophan in combination with carbohydrate, (3) carbohydrate alone. Subjects: Out of 57 subjects 49 of those who began the study completed the three week protocol. Results: Protein source tryptophan with carbohydrate and pharmaceutical grade tryptophan, but not carbohydrate alone, resulted in significant improvement on subjective and objective measures of insomnia. Protein source tryptophan with carbohydrate alone proved effective in significantly reducing time awake during the night. Conclusion: Protein source tryptophan is comparable to pharmaceutical grade tryptophan for the treatment of insomnia.

A current focus in the treatment of intracranial germinoma is on decreasing the Volume of radiotherapy. We Studied the theoretical impact of selecting different target Volumes and treatment techniques. Procedure. Retrospectively, five cases of localized germinoma were identified. Treatment plans were produced for three target Volumes: involved field plans (i.e., targeting only gross disease), whole brain plans, and plans of increasing complexity targeting the ventricles (lateral-opposed, four-field and intensity-modulated (IMRT)). A second series of patients was processed similarly except that no involved field plans were produced. Results. When target volumes were compared, normal structures were substantially spared by ventricular irradiation but maximally spared by involved field radiation. When treatment techniques were assessed for ventricular irradiation, the greatest gain in tissue sparing occurred when switching from two to four fields. This gain was at the higher doses levels at the expense of an increased volume of tissue irradiated to lower doses. IMRT plans always spared a small additional amount of normal brain. Whole ventricular plans were compared to similar plans excluding the fourth ventricle. Whole brain dose was only improved by 4-6% by excluding the fourth ventricle. Conclusions. The substitution of whole-ventricular irradiation for whole-brain irradiation can spare a significant amount of normal tissue, thus providing a theoretical advantage with respect to the risk of late effects. Ventricular irradiation is best achieved with at least a four-field 3D configuration, and optimally through an IMRT plan. Exclusion of the fourth ventricle in the target volume had only a minimal impact on normal tissue doses. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and chemotherapeutic agents, particularly methotrexate (MTX), are often suggested to be major contributing factors for its development. Homocysteinemia that arises as a result of MTX-induced folate depletion was proposed to play a role in MTX-related neurotoxicity. Several enzymes are essential to maintain the homocysteine levels. Their different functional forms, associated with common genetic polymorphisms, may modulate homocysteine levels and thereby influence MTX-associated neurotoxicity. Objectives: To test this hypothesis we assessed whether the variants of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and endothelial nitric acid synthase (eNOS, NOS3) genes, acting either independently or in conjunction with other risk factors, influenced the cognitive functioning in ALL patients. The influence of the genes was measured by estimating the change in IQ scores over a period of 4 years post ALL diagnosis. Results: Two variants, the CBS 844ins68 polymorphism and NOS3 894T homozygosity, were associated with a change in IQ scores (p = 0.01 and 0.007, respectively). A multivariate model obtained through step-wise selection pointed to the importance of the NOS3 894TT genotype only. This effect appears to be dependent on CRT, IQ decline was apparent among individuals with the 894TT genotype who received radiation therapy (p = 0.03). Furthermore, additional factors affecting IQ were identified, including the treatment administered (i.e., CRT, p = 0.02) and a younger age at diagnosis (p = 0.003), and the modifying effect of the treatment protocols was also noted (p = 0.04). Conclusion: The results suggest that NOS3 genotyping might identify individuals that are susceptible to intellectual impairment following ALL treatment.

The database comprises 940 reference data points from the North Atlantic, Arctic and North Pacific oceans and their adjacent seas, including the Mediterranean Sea, as well as epicontinental environments such as the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bering Sea and the Hudson Bay. The relative abundance of taxa was analysed to describe the distribution of assemblages. The best analogue technique was used for the reconstruction of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sea-surface temperature and salinity during summer and winter, in addition to sea-ice cover extent, at sites from the North Atlantic (n = 63), Mediterranean Sea (it = 1) and eastern North Pacific (n = 1). Three of the North Atlantic cores, from the continental margin of eastern Canada, revealed a barren LGM interval, probably because of quasi-permanent sea ice. Six other cores from the Greenland and Norwegian seas were excluded from the compilation because of too sparse assemblages and poor analogue situation. At the remaining sites (n = 54), relatively close modern analogues were found for most LGM samples, which allowed reconstructions. The new LGM results are consistent with previous reconstructions based on dinocyst data, which show much cooler conditions than at present along the continental margins of Canada and Europe, but sharp gradients of increasing temperature offshore. The results also suggest low salinity and larger than present contrasts in seasonal temperatures with colder winters and more extensive sea-ice cover, whereas relatively warm conditions may have prevailed offshore in summer. From these data, we hypothesise low thermal inertia in a shallow and low-density surface water layer. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Montoya, A; Lepage, M; Malla, A				Montoya, A; Lepage, M; Malla, A			Temporal lobe dysfunction in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.	SALUD MENTAL			French	Article						schizophrenia; first-episode of psychosis; magnetic resonance imaging; brain imaging; temporal lobe	FIRST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; BRAIN MORPHOLOGY; VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT; METAANALYSIS; PSYCHOSIS; REDUCTION; DEFICITS; GYRUS	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been useful in revealing subtle structural differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients compared with healthy controls. MR structural analyses have revealed a number of brain abnormalities including ventricular enlargement, total brain volume reduction, and regional reductions in brain volume in frontal, parietal and temporal regions. However, it is still unknown whether the brain abnormalities observed with MRI in schizophrenia are confounded by chronicity or whether there is a continual degenerative process. Evaluation of the brain structure during the first episode of psychosis (FEP) is a powerful strategy for investigating these fundamental questions. The first-episode design avoids the confusion of chronicity of illness, longstanding substance abuse, and the effects of treatment. Structural MRI studies of patients experiencing a first-episode psychosis have revealed a similar pattern of brain abnormalities as in samples of chronic patients, although deficits may be less extensive. The temporal lobe, a brain structure traditionally implicated in the pathophyisiology of schizophrenia, has been examined often in first-episode studies. Many studies have reported significant abnormalitites in the medial areas and superior temporal gyri. However, most studies examining the whole temporal lobe have been unable to show such significant abnormalities. In the light of the increasing amount of ambiguous findings regarding structural temporal lobe abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia experiencing their first-episode of psychosis, a quantitative review of the existing literature was needed to better characterize the temporal lobe deficits observed with MRI in those patients. Thus we conducted a systematic review of structural MRI studies of patients with first-episode schizophrenia in which volume measurements of temporal lobe structures were reported. Using meta-analytical methods, we carried out an analysis of the temporal lobe volumes in these FEP patients and the comparison subjects. In addition to solving the problems of traditional narrative reviews, a meta-analysis provides tools for integrating quantitative data from multiple. studies, improving the overall effect size of variables of interest, and increasing statistical power. Eighteen studies were identified as suitable for the present analysis. These studies included 575 FEP patients and 738 control subjects. The average number of patients across studies was 32. The majority of patients in the studies were male (62%) and the average age of patients was 27 years old. In terms of structural brain findings, and assuming a volume of 100% in the comparison group, we found that the mean temporal volume of subjects with FEP was smaller (95%), as well as the analysis of regional structures such as left amygdala (95%), hippocampus-amygdala (left 92%, right 94%), hippocampus (left 85%, right 96%), and left temporal lobe (97%). Right temporal lobe volume was slightly greater (104%) and there was no difference in the volume of the right amygdala. Although this review was focused on evaluating the findings on temporal lobe deficits in patients with a first episode of psychosis, other brain region volumes were analyzed. The whole brain volume (95%) and frontal lobe volume (right 98%, left 99%) were lower in patients than in the comparison subjects. It is important to consider several potential limitations of this study. The first one has to do with the methodology employed to analyze structural MRI data. The method of choice in investigating the distribution of subtle cerebral pathology in schizophrenia has been an examination of anatomically defined regions of interest (ROI) within the brain. This method has some limitations, including the manual tracing of ROI on successive brain slices, a time consuming process that does not easily allow for the comparison of many brain regions or for the examination of volume differences in large samples of subjects. Furthermore, the question of validity is relevant as the ROI is investigator-determined and depends on the complex interindividual variability of the brain. The other method used in two studies included in this review is the voxel-based morphometry (VBM). This is an automated statistical method for examining structural MR images of the brain. VBM methodology makes voxel-wise comparisons of the local concentrations of grey matter between two groups of subjects and offers a more rapid and extensive survey of grey matter abnormalities in patients than ROI analysis. An important limitation of this methodology is that it has less regional sensitivity compared to the ROI technique and that these differences have to be considered in the interpretation of the results. Secondly, although our review only considered studies with patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis in schizophrenia (and not affective psychotic disorders), the fact that different investigators used somewhat different criteria when making their diagnoses could have introduced a potential bias in our inclusion process. Thus, it is possible that our results can not be generalized to the full population of first-episode patients. For instance, although most of the studies included used either DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (16 studies) or the Research Diagnostic Criteria (2 studies), variability may arise because many authors did not consider previous psychotic episodes in which patients were treated with antipsychotic medications for less than 30 days. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that schizophrenic patients present temporal lobe differences, mainly diminished volume values in mesial temporal lobe structures during the initial presentation of a first episode of their illness. However, our results indicated that there was also evidence of global volume changes and regional volume decreases in the frontal lobes of these patients. This data, derived from patients in the early courses of their illness, is compatible with developmental hypotheses of schizophrenic abnormalities and with the view of schizophrenia as a neuropsychiatric disorder with marked deficits in the temporal lobes. However, the central questions in schizophrenia research regarding which brain abnormalities are independent of psychosis and which evolve before and after psychosis begins still remain unanswered. We think that. these questions can be addressed by longitudinal neuroimaging studies beginning in the prodromal phase of the illness or by evaluating high-risk subjects during the critical period of transition to first-episode psychosis.

Our approach decomposes the observed multiple time series into measurement error and the BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) signals. The proposed model consists of the activation and connectivity equations. In the activation equation, we model the observed signals at each brain region as a function of the BOLD signal. One special feature of our model for capturing the complexities of the dynamic processes in the brain is that the region-specific time-varying coefficients in the activation equation are subsequently modelled, in the connectivity equation, as a function of the BOLD signals at other brain regions. Because our model has a state-space representation, the parameters are readily estimated by maximum likelihood via a routine application of the Kalman filter and smoother. In this paper, we apply our model to a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set to investigate the attentional control network in the brain.

Under general anaesthesia, atrioventricular block was induced after thoracotomy in 19 canines. Brief trains of 5 electrical stimuli were delivered to right-sided mediastinal nerves during the atrial refractory period. Unipolar electrograms were recorded from 191 right and left atrial epicardial sites under several conditions, i.e. (i) with intact nervous systems and following (ii) acute decentralization of the intrathoracic nervous system or administration of (iii) atropine, (iv) timolol, (v) hexamethonium. Concomitant right atrial endocardial mapping was performed in 7 of these dogs. Mediastinal nerve stimulation consistently initiated bradycardia followed by atrial tachyarrhythmias. In the initial tachyarrhythmia beats, early epicardial breakthroughs were identified in the right atrial free wall (28/50 episodes) or Bachmann bundle region (22/50), which corresponded to endocardial sites of origin associated with the right atrial subsidiary pacemaker complex, i.e. the crista terminalis and dorsal locations including the right atrial aspect of the interatrial septum. Neuronally induced responses were eliminated by atropine, modified by timolol and unaffected by acute neuronal decentralization. After hexamethonium, responses to extra-pericardial but not intra-pericardial nerve stimulation were eliminated. It is concluded that concomitant activation of cholinergic and adrenergic efferent intrinsic cardiac neurons induced by right-sided efferent neuronal stimulation initiates atrial tachyarrhythmias that originate from foci anatomically related to the right atrial pacemaker complex and tissues underlying major atrial ganglionated plexuses.

Choline acetyltransferase(ChAT), the synthesis enzyme of acetylcholine, was evidenced on sections of the spinal enlargements, and the protein that transports acetylcholine (VAChT) on limb sections. In newborn, ChAT immunolabeling occurred in small, undifferentiated neurons of the: ventral horn, presumably motoneurons, and intermediate and dorsal gray matter, and in the presumptive white matter, all less abundant at lumbosacral than brachial levels. Scant immunolabeling for VAChT marked small terminal-looking profiles, presumably growth cones or immature neuromuscular junctions, decreasing proximodistally in each limb and being less abundant in hindlimbs than forelimbs; it was absent distally in the foot where no muscle tissue was formed. ChAT labeling disappeared from the white matter within 1 week while cholinergic neurons increased in number and size. Motoneurons segregated in a medial and lateral group by 4-5 weeks. VAChT-labeled profiles increased in number and size and they flattened along a proximodistal gradient within each limb, but later in the hindlimbs than in the forelimbs. Labeling appeared in distal foot muscle at I week. The density, size, and shape of terminals became comparable in all segments of a given limb by 3-4 weeks. Their number and size increased, and by 8 weeks, they clustered in 3 or 4 along muscle fibers. Thus, limb motor innervation develops largely postnatally in the opossum, along rostrocaudal and proximodistal gradients. Its timecourse is compared to the development of motor behaviors.

To throw more light on this problem spontaneous quantal release was recorded amperometrically in PC-12 cells. Amperometric current spikes, representing single vesicle release, were detected by thresholding and were separated from spurious events on the basis of their amplitude and time course using a pattern recognition system based on the principal component neural network methods. The frequency of current spikes, their amplitude, quantal size, rise time and decay time were typically non-stationary, even in the absence of stimulation. Their running values changed much more than those of memoryless stationary random data with the same probability density distribution. Irrespective of how much the quantal size, rise and decay times varied, their amplitude dependence remained constant, or changed with a very different time course. In conclusion, the quantal size is highly labile in PC-12 cells. The lability does not appear to result from the changes of fusion pore dynamics or the mechanism of release of vesicular content, but because of the preferential release of large vesicles.

The netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) is required for commissural axon extension to the floor plate in the embryonic spinal cord. Here we demonstrate that challenging embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons with netrin-1, either in solution or as a substrate, causes DCC-dependent increases in growth cone surface area and filopodia number, which we term growth cone expansion. We provide evidence that DCC influences growth cone morphology by at least two mechanisms. First, DCC mediates an adhesive interaction with substrate-bound netrin-1. Second, netrin-1 binding to DCC recruits an intracellular signaling complex that directs the organization of actin. We show that netrin-1-induced growth cone expansion requires Cdc42 ( cell division cycle 42), Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1), Pak1 (p21-activated kinase), and N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and that the application of netrin-1 rapidly activates Cdc42, Rac1, and Pak1. Furthermore, netrin-1 recruits Cdc42, Rac1, Pak1, and N-WASP into a complex with the intracellular domain of DCC and Nck1. These findings suggest that DCC influences growth cone morphology by acting both as a transmembrane bridge that links extracellular netrin-1 to the actin cytoskeleton and as the core of a protein complex that directs the organization of actin.

To evaluate GATA proteins as potential targets for lead, spectroscopically monitored metal-binding titrations were used to measure the affinity of Pb2+ for the C-terminal zinc-binding domain from chicken GATA-1 (CF) and the double-finger domain from human GATA-1 (DF). Using this method, Pb2+ coordinating to CF and DF was directly observed through the appearance of intense bands in the near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum (250-380 nm). Absorption data collected from these experiments were best fit to a 1:1 Pb2+-CF model and a 2:1 Pb2+-DF model. Competition experiments using Zn2+ were used to determine the absolute affinities of Pb2+ for these proteins. These studies reveal that Pb2+ forms tight complexes with cysteine residues in the zinc-binding sites in GATA proteins, &beta;(Pb)(1) = 6.4 (&PLUSMN; 2.0) x 10(9) M-1 for CF and &beta;(2) = 6.3 (&PLUSMN; 6.3) x 10(19) M-2 for Pb-2(2+)-DF, and within an order of magnitude of the affinity of Zn2+ for these proteins. Furthermore, Pb2+ was able to displace bound Zn2+ from CF and DF. Upon addition of Pb2+, GATA shows a decreased ability to bind to DNA and subsequently activate transcription. Therefore, the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of GATA proteins are most likely to be targeted by Pb2+ in cells and tissues that sequester Pb2+ in vivo, which include the brain and the heart.

J	Campbell, DO; Legault, P				Campbell, DO; Legault, P			Nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the varkud satellite ribozyme stem-loop V RNA and magnesium-ion binding from chemical-shift mapping	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							LEAD-DEPENDENT RIBOZYME; SELF-CLEAVAGE; SECONDARY-STRUCTURE; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; ANGSTROM RESOLUTION; HAMMERHEAD RIBOZYME; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; METAL-BINDING; BASE PROTONS	An important step in the substrate recognition of the Neurospora Varkud Satellite (VS) ribozyme is the formation of a magnesium-dependent loop/loop interaction between the terminal loops of stem-loops I and V. We have studied the structure of stem-loop V by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and shown that it adopts a U-turn conformation, a common motif found in RNA. Structural comparisons indicate that the U-turn of stem-loop V fulfills some but not all of the structural characteristics found in canonical U-turn structures. This U-turn conformation exposes the Watson-Crick faces of the bases within stem-loop V (G697, A698, and C699) and makes them accessible for interaction with stem-loop I. Using chemical-shift mapping, we show that magnesium ions interact with the loop of the isolated stem-loop V and induce a conformational change that may be important for interaction with stem-loop I. This study expands our understanding of the role of U-turn motifs in RNA structure and function and provides insights into the mechanism of substrate recognition in the VS ribozyme.

J	Neagoe, PE; Lemieux, C; Sirois, MG				Neagoe, PE; Lemieux, C; Sirois, MG			Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)-A(165)-induced prostacyclin synthesis requires the activation of VEGF receptor-1 and-2 heterodimer	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CYTOSOLIC PHOSPHOLIPASE A(2); CELL PAF SYNTHESIS; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; PROTEIN-KINASE; NITRIC-OXIDE; HUMAN-LYMPHOCYTES; TYROSINE KINASE; P42/44 MAPK; CROSS-TALK; SYNTHASE	We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A(165) inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A(165) promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI(2)). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A(165) is mediating PGI2 synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A(165) activity. In this study, PGI2 synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6- keto prostaglandin F-1 alpha, 6- keto PGF(1 alpha)) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A(165) (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A(121) ( VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) ( up to 10(-9) M), increased PGI2 synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 ( placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI2 synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI2 release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI2 release mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121) up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI2 synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A(165) to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI(2) synthesis.

The vNTS2 polypeptide is 281 amino acids in length, which is 135 amino acids shorter than the full-length isoform. Immunohistochemical and radioligand binding studies revealed that the HA-tagged recombinant vNTS2 receptor is poorly targeted to plasma membranes in transfected COS-7 cells. Binding studies also showed that the truncated receptor displayed a 5000-fold lower affinity for neurotensin (NT) than its full-length counterpart (IC50 of 10 mu M and 2 nM, respectively). Yet NT binding induced efficient internalization of receptor-ligand complexes in vNTS2-transfected cells. Furthermore, it produced a rapid (< 5 min) activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2) pathway, indicating functional coupling of the variant receptor. This activation is sustained (> 1 h) and is also produced by the NTS2 agonist levocabastine. Western blotting experiments suggested that vNTS2 is not expressed in monomeric form in the rat central nervous system. However, it does appear to form a variety of multimeric complexes, including homodimers and heterodimers, with the full-length NTS2. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation studies in dually transfected cells demonstrated that the two receptor isoforms can form stable associations. Taken together, the present results indicated that the rat vNTS2 is a functional receptor that may play a role in NT signaling in mammalian central nervous system.

In one such study, we showed that early-blind subjects were able to localize sound sources accurately despite the lack of visual input for the calibration of their auditory space. A further ERP study with these subjects also revealed N1 and P3 components during a sound localization task to be more posteriorly distributed than for sighted controls, indicating an involvement of posterior regions in sound localization for blind subjects not present for sighted subjects. In the current study, we analyzed these data for EEG power and coherence in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands to see whether blind individuals would show increased coherence reflecting increased connectivity between the central and posterior cortical regions. Blind and sighted subjects did not differ with respect to overall EEG power in any frequency range. However, EEG coherence was significantly increased in blind subjects compared to sighted in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. These results have implications for cortical plasticity affected by sensory deprivation in humans. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is applicable for a class of design and covariance matrices which involve Kronecker products. An efficient algorithm which allows for application of the method to large multidimensional data volumes is given. This has direct application to neuroimaging, and here the technique is applied to positron emission tomography (PET) data. PET is an in vivo functional imaging technique that measures biological processes such as blood flow and receptor concentrations. Here, the algorithm is used to correct for resolution degradation in these images. This process is typically referred to as PET partial volume correction. Examples involving both measured phantom and human data are given. This rapid algorithm leads to advances in the types of quantitative brain imaging studies that can be performed.

J	Lamont, EW; Robinson, B; Stewart, J; Amir, S				Lamont, EW; Robinson, B; Stewart, J; Amir, S			The central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala exhibit opposite diurnal rhythms of expression of the clock protein Period2	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						hippocampus; suprachiasmatic nucleus; oval nucleus; circadian clock	MAMMALIAN CIRCADIAN CLOCK; RPER2 MESSENGER-RNA; RAT CENTRAL NUCLEUS; STRIA TERMINALIS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; BED NUCLEUS; PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; PERIPHERAL-TISSUES; CELLULAR ARCHITECTURE	There is considerable evidence that circadian rhythms in mammals can be modulated by emotional state, but how emotional state modulates specific circadian outputs is poorly understood. We analyzed the expression of the circadian clock protein Period2 (PER2) in three regions of the limbic forebrain known to play key roles in emotional regulation, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the dentate gyrus (DG). We report here that cells in all three regions exhibit daily rhythms in expression of PER2 that are under the control of the master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The rhythm in the CEA and the rhythms in the BLA and DG are diametrically opposite in phase and are differentially affected by adrenalectomy. Adrenalectomy completely abolished the PER2 rhythm in the CEA but had no effect on the PER2 rhythms in the BLA and DG. We previously reported a rhythm in PER2 expression in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis that is identical in phase and sensitivity to adrenalectomy to that found in the CEA. Together, these findings show that key structures of the limbic forebrain exhibit daily oscillations in clock gene expression that are controlled not only by input from the SCN but, importantly, by hormonal and neurochemical changes that normally accompany motivational and emotional states. Thus, cells within these areas are strategically positioned to integrate the inputs from the SCN and emotional states to modulate circadian rhythms downstream from the SCN clock.

Our aim was to investigate the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), MEK1, and Src family tyrosine kinases in IGF-I-mediated oligodendrocyte progenitor survival. In agreement with previous studies, IGF-I promoted cell survival. We show that IGF-I prevented apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation in a PI3K-dependent and MEK/ERK-independent manner. In addition, IGF-I activated Akt while inhibiting caspase-3 activation, and these effects were reversed by the PI3K inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin, but not by the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059. Interestingly, PP2, a specific Src-like kinase inhibitor, blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src, Fyn, and Lyn and IGF-I-stimulated Akt activation, yet had no significant effects on caspase-3 activation or progenitor survival. To further determine whether Akt is required for IGF-I-mediated survival, oligodendrocyte progenitors were transduced with defective Akt mutants or treated with an Akt inhibitor. Although the Akt mutants and inhibitor decreased Akt activity and reduced basal cell survival, IGF-I could partially rescue oligodendrocyte progenitors by decreasing caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that 1) PI3K is essential for IGF-I-promoted cell survival, 2) downstream activation of Akt-dependent and -independent pathways is involved, and 3) Src-like tyrosine kinases participate in IGF-I-induced Akt activation. Therefore, an unidentified effector(s) of PI3K appears to be involved in conferring complete IGF-I-mediated protection of oligodendrocyte progenitors.

Dendrites can be distinguished from the axon by the presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum ( RER). The mechanism by which the structure and distribution of the RER is maintained in these cells is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of the dendritic microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) in the RER membrane positioning by comparing their distribution in brain subcellular fractions and in primary hippocampal cells and by examining the MAP2-microtubule interaction with RER membranes in vitro. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain revealed a high MAP2 content in a subfraction enriched with the endoplasmic reticulum markers ribophorin and p63. Electron microscope morphometry confirmed the enrichment of this subfraction with RER membranes. In cultured hippocampal neurons, MAP2 and p63 were found to concomitantly compartmentalize to the dendritic processes during neuronal differentiation. Protein blot overlays using purified MAP2c protein revealed its interaction with p63, and immunoprecipitation experiments performed in HeLa cells showed that this interaction involves the projection domain of MAP2. In an in vitro reconstitution assay, MAP2-containing microtubules were observed to bind to RER membranes in contrast to microtubules containing tau, the axonal MAP. This binding of MAP2c microtubules was reduced when an anti-p63 antibody was added to the assay. The present results suggest that MAP2 is involved in the association of RER membranes with microtubules and thereby could participate in the differential distribution of RER membranes within a neuron.

Some researchers have hypothesized that abnormal fiber composition can lead to paraspinal muscle dysfunction such as poor neuromuscular efficiency and muscle fatigue. EMG parameters were used to evaluate these impairments. The purpose of the present study was to examine the clinical potential of different EMG parameters such as amplitude (RMS) and median frequency (MF) of the power spectrum in order to assess the back muscles of patients presenting idiopathic scoliosis in terms of their neuromuscular efficiency and their muscular fatigue. Methods: L5/S1 moments during isometric efforts in extension were measured in six subjects with idiopathic scoliosis and ten healthy controls. The subjects performed three 7 s ramp contractions ranging from 0 to 100% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and one 30 s sustained contraction at 75% MVC. Surface EMG activity was recorded bilaterally from the paraspinal muscles at L5, L3, L1 and T10. The slope of the EMG RMS/force ( neuromuscular efficiency) and MF/force ( muscle composition) relationships were computed during the ramp contractions while the slope of the EMG RMS/time and MF/time relationships ( muscle fatigue) were computed during the sustained contraction. Comparisons were performed between the two groups and between the left and right sides for the EMG parameters. Results: No significant group or side differences between the slopes of the different measures used were found at the level of the apex ( around T10) of the major curve of the spine. However, a significant side difference was seen at a lower level ( L3, p = 0.01) for the MF/time parameter. Conclusion: The EMG parameters used in this study could not discriminate between the back muscles of scoliotic subjects and those of control subject regarding fiber type composition, neuromuscular efficiency and muscle fatigue at the level of the apex. The results of this pilot study indicate that compensatory strategies are potentially seen at lower level of the spine with these EMG parameters.

The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects in 7 percent of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with minimal additional toxicity.

Critical players involved in this immune regulatory process are the resident immune cells of the brain, the microglia. Interactions between the growing family of B7 costimulatory ligands and their receptors are increasingly recognized as important pathways for costimulation and/or inhibition of immune responses. Human and mouse microglial cells constitutively express B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) in vitro. However, under inflammatory conditions [presence of interferon-gamma( IFN-gamma) or T-helper 1 supernatants], a significant upregulation of B7-H1 was detectable. Expression levels of B7-H1 protein on microglial cells were substantially higher compared with astrocytes or splenocytes. Coculture experiments of major histocompatibility complex class II-positive antigen-presenting cells (APC) with syngeneic T cells in the presence of antigen demonstrated the functional consequences of B7-H1 expression on T-cell activation. In the presence of a neutralizing anti-B7-H1 antibody, both the production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma and interleukin-2) and the upregulation of activation markers ( inducible costimulatory signal) by T cells were markedly enhanced. Interestingly, this effect was clearly more pronounced when microglial cells were used as APC, compared with astrocytes or splenocytes. Furthermore, B7-H1 was highly upregulated during the course of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced and proteolipid protein-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in vivo. Expression was predominantly localized to areas of strongest inflammation and could be colocalized with microglial cells/macrophages as well as T cells. Together, our data propose microglial B7-H1 as an important immune inhibitory molecule capable of downregulating T-cell activation in the CNS and thus confining immunopathological damage.

Recent functional neuroimaging studies have implicated the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and amygdala in the representation of reward values and/or in the anticipation of rewarding events. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activation during the presentation of reward with that during presentation of (conditioned) stimuli that have been paired previously with reward. Specifically, we aimed to investigate conditioned reward in the absence of explicit reward anticipation. Twenty-two healthy volunteers were scanned while monochrome visual patterns were incidentally associated with reward or negative feedback in the context of a simple card game. In the subsequent session, visual patterns, including the conditioned stimuli, were presented without reward or negative feedback, and the affective valence of these stimuli was assessed behaviorally. The presentation of reward compared with negative feedback activated the ventral striatum and OFC. Activation in the same OFC region was observed when, in the subsequent session, subjects passively viewed the stimuli that had been paired with reward, without the administration of reward and with subjects being essentially unaware of the conditioning manipulation. These findings suggest that the OFC in humans plays an important role in the representation of both rewarding stimuli and conditioned stimuli that have acquired reward value.

RBD affects mainly older men and its prevalence in the general population is estimated to be around 0.5%. RBD may be idiopathic or associated with other neurologic disorders. A strong association between RBD and alpha-synucleinopathies has been recently observed, with the parasomnia often heralding the clinical onset of the neurodegenerative disease. The idiopathic form accounts for up to 60% of the cases reported in the three largest series of patients with RBD. Small clinical follow-up studies revealed that a proportion of these patients will eventually develop a parkinsonian syndrome or a dementia of Lewy bodies type in the years following the RBD diagnosis, while some patients will never show other neurologic signs within several decades from the RBD onset. Recent studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuro-psychological functions in idiopathic RBD and have found evidences of CNS dysfunction during both wakefulness and sleep. An impairment of the cortical activity, specific neuropsychological deficits, and signs of autonomic dysfunction have been observed in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of idiopathic RBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies.

Our goal is to perform Monte Carlo calculations of dose distributions for certain treatment plans as a verification tool. A dedicated mu MLC component module for the BEAMnrc code was developed as part of this project and was incorporated in a model of the Varian CL2300 linear accelerator 6 MV photon beam. As an initial validation of the code, the leaf geometry was visualized by tracing particles through the component module and recording their position each time a leaf boundary was crossed. The leaf dimensions were measured and the leaf material density and interleaf air gap were chosen to match the simulated leaf leakage profiles with film measurements in a solid water phantom. A comparison between Monte Carlo calculations and measurements (diode, radiographic film) was performed for square and irregularly shaped fields incident on flat and homogeneous water phantoms. Results show that Monte Carlo calculations agree with measured dose distributions to within 2% and/or 1 mm except for field size smaller than 1.2 cm diameter where agreement is within 5% due to uncertainties in measured output factors.

Conventional methods of dose computation for these complex, inhomogeneous IMRT cases involve significant approximations. In the present work, a methodology for the development, commissioning and implementation of a Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine for intensity modulated radiotherapy (MC-IMRT) is proposed which can be used by radiotherapy centres interested in developing MC-IMRT capabilities for research or clinical evaluations. The method proposes three levels for developing, commissioning and maintaining a MC-IMRT dose calculation engine: (a) development of a MC model of the linear accelerator, (b) validation of MC model for IMRT and (c) periodic quality assurance (QA) of the MC-IMRT system. The first step, level (a), in developing an MC-IMRT system is to build a model of the linac that correctly predicts standard open field measurements for percentage depth-dose and off-axis ratios. Validation of MC-IMRT, level (b), can be performed in a rando phantom and in a homogeneous water equivalent phantom. Ultimately, periodic quality assurance of the MC-IMRT system is needed to verify the MC-IMRT dose calculation system, level (c). Once the MC-IMRT dose calculation system is commissioned it can be applied to more complex clinical IMRT treatments. The MC-IMRT system implemented at the Royal Marsden Hospital was used for IMRT calculations for a patient undergoing treatment for primary disease with nodal involvement in the head-and-neck region (primary treated to 65 Gy and nodes to 54 Gy), while sparing the spinal cord, brain stem and parotid glands. Preliminary MC results predict a decrease of approximately 1-2 Gy in the median dose of both the primary tumour and nodal volumes (compared with both pencil beam and collapsed cone). This is possibly due to the large air-cavity (the larynx of the patient) situated in the centre of the primary PTV and the approximations present in the dose calculation.

When two potential targets appeared, many (43%) task-related, directionally tuned cells in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) discharged if one of the targets was near their preferred direction. At the population level, this generated two simultaneous sustained directional signals corresponding to the current reach options. After a subsequent nonspatial cue identified the correct target, the corresponding directional signal increased, and the signal for the rejected target was suppressed. The PMd population reliably predicted the monkey's response choice, including errors. This supports a planning model in which multiple reach options are initially specified and then gradually eliminated in a competition for overt execution, as more information accumulates.

Patients: Two sisters aged 6 and 8.5 years presented with a latent hemolytic process characterized by undetectable or low plasma haptoglobin, respectively, associated with renal failure and gross proteinuria. Renal biopsies performed in both patients found typical findings of thrombotic microangiopathy suggesting the diagnosis of HUS. Both patients were free of neurologic signs. Results: Biochemical investigations found a cobalamin processing deficiency of the cblC type. Search for additional factors susceptible to worsen endothelial damage revealed homozygosity 677C --> T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene as well as heterozygosity for a 3254T --> C mutation in factor H in the patient with the most severe clinical presentation. Long-term subcutaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin in combination with oral betaine and folic acid resulted in clinical and biological improvement in both patients. Conclusion: cblC disease may be a cause of chronic HUS with delayed onset in childhood. Superimposed mutation of factor H gene might influence clinical severity.

The adductor pollicis muscle has long been used in research and clinical practice as reference for neuromuscular monitoring. The goal of our study was to compare PMG signals (train-of-four [TOF] ratios and T-1 /T-0 values) from both hands of the same patient to investigate the influence of hand dominance on neuromuscular monitoring. In 14 patients, PMG was recorded via small piezoelectric microphones taped over the thenar mass of both hands. After induction of anesthesia, both ulnar nerves were stimulated supramaximally using TOF stimulation every 12 s. Mivacurium 0.2 mg/kg was administered within 5 s. Onset, maximum effect, and offset of NMB were compared between both adductor pollicis muscles. Twelve patients were right-handed and two patients were left-handed. No statistical difference was found between the signals from the dominant or nondominant hand. Correlation was very good (r = 0.95). Agreement was excellent with a bias of -0.57% and limits of agreement of -17.9% to 16.7% (dominant nondominant hand). This study shows minimal bias, good correlation and no statistical difference when NMB is monitored at both the dominant and nondominant adductor pollicis muscles. Both hands could be used interchangeably to assess NMB at the adductor pollicis muscle.

J	Guay, J				Guay, J			The neurostimulator for brachial plexus blockade by the axillary approach: a metaanalysis on its efficacy to increase the success rate	ANNALES FRANCAISES D ANESTHESIE ET DE REANIMATION			French	Article						axillary brachial plexus block; neurostimulation; metaanalyse	PERIPHERAL-NERVE STIMULATOR; LOCALIZATION; PARESTHESIA; ANESTHESIA; INJECTION; SURGERY; QUALITY	Objective. - To evaluate the effectiveness of the neurostimulator to improve the success rate of a brachial plexus blockade by the axillary approach. Study design. - Metaanalysis. Methods. - Ten prospective randomized studies comparing a neurostimulating technique (NST) of brachial plexus blockade performed by the axillary approach to another technique were kept for analysis. A successful block was defined as blockade of the four following nerves: radial, median, ulnar and musculocutaneous. Data were entered on an intention to treat basis and were analyzed with a random model. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results. - Data were heterogenous (p < 0.001) and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test showed that the neurostimulator does not improve the success rate of brachial plexus blocks performed by the axillary approach when all available studies are considered as a whole (P = 1). For the subgroup of studies where four nerves were stimulated however, the NST decreases the incidence of failed block by 25% (95% C I= 7-42%) (p < 0.0001). There were 12 patients with systemic signs of local anesthetics toxicity when a NST was used compared to 28 when it was not (p = 0.04), relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI = 0.6-0.8). Conclusion. - This study shows that the neurostimulator improves the success rate of brachial plexus blocks performed by the axillary approach only when three nerves or more are stimulated and its use decreases the incidence of systemic local anaesthetics toxicity.

In this study, we evaluated 24 ataxic patients from 10 French-Canadian families. All cases have a homogeneous phenotype consisting of a progressive ataxia appearing between 2 and 20 (mean age, 14.8) years of age with associated dysarthria, saccadic ocular pursuit, distal amyotrophy, sensory and motor neuropathy, and increased a-fetoprotein levels but absence of oculomotor apraxia. Linkage disequilibrium was observed with markers in the ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 2 locus on chromosome 9q34. We have identified four mutations in senataxin in the French-Canadian population including two novel missense mutations: the 5927T-->G mutation changes the leucine encoded by codon 1976 to an arginine in the helicase domain (L1976R), and the 193G-->A mutation changes a glutamic acid encoded by codon 65 into a lysine in the N-terminal domain of the protein (E65K). The common L1976R mutation is shared by 17 of 20 (85%) carrier chromosomes. The study of this large French-Canadian cohort better defines the phenotype of this ataxia and presents two novel mutations in senataxin including the more common founder mutation in the French-Canadian population.

J	Robichaud, M; Dugas, MJ				Robichaud, M; Dugas, MJ			Negative problem orientation (Part II): construct validity and specificity to worry	BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY			English	Article						problem-solving; anxiety; depression (emotion); statistical validity; personality measures	SELF-MASTERY; DEPRESSION; OPTIMISM; ANXIETY; PERSONALITY; VALIDATION	Negative problem orientation, a dysfunctional set of attitudes related to problem-solving ability, has been implicated as a process variable in several psychological disorders, notably depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The goal of the present study was two-fold: (1) to further examine the construct validity of a new measure of negative problem orientation, the negative problem orientation questionnaire (NPOQ), through its relationship to conceptually similar variables, and (2) to investigate the specificity of negative problem orientation to worry, the cardinal feature of GAD, compared to depression. The sample consisted of 148 university students who completed six questionnaires, the NPOQ and measures of worry, depression, pessimism, self-mastery, and neuroticism. Multiple hierarchical regressions revealed that when entered in the last step following demographic information and personality variables (pessimism, self-mastery, and neuroticism), the NPOQ accounted for 5.6% of the variance in worry scores compared to 1.6% of the variance in depression scores. It was concluded that the NPOQ shows evidence of construct validity, and that the process variable of negative problem orientation appears to have greater specificity to worry than depression. Implications for the understanding of worry and GAD are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We used PET to study cross-modal plasticity in the congenitally blind, using electrotactile stimulation of the tongue. Blind (n = 6) and sighted blindfolded controls (n = 5) were scanned before and after they were trained to use their tongue in a Snellen orientation detection task. Results showed that both groups of subjects learned the discrimination orientation task after seven 1 h training sessions. Before training, no significant changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were observed in the occipital cortex in either group. In sharp contrast, activity in the occipital cortex increased after practice for the blind, but not for the sighted, providing evidence for training-induced plasticity in the blind. An inter-regional correlation analysis showed that task-related rCBF changes in left posterior parietal cortex were positively correlated with rCBF changes in the occipital area of the trained blind. These data reveal that cross-modal plasticity in the blind develops rapidly and that the occipital cortex is part of a functional neural network for tactile discrimination in conjunction with the posterior parietal cortex. Our data further show that the tongue can act as a portal to convey somatosensory information to visual cortex.

However, there has been minimal investigation into the underlying cerebral organization for perceiving danger created by music. In comparison, the amygdala's role in recognition of fear in non-musical contexts has been well established. The present study sought to fill this gap in exploring how patients with amygdala resection recognize emotional expression in music. To this aim, we tested 16 patients with left (LTR; n = 8) or right (RTR; n = 8) medial temporal resection (including amygdala) for the relief of medically intractable seizures and 16 matched controls in an emotion recognition task involving instrumental music. The musical selections were purposely created to induce fear, peacefulness, happiness and sadness. Participants were asked to rate to what extent each musical passage expressed these four emotions on 10-point scales. In order to check for the presence of a perceptual problem, the same musical selections were presented to the participants in an error detection task. None of the patients was found to perform below controls in the perceptual task. In contrast, both LTR and RTR patients were found to be impaired in the recognition of scary music. Recognition of happy and sad music was normal. These findings suggest that the anteromedial temporal lobe (including the amygdala) plays a role in the recognition of danger in a musical context.

To define the role of heterotopic grey matter tissue in epileptogenesis and to improve outcome, we performed stereoencephalography (SEEG) recordings in eight patients with uni- or bilateral PNH and intractable focal epilepsy. The SEEG studies aimed to evaluate the most epileptogenic areas and included the allo- and neocortex and at least one nodule of grey matter. Interictal spiking activity was found in ectopic grey matter in three patients, in the cortex overlying the nodules in five and in the mesial temporal structures in all. At least one heterotopion was involved at seizure onset in six patients, synchronous with the overlying neocortex or ipsilateral hippocampus. Two patients had their seizures originating in the mesial temporal structures only. Six patients had surgery and the resected areas included the seizure onset, with follow-up from 1 to 8 years. An amygdalo-hippocampectomy was performed in two (Engel class Id and III), an amygdalo-hippocampectomy plus removal of an adjacent heterotopion in two (class Ia), and a resection of two contiguous nodules plus a small rim of overlying occipital cortex in one patient (class Id). One patient with bilateral PNH had three adjacent nodules resected and an ipsilateral amygdalo-hippocampectomy resulting in a reduction of the number of seizures by 25-50%. The best predictor of surgical outcome is the presence of a focal epileptic generator; this generator may or may not include the PNH. Invasive recording is required in patients with PNH; it improves localization and is the key to better outcome.

It is proposed that these two systems are more closely related than previously supposed. In particular, it is claimed that a sentence with anaphoric dependencies involves several Working Memories, each entrusted with a different linguistic function. Components of Working Memory reside in the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, which is associated with Broca's region. When lesioned, this area manifests comprehension disruptions in the ability to analyze intra-sentential dependencies, suggesting that Working Memory spans over syntactic computations. The unification of considerations regarding Working Memory with a purely syntactic approach to Broca's regions leads to the conclusion that mechanisms that compute transformations and no other syntactic relations-reside in this area.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) generates the folate derivative for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. We investigated the effect of antisense-mediated inhibition of MTHFR on survival of human cancer cells. Experimental Design: We examined the in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of a combination of MTHFR antisense and standard cytotoxic drugs. Results: Specific antisense against MTHFR (EX5) showed significant inhibitory effects on growth of human colon, lung, breast, prostate, and neuroblastoma tumor cells in vitro compared with that of the control oligonucleotide. Cytotoxic drugs (5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, or paclitaxel) potentiated the effect of EX5. In vivo, antisense alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs inhibited the growth of human colon and lung carcinoma xenografts. In comparison with control oligonucleotide, treatment with EX5 inhibited growth of colon tumors and lung tumors by 60% and 45%, respectively. EX5 with 5-fluorouracil decreased growth of colon tumors by an additional 30% compared with EX5 alone, and EX5 with cisplatin decreased growth of lung tumors by an additional 40% compared with cisplatin alone. Growth inhibition by EX5 was associated with decreased amounts of MTHFR protein and with increased amounts of an apoptosis marker. Conclusions: Our results confirm that MTHFR inhibition decreases tumor growth and suggest that inhibition of MTHFR by antisense or small molecules may be a novel anticancer approach.

We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to determine the way in which unattended, task-irrelevant sounds were stored in auditory memory (i.e., as one integrated stream or as two distinct streams). Subjects were instructed to ignore all the sounds and attend to a visual task or to selectively attend to a subset of the sounds and perform a task with the sounds (Experiments I and 2). A third (behavioral) experiment was conducted to test whether global pattern violations (used in Experiments 1 and 2) were perceptible when the sounds were segregated. We found that the mismatch negativity ERP component, an index of auditory change detection, was evoked by infrequent pattern violations occurring in the unattended sounds when all the sounds were ignored, but not when attention was focused on a subset of the sounds. The results demonstrate that multiple unattended sound streams can segregate by frequency range but that selectively attending to a subset of the sounds can modify the extent to which the unattended sounds are processed. These results are consistent with models in animal and human studies showing that attentional control can limit the processing of unattended input in favor of attended sensory inputs, thereby facilitating the ability to achieve behavioral goals.

Attentional control was examined by employing a modified version of the flanker task. We found that the inconsistent condition elicited a significantly greater number of path coefficients than the consistent condition. In addition, we report that the strength of the prefrontal paths common to both conditions were not different, but that the remaining six paths were different between conditions. Importantly, these results suggest that the relationship between regions supporting attentional control differ between task conditions but the strength of the relationship between some prefrontal regions is invariant between task conditions. Additionally, we found that the paths were significantly lateralized to the right hemisphere. These results are discussed in relation to theories of the function of each region in attentional control. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it remains uncertain which of the various steps involved in the processing of long-distance dependencies is responsible for the increased cost of longer dependencies. Previous sentence comprehension studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have revealed response components that reflect the construction [J. King, M. Kutas, Who did what and when? Using word- and clause-level ERPs to monitor working memory usage in reading. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 7, (1995) 376-395.] and completion [E. Kaan, A. Harris, E. Gibson, P. Holcomb, The P600 as an index of syntactic integration difficulty. Language and Cognitive Processes, 5, (2000) 159-201.] of long-distance wh-dependencies. This article reports one off-line rating study and one ERP study that manipulated both the presence of wh-dependencies and the length of the dependencies (one clause vs. two clauses), with the aim of clarifying the locus of length-sensitivity and the functional role of associated ERP components. Results of the off-line study confirm that longer wh-dependencies incur greater processing cost. Results of the ERP study indicate that both a sustained anterior negativity that follows the initiation of the wh-dependency and also a late posterior positivity (P600) that marks the completion of the dependency are sensitive to the presence of a wh-dependency, but do not show amplitude variations reflecting the length of the dependency. However, the P600 is delayed when it marks the completion of a longer wh-dependency. This suggests that both the sustained negativity and the P600 reflect length-insensitive aspects of the construction of syntactic dependencies. In addition, an N400 component is elicited in the middle of the two clause wh-dependency, upon encountering a verb with an argument structure that prevents completion of the dependency.

In oocytes, actin is known to play important roles in different processes such as those leading to fertilization or to mRNA localization during oogenesis. In this paper, we report the characterization of a novel actin isoform (apACTov) in Aplysia californica that is specifically expressed in ovotestis. The apACTov cDNA codes for a putative protein of 376 amino acids that shows 96% and 94% sequence identity with two other actin isoforms previously characterized in Aplysia. In situ hybridization experiments showed that the apACTov transcript is not uniformly distributed but is found in crescent or filipodia-like structures at the surface of the oocyte. Our results suggest that apACTov may contribute to the differential distribution of critical material during egg division and/or cell differentiation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The purpose Of this Study was: 1- to verify this claim With Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) and eye-hand Reaction Time (RT) measurements and 2- examine if the VEP and RT responses are similarly modulated by the same trigger features of (lie stimuli. Methods: The VEPs and eye-hand RT for motion-reversal luminance- (first-order) and texture-defined (second-order) stimuli were recorded from ten normal human subjects. VEPs and RTs were measured for each motion class at eight different modulation depths (from 3 to 100%). Results: Our results reveal that for stimuli Of of low contrast levels, the SO-FO timing differences are approximately 100 ms (RT) or 20 ms (VEP), while for contrasts >= 15-20% (VEP) or >= 50% (RT), the SO-FO difference is 110 longer significant (p > 0.007), Suggesting either that the brain can no longer distinguish SO from FO stimuli or that in spite of the added complexity Or SO stimuli the brain takes equal time to process both. Conclusion: Interestingly, the above contrast discrepancy in SO-FO resolution threshold Suggests that, compared to the VEP, the more psychophysical RT measurement Can process and thus distinguish a larger spectrum of motion stimuli, thus further confirming the latter measurement Or the retinocortical processing, time as a valid alternative to the VEP.

The reliability and the construct validity of the MISA have been documented. However, establishment of the ability of the MISA to predict health outcomes related to feeding difficulties would support its applicability in research and in clinical settings. Seventy-three participants of a large-scale reliability and validity study were followed for up to 563 days following evaluation with the MISA. The date of the first pulmonary infection and the date and cause of death where applicable were obtained from medical records. Individuals with no incident of pulmonary infection and who were not deceased were "censored" at the date of followup. Survival analyses revealed that the MISA scores are predictive of death using a Cox proportional hazards model, and of time to pulmonary infection using a flexible model. Scores on the Solid Ingestion and Self-feeding scales are predictive of death using the Cox model, and the Texture Management scale is predictive of death using the flexible model. This effect remains statistically significant even when MISA scores are adjusted for the participant's age. These findings Support the validity of the MISA for use with elderly individuals with neurogenic ingestive skill loss residing in long-term care facilities.

Most of the studies were conducted in highly selected EEG epochs and patients. In addition, these studies relied mostly oil mathematical approaches and neglected clinical and visual EEG parameters. We therefore performed a systematic comparison of a nonlinear method (the similarity measure) with classic visual inspection of the EEG and the patient's clinical state. Methods: We analyzed the dynamics of long epochs of intracranial EEG containing 129 electroclinical and 45 electrographic seizures in 13 successive unselected patients undergoing presurgical evaluation. Results: (a) The similarity measure detected preictal dynamical changes of the EEG signal in two thirds of the seizures whether or not a clear focus was identified, and whether seizures were electroclinical or purely electrographic. The mean duration of preictal changes was 12 min. (b) The preictal changes were correlated with various visually detectable EEG changes in 78.9% of electroclinical seizures. (c) 81.5% of the preictal dynamic changes were correlated with changes of vigilance or behavior. (d) Fluctuations of the dynamics were not necessarily followed by seizures. Conclusions: Our results indicate that EEG dynamics frequently change before seizures. These preictal changes are most often associated with the EEG changes accompanying transitions between states of vigilance. The preictal dynamic changes may represent physiologic changes acting as facilitating factors or pathologic changes reflecting a network dysfunction.

Spike generators were realistically simulated with cortical areas of different extents. Methods: The source was simulated by using a patch that comprised small triangles on the cortical surface, each triangle having an elementary dipole generator with a moment corresponding to real intracerebral fields of spikes. The source-patch covered various clinically important parts of the temporal and frontal lobes, with an area ranging from 6 to 120 cm(2). The scalp field was computed for each source-patch by using a realistic head model and was fitted by the single-dipole model to determine the best-fit dipole and the intracerebral distribution of residual variance (RV). Dipole modeling also was performed for the simulated scalp field with additional real EEG background. Results: The RV after fitting a dipole to the scalp field without noise was at most 1.34%. Scalp spikes arising from sources of 6 cm(2) were of small amplitude, and the dipoles estimated for these spikes were inconsistent. Extension of the source area was associated with increase of scalp potential amplitude, only very small increase of RV, and increased consistency of the estimated dipoles. When the source was very large, the dipoles clustered at very misleading locations. Conclusions: Pitfalls in dipole source localization are caused by the procedure of fitting the simplistic dipole model to real cortical sources with spatial extent and complex configuration.

Although numerous reasons could be offered to explain these discrepancies in research findings, recent evidence from rodent, nonhuman primate, and human studies consistently suggests that one possibility may be critical to our understanding of the estrogenic effect on memory. Results of these animal and human studies indicate that the initiation of estrogen treatment at the time of menopause, or soon after ovariectomy (OVX), provides a window of opportunity for the preservation of memory in females whereas the administration of the hormone following a considerable delay in time after OVX has little or no beneficial effect on cognition. Considering the evidence that, in several organ systems, heightened disease risks accrue to a longer duration of estrogen deprivation in women, it would seem important to determine whether this is also true for brain structure and function in order to protect the quality of life for the considerable number of women who undergo a surgical menopause before their natural menopause had occurred.

The maps assess the likelihood that a point in the brain contains a dipolar source, under the hypothesis of one, two or three activated sources. This is achieved by examining all combinations of one to three dipoles on a coarse grid and attributing to each combination a score based on an F statistic. The probability density function of the statistic under the null hypothesis is estimated nonparametrically, using bootstrap resampling. A theoretical F distribution is then fitted to the empirical distribution in order to allow correction for multiple comparisons. The maps allow for the systematic exploration of the solution space for dipolar sources. They permit to test whether the data support a given solution. They do not rely on the assumption of uncorrelated source time courses. They can be compared to other statistical parametric maps such as those used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results are presented for both simulated and real data. The maps were compared with LORETA and MUSIC results. For the real data consisting of an average of epileptic spikes, we observed good agreement between the EEG statistical maps, intracranial EEG recordings, and fMRI activations.

We report on the results of a self-administered questionnaire study conducted in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 2002. The questionnaire consisted of 34 items and included demographic data, disease and medication use patterns and cannabis use profiles. Subjects were self-selected; 3663 questionnaires were distributed and 2969 were returned [1805 (60.9%) women, mean age 52.7 years (SD 12.7)]. Medicinal cannabis use was reported by patients with chronic pain (25%), multiple sclerosis and depression (22% each), arthritis (21%) and neuropathy (19%). Medicinal cannabis use was associated with younger age, male gender and previous recreational use (p < 0.001). While caution must be exercised in interpreting these data, they point to the need for clinical studies of cannabis and cannabinoids with standardised and quality-controlled products.

Both interferon (IFNO) and copolymer-1 (Cop-1) reduce the overall lymphocyte entry into the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as judged by MRI based studies. In this study, we used a modified Boyden chamber assay in which human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBEC) monolayers are grown on a fibronectin coated transwell membrane to evaluate in vitro migration of allo-antigen Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes across brain endothelium. We confirmed previous observations showing that migration rates of Th2 lymphocytes across HBECs were higher than migration rates of Th1 cells. When HBECs were pre-treated with IFN beta (100 U/ml) 30 min prior to migration, the migration rate of Th1 was significantly decreased (45% reduction) while the migration of Th2 remained unchanged. Addition of Cop-1 (30 mu g/ml) to HBEC monolayers 30 min prior to migration significantly increased the migration rate of Th2 cells and did not affect the migration of Th1 cells. We did not observe any changes in (1) the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of HBECs and (2) the pattern of chemokine production by HBECs after IFN beta or Cop-1 treatment. The changes in cellular migration rates were not paralleled with changes in diffusion of large molecular weight tracers across brain ECs. Our data support the notion that immuno-modulators used for the treatment of NIS selectively and differentially regulate the migration of T helper lymphocyte subsets and that Cop-1 promotes trans-endothelial migration of Th2 cells across the BBB.

The study is based on a comprehensive literature review and a field investigation of projects constructed in Canada and the USA. The field investigation was carried out over a 6-month period and encompassed 33 actual cases of work packages and contracts. Factors contributing to the adverse effects of change orders on labor productivity are identified and a model presented earlier is expanded to account primarily for the timing of change orders, among other factors. The developed model, as well as four models developed by others, have been incorporated in a prototype software system to estimate the loss of labor productivity due to change orders. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the use of the developed model, and illustrate its capabilities.

Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests a reciprocal modulation between sex steroids and the serotonin (5-HT) system. A previous study from our laboratory has shown that the progesterone metabolites 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-dione (5 beta-DHP) and 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol,20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP), as well as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), increase the firing activity of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurones in female rats. The present study was undertaken to assess the effects of these steroids in male rats, as well as the effects of testosterone and 17 beta-oestradiol (17 beta-E) in both sexes, and finally to evaluate gender differences in the modulation of the 5-HT neuronal firing activity by these different neuroactive steroids. Male rats were treated i.c.v., for 7 days, with a dose of 50 mu g/kg/day of one of the following steroids: progesterone, 5 beta-DHP, 3 alpha,5 alpha-THIP, DHEA, testosterone, 17 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstan-3-one (5 alpha-DHT) and 17 beta-E. Some rats also received a 3-day administration of testosterone (50 mu g/kg/day, i.c.v). Females were treated in the same fashion with testosterone and 17 beta-E. Extracellular unitary recordings of 5-HT neurones, obtained in vivo in the DRN of these rats, revealed that testosterone and 17 beta-E increased the firing activity of 5-HT neurones in both males and females. In males, the effect of testosterone could already be seen after 3 days of treatment. Neither castration nor any treatment with other steroids significantly modified the firing rate of male 5-HT neurones. Taken together with previous findings, the results of the present study indicate both similarities and differences between sexes in the modulation of 5-HT neurones by some steroids. This could prove important in understanding gender differences in mood disorders.

The authors investigated whether patients with early (N = 21) and late (N = 17) onset OCD differ with respect to neuropsychological functioning. Results revealed that the late onset OCD group obtained poorer scores on measures of executive function and auditory attention than the early onset group. Late onset OCD was also associated with poorer visual memory relative to healthy comparison subjects. These findings suggest that early and late onset OCD may be the result of at least partially differing neurobiological mechanisms.

Although the Edmontan. Staging System (ESS) for cancer pain was developed for this purpose, clinical and, research utility has been limited due to problems associated with the assessment. of some items, especially in relation to definitions and terminology. To overcome these limitations, we designed, a revised ESS (rESS) and conducted a multicenter study to determine its inter-rater reliability and predictive value. In revising the rESS, we hypothesized that patients with less problematic pain features would require a shorter time to achieve stable pain control, require less complicated analgesic regimens, be more responsive to opioid therapy, and use lower opioid doses. The rESS items include mechanism of Pain, presence or absence of incidental pain, presence or absence of psychological distress and addictive behavior and level of cognitive function. Patients with cancer pain who were consecutively admitted to two different hospice centers, an acute care consultation service in a teaching hospital or a tertiary palliative care unit in a second teaching hospital were evaluated for study entry. Two independent palliative care specialists completed the rESS where possible within 24 hours of each other. Patients' pain ratings and opioid consumption were recorded daily until the study endpoint (i.e. achievement of stable pain control, discharge or death). Seven hundred and forty-six patients were eligible for study entry and of these, 619 (83 %) had a pain syndrome. Inter-rater reliability estimates ranged from. 0.67 (pain mechanism) to 0.95 (presence of addiction). In the univariate Cox regression analysis, younger patients (< 60), as well as patients with neuropathic pain, incidental pain, psychological distress, or co-morbid psychological distress and addiction, required a significantly longer lime to achieve stable pain control (P < 0.05). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, only age (< 60), neuropathic pain and incidental pain were significantly associated with time to reach stable pain control (P <= 0.05). Patients with neuropathic or incidental pain used significantly more modalities to achieve stable pain control (P < 0.01). Patients with neuropathic pain, incidental pain, as well as the presence of psychological distress or addiction, required a higher final mean morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) (P < 0.001). A comparison of the rESS with the ESS demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the ESS prognostic staging system for predicting achievement of stable pain control. These findings confirm the study hypothesis, suggesting that the rESS appears to have good predictive value and a moderate to high inter-rater reliability. We suggest the rESS should prove to be a useful tool in clinical practice, and in the comparison of cancer pain populations in research studies. (c) 2005 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

The focus of this review is to discuss the literature concerning sigma receptors and their ligands, with respect to their antidepressants properties. In addition to the behavioral data, we discuss electrophysiological and biochemical models demonstrating sigma receptors' ability to modulate important factors in the pathophysiology of depression and/or the mechanisms of action of antidepressants such as the serotonergic neurotransmission in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus. We also discuss the significance of these two systems in the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Sigma ligands have potential as antidepressant medications with a fast onset of action as they produce a rapid modulation of the serotonergic system in the DRN and the glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus. As these effects of sigma ligands may produce antidepressant properties by completely novel mechanisms of action, they may provide an alternative to the antidepressants currently available and may prove to be beneficial for treatment-resistant depressed patients.

Methods: Fourteen patients with advanced cancer and hypoactive delirium were seen between March 1999 and August 2000 at the Palliative Care Day Hospital and the inpatient Tertiary Palliative Care Unit of Montreal General Hospital, Montreal. They were chosen for inclusion in a prospective clinical study on the basis of (1) cognitive failure documented by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (2) sleep-wake pattern disturbances, (3) psychomotor retardation, (4) absence of delusions or hallucinations, and (5) absence of an underlying cause to explain the delirium. All patients were treated with methylphenidate, and changes in their cognitive function were measured using the MMSE. Results: All 14 patients showed improvement in their cognitive function as documented by the MMSE. The median pretreatment MMSE score (maximum score 30) was 21 (mean 20.9, standard deviation [SD] 4.9), which improved to a median of 27 (mean 24.9, SD 4.7) after the first dose of methylphenidate (p < 0.001, matched, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test). One patient died before reaching a stable dose of methylphenidate. In the other 13 patients, the median MMSE score further improved to 28 (mean 27.8, SD 2.4) (p = 0.02 compared with the median MMSE score documented 1 hour after the first dose of methylphenidate). All patients showed an improvement in psychomotor activities. Conclusions: Hypoactive delirium that cannot be explained by an underlying cause (metabolic or drug-induced) in patients with advanced cancer appears to be a specific syndrome that could be improved by the administration of methylphenidate.

The present studies aimed to identify and clone the 48-kD nuclear protein and to define its action on ANG gene expression. Nuclear proteins were isolated from IRPTC and subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. The 48-kD nuclear protein was detected by Southwestern blotting and subsequently identified by mass spectrometry, revealing that it was identical to 46-kD heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP F), a nuclear protein that binds to TATA-binding protein and associates with RNA polymerase 11 and also interacts with nuclear cap-binding complex. The hnRNP F cDNA was cloned from IRPTC by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Bacterially expressed recombinant hnRNP F bound to the rat ANG-IRE, as revealed by gel mobility shift assay. The addition of polyclonal antibodies against hnRNP F yielded a supershift in gel mobility. Transient transfer of sense and antisense hnRNP F cDNA in IRPTC inhibited and enhanced ANG gene expression, respectively. High glucose stimulated and insulin inhibited hnRNP F expression in IRPTC. Expression studies indicated that hnRNP F is present in the kidney, testis, liver, lung, and brain but not in the spleen. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that hnRNP F binds to rANG-IRE and modulates renal ANG gene expression, implicating that dysregulation of hnRNP F might affect renin-angiotensin system activation and, subsequently, kidney injury in diabetes.

Both trials showed encouraging trends for a decrease in macrovascular complications, and this is being pursued in new studies. These findings have led to more strict goals for glucose control. As glucose levels are aimed to be closer to the normal range, the risk for hypoglycemia also increases dramatically. The choice of the agent therefore is more influenced currently by the risk for hypoglycemia. There are presently four classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. These agents differ greatly in terms of mechanisms of action, efficacy, side effect profiles, and cost. Except for Acarbose, all classes decrease the glycosylated hemoglobin by a similar magnitude: 1.0 to 1.5%. In chronic renal failure, the oral agents that can be used therefore include the insulin secretagogues repaglinide and nateglinide and the thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) with caution. Insulin also can be used safely in renal failure.

J	Gregoire, S; Yang, XJ				Gregoire, S; Yang, XJ			Association with class IIa histone deacetylases upregulates the sumoylation of MEF2 transcription factors	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; C-JUN PROMOTER; SUMO E3 LIGASE; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; HDAC4 DEACETYLASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; NUCLEAR; PHOSPHORYLATION; APOPTOSIS; ACETYLATION	The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors plays an important role in regulating cellular programs like muscle differentiation, neuronal survival, and T-cell apoptosis. Multisite phosphorylation is known to control the transcriptional activity of MEF2 proteins, but it is unclear whether other modifications are involved. Here, we report that human MEF2D, as well as MEF2C, is modified by SUMO2 and SUMO3 at a motif highly conserved among MEF2 proteins from diverse organisms. This motif is located within the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain, and its sumoylation inhibits transcription. As a transcriptional corepressor of MEF2, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) potentiates sumoylation. This potentiation is dependent on the N-terminal region but not the C-terminal deacetylase domain of HDAC4 and is inhibited by the sumoylation of HDAC4 itself. Moreover, HDAC5, HDAC7, and an HDAC9 isoform also stimulate sumoylation of MEF2. Opposing the action of class IIa deacetylases, the SUMO protease SENP3 reverses the sumoylation to augment the transcriptional and myogenic activities of MEF2. Similarly, the calcium M kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 signaling pathways negatively regulate the sumoylation. These results thus identify sumoylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for MEF2 and suggest that this modification interplays with phosphorylation to promote intramolecular signaling for coordinated regulation in vivo.

We have previously reported a new knock-in mouse adenocarcinoma prostate (KIMAP) model. In this study, we demonstrate that the new model possesses a tumor architecture of heterogeneity and multifocality similar to that of human CaP, by utilizing a new compound scoring system to compare with the PSP94 (approved gene symbol Msmb) gene-directed transgenic mouse Cap model (TGMAP). KIMAP mice showed a balanced distribution of tumor extent, which penetrated the prostate gland. Comparative studies on cDNA microarrays demonstrated that KIMAP tumors were upregulated with higher contents of immunoresponse genes, whereas PSP-TGMAP tumors had neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. The majority of KIMAP mice did not progress to NE Cap, which was observed only at a very late stage and a low frequency. Several tumor marker genes characteristic of human Call were uniquely identified in KIMAP tumors, including hepsin, maspin, Nkx3.1, CD10 and PSP94 (similar to PSA), etc. The differences between these two CaP models are attributed to the introduction of a single endogenous knock-in mutation. Due to the similarities between human CaP tumors and the PSP-KIMAP tumors, this preclinical model may supplement the current transgenic models to study Cap more accurately.

The experiment compared brain responses (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) while participants listened to classical music and scrambled versions of that same music. The scrambled versions disrupted musical structure while holding low-level musical attributes constant, including such psychoacoustic parameters as pitch, loudness, and timbre. Comparing music to its scrambled counterpart, we found focal activation in the pars orbitalis region (Brodmann Area 47) of the left inferior frontal cortex, a region that has been previously closely associated with the processing of linguistic structure in spoken and signed language, and additional activation in the right hemisphere homologue of that area. We speculate that this particular region of inferior frontal cortex may be more generally responsible for processing fine-structured stimuli that evolve over time, not merely those that are linguistic.

Despite evidence that receptors derived from selected mutated alleles cannot support TGFbeta signal propagation, cells derived from individuals heterozygous with respect to these mutations did not show altered kinetics of the acute phase response to administered ligand. Furthermore, tissues derived from affected individuals showed increased expression of both collagen and connective tissue growth factor, as well as nuclear enrichment of phosphorylated Smad2, indicative of increased TGFbeta signaling. These data definitively implicate perturbation of TGFbeta signaling in many common human phenotypes, including craniosynostosis, cleft palate, arterial aneurysms, congenital heart disease and mental retardation, and suggest that comprehensive mechanistic insight will require consideration of both primary and compensatory events.

Using both a novel monoclonal antibody and LacZ knock-in mice, we demonstrate that alsin is widely expressed in neurons of the CNS, including the cortex, brain stem and motor neurons of the spinal cord. Interestingly, the highest levels of alsin are found in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, a brain region not previously implicated in ALS2. During development, alsin is expressed by day E9.5, but CNS expression does not become predominant until early postnatal life. At the subcellular level, alsin is tightly associated with endosomal membranes and is likely to be part of a large protein complex that may include the actin cytoskeleton. ALS2 is present in primates, rodents, fish and flies, but not in the nematode worm or yeast, and is more highly conserved than expected among mammals. Additionally! the product of a second, widely expressed gene, ALS2 C-terminal like (ALS2CL), may subserve or modulate some of the functions of alsin as an activator of Rab and Rho GTPases.

Here, we report a similar pattern of peripherin expression in the brains of both mice treated with systemic injections of kainic acid (KA) and in peripherin transgenic mice (Per mice) over-expressing the normal peripherin gene under its own promoter. Double-immunofluorescence labeling revealed a partial co-localization of peripherin with the microtubule-associated protein MAP2, but not with neurofilament proteins. Electrophysiological studies revealed that synaptic plasticity was markedly altered in Per mice: in CA1. long-term potentiation (LTP) was decreased in Per slices (+29 +/- 2.0%, vs. +58 +/- 5.4%, in WT); while in CA3, LTP was increased in Per (+63 +/- 3.5% vs. +43 +/- 2.4.0%). In the hippocampus of Per mice, the levels of MAP2 were decreased, though synaptophysin and PSD95 remained unchanged. These intriguing findings suggest a role of peripherin in the alteration of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The anti-nociceptive effects of intrathecal (i.t.) pretreatment with various mGlu receptor agonists and antagonists were assessed in Long Evans rats with mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity after sub-dermal injection of capsaicin in the hindpaw. Selective group II (aminopyrrolidine-2R,4R-dicarboxylate, APDC) and group III (L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate, L-AP4) agonists, as well as selective mGlu(1) (1-aminoindan-1,5(R,S)-dicarboxylic acid, AIDA) and mGlu(5) (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine, MPEP) receptor subtype antagonists were compared with that of an NMDA receptor antagonist (dizocilipine maleate, MK-801). The rats were observed for signs of capsaicin-induced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity 15 min after capsaicin injection, and 20 min following i.t. drug administration. Results indicate there was a dose-dependent reduction in capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity for all mGlu receptor agents; with maximal increases in mechanical thresholds that were 7-fold for AIDA and APDC, 7.5-fold for L-AP4 and 5.6-fold for MPEP. However, only a weak reduction (often non-significant) in thermal hypersensitivity was observed with each of the mGlu receptor drugs; thermal latencies were maximally increased by 125% (AIDA), 0% (MPEP), 8% APDC and 205% (L-AP4). By contrast, the highest dose of MK-801 was able to significantly reduce both mechanical (maximal 6.67-fold increase in threshold) and thermal (maximal 3-fold increase in latencies) hyperalgesia. We conclude that mGlu receptors contribute to the development of mechanical allodynia, but not thermal hyperalgesia, following capsaicin injury; while iGluRs may contribute to both thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity.

J	Auger, N; Kofman, O; Kosatsky, T; Armstrong, B				Auger, N; Kofman, O; Kosatsky, T; Armstrong, B			Low-level methylmercury exposure as a risk factor for neurologic abnormalities in adults	NEUROTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						methylmercury compounds; mercury poisoning; nervous system; tremor; Aborigines; risk factors; regression analysis	REGRESSION-MODELS; MERCURY EXPOSURE; TREMOR; QUEBEC	Methylmercury is a neurotoxicant that bio-accumulates in the aquatic food chain and is present in all fish. Little is known about the effects of long-term low-dose exposure to methylmercury in adults. The aim of this study was to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists between long-term methylmercury exposure and neurological abnormalities in aboriginal Quebec Cree adults for whom fish is a dietary staple. We re-analysed data from a 1977 cross-sectional study conducted by Kofman and collaborators on a group of Quebec Cree individuals claiming ill health from local fish consumption. In the original 1977 study, 306 adult participants aged 18-82 years were assessed for methylmercury exposure. Tremor and other neurologic outcomes were assessed with a clinical examination. The investigators did not find clinical evidence of methylmercury intoxication based on an analysis of covariance. We used ordinal regression to obtain odds ratios for the relationship between total hair mercury levels and neurologic abnormalities. Hair mercury concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 46 ppm (parts per million). A 6 ppm increase in hair mercury was associated with increasing levels of tremor (OR, 2.22; 95%CL 1. 15-4.26) in adults under 40 years of age. There was no association with nine other outcomes considered, nor with tremor among older persons. Odds ratios were not influenced by gender, smoking, alcohol use, or co-morbidity. Conclusion: Dose-dependent effects of methylmercury on tremor may occur below the commonly accepted 50 ppm threshold, particularly in young adults. These effects may be detectable by clinical examination. However the results should be interpreted with caution given that alcohol use was probably under-reported and that multiple outcomes were studied. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The study population consisted of 110 preschool Inuit children from Nunavik (Canada). Blood Hg, PCBs and Pb concentrations were measured at birth (cord blood) and at the time of testing. Gross motor functions were evaluated and a neurological examination was performed. Fine neuromotor performance was assessed using quantitative measures of postural hand tremor, reaction time, sway oscillations, as well as alternating and pointing movements. Potential covariates were documented including demographic and familial characteristics, other prenatal neurotoxicants (alcohol, tobacco) and nutrients (selenium (Se), Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA)). Hierarchical multivariate regression analyses were performed, controlling for significant covariates. Gross motor development was not linked to prenatal exposures. However, significant associations were observed between blood Pb concentration at testing time and changes in reaction time, sway oscillations, alternating arm movements and action tremor. For some of these outcomes, neuromotor effects of Pb exposure are observed at blood concentrations below 10 mu g/dl. Negative effects of PCBs on neuromotor development were not clearly observed, neither were the potential beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA and selenium. Tremor amplitude was related to blood Hg concentrations at testing'time, which corroborate an effect already reported among adults. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Several types of relationships can be modeled in a unified way using fuzzy mathematical morphology. Their combination benefits from the powerful framework of fuzzy set theory for fusion tasks and decision making.

Recent work extended Markov models to the case of latent states because frequently psychological states are not directly observable and subject to measurement error. This article presents a further generalization of latent Markov models to allow for the analysis of rating data that are collected at arbitrary points in time. This extension offers new ways of investigating change processes by focusing explicitly on the durations that are spent in latent states. In an experience sampling application the author shows that such duration analyses can provide valuable insights about chronometric features of emotions.

The goal of this study was to determine if the cytoarchitecture of the dorsocentral portion of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), was male-typical in female Japanese macaques drawn from one such population. The AHdc is located in the medial preoptic anterior hypothalamus (MPO-AH), a region of the brain that is known to regulate sexual behaviour in primates. Despite their potential for male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preference, our female subjects did not possess male-typical AHdc. The AHdc was significantly larger in males than it was in females, a difference that could be attributed to the significantly larger number of neurons in the male AHdc compared to that of the females. The AHdc of female Japanese macaques were no more male-typical in size than those of female rhesus macaques, a closely related sister species in which females rarely exhibit male-typical sexual behaviour. Although the AHdc may be involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour, this study indicates that a male-typical AHdc is not a prerequisite for the expression of male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preference in Japanese macaques. This study is the first to examine the relationship between sex-atypical sexual activity and the cytoarchitecture of a hypothalamic nucleus in hormonally unmanipulated females. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

ELEGANS; DOMAIN; GABA; IDENTIFICATION; SUPERFAMILY; REVEALS	The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a surprisingly large and diverse superfamily of genes encoding Cys loop ligand-gated ion channels. Here we report the first cloning, expression, and pharmacological characterization of members of a family of anion-selective acetylcholine receptor subunits. Two subunits, ACC-1 and ACC-2, form homomeric channels for which acetylcholine and arecoline, but not nicotine, are efficient agonists. These channels are blocked by D-tubocurarine but not by a-bungarotoxin. We provide evidence that two additional subunits, ACC-3 and ACC-4, interact with ACC-1 and ACC-2. The acetylcholine-binding domain of these channels appears to have diverged substantially from the acetylcholine-binding domain of nicotinic receptors.

It is shown here that the murine runt-related gene Runx1 is expressed in proliferating cells on the basal side of the olfactory epithelium. These include both Mash1 + olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) progenitors and NeuroD + ORN precursors. Disruption of Runx1 function in vivo does not cause a change in Mash1 expression but leads to a decrease in the number of NeuroD + neuronal precursors and an increase in differentiated ORNs. These effects result in premature and ectopic ORN differentiation. It is shown further that exogenous Runx1 expression in cultured olfactory neural progenitors causes an expansion of the mitotic cell population. In agreement with these findings, exogenous Runx1 expression also promotes cortical neural progenitor cell proliferation without inhibiting neuronal differentiation. These effects are phenocopied by a chimeric protein containing ETO, the eight twenty one transcriptional repressor, fused to the Runx1 DNA-binding domain, which suggests the involvement of transcription repression mechanisms. Consistent with this possibility, Runx1 represses transcription driven by the promoter of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1) in cortical progenitors. Together, these findings suggest a previously unrecognized role for Runx1 in coordinating the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of selected populations of neural progenitors.

Their physiological effects are mediated through the activation of their receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA). This receptor is a member of the membrane guanylyl cyclase family and catalyzes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production following its activation. To map the binding site of human NPRA, we applied the methionine proximity assay method to this receptor. We photolabeled NPRA mutants, presenting a single methionine in the binding domain of the receptor, and used benzoylphenylalanine- (Bpa-) substituted peptides at positions 0, 3, 18, 26, and 28 of the ligand. We identified that the N-terminus of the peptide is interacting with the region between Asp(177) and Val(183) of the receptor. Arg(3) is interacting in the vicinity of Phe(172). Leu(18) binds close to Val(116). Phe(26) binds in the vicinity of His(195), and the C-terminal Tyr(28) is located close to Met(173). We next proceeded with photolabeling of a dual Bpa-substituted peptide and showed that the N-terminus and Leu(18) interact with opposite receptor subunits. On the basis of our results, a molecular model of peptide-bound NPRA was developed by homology modeling with the C-type natriuretic peptide(CNP-) bound natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPRC) crystal structure. The model has been validated by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work provides a rational basis for interpreting and predicting natriuretic peptide binding to the human NPRA.

Methods: Subjects were children with AIS/TIA occurring < 1 year after varicella, ischemic localization consistent with unilateral disease affecting the supraclinoid internal carotid artery or proximal anterior or middle cerebral arteries, and no identified AIS/TIA etiology other than PVA. Charts, brain MRI, and sequential cerebral vessel imaging (selective cerebral angiography or MR angiography [SCA/MRA]) were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Twenty-three children had varicella at age 1.0 to 10.4 years and had single or multiple AIS/TIAs 4 to 47 weeks later. Initial SCA/MRA was performed within 1 month of presentation, and each child had one to five repeat SCA/MRAs during a 4- to 87-month period. There was vascular stenosis in 19 children, maximal on initial studies in 15 of these. Subsequent stenosis regression occurred in 17 children. In 11 of these, one or two additional SCA/MRAs showed further regression as long as 48 months after presentation; there was no restenosis. Eight of 23 children had recurrent AIS/TIA with antithrombotic therapy within 33 weeks of presentation, including 1 of 17 children with documented stenosis regression. Conclusion: Vascular stenosis of childhood post-varicella arteriopathy takes a monophasic course, generally with subsequent stenosis regression and only occasional stenosis progression after arterial ischemic stroke/TIA. Arterial ischemic stroke/TIA rarely recurs with antithrombotic prophylaxis after stenosis regression occurs.

To further investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, a human brain cDNA library was screened for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of NHE5 by using yeast two-hybrid methodology. One candidate cDNA identified by this procedure encoded beta-arrestin2, a specialized adaptor/scaffolding protein required for internalization and signaling of members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Direct interaction between the two proteins was demonstrated in vitro by GST fusion protein pull-down assays. Sequences within the N-terminal receptor activation-recognition domain and the C-terminal secondary receptor-binding domain of beta-arrestin2 conferred strong binding to the C terminus of NHE5. Full-length NHE5 and beta-arrestin2 also associated in intact cells, as revealed by their coimmunoprecipitation from extracts of transfected CHO cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of both proteins caused a redistribution of beta-arrestin2 from the cytoplasm to vesicles containing NHE5, and significantly decreased the abundance of the transporter at the cell surface. Comparable results were also obtained for the beta-arrestin1 isoform. These data reveal a broader role for arrestins in the trafficking of integral plasma membrane proteins than previously recognized.

Design Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration's register of controlled trials (November 2004) for trials produced by the Cochrane depression, anxiety, and neurosis group. Selection of studies Studies had to be randomised controlled trials comparing an SSRI with either placebo or an active non-SSRl control. We included clinical trials that evaluated SSRIs for any clinical condition. We excluded abstracts, crossover trials, and all trials whose follow up was less than one week. Results Seven hundred and two trials met our inclusion criteria. A significant increase in the odds of suicide attempts (odds ratio 2.28, 95% confidence 1. 14 to 4.55, number needed to treat to harm 684) was observed for patients receiving SSRIs compared with placebo. An increase in the odds ratio of suicide attempts was also observed in comparing SSRIs with therapeutic interventions other than tricyclic antidepressants (1.94, 1.06 to 3.57, 239). In the pooled analysis of SSRIs versus tricyclic antidepressants, we did not detect a difference in the odds ratio of suicide attempts (0.88, 0.54 to 1.42). Discussion Our systematic review, which included a total of 87 650 patients, documented an association between suicide attempts and the use of SSRIs. We also observed several major methodological limitations in the published trials. A more accurate estimation of risks of suicide could be garnered from investigators fully disclosing all events.

Studies investigating genetic factors increasing suicide predisposition have been limited by current knowledge of the suicide neurobiology and have typically investigated one or a few genes at a time, whereas it is anticipated that several genes account for the total genetic variance mediating suicide. This review focuses on the advantages and the interest of using the microarray technology to investigate the neurobiology of suicide and discusses, by means of a data analysis example, the possible methodological problems and bioinformatic strategies that should be employed in order to separate the signal from the large amount of background noise, which is usually generated in such studies. Microarray expression studies and related platforms are promising tools to gain better insight into the neurobiology of suicide. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Achim, AM; Lepage, M				Achim, AM; Lepage, M			Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex involvement in memory post-retrieval monitoring revealed in both item and associative recognition tests	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; post-retrieval monitoring; memory	EPISODIC MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CUED-RECALL; FMRI; ACTIVATION; HUMANS; ROLES; RECOLLECTION; DISSOCIATION	Post-retrieval monitoring is a process that contributes to episodic memory retrieval by allowing people to evaluate the relevance of retrieved information in relation to the task requirements. Previous studies have suggested that post-retrieval monitoring is supported by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate involvement of the DLPFC in post-retrieval monitoring in two different recognition tests (item recognition and associative recognition). The item recognition memory test required subjects to make old/new judgments and the associative recognition memory test required them to make intact/rearranged judgments. Because the post-retrieval monitoring demand increases during old (hits) relative to new (correct rejections) item recognition trials, and also during rearranged (correct rejections) relative to intact (hits) associative recognition trials, we evaluated the brain activation associated with the interaction of Memory test (item versus associative) by Recognition trial (hit versus correct rejection). As expected, the DLPFC was activated in this interaction as well as for both old relative to new item recognition trials and rearranged relative to intact associative recognition trials. This study provides strong evidence that DLPFC activation supports post-retrieval monitoring across different types of recognition tasks. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Using an RT-PCR based strategy, we have identified Regulator of G-protein Signaling 5 (RGS5) as being up-regulated in the atria of TG4 mice. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that RGS5 levels were 3 fold higher in the atria of TG4 mice. Western blot analysis of a panel of rat tissues demonstrated that basal expression of RGS5 protein was confined to the heart and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, RGS5 protein was detected in skeletal muscle C2C12 and cardiomyocyte HL-1 cultured cell lines. As observed for RGS5 mRNA levels in TG4 mice, RGS5 protein levels were increased in the atria of rats that were administered the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol during a 14 day period. Taken together, these results indicate that RGS5 is a housekeeping RGS in the heart and in skeletal muscle while its beta adrenergic-mediated induction in the atrium suggests that it also has a highly specialized function.

The APP23 mice were distinguishable from controls by pathological limb reflexes, myoclonic jumping. seizure activity, and tail malformation. In addition, this mouse model of Alzheimer's disease was also marked by a crooked swimming trajectory. APP23 mice were also of lighter weight and were less inclined to stay immobile during a transfer arousal test. Despite the neurologic signs. APP23 transgenic mice were not deficient in stationary, beam. coat-hanger. and rotorod tests, indicating intact motor coordination abilities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The dopamine ( DA) projection to the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC) plays an important role in mediating stress responsivity and is thought to be involved also in regulating sensorimotor gating. In the present study, we compared prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle as well as the left and right mPFC DA stress responses in the adult offspring of high- and low-licking/ grooming (LG) dams. Our data indicate that the offspring of low- LG animals are impaired on measures of PPI compared with high- LG animals. We also observed in low- LG animals a significant blunting of the mPFC DA stress responses that was lateralized to the right hemisphere, whereas in high- LG animals, the left and right mPFC DA stress responses were equally attenuated. Although mPFC levels of DA transporter did not differ between the two groups of animals, mPFC levels of catechol-O-methyl transferase immunoreactivity of low- LG animals were significantly lower than those of high- LG animals. These data provide evidence that variations in maternal care can lead to lasting changes in mPFC DA responsivity to stress and suggest the possibility that such changes in mesocorticolimbic DA function can also lead to deficits in sensorimotor gating.

Methods: The study prospectively included 273 patients with first-ever single uncomplicated ischemic stroke. In the stroke unit, nurses scored crying, overt sadness, and apathy daily using an observational method to include patients with comprehension deficits. The Barthel Index was used to assess disability. Follow-up evaluation at months 3 and 12 included psychiatric assessment based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. Results: Crying (19.8%), overt sadness (50.5%), and apathy (47.6%) were observed. Of the patients observed crying, 4 showed pathologic crying, 19 emotionalism, and 12 catastrophic reactions. Crying and overt sadness, but not apathy, were associated with a subjective experience of depression (p < 0.05). Thirty of 52 (58%) patients observed crying, 12 of 19 (63%) patients with emotionalism, and 5 of 12 (41%) patients with catastrophic reactions developed PSD within the first year. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only severe functional disability (odds ratio [OR], 4.31; 95% CI, 2.41 to 7.69), crying behaviors (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.35 to 5.27), and an age <68 years (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.30 to 4.13) were (p < 0.05) predictors of late PSD development (13% of the variance). Conclusions: In the stroke unit, crying and overt sadness are more reliable indicators of depressed mood than apathy. In patients with first-ever stroke, crying behaviors soon after stroke, a younger age, and severe disability are predictors of poststroke depression occurrence within the first year after stroke onset.

However, molecular mechanisms regulating VSMC Mg2+ remain unknown. Using biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic tools, the role of transient receptor potential membrane melastatin 7 (TRPM7) cation channel in VSMC Mg2+ homeostasis was evaluated. Rat, mouse, and human VSMCs were studied. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting demonstrated TRPM7 presence in VSMCs ( membrane and cytosol). Angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone increased TRPM7 expression. Gene silencing using small interfering RNA ( siRNA) against TRPM7, downregulated TRPM7 (mRNA and protein). Basal [Mg2+](i), measured by mag fura-2AM, was reduced in siRNA-transfected cells (0.39+/-0.01 mmol/L) versus controls (0.54+/-0.01 mmol/L; P<0.01). Extracellular Mg2+ dose-dependently increased [Mg2+](i) in control cells (E-max 0.70&PLUSMN;0.02 mmol/L) and nonsilencing siRNA-transfected cells (E-max 0.71&PLUSMN;0.04 mmol/L), but not in siRNA-transfected cells (E-max 0.5&PLUSMN;0.01 mmol/L). The functional significance of TRPM7 was evaluated by assessing [Mg2+](i) and growth responses to Ang II in TRPM7 knockdown cells. Acute Ang II stimulation decreased [Mg2+](i) in control and TRPM7-deficient cells in a Na+-dependent manner. Chronic stimulation increased [Mg2+](i) in control, but not in siRNA-transfected VSMCs. Ang II-induced DNA and protein synthesis, measured by (3)[H]-thymidine and (3)[H]-leucine incorporation, respectively, were increased in control and nonsilencing cells, but not in TRPM7 knockdown VSMCs. Our data indicate that VSMCs possess membrane-associated, Ang II-, and aldosterone-regulated TRPM7 channels, which play a role in regulating basal [Mg2+](i), transmembrane Mg2+ transport and DNA and protein synthesis. These novel findings identify TRPM7 as a functionally important regulator of Mg2+ homeostasis and growth in VSMCs.

Here, we compared axon growth when neuronal cell bodies or injured axons were treated with a cell-permeable Rho antagonist (C3-07) in vitro and in vivo. In neurons plated in compartmented cultures, application of C3-07 to either cell bodies or distal axons promoted axonal growth on myelin-associated glycoprotein substrates. In vivo, an injection of C3-07 into the eye promoted regeneration of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the optic nerve after microcrush lesion. Delayed application of C3-07 promoted RGC growth across the lesion scar. Application of C3-07 completely prevented RGC cell death for 1 week after axotomy. To investigate the mechanism by which Rho inactivation promotes RGC growth, we studied slow axonal transport. Reduction in slow transport of cytoskeletal proteins was observed after axotomy, but inactivation of Rho did not increase slow axonal transport rates. Together, our results indicate that application of a Rho antagonist at the cell body is neuroprotective and overcomes growth inhibition but does not fully prime RGCs for active growth.

Study design: Forty-eight children who were born between 1991 and 1999 were included in this study on the basis of abnormal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry. Prenatal isthmus blood flow index was obtained by dividing the sum of the systolic and diastolic Doppler blood flow velocity integrals by the systolic blood flow integrals. Neurodevelopmental outcome between 2 and 5 years was classified as optimal, when neurologic assessment and developmental quotient were within normal limits and as nonoptimal when abnormal neurologic findings and/or a nonoptimal developmental quotient was present. Neurodevelopmental outcome was analyzed in relation to isthmus flow index and pulsatility indices in the umbilical artery. Results: The mean gestational age at delivery was 33.0 +/- 2 weeks. Nonoptimal neurodevelopmental outcome was found in 60.4% of the children (29/48). An inverse correlation was found between the isthmus blood flow index and postnatal neurodevelopmental outcome. All 13 children with an isthmus blood flow index of <0.5 were in the nonoptimal group. All 19 children with an optimal outcome had an isthmus blood flow index of >0.5, but this was also the case for 16 other children with nonoptimal neurodevelopmental outcome. An isthmus blood flow index cut-off value of 0.70 was associated with the highest overall positive and negative predictive values. The pulsatility index in the umbilical artery did not provide any significant contribution in the explanation of the outcome. Conclusion: The isthmic blood flow index can help to identify a subgroup of fetuses with placental circulatory insufficiency that might benefit from early delivery. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The bispectral index (BIS) suddenly decreased from values of 45-50 to 0 during distal grafting. Neurologic evaluation after immediate tracheal extubation in the operating room was normal and the 58 yr old patient did not suffer any neurologic sequelae. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged 5 days after surgery. Cerebral hypoperfusion is a possible complication during OPCAB. BIS monitoring in OPCAB could be an indicator of cerebral hypoperfusion.

We designed this study to compare the pharmacodynamics of cisatracurium in OPMD patients versus a control group. Forty patients were enrolled: 20 OPMD patients requiring general anesthesia for cricopharyngeal myotomy and 20 age-matched controls undergoing an operation of similar duration and expected blood loss. Anesthesia was standardized, and both groups received a bolus of cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg. Onset time, time to 10% T1 recovery, and the intervals 10%, 25% and 25%-75% were calculated for both groups. A subgroup analysis was performed in patients with a more severe form of OPMD. Demographic and intraoperative data were similar. Onset time was significantly longer in OPMD patients compared with the control group (4.6 +/- 1.5 min versus 3.4 +/- 1.0 min; P = 0.001). There was no difference in recovery times or indices between groups, regardless of the severity of the disease. In conclusion, there was no difference in the duration of a cisatracurium-induced neuromuscular block between OPMD patients and a control group. A delayed onset of action of the drug may occur.

In this study, we compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cisatracurium after a prolonged infusion in patients with or without CAT. Thirty patients undergoing intracranial surgery were enrolled in the study: 15 patients under CAT (carbamazepine and phenytoin, Group A) and 15 controls receiving no anticonvulsant therapy (Group C). Anesthesia was standardized and both groups received a bolus of cisatracurium followed by an infusion to maintain a 95% twitch depression. A steady-state was obtained and the infusion was kept constant for 2 additional hours. Neuromuscular blockade was then allowed to spontaneously recover. Blood samples were taken for measurement of cisatracurium plasma concentration during the steady-state period (Cp(ss)95) and at various times during recovery. Demographic and intraoperative data were similar. CAT resulted in faster 25% and 75% recovery of the first twitch. The rate of infusion of cisatracurium needed to maintain a 95% twitch depression at steady-state was 44% faster in Group A (P < 0.001). The clearance of cisatracurium was significantly faster in Group A when compared with Group C (7.12 &PLUSMN; 1.87 versus 5.72 &PLUSMN; 0.70 L . kg(-1) . min(-1), P = 0.01). The Cp(ss)95 was also significantly larger in Group A (191 &PLUSMN; 45 versus 159 &PLUSMN; 36 ng/mL, P = 0.04). In addition, patients receiving CAT had a 20% increase in the clearance of cisatracurium that, in turn, resulted in a faster recovery of neuromuscular blockade after an infusion of the drug. Also, patients under CAT had a 20% increase in their Cp(ss)95, indicating an increased resistance to the effect of cisatracurium.

There is some evidence that RBD patients have more of slow-wave sleep (SWS) than healthy elderly subjects. No study has looked at quantitative electroencephalogram analysis during non-R-EM sleep in either primary or secondary, RBD. The aim of this study was to assess the increase of SWS and to analyze different electroencephalographic frequency ranges during non-REM sleep in 28 idiopathic RBD patients compared with 28 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Idiopathic RBD patients spent more time in SWS (men: 1.4%; women: 5.9%) than control subjects (men: 0.4%; women: 0.6%: p = 0.004). Spectral analyses demonstrated that idiopathic RBD patients had increased all-night delta power in comparison with control subjects (p = 002). This study shows an increase of SWS and power in the delta band during non-REM sleep in idiopathic RBD patients compared with control subjects. Results are discussed about the possible nigrostriatal dopaminergic impairment in RBD patients and the association between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders.

To examine the in vivo effects of PD0200347, an alpha(2)delta ligand of voltage-activated Ca(2+)hannels and a compound chemically related to pregabalin and gabapentin, on the development of cartilage structural changes in an experimental dog model of osteoarthritis (OA). The effects of PD-0200347 on the major pathways involved in OA cartilage degradation, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), were also studied. Methods. OA was surgically induced in dogs by sectioning the anterior cruciate ligament. OA dogs were randomly distributed into 3 groups and treated orally with either 1) placebo, 2) 15 mg/kg/day of PD-0200347, or 3) 90 mg/kg/day of PD-0200347. Dogs were killed 12 weeks after surgery. The severity of the lesions was scored macroscopically and histologically. Cartilage specimens from the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus were processed for RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunohistochemistry. Specific probes and antibodies were used to study the messenger RNA and protein levels of iNOS, MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13. Results. No clinical signs of drug toxicity were noted in the treated animals. Treatment with PD0200347 at both dosages tested (15 and 90 mg/kg/day) reduced the development of cartilage lesions. There was a reduction in the score of lesions, with a statistically significant (P = 0.01) difference when the highest dosage of the drug was administered. The reduction in the score was mainly related to a decrease in the surface size of the lesions. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that PD-0200347 significantly reduced the expression of MMP-13, a key mediator in OA. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that treatment with PD-0200347 significantly reduced the synthesis of all key OA mediators studied. Conclusion. This study demonstrated the efficacy of PD-0200347 in reducing the progression of cartilage structural changes in a dog model of OA. It also showed that this effect is linked to the inhibition of the major pathophysiologic mediators responsible for cartilage degradation.

Affected individuals display a neurobehavioral phenotype that includes a significant impairment in social cognition alongside deficits in attentional control, inhibition and working memory. In contrast, relatively little is known about the trajectory and specificity of any cognitive impairment associated with the fragile X premutation ("carrier-status") (approximately 55-200 repeats). Here, we focus on one aspect of cognition that has been well documented in the fragile X full mutation, namely social cognition. The results suggest that premutation males display a pattern of deficit similar in profile, albeit milder in presentation, to that of the full mutation. However, little evidence emerged for a correlation between CGG repeat length and severity of phenotypic outcomes. The findings are discussed in the context of functional neuroimaging and brain-behaviour-molecular correlates. We speculate that the deficiencies in social cognition are attributable to impairment of neural pathways modulated by the cerebellum. (C) 2004 Elsevire Inc. All rights reserved.

Subjects first heard four-sentence discourse passages ending in ambiguous words and after an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of either 0 or 750 ms, made lexical decisions on first- or second-meaning related visual targets. NBD control subjects, at the 0 ms ISI, only activated contextually appropriate meanings, though significant effects, as a group, were only seen in second-meaning biased contexts. Surprisingly, at the 750 ms ISI, these subjects activated both appropriate and inappropriate meanings in first-meaning biased contexts. With respect to the LHD nonfluent aphasic patients, the majority activated first meanings regardless of context at the 0 ms ISI, though effects for the group were not significant. At the 750 ms ISI, these patients again activated first meanings regardless of context, with significant effects for the group only seen in first-meaning biased contexts. With regard to the RHD patients, the majority activated second meanings regardless of context at the 0 ms ISI and first meanings regardless of context at the 750 ms ISI, though, as a group, the effects were not significant. In light of our previous findings (Grindrod & Baum, 2003, submitted), the present data are interpreted as supporting the notion that damage to the left hemisphere disrupts either lexical access processes or the time course of lexical activation, whereas damage to the right hemisphere impairs the use of context and leads to activation of ambiguous word meanings based on meaning frequency.

Behavioral data and ERPs were recorded in 16 males and 10 females during a recognition memory task for faces. The behavioral data results showed that females performed better than males. Gender differences on ERPs were evidenced over anterior locations and involve the modulation of two spatially and temporally distinct components. These results are in general accordance with the view that males and females differ in the cognitive strategies they use to process information. Specifically, they could differ in their abilities to maintain information over interference and in the processing of the intrinsic contextual attributes of items, respectively, associated with the modulation of two anterior components. These interpretations lend support to the view that processing in females entails more detailed elaboration of information content than in males. Processing in males is more likely driven by schemas or overall information theme. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fifteen patients were assessed for symptoms (SAPS-SANS) and undergone a complete neuropsychological assessment at two sessions. The first session (S1) was carried out within six days after admission, i.e., acute phase and the second (S2) at least two month after hospitalization, i.e., stable phase. The data were analyzed using stepwise regression models in which neuropsychological scores were in entered to predict each dimensional score. This analysis was applied on the S1 and S2 data as well as on the S2 - S1 difference to assess the neuropsychological predictors of clinical changes. Generally, the results replicate the previous associations between neuropsychological and dimensional measures found in stable patients. In addition, this study shows if each dimension appears to rely on a key structure, symptom variations seems to involve changes in the spread of the dysfunction and/or changes in the connectivity between the key and other regions. The results also suggest that functional changes related to some symptoms dimensions occur to compensate for the dysfunction associated with other symptoms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is induced in glial cells following head trauma, suggestive of oxidative stress. We have studied the temporal and spatial effects of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on HO-1 levels following lateral fluid-percussion injury by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In the injured cerebral cortex, maximal HO-1 induction was seen 6 h post-TBI and was maintained for up to 24 h following the insult, while the ipsilateral hippocampus and thalamus showed marked induction at 24 h postinjury. In all three brain regions, little or no HO-1 immunoreactivity was observed on the contralateral side. Astrocytes exhibited positive immunoreactivity for HO-1 in the injured cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, while some neurons and microglia were also immunoreactive in the injured cortex. The administration of NAC 5 min following TBI resulted in a marked reduction in this widespread induction of HO-1, concomitant with a decrease in the volume of injury in all three brain regions. Together, these findings indicate that HO-1 induction is related to both oxidative and injury characteristics of the affected tissue, suggesting that protein expression of this gene is a credible marker of oxidative damage in this model of TBI.

J	Han, F; Bulman, DE; Panisset, M; Grimes, DA				Han, F; Bulman, DE; Panisset, M; Grimes, DA			Neurofilament M gene in a French-Canadian population with Parkinson's disease	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MUTATION; PATHOLOGY	Background: Recently, a single base pair substitution (G1747A) mutation of the neurofilament M (NF-M) gene was reported in a French-Canadian patient with early onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Three unaffected siblings were found to be heterozygotes for the NF-M Gly336Ser mutation but, to date, no other affected PD individuals have been found with a similar mutation. No other individuals with Parkinson's disease and of similar ethnic background have been screened for this mutation. Methods: We screened 102 French-Canadian patients with definite PD and 45 French-Canadian controls for this substitution in the NF-M gene using a PCR-restriction enzyme digestion method. Results: None of the patients or controls carried this mutation. Conclusion: Our results would indicate that this mutation is not common even in a PD population of similar ethnic background and suggest this change represents a rare variant. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that other mutations in this gene could be present.

Rats were treated with the dual metallopeptidase inhibitor, omapatrilat, or the ACE inhibitor, ramipril, for 7 d (1 mg center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1)). Hearts were then isolated and subjected to a zero-flow ischemia and reperfusion (except controls), in the absence or presence of either a B-2-receptor antagonist (Hoe-140), a B-1-receptor antagonist (Lys-Leu(8)-des-Arg(9)-BK), or the GC-A/GC-B-receptor antagonist (HS-142-1). Chronic omapatrilat and ramipril increased the amount of endogenous BK collected upon reperfusion, but only ramipril increased that of des-Arg(9)-BK. Only omapatrilat increased both peak BNP and peak cGMP upon reperfusion, those increases being blocked by Hoe-140. Chronic omapatrilat (but not ramipril) decreased the total noradrenaline and lactate dehydrogenase release during the reperfusion period. Importantly, only omapatrilat improved the functional recovery of the ischemic reperfused heart, with a reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and improved developed left ventricular pressure. All cardioprotective effects of omapatrilat were blocked by Hoe-140 and by HS-142-1, but not by the B-1-receptor antagonist. In conclusion, a chronic treatment with a dual metallopeptidase inhibitor demonstrated a cardioprotective action not observed with an ACE inhibitor in a context of severe ischemia in rat isolated hearts, which was mediated by both endogenous BK and BNP.

To investigate the scope of the problem we systematically searched for definitions in high-ranking medical journals. Methods Literature review of articles on 'syncope', 'neurocardiogenic syncope','neurally mediated syncope', 'orthostatic intolerance', and 'orthostatic hypotension' with these keywords in the title, mainly published in the ten journals with the highest impact in the fields of cardiology, internal medicine, and neurology. Results Syncope, neurocardiogenic syncope, neurally mediated syncope, orthostatic intolerance, and orthostatic hypotension were defined in only 41%, 34%, 26%,38%, and 48% of papers respectively. Definitions, when given, differed considerably among papers. Orthostatic hypotension was most frequently defined, with an increase in number and consistency of definitions after publication of a consensus in 1996. Conclusions Syncope and related conditions proved to be infrequently and inconsistently defined in current medical literature. The lack of consistent terminology is likely to harm medical education, research, and patient care. There is a strong need for a systematic terminology for syncope and related conditions.

J	Saab, ME; Gotman, J				Saab, ME; Gotman, J			A system to detect the onset of epileptic seizures in scalp EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; seizure detection; seizure onset	ORGANIZING NEURAL-NETWORK; AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION; ARTIFACTS	Objective: A new method for automatic seizure detection and onset warning is proposed. The system is based on determining the seizure probability of a section of EEG. Operation features a user-tuneable threshold to exploit the trade-off between sensitivity and detection delay and an acceptable false detection rate. Methods: The system was designed using 652 h of scalp EEG, including 126 seizures in 28 patients. Wavelet decomposition, feature extraction and data segmentation were employed to compute the a priori probabilities required for the Bayesian formulation used in training, testing and operation. Results: Results based on the analysis of separate testing data (360 h of scalp EEG, including 69 seizures in 16 patients) initially show a sensitivity of 77.9%, a false detection rate of 0.86/h and a median detection delay of 9.8 s. Results after use of the tuning mechanism show a sensitivity of 76.0%. a false detection rate of 0.34/h and a median detection delay of 10 s. Missed seizures are characterized mainly by subtle or focal activity, mixed frequencies, short duration or some combination of these traits. False detections are mainly caused by short bursts of rhythmic activity, rapid eye blinking and EMG artifact caused by chewing. Evaluation of the traditional seizure detection method of [Gotman J. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 1990;76:317-24] using both data sets shows a sensitivity of 50.1%, a false detection rate of 0.5/h and a median detection delay of 14.3 s. Conclusions: The system performed well enough to be considered for use within a clinical setting. In patients having an unacceptable level of false detection, the tuning mechanism provided an important reduction in false detections with minimal loss of detection sensitivity and detection delay. Significance: During prolonged EEG monitoring of epileptic patients, the continuous recording may be marked where seizures are likely to have taken place. Several methods of automatic seizure detection exist, but few can operate as an on-line seizure alert system. We propose a seizure detection system that can alert medical staff to the onset of a seizure and hence improve clinical diagnosis. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Participants were presented with semantically related sentence pairs and the terminal word congruence was varied in the second sentence. WM load was varied for the sentence pairs using a modified fan procedure [J.R.. Anderson, Retrieval of propositional information from long-term memory. Cogn. Psychol., 6 (1974) 451-474; JR. Anderson, A spreading activation theory of memory. J. Verbal Learn. Verbal Behav., 22 (1983) 261-295]. ERPs were recorded to the onset of the terminal word (Congruent and Incongruent) for sentence pairs at two level:; of WM load (WML1 and WML2). Behavioral data analysis revealed that reaction times (RTs) increased as a function of WM load (i.e., the an effect). Semantically incongruent words elicited an N400 response. Increased WM load reduced the congruency effect and, importantly.. resulted in a significant delay in N400 peak latency (similar to50 ms). Moreover, the latency delay was correlated with a neuropsychological measure of individual WM capacity. WM load effects on the N400 were interpreted as a result of competing activation in WM, both modulating semantic expectancies and delaying semantic integration. Exploratory source analysis revealed activation in occipital, temporal, and parietal regions. Consistent with prior reports on the N400 and semantic processing, equivalent current dipoles were modeled in the left perisylvian region. Increased WM load led to novel source activation in the left inferior parietal region as well as increased activatior levels in anterior temporal sources. The source modeling results were in agreement with the functional roles typically ascribed to these areas and confirmed that the scalp-recorded WM load effects on the N400 were present within the intracranial generators.

Depression is three times more common in CHD patients than in the general community. It is independently associated with at least a doubling in risk of subsequent cardiac events. Studies also show that it may precede the development of clinically evident CHD by many years. The mechanisms linking depression. and CHD are currently unknown and likely to be complex. In addition to behavioral factors, changes in autonomic regulation., vascular disease of the brain, subchronic inflammation, reduced omega-3 free fatty acid levels, and enhanced platelet responsiveness may all be involved. Only one large clinical trial has attempted to alter CHD prognosis by treating depression. It succeeded in producing a small, but significant reduction in depression symptoms, but had no impact on subsequent CHD events. While debate continues about the causal relationship between CHD and depression, the best treatment strategy to improve prognosis in depressed CHD patients remains intensive modification of standard CHD risk factors in, combination with treatment of depression to improve life quality.

This secondary processing occurs in the glucagon- and MG-producing alpha-cells of the islets of Langerhans and from circulating glucagon. We first characterized the enzymatic activities of MGE in culture media from glucagon and MG-secreting alphaTC1.6 cells as made of a metalloendoprotease and an aminopeptidase. We observed that glucagon is a substrate for N-arginine dibasic convertase (NRDc), a metalloendoprotease, and that aminopeptidase B cleaves in vitro the intermediate cleavage products sequentially, releasing mature MG. Furthermore, immunodepletion of either enzyme resulted in the disappearance of the majority of MGE activity from the culture medium. We found RNAs and proteins corresponding to both enzymes in different cell lines containing a MGE activity (mouse alphaTC1.6 cells, rat hepatic FaO, and rat pituitary GH(4)C(1)). Using confocal microscopy, we observed a granular immunostaining of both enzymes in the alphaTC1.6 and native rat alpha-cells from islets of Langerhans. By immunogold electron microscopy, both enzymes were found in the mature secretory granules of alpha-cells, close to their substrate (glucagon) and their product (MG). Finally, we found NRDc only in the fractions from perfused pancreas that contain glucagon and MG after stimulation by hypoglycemia. We conclude that MGE is composed of NRDc and aminopeptidase B acting sequentially, providing a molecular basis for this uncommon regulatory process, which should be now addressed in both physiological and pathophysiological situations.

Thus, two superimposed gratings drifting in a rightward direction composed plaid stimuli whose global motion direction was perceived as the vector sum of the two components. The first experiment was aimed at comparing the perception of plaid motion when both components were presented to both eyes (dioptic) or separately to each eye (dichoptic). When components of the patterns had identical spatial frequencies, coherent motion was correctly perceived under dioptic and dichoptic viewing condition. However, the perceived direction deviated from the predicted direction when spatial frequency differences were introduced between components in both conditions. The results suggest that motion integration follows similar rules for dioptic and dichoptic plaids even though performance under dichoptic viewing did not reach dioptic levels. In the second experiment, the role of early cortical areas in the processing of both plaids was examined. As convergence of monocular inputs is needed for dichoptic perception, we tested the hypothesis that primary visual cortex (V1) is required for dichoptic plaid processing by delivering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to this area. Ten minutes of magnetic stimulation disrupted subsequent dichoptic perception for approximately 15 min, whereas no significant changes were observed for dioptic plaid perception. Taken together, these findings suggest that V1 is not crucial for the processing of dioptic plaids but it is necessary for the binocular integration underlying dichoptic plaid motion perception.

It has similar skin lesions as observed for EKV, including congenital hyperkeratosis and red patches of variable sizes, shapes, and duration. EKV3 is also characterized by ichthyosis, sensorineural hearing loss, peripheral neuropathy, psychomotor retardation, congenital chronic diarrhea, and an elevation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). To map the disease locus, we performed candidate gene analysis and a genomewide scan to identify a common homozygous region in affected individuals from three non-consanguineous families. Mutations in connexin 31 (GJB3) and connexin 30.3 (GJB4), implicated in previous reports of EKV, and connexin 26 (GJB2), implicated in palmoplantar keratoderma, were unlikely given the lack of shared homozygous haplotypes in the regions surrounding these genes. The most promising region of common homozygosity observed in a 4,600 single-nucleotide polymorphism genome scan was further characterized by using microsatellites. A 6.8-Mb region on chromosome 7 between D7S2539 and rs727708 was found to be homozygous for the same haplotype in all affected individuals but not in the parents or an unaffected sibling. This region contains connexin 31.3 (GJE1), and although no mutation have been observed in the coding region of this gene, further analyses are required in order to exclude it. Identification of the gene responsible for this disorder will provide insights into the etiology of this multisystemic disorder.

It is traditionally considered a pure lower motoneuron disorder, for which a current definitive diagnosis is now possible by molecular genetic testing. We report two newborns with a clinical phenotype consistent with that of spinal muscular atrophy type I and nerve conduction studies and electromyography suggesting more extensive sensory involvement than classically described with spinal muscular atrophy. Molecular testing confirmed spinal muscular atrophy in patient 1 but not in patient 2. Thus, in the setting of a suspected congenital axonal neuropathy, molecular testing might be necessary to distinguish spinal muscular atrophy type I from infantile polyneuropathy.

Infant, mother, and contextual factors were assessed at 3 and 9 months of age, and mothers and infants were observed in teaching interactions at 9 months. Dyads whose interaction was more sensitive and responsive included mothers who were better educated and less anxious at 3 months and reported higher perceived support at 3 months. The findings highlight the importance of maternal education and well-being in the parenting of VLBW infants.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study of 10 MS patients was performed using qMTI. A total of 60 MTI measurements were collected in each patient at a resolution of 2 x 2 x 7 mm. over a range of saturation pulses. The observed T-1 and T-2 were also measured. qMT model parameters were estimated using a voxel-by-voxel fit. Results: A total of 65 T-2-hyper-intense lesions were identified; 53 were also T-1 hypointense. In these black holes, the qMTI-derived semisolid pool fraction F correlated negatively with T-1,T-obs (r(2) = 0. 76; P < 0.0001). The water pool absolute size (PDf) showed a weaker correlation with T-1.obs (positive. r(2) = 0.53: P < 0.0001). The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) showed a similarly strong correlation with F and a weaker correlation with PDf (r(2) = 0. 18: P < 0.04). Conclusion: T-1 increases in chronic black holes strongly correlated with the decline in semisolid pool size, and somewhat less to the confounding effect of edema. MTR was less sensitive than T-1.obs to liquid pool changes associated with edema.

Caveolin-1 is a cholesterol-binding membrane protein involved in cellular cholesterol transport and homeostasis. Evidence presented here demonstrates an up-regulation of caveolin-1 in the hippocampus, which was temporally correlated with an increase in synaptophysin during the reinnervation phase in a mouse model of hippocampal deafferentation. Using an in vitro model of neuronal reactive plasticity, we examined the effect of virally mediated overexpression of caveolin-1 on injured differentiated PC12 cells undergoing terminal remodeling. Three days post lesion, caveolin-1-overexpressing cells revealed increases in synaptophysin and GAP-43, two markers of neurite sprouting and synaptogenesis. Morphologically, caveolin-1-overexpressing cells showed a decrease in primary neurite outgrowth and branching as well as an increase in neurite density. Caveolin-1-overexpressing cells also revealed the presence of terminal swelling and beading along processes, consistent with a possible alteration of microtubules stability. Moreover, a focal enrichment of caveolin-1 immunofluorescence was observed at the bases of axonal and dendritic terminals of mouse primary hippocampal neurons. Altogether, these results indicate that caveolin-1 plays an active role in the regulation of injury-induced synaptic and terminal remodeling in the adult CNS.

Methods: The subjects were 31 healthy individuals (22 to 79 years old) and 10 patients (19 to 70 years old) with a unilateral vestibular deficit owing to surgical resection of an acoustic neuroma. They read a Snellen or an E-chart while their head was passively moved +/- 20 degrees back and forth in the horizontal or vertical direction at one of four frequencies (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 Hz). The DVA score was the difference in the number of lines on the vision chart that could be read with the head passively moved versus with the head immobile. Results: Four healthy subjects had a low DVA score during horizontal head movements at the fastest frequency (2.0 Hz) with the Snellen chart. In patients, DVA scores significantly decreased as head movement frequency increased from 0.5 to 1.0 Hz and from 1.0 to 1.5 Hz, during horizontal and vertical movements, and with both vision charts (p < .001). The DVA scores of healthy subjects were more consistent across three trials with the E-chart than with the Suellen chart at 1.0 and 0.5 Hz (horizontal movements, p < .01) and at 1.5 and 1.0 Hz (vertical movements, p < .01). Conclusions: This study provides new indications on the optimal parameters for the clinical test of DVA. From the results, it is recommended that DVA be tested during horizontal and vertical head movements at a frequency of 1.5 Hz with the E-chart.

Flux refers to variability about an individual's mean score on an interpersonal dimension and was examined for the four poles of the interpersonal circumplex. Pulse and spin refer to variability about an individual's mean extremity and mean angular coordinate on the interpersonal circumplex. Moderate to high temporal stability was found for pulse, spin, and flux in dominant, submissive, agreeable, and quarrelsome behaviors. Neuroticism was a robust predictor of greater spin. Extraversion was a robust predictor of greater flux in agreeable and quarrelsome behaviors. In contrast, Agreeableness was a robust predictor of less flux in quarrelsome behavior and less spin. Flux, pulse, and spin provide reliable additions for describing individual differences which are related to, but not redundant with, five-factor traits. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Twelve laryngectomized participants, all at least 3 years postsurgery, were compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Respiration and swallowing were monitored before, during, and after mastication. No significant differences were found between the laryngectomized and normal control participants in the,, distribution of the respiratory phase in which swallowing occurs, our primary measure of respiratory-swallowing stability. Data suggest that the coupling between the swallowing and respiratory pattern generators is highly stable. Pronounced masticatory- related apnea was observed in 3 of the laryngectomized participants but in none of the controls, suggesting that masticatory/respiratory interactions may become abnormal in these patients.

Venous refocusing for volume estimation (VERVE) exploits the dependency of the spin-spin relaxation rate of deoxygenated blood on the refocusing interval. Interleaved CPMG EPI acquisitions following a train of either tightly or sparsely spaced hard refocusing pulses (every 3.7 or 30 msec, respectively) at matched echo time were used to isolate the blood signal while minimizing the intravascular blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal contribution. The technique was employed to determine the steady-state increase in the CBVv, in the visual cortex (VC) in seven healthy adult volunteers during flickering checkerboard photic stimulation. A functional activation model and a set of previously collected in vitro human whole blood relaxometry data were used to evaluate the intravascular BOLD effect on the VERVE signal. The average VC venous blood volume change was estimated to be 16 +/- 2%. This method has the potential to provide efficient and continuous monitoring of venous cerebral blood volume, thereby enabling further exploration of the mechanism underlying BOLD signal changes upon physiologic, pathophysiologic, and pharmacologic perturbations.

Imprinting of Igf2r, Kcnq1, Gtl2, and Dlk1 varied among individuals. As three of these genes are implicated in cell-cell signaling or cell-environment interactions, variation in their imprinting may influence a wide range of biological processes from cell differentiation to behavior. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the interindividual imprinting variation in the brain, we focused our effort on the paternally expressed gene Dlk1. We investigated expression of Dlk1 in the brains of animals from N-9 and N-10 backcrosses and found that reactivation of the normally silent maternal Dlk1 allele in the N-9 and N-10 mice occurred less often than in N2 x N2 animals. Our data suggest that trans-acting genetic factors of MOLF/Ei origin facilitate the reactivation of the normally silent maternal allele of Dlk1. We mapped one of these factors to the proximal part of Chr 7. The results of bisulfite sequencing methylation analysis show that reactivation of the maternal allele was also associated with hypermethylation of the intragenic differentially methylated region (IG DMR), which is the imprinting control region for the Dlk1-Gtl2 domain. Thus, the imprinting status of Dlk1 in the brain depends upon trans-acting genetic influences and correlates with the methylation status of a specific subregion of the IG DMR.

J	Preuss, R; Fung, J				Preuss, R; Fung, J			Can acute low back pain result from segmental spinal buckling during sub-maximal activities? - A review of the current literature	MANUAL THERAPY			English	Review						low back pain; soft tissue injuries; joint instability	TRUNK MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; LUMBAR SPINE; TRANSVERSUS ABDOMINIS; MUSCULAR STABILIZATION; BIOMECHANICAL MODEL; POSITION SENSE; FRONTAL PLANE; FOLLOWER LOAD; STABILITY; SUDDEN	This paper provides a review of the current literature supporting the hypothesis that segmental spine buckling resulting in tissue damage may be a primary cause of sudden onset low back pain, even during activities that are sub-maximal with respect to loading and muscle activation. While a temporal link exists, it is supported primarily by anecdotal and clinical reports. More pertinent to this review is the biological plausibility of segmental spine buckling as a mechanism of acute injury, supported by modelling studies as well as current knowledge of tissue mechanics and neurophysiology. One antithesis, however, is the low incidence of low back injuries reported during sub-maximal tasks. In order to account for this discrepancy, several predisposing factors are addressed, both constant and situation-dependent, which may contribute to the occurrence of segmental spinal buckling during sub-maximal activities.

In the acute treatment study, CP-93,129 (7 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before the alpha-MTrp injection (30 muCi over 2 min). A single dose of CP-93,129 caused a significant increase in the synthesis in the median raphe nucleus (MR) without a significant influence on the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). There was a reduction in 5-HT synthesis in almost all of the projection areas. In the chronic treatment study, CP-93,129 was administered continuously (7 mg/kg/day) for 14 days using an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously. The chronic treatment with CP-93,129 did not produce a significant change in 5-HT synthesis in the raphe nuclei nor in the nerve terminal structures, except for the medial frontal bundle and the visual and sensory-motor cortices. The unaltered 5-HT synthesis rates in the chronic treatment study probably reflect a normalization of the synthesis as a result of the desensitization of 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors and/or heteroreceptors.

Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) during odor imagery were compared with changes during nonspecific expectation of olfactory stimuli and with those during odor perception. Sixty-seven healthy volunteers were screened for their odor imagery (with a paradigm developed in a previous study), and 12 of them, assessed to be "good odor imagers," participated in the neuroimaging, part of the study. Imagination of odors was associated with increased activation in several olfactory regions in the brain: the left primary olfactory cortical (POC) region including piriform cortex, the left secondary olfactory cortex or posterior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the rostral insula bilaterally. Furthermore, blood flow in two regions within the right orbitofrontal cortex correlated significantly with the behavioral measure of odor imagery during scanning. Overall, the findings indicated that neural networks engaged during odor perception and imagery overlap partially. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Specifically, animal data indicate an analgesic role of NMDA-R antagonists in acute visceral but not acute somatic pain. In humans analgesic effects are documented in acute somatic pain, while the role of NMDA-R antagonists in acute visceral pain is still questionable. We, therefore, conducted a study in humans comparing the analgesic effects of ketamine in an experimental model of visceral and cutaneous pain. In a double-blind, randomized. cross-over study, 11 healthy volunteers (3M, 8F) participated in two experimental sessions in which they evaluated perceptions induced by balloon distention of the distal esophagus and contact heat on the upper chest during continuous computer-controlled i.v. infusion of either ketamine (60 and 120 ng/mL) or saline. Two stimulus intensities producing non-painful and painful sensation were used for each stimulus modality. Subjects reported maximum pain intensity and unpleasantness on visual analog scales (VAS). For noxious visceral stimulation, low dose ketamine produced significant attenuation of both pain intensity and unpleasantness. In contrast, for noxious cutaneous stimulation, ketamine reduced pain unpleasantness, but not perceived intensity. In addition, ketamine did not alter the perception of innocuous stimuli in either modality. Our results confirm the analgesic effects of low-dose ketamine, with minimal side effects. on acute visceral pain and indicate a similar but smaller effect on acute cutaneous pain. A decrease in the unpleasantness but not in the intensity of cutaneous pain may reflect the differential effect of NMDA-R antagonists for the two pain states observed in animal models.

Eighty patient, with diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, post-surgical or post-traumatic neuropathic pain who had volunteered for participation in a clinical trial formed the basis of the present analyses. Spontaneous pain was assessed with the sensory and affective subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Pinprick hyperalgesia and dynamic tactile aliodynia were used as measures of evoked pain. Consistent with previous research, individuals who scored higher on a measure of catastrophic thinking (Pain Catastrophizing Scale; PCS) also rated their pain as more intense, and rated themselves to be more disabled due to their pain. Follow up analyses revealed that the PCS was significantly correlated with the affective subscale of the MPQ but not with the sensory subscale. The helplessness subscale of the PCS was the only dimension of catastrophizing to contribute significant unique variance to the prediction of pain. The PCS was not significantly correlated with measures of evoked pain. Catastrophizing predicted pain-related disability over and above the variance accounted for by pain severity. The findings are discussed in terms of mechanisms linking catastrophic thinking to pain experience. Treatment implications are addressed. (C) 2004 International Association for the Study of Pain.

However, the neural substrate that underlies this improved performance remains to be fully understood. An earlier behavioral study demonstrated that some early-blind people localize sounds more accurately than sighted controls using monaural cues. In order to investigate the neural basis of these behavioral differences in humans, we carried out functional imaging studies using positron emission tomography and a speaker array that permitted pseudo-free-field presentations within the scanner. During binaural sound localization, a sighted control group showed decreased cerebral blood flow in the occipital lobe, which was not seen in early-blind individuals. During monaural sound localization ( one ear plugged), the subgroup of early-blind subjects who were behaviorally superior at sound localization displayed two activation foci in the occipital cortex. This effect was not seen in blind persons who did not have superior monaural sound localization abilities, nor in sighted individuals. The degree of activation of one of these foci was strongly correlated with sound localization accuracy across the entire group of blind subjects. The results show that those blind persons who perform better than sighted persons recruit occipital areas to carry out auditory localization under monaural conditions. We therefore conclude that computations carried out in the occipital cortex specifically underlie the enhanced capacity to use monaural cues. Our findings shed light not only on intermodal compensatory mechanisms, but also on individual differences in these mechanisms and on inhibitory patterns that differ between sighted individuals and those deprived of vision early in life.

Later, androstenedione, pregnenolone and their sulfates and lipid derivatives as well as tetrahydrometabolites of progesterone (P) and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) were identified as neurosteroids. The term "neuroactive steroid" (NAS) refers to steroids which, independent of their origin, are capable of modifying neural activities. NASs bind and modulate different types of membrane receptors. The GABA and sigma receptor complexes have been the most extensively studied, while glycine-activated chloride channels, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, voltage-activated calcium channels, although less explored, are also modulated by NASs. Within the glutamate receptor family, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ANTA) receptors and kainate receptors have also been demonstrated to be a target for steroid modulation. Besides their membrane effects, once inside the neuron oxidation of Ring A reduced pregnanes, THP and THDOC, bind to the progesterone intracellular receptor and regulate gene expression through this path. The involvement of NASs on depression syndromes, anxiety disorders, stress responses to different stress stimuli, memory processes and related phenomena such as long-term potentiation are reviewed and critically evaluated. The importance of context for the interpretation of behavioral effects of hormones as well as for hormonal levels in body fluids is emphasized. Some suggestions for further research are given.

J	Stip, E; Chouinard, S; Boulay, LJ				Stip, E; Chouinard, S; Boulay, LJ			On the trail of a cognitive enhancer for the treatment of schizophrenia	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						cognition; cognitive enhancer; cholinergic system; neuroleptic; schizophrenia	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TEST-PERFORMANCE; TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA; SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY-DISORDER; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PSYCHIATRIC-SYMPTOMS; RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER	The aim of this critical review is to address that the study of cognition and antipsychotics is not always driven by logic and that research into real pro-cognitive drug treatments must be guided by a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive processes and deficits. Many studies have established that typical neuroleptic drugs do not improve cognitive impairment. Atypical antipsychotics improve cognition, but the pattern of improvement differs from drug to drug. Diminished cholinergic activity has been associated with memory impairments. Why atypical drugs improve aspects of cognition might lie in their ability to increase dopamine and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex. An optimum amount of dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is critical for cognitive functioning. Another mechanism is related to procedural learning, and would explain the quality of the practice during repeated evaluations with atypical antipsychotics due to a more balanced blockage of D2 receptors. Laboratory studies have shown that clozapine, ziprasidone, olanzapine, and risperidone all selectively increase acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex, whereas this is not true for haloperidol and thioridazine. A few studies have suggested that cholinomimetics or AChE inhibitors can improve memory functions not only in Alzheimer's disease but also in other pathologies. Some studies support the role of decreased cholinergic activity in the cognitive deficits while others demonstrate that decreased choline acetyltransferase activity is related to deterioration in cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Overall, results suggest the hypothesis that the cholinergic system is involved in the cognitive dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia and that increased cholinergic activity may improve these impairments. Furthermore, a dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission could play a key role in cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Further meta-analysis of various clinical trials in this field is required to account for matters on the grounds of evidence-based medicine. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In a recent longitudinal study of first-episode schizophrenia patients, we found that while dysfunction of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), right thalamus, left cerebellum and cingulate gyrus normalized with antipsychotic treatment and significant reduction in symptomatology, the left DLPFC, left thalamus, and right cerebellum remained disturbed. In the present study we investigated whether these abnormalities are also present in clinically stable, relatively well-functioning schizophrenia patients in comparison to control subjects during performance of the N-back working-memory task. Method. Twelve schizophrenia and 12 control subjects completed the study. The functional images collected during scanning were analyzed using a random-effects model in a restricted set of six regions of interest (ROls). In addition, the exploratory search in the entire brain volume was performed. Results. The ROI analyses revealed relative underactivation in the region of the left DLPFC and the right cerebellum, as well as overactivation in the left cerebellum. The exploratory whole-brain search exposed additional overactivation in the medial frontal, anterior cingulate, and left parietal cortices. Conclusions. The present study provides evidence of significant underactivations in stable schizophrenia patients in regions that we have previously observed to be dysfunctional in acutely psychotic and partially remitted patients, together with extensive overactivations in several regions that potentially reflect some compensatory mechanism or increased effort on the working-memory task.

There is an emerging consensus of a continuous increase throughout adolescence in the volume of white matter, both global and local. There is less agreement on the meaning of asynchronous age-related decreases in the volume of grey matter in different cortical regions; these might equally represent loss ('pruning') or gain (intra-cortical myelination) of tissue. Functional MRI studies have so far focused mostly on executive functions, such as working memory and behavioural inhibition, with very few addressing questions regarding the maturation of social cognition. Future directions for research in this area are discussed in the context of processing biological motion and matching perceptions and actions.

Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay(NMD) degrades abnormal and natural mRNAs that terminate translation sufficiently upstream of a splicing-generated exon-exon junction. Here we describe an mRNA decay mechanism that involves Stau1, the NMD factor Upf1, and a termination codon. Unlike NMD, this mechanism does not involve pre-mRNA splicing and occurs when Upf2 or Upf3X is downregulated. Stau1 binds directly to Upf1 and elicits mRNA decay when tethered downstream of a termination codon. Stau1 also interacts with the 3'-untranslated region of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)1 mRNA. Accordingly, downregulating either Stau1 or Upf1 increases Arf1 mRNA stability. These findings suggest that Arf1 mRNA is a natural target for Stau1-mediated decay, and data indicate that other mRNAs are also natural targets. We discuss this pathway as a means for cells to downregulate the expression of Stau1 binding transcripts.

Current evidence suggests that, for food rewards in rats, this learning process involves the amygdala. However, it remains unclear whether this learning undergoes protein synthesis-dependent consolidation and "reconsolidation" processes in the lateral and basal nuclei of amygdala. Accordingly, we examined this hypothesis by local infusion of protein-synthesis inhibitor after devaluation of a food reward induced by a shift from a food-deprived to a food-sated state in an instrumental conditioning paradigm. Our results show that intra-amygdala infusions of anisomycin, whether given after the initial devaluation or after a second devaluation session, abolished the changes in the value of the food reward produced by incentive learning. This study provides direct evidence that instrumental incentive learning depends on protein synthesis within the amygdala for both consolidation and reconsolidation and extends the demonstrations of protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation to reward-related memories.

The spatiotemporal properties of dendritic Ca2+ signals in hippocampal interneurons are relatively unexplored. Here we use two- photon calcium imaging and whole- cell recordings to study properties of dendritic Ca2+ signals mediated by different glutamate receptors and their regulation by synaptic activity in oriens/ alveus ( O/ A) interneurons of rat hippocampus. We demonstrate that O/ A interneurons express Ca2+- permeable AMPA receptors ( CP- AMPARs) providing fast Ca2+ signals. O/ A cells can also coexpress CP- AMPARs, Ca2+ -impermeable AMPARs ( CI- AMPARs), and group I/ II metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs) ( including mGluR1a), in the same cell. CI- AMPARs are often associated with mGluRs, resulting in longer- lasting Ca2+ signals than CP- AMPAR- mediated responses. Finally, CP- AMPAR- and mGluR- mediated Ca2+ signals demonstrate distinct voltage dependence and are differentially regulated by presynaptic and postsynaptic activity: weak synaptic stimulation produces Ca2+ signals mediated by CP- AMPARs, whereas stronger stimulation, or weak stimulation coupled with postsynaptic depolarization, recruits Ca2+ signals mediated by mGluRs. Our results suggest that differential activation of specific glutamate receptor- mediated Ca2+ signals within spatially restricted dendritic microdomains may serve distinct signaling functions and endow oriens/ alveus interneurons with multiple forms of Ca2+- mediated synaptic plasticity. Specific activation of mGluR- mediated Ca2+ signals by coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity fulfills the conditions for Hebbian pairing and likely underlies their important role in long- term potentiation induction at O/ A interneuron synapses.

Methods: Patients were classified into nondemented (ND) and demented ( D) groups according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.), and a group comparison was performed. In the ND patients, a correlation was also performed between local gray matter density and the score on Raven Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM), a test of executive and visuospatial function. Results: In patients with advanced ND-PD vs NCs, atrophic changes were observed in the limbic/paralimbic areas and the prefrontal cortex. In D vs ND patients, atrophic change was observed widely in the limbic/paralimbic system, including the anterior cingulate gyrus and hippocampus as well as the temporal lobe, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and caudate nucleus. The RCPM score was positively correlated with the gray matter density in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus. Conclusions: In patients with Parkinson disease ( PD), atrophic changes occur mainly in the limbic/paralimbic and prefrontal areas. These atrophic changes may be related to the development of dementia in PD.

Methods: Exonic sequencing and single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed on affected individuals. Linkage analysis using microsatellite markers on the X-chromosome was performed on a single pedigree. Western blotting evaluated for loss of filamin A ( FLNA) protein and Southern blotting assessed for any potential chromosome rearrangement in this region. Results: The authors report two familial cases and nine additional sporadic cases of the EDS-variant form of PH, which is characterized by nodular brain heterotopia, joint hypermobility, and development of aortic dilatation in early adulthood. MRI typically demonstrated bilateral nodular PH, indistinguishable from PH due to FLNA mutations. Exonic sequencing or SSCP analyses of FLNA revealed a 2762 delG single base pair deletion in one affected female. Another affected female harbored a C116 single point mutation, resulting in an A39G change. A third affected female had a 4147 delG single base pair deletion. One pedigree with no detectable exonic mutation demonstrated positive linkage to the FLNA locus Xq28, an affected individual in this family also had no detectable FLNA protein, but no chromosomal rearrangement was detected. Conclusion: These results suggest that the Ehlers-Danlos variant of periventricular heterotopia ( PH), in part, represents an overlapping syndrome with X-linked dominant PH due to filamin A mutations.

Methods: Preoperative and postoperative neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and chemosensory evaluations were performed in a 39-year-old woman undergoing surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. Results: Preoperative MRIs showed bilateral ( right > left) atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and complete atrophy of the left insula. Evaluation of gustatory function revealed normal suprathreshold intensity estimation, affective evaluation, and detection thresholds but elevated recognition thresholds. A functional neuroimaging study showed activation to stimulation of aversive taste in the left amygdala. Surgical treatment entailed resection from the left medial temporal lobe that included the region of amygdala that had responded to taste. Postoperatively, detection, naming, and intensity estimation for taste remained normal, but the patient was unable to recognize different tastes ( sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). A second evaluation 2.5 years after her surgery revealed no change in taste ability. Conclusion: The anteromedial temporal lobe has an important role in recognizing taste quality.

However, the functional neuroanatomy of DORs has not been mapped in any detail; this is potentially important, because these receptors appear to be primarily cytosolic. Opioid receptors can couple to G(i/o) G proteins, a process that is detected by agonist-stimulated [S-35]guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS) binding. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the distribution of functional DORs, as assessed by [S-35]GTPgammaS autoradiographic labeling in response to the DOR agonist deltorphin II. For comparison, adjacent sections were labeled with [I-125]deltorphin II or the DOR antagonist [I-125]AR-M100613. In all three assays, mu-opioid receptors were blocked pharmacologically. The distributions of [I-125]deltorphin II and [I-125]AR-M100613 were highly correlated but not identical. Deltorphin II increased [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in a concentration-dependent and naltrindole-sensitive manner. The regional [S-35]GTPgammaS response to deltorphin II was only moderately predicted by agonist or antagonist radioligand binding (r = 0.67 and 0.50, respectively). [S-35]GTPgammaS responses to deltorphin II were strongest in the extended striatum (caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle) and cerebral cortex. In contrast, some areas reported to mediate DOR analgesia (brainstem, spinal cord) possessed a much lower [S-35]GTPgammaS response. These findings demonstrate the existence of a partial mismatch between DOR radioligand binding and [S-35]GTPgammaS response. This divergence possibly reflects regional heterogeneity in G-protein receptor coupling, or in the subcellular localization of DOR. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Deletions/mutations in the SMN1 gene are responsible for childhood spinal muscular atrophy, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. While the SMN1 and SMN2 genes are not functionally equivalent, up-regulation of the SMN2 gene represents an important therapeutic target. Consequently, we exploited in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches to characterize the core human and mouse promoters in undifferentiated and differentiated P 19 cells. Phylogenetic comparison revealed four highly conserved regions that contained a number of cis-elements, only some of which were shown to activate/repress SMN promoter activity. Interestingly, the effect of two Sp1 cis-elements varied depending on the state of P19 cells and was only observed in combination with a neighbouring Ets cis-element. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and in vivo DNA footprinting provided evidence for DNA-protein interactions involving Sp, NF-IL6 and Ets cis-elements, whereas transient transfection experiments revealed, complex interactions involving these recognition sites. SMN promoter activity was strongly regulated by an NF-IL6 response element and this regulation was potentiated by a downstream Ets element. In vivo results suggested that the NF-IL6 response must function either via a protein-tethered transactivation mechanism or a transcription factor binding an upstream element. Our results provide strong evidence for complex combinatorial regulation and suggest that the composition or state of the basal transcription complex binding to the SMN promoter is different between undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells.

Most of the microglial cells surrounding these plaques are activated and release a high amount of oxidizing species. In order to develop their toxic effects numerous oxidizing species need iron. To prevent this iron-dependent oxidation an iron-sequestering apparatus exists, including the major iron storage protein ferritin. Microglial cells damage their own protein pool during activation and it is still unknown whether microglial cells are able to maintain their iron-dependent function during oxidative stress. Therefore, we explored the microglial cell line RAW to test the maintenance of ferritin under oxidizing conditions. Our investigations revealed a half-life of both ferritin chains of 3-3.5 h and a reduced half-life due to oxidation. This was due to the removal of oxidized ferritin by the proteasomal system. Ferritin de novo synthesis was also severely affected by oxidation. This results in a decreased ferritin pool due to acute oxidative stress. These data let us conclude that microglial cells do not increase their ferritin amount after oxidative stress and an increase in the iron storage capacity in these cells after treatment might be achieved only by a high iron saturation of the existing ferritin molecules.

This study sought to replicate and extend these findings in a sample of 32 right-handed, healthy volunteers (14 males, 18 females). Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T and an off-line eye movement assessment using infrared oculography at 500 Hz. Separate blocks of prosaccades and antisaccades were carried out (60 trials each). Optimised volumetric voxel-based morphometry (VBM-1) implemented in SPM99 was used to investigate the relationship of saccadic performance measures to regional grey matter volume, covarying for age. A significant negative correlation was obtained between prosaccade spatial error and grey matter volume in the right inferior cerebellar lobe (lobule VIIIB, extending into the vermis, centred at x = 11; y = -64; z = -61), indicating that more grey matter volume in this area was associated with better spatial accuracy. On the antisaccade task, the error rate was significantly negatively correlated with grey matter volume in the right middle frontal gyros (Brodmann area 6) in an area anterior to the frontal eye field (centred at x = 27; y = 18; z = 50), indicating that more grey matter volume in this area was associated with fewer antisaccade errors. These findings extend our previous observations by identifying the relationship between brain structure and saccadic performance on a spatially highly localised scale and support the validity of structural neuroimaging methods in delineating the neural mechanisms underlying human oculomotor control.

Several studies have shown that negative stimuli (e.g., words, pictures) are better remembered than neutral ones. Although facial expressions are powerful emotional stimuli and have been shown to influence perception and attention processes, little is known about their effect on memory. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the effects of expression (happy, neutral, and fearful) on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during the encoding of faces, using a subsequent memory effect paradigm. Our results show that activity in right PFC predicted memory for faces, regardless of expression, while a homotopic region in the left hemisphere was associated with successful encoding only for faces with an emotional expression. These findings are consistent with the proposed role of right dorsolateral PFC in successful encoding of nonverbal material, but also suggest that left DLPFC may be a site where integration of memory and emotional processes occurs. This study sheds new light on the current controversy regarding the hemispheric lateralization of PFC in memory encoding. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the present study, a non-transmembrane isoform of hepsin, named hepsin/-TM that originates from alternative splicing, was identified. Unlike the transmembrane hepsin isoform, this non-transmembrane isoform was distributed within the cytoplasm. Real-time PCR experiments revealed that while hepsin was expressed in all tested human tissues, hepsin/-TM was restricted in kidney, brain and lung tissues. Significantly, hepsin/-TM was not expressed in liver where hepsin was originally identified. However, hepsin/-TM was highly expressed in brain where hepsin was expressed at a relatively lower level. Moreover, these two isoforms showed different expression patterns in a number of colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. In addition, in contrast to hepsin, expression of hepsin/-TM in vivo does not exert any apparent inhibitory effect on mammalian cell growth. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traditional antidepressant treatments target the biogenic amine systems. However. a growing body of evidence is implicating the involvement of neuropeptides in depression, especially the neurokinin substance P. This study evaluated the effects of selective antagonists of the tachykinin NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors in the forced swim test a commonly used screen for antidepressants. Rats were given CP-96,345 (2S, 3S)-cis-2-(diphenylmethyl)-N-[(2-methoxphenl)-methyl]-l-azabicyclo[2.2.2)octan-3-amine. SR 48968 (S)-N-methyl-N[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-butyl]benzamide. or SR 142801 (S)-(N)-(1-(3-(1-benzoyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) piperidin-3-yl) propyl)-4-phenylpiperidin4-yl)-N-methylacetamide, antagonists of the NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors, respectively, at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.). The time of immobility during the forced swim test was used as an indicator of antidepressant activity of the antagonists. All antagonists decreased immobility times. CP-96,345 and SR 142801 showed dose-related effects; SR 48968 had its maximum effect at 2.5 mg/kg. The magnitude of the effects of the neurokinin receptor antagonists, was approximately the same as that of amitriptyline and desipramine, two traditional antidepressants, both given at 10 mg/kg. i.p. This study provides comparative data on the relative effectiveness of NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptor antagonists in this screen for antidepressant drug activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The present study sought to further characterize the reward-relevant functional link between these two regions by assessing changes to the rewarding effectiveness of caudal medial forebrain bundle stimulation (ventral tegmental area, VTA) subsequent to electrolytic lesions of different PM sites. A total of 13 rats were tested, 11 of these at bilateral VTA stimulation sites. Overall, rewarding effectiveness was reduced in five rats and pontentiated in four. The presence and magnitude of the effects were site-, current- and time-dependent, and ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 log 10 unit shifts in reward magnitude, with most effects falling below 0.3 log to units. Generally, these effects became apparent approximately two weeks after the lesion. In addition to these effects, PM lesions placed on or close to the midline also produced small transient reductions in rewarding effectiveness immediately after the lesion, an effect that disappeared within three days. Conversely, lateral PM lesions were associated either with no immediate effects or with small transient potentiations of reward. The finding that lesions of the PM placed on the midline, just off the midline or laterally all altered the rewarding effectiveness of VTA stimulation suggests that the reward-relevant circuitry is distributed diffusely throughout the PM.

In order to confirm these causative mutations in our autistic population and to determine their frequency we screened 96 individuals affected with autism. We found no mutations in these X-linked genes. These results indicate that mutations in NLGN3 and NLGN4 genes are responsible for at most a small fraction of autism cases and additional screenings in other autistic populations are needed to better determine the frequency with which mutations in NLGN3 and NLGN4 occur in autism.

Upper layer neurons labeled by electroporation of plasmid encoding yellow fluorescent protein were observed by confocal microscopy. Time-lapse observation of single-labeled axons showed that axons started to branch after 8 - 10 d in vitro. Over the succeeding 7 - 10 d, branch complexity gradually increased by both growth and retraction of branches, resulting in axon arbors that morphologically resembled those observed in 2- to 3-week-old animals. Electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity in the upper layers, made using multielectrode dishes, showed that the frequency of spontaneous firing increased dramatically similar to 10 d in vitro and remained elevated at later stages. To examine the involvement of spontaneous firing and synaptic activity in branch formation, various blockers were applied to the culture medium. Cultures were silenced by TTX or by a combination of APV and DNQX but exhibited a homeostatic recovery of spontaneous activity over several days in the presence of blockers of either NMDA-type or non-NMDA-type glutamate receptors alone. Axonal branching was suppressed by TTX and AMPA receptor blockade but not by NMDA receptor blockade. We conclude that cortical axon branching is highly dynamic and that neural activity regulates the early developmental branching of upper layer cortical neurons through the activation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors.

Rats received subchronic i.c.v. injections of anti-mu 2 opioid receptor antisense, mismatch or vehicle, and were tested for paw pressure latency following i.c.v. mu opioid receptor agonist ([D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin; DAMGO) or delta opioid receptor agonist ((+)-4-[(aR)-a-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide; SNC80). The anti-mu opioid receptor antisense (but not mismatch) sequence abolished DAMGO-induced antinociception with no reduction in the delta opioid receptor-mediated response. In contrast, postmortem receptor autoradiographic analysis of CNS areas revealed no change in mu opioid receptor functional response ([S-35]GTPgammaS assay) or receptor labelling ([I-125]FK-33824 and mat opioid receptor immunoautoradiography). These results provide further evidence for antisense-induced knockdown at the behavioural level in the absence of clear changes at the tissue level. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More recently, vertebrates were found to possess a second cut orthologs that was generated by gene duplication: Cux2. We report the initial biochemical characterization of the Cux2 protein in tissue culture and in vitro. We generated four polyclonal antibodies that were able to recognize the human and mouse Cux2 protein but displayed little or no cross-reactivity towards CDP1 and Cux1. The expression of the Cux2 protein was convincingly detected in only one among 19 neuronal cell lines: the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line. CDP/Cux proteins contain four DNA binding domains, three Cut repeat (CR1, CR2 and CR3) and one Cut homeodomain (HD). Purified fusion proteins containing either CR1CR2, CR2CR3HD or CR3HD exhibited similar DNA binding specificities as the corresponding domains of Cux1, but their DNA binding kinetics were much more rapid. Similarly, the full-length Cux2 protein made rapid but transient interactions with DNA. We did not observe an N-terminally processed Cux2 isoform equivalent to the Cux1 p110 isoform. Whereas Cux1 can function as a repressor or activator in a promoter-specific manner, Cux2 functioned exclusively as a transcriptional repressor in NIH3T3 cells. Overall, our results suggest that the Cux1 and Cux2 proteins carry distinct biochemical functions. Cux2 is able, like Cux1, to perform the CCAAT-displacement activity. However, Cux2 is unlikely to execute transcriptional regulatory functions that require stable interaction with DNA. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The degree of quenching serves to predict the efficiency with which the conjugates are able to enter living cells. Along with quenching, the presence of specific receptors on the cells is necessary for QD binding, entry, and phototoxicity. Toxicity is manifested by opening of large membrane pores and by oxidative DNA damage, and does not require the release of Cd2+. In bacterial cells. light exposure is necessary for uptake, and procedures to reduce toxicity eliminate labeling. In mammalian cells, antioxidants prevent toxicity but not QD uptake, leading to QD-loaded cells that are nonfluorescent before light exposure. These findings provide a general procedure for rational design of nanoparticle-based photosensitizing drugs and for "off-on" fluorescent labels.

In this paper, we present a new 3D adaptive Wiener filter for restoration of brain SPECT images with a priori data taken from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the same patient.

Based on the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model and, the direct method for robust adaptive design given in [1], this paper deals with robust adaptive control of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems preceded by unknown hysteresis nonlinearity. By utilizing the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model and a neural networks approximator, the robust adaptive control developed ensures that all the close-loop system signals are bounded, and the tracking error converges to a set of adjustable neighborhood of zero independent of initial conditions.

If the dose is too high, it can have physiological effects which can affect the results in longitudinal scanning of animals, particularly in tumour growth models. To calculate the dose received by a mouse during routine microPET scanning, four mice were imaged for 1 hour immediately following the injection of C-11-raclopride. The data was summed into one static frame and used as the tracer distribution input function for an in-house computer package, VMDOSE, based on the MIRD formalism with S factors calculated at the voxel level. The dose calculation requires about 2.5 s, allowing rapid subject specific dosimetry. The output of VMDOSE is an image volume where the voxel values represent absorbed dose. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the PET image for various organs as well as the whole body. These ROIs were applied to the dose distribution data in order to calculate organ-specific doses. The doses ranged from an average of 3.8 mGy/MBq for the brain to 82.8 mGy/MBq gall bladder. The whole body dose average was 5.8 mGy/MBq. For a C-11-raclopride injection of 7.4 MBq (200 mu Ci), this will result in doses of 42.9, 28.1 and 613 mGy to the whole body, brain and gall bladder, respectively.

Here, we study the statistical properties of the WDCTC and compare them with the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). We report some interesting properties of the WDCTC when compared to the MFCC: its statistical distribution is more Gaussian-like with lower variance, it obtains better vowel cluster separability, it forms tighter vowel clusters and generates better codebooks. Further, we employ the WDCTC and MFCC features in a 5-vowel recognition task using Vector Quantization (VQ), 1-Nearest Neighbour (1-NN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) as classifiers. Finally, we discuss the vowel recognition results in the context of the statistical properties of the WDCTC and MFCC. In our experiments, the WDCTC consistently outperforms the MFCC.

In particular, the possibility of image compression using Neural Networks (NNs) has been considered by many researchers in recent years, and several Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs) have been proposed with reported promising experimental results. Constructive One-Hidden-Layer Feedforward Neural Network (OHL-FNN) is one such architecture. We have previously proposed a new constructive OHL-FNN using Hermite polynomials for regression and recognition problems, and good experimental results were demonstrated. In this paper, we first modify and then apply our proposed OHL-FNN to compress still images and investigate its performance in terms of both training and generalization capabilities. Extensive experimental results for still images (Lena, Lake, and Girl) are presented. It is revealed that the performance of the constructive OHL-FNN using Hermite polynomials is quite good.

The proposed architecture is motivated from the following facts: (1) the satellite's attitude dynamics is highly complex and nonlinear, (2) the large volume of data that is generated in the attitude control system has to be monitored in real-time by the ground station operators which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming task, and (3) dynamically driven recurrent neural networks (DDRNN) have been shown to have the ability to learn, recognize and generate complex temporal patterns. To improve the FDI performance accuracy, the proposed architecture is designed to consist of two DDRNNs. The first DDRNN determines and diagnoses the presence of a faulty thruster. The second DDRNN then identifies which thruster is faulty, i.e. it isolates the location of the fault. Extensive simulation results are shown that demonstrate and verify that the proposed two DDRNNs scheme is more efficient and robust as compared to a scheme that is based on a single feed-forward back-propagation neural network or a single DDRNN scheme, especially in the presence of external disturbances and noise.

Stimulation over a muscle is believed to cause direct muscle contraction, but evidence for this is lacking. In this study we sought to determine whether direct muscle stimulation occurred during stimulation of the adductor pollicis in the hand and whether the responses were comparable to those observed with stimulation at the wrist. In 20 patients anesthetized with sevoflurane, 1 pair of stimulating electrodes was positioned over the ulnar nerve at the wrist. A second pair was placed between the first and second metacarpals on the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand. The acceleromyographic response was monitored. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered. Tram-of-four (TOF) stimulations were applied at the wrist site until maximal blockade. Then, stimulation was applied to the hand site. During recovery, both sites were monitored alternately. After injection of rocuronium, 17 of 20 patients showed no twitch response at either site. One patient had a response at both stimulation sites, and two patients had responses only at the wrist site. With a Bland and Altman analysis, TOF ratios during recovery at the hand showed a bias of 0.5% and limits of agreement of +/- 11.8% as compared with the wrist. Stimulation in the hand causes no direct muscle stimulation because the response is no more than that produced by stimulation at the wrist. Both sites yield comparable TOF ratios.

Case Summary: A 53-year-old white man was admitted to the hospital for loss of consciousness secondary to voluntary intoxication with venlafaxine and quetiapine. Several complications were attributable to this intoxication including seizures, prolonged coma, respiratory depression, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, prolonged QRS and QTc intervals, and a possible venlafaxine withdrawal syndrome. Discussion: Quetiapine could be responsible for the neuroleptic malignant syndrome presented in this case. Moreover, venlafaxine intoxication, fever, autonomic instability, and myoclonus presented serotonin syndrome as a differential diagnosis. Potential causes of seizures and prolongation of the QRS and QTc intervals are reviewed. Finally, prolonged coma and late venlafaxine withdrawal are discussed with regard to the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drug elimination in the context of intoxication. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of possible complications following intoxication with atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants, including protracted altered mental status.

Results emanating from both lesion studies and neuroimaging techniques are reviewed and integrated for each of these musical functions. We focus our attention on the common core of musical abilities shared by musicians and nonmusicians alike. Hence, the effect of musical training on brain plasticity is examined in a separate section, after a review of the available data regarding music playing and reading skills that are typically cultivated by musicians. Finally, we address a currently debated issue regarding the putative existence of music-specific neural networks. Unfortunately, due to scarcity of research on the macrostructure of music organization and on cultural differences, the musical material under focus is at the level of the musical phrase, as typically used in Western popular music.

To date, most studies exploring perception of vocal emotions have done so in the context of speech prosody, although nonlinguistic emotional vocalizations represent an important, perhaps more universal, means to express emotions. Here, we explored the perception of emotional nonlinguistic vocalizations in healthy individuals, with an emphasis on potential age- and sex-related differences. Sixty participants rated 563 positive (e.g., laughs, sexual vocalizations), negative (e.g., cries, screams of fear), and neutral vocalizations (e.g., coughs), according to the valence, intensity, and authenticity of the emotion expressed. Ratings were consistent among individuals, suggesting that valence is an adequate measure of emotional categorization. An important effect of age emerged: (a) age by vocalization category interactions were observed for both valence and intensity ratings, and (b) younger participants rated stimuli as more emotional than older individuals (i.e., higher valence for positive, lower for negative, and more intense for both positive and negative). We also found a sex effect in the authenticity ratings: older women rated the vocalizations as less authentic than younger women whereas authenticity judgments did not differ between the two age groups in men. Taken together, these findings suggest that, as previously observed for facial expressions and prosody, the judgments of emotional vocalizations may vary with age.

J	Bateni, H; Maki, BE				Bateni, H; Maki, BE			Assistive devices for balance and mobility: Benefits, demands, and adverse consequences	ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION			English	Review						accidental falls; aging; assistive devices; canes; gait; posture; rehabilitation; walkers	CARPAL-TUNNEL SYNDROME; ANTICIPATORY POSTURAL ADJUSTMENTS; NONWEIGHT-BEARING AMBULATION; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; STANDING BALANCE; FALL PREVENTION; STROKE PATIENTS; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; WEIGHT-BEARING	Objectives: To provide information on the advantages and possible disadvantages of using canes and walkers. Data Sources: English-language articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and PubMed (1966-May 2003) for key words cane or walker, excluding articles unrelated to mobility aids. Bibliographies were reviewed and ISI Web of Science citation searches were run to identify additional references. Over 1000 articles were selected for further evaluation. Study Selection: We extracted all Studies of single-tip canes or pickup walkers addressing: (1) functional, biomechanic, or neuromotor benefits; (2) biomechanic, attentional, neuromotor, metabolic, or physiologic demands; and (3) falls, injuries, or other problems. We included approximately 10% of the articles originally identified. Data Extraction: The methodology of each selected article, and findings relevant to the benefits, demands, or adverse effects of cane or walker use were summarized. Data Synthesis: Findings were synthesized by considering their relation to basic biomechanic principles. Some biomechanic findings appear to support the clinical view that canes and walkers can improve balance and mobility for older adults and people with other clinical conditions. However, a large proportion of users experience difficulties, and the use of such devices is associated with increased risk of falling. A small number of studies have characterized some of the specific demands and problems associated with using mobility aids. Conclusions: Clinical and biomechanic evaluations of canes and walkers confirm that these devices can improve balance and mobility. However, they can also interfere with one's ability to maintain balance in certain situations, and the strength and metabolic demands can be excessive. More research is needed to identify and solve specific problems. Such research may lead to improved designs and guidelines for safer use of canes and walkers.

This work demonstrates that TCAT (Tricomponent Antioxidant Therapy), an association of pyruvate, vitamin E and fatty acids, provides neuronal and cardiac protection in oxidative stress, ex vivo. Mouse P19 neuron cultures were exposed for 30 min to low millimolar H2O2 concentrations in the absence or presence of Fe2+. Concentrations 1X (10 mmol/L pyruvate, 0.1 U/mL vitamin E and 0.1 % fatty acids) and 3X of TCAT, respectively, prevented neuronal death caused by these treatments. Analysis of the contribution of TCAT components to neuroprotection showed that vitamin E and fatty acids enhanced pyruvate action whereas they displayed no neuroprotection by themselves. In contrast, vitamin E and fatty acids were as potent antioxidants as pyruvate in an in vitro cell-free assay, indicating that TCAT protection is modulated by the existence of the cellular membrane barriers. Isolated rat hearts were perfused under electrolysis or subjected to regional ischemia-reperfusion. TCAT 1X prevented the electrolysis-induced decrease in left ventricular pressure, heart rate and coronary flow. At 0.25X concentration, TCAT abolished the incidence of irreversible ventricular fibrillation in ischemia-reperfusion. The results indicate that TCAT could have a broad therapeutic utility in neurological and cardiac injuries associated with oxidative stress. The protective action of TCAT can surpass that of its components, revealing a benefit of the association.

We describe a method that can produce a network with invariance to changes in visual input caused by attention shifts. Training of the network is controlled by signals associated with attention shifting. A temporal perceptual stability constraint is used to drive the output of the network towards remaining constant across temporal sequences of attention shifts. We use a four-layer neural network model to perform the position-invariant extraction of local features and temporal integration of attention-shift invariant presentations of objects. We present results on both simulated data and real images, to demonstrate that our network can acquire position invariance across a sequence of attention shifts.

In the striatum, retrograde trophic support from targets, including the ventral midbrain, is important for survival of neurons during postnatal apoptosis (van der Kooy 1996). We hypothesized that anterograde trophic support to the striatum from glutamatergic systems is also an important determinant of neuronal survival during the apoptosis period. We used the glutamatergic thalamostriatal system (TS) arising from the parafascicular (PF) nucleus as a model. We proposed that anterograde transport of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), occurs in the developing TS system, and cooperates with glutamate to rescue striatal neurons from apoptosis. We demonstrate that early striatal deafferentation by lesioning of the rat PF nucleus at postnatal day 2 (P2) results in: 1) 30% loss of neostriatum neurons by P35 when quantified on Nissl stains using unbiased streology; 2) enhanced apoptosis in the striatum during the first two postnatal weeks measured using Western blots for activated caspase-3; 3) and marked reduction in striatal BDNF content on protein biochemistry. In ongoing work, neuronal loss after P2 PF lesions is markedly reduced by striatal injection of BDNF containing spheres during the first postnatal week. Anterograde trophic mechanisms play an important role in determining the filial complement of striatal neurons. We provide novel evidence indicating that BDNF serves as an "anterophin" in developing glutamatergic striatal afferents, and may cooperate with glutamate to promote activity dependent rescue of striatal neurons, thus matching neuronal number with afferent density.

One aim was to estimate the role of negative emotionality and general psychopathology (i.e. neuroticism) in this relationship. 115 non-clinical volunteers underwent infrared oculographic assessment of antisaccades and prosaccades. Schizotypy was assessed with the Personality Syndrome Questionnaire (PSQ-80), the Rust Inventory of Schizotypal Cognitions (RISC), and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R) Psychoticism. Higher positive schizotypy scores predicted increased antisaccade errors (RISC) and greater prosaccade spatial error (PSQ-80 Unreality). Greater thought disorder (PSQ-80 Activity) predicted shorter prosaccade latencies. EPQ-R Neuroticism was substantially correlated with schizotypy but was not related to saccadic measures and did not account for their relationship with schizotypy. We conclude that saccadic performance patterns in schizotypy are not due to negative emotionality or general psychopathology, but specific to schizophrenia spectrum signs and symptoms.

J	Roth, AD; Ramirez, G; Alarcon, R; von Bernhardi, R				Roth, AD; Ramirez, G; Alarcon, R; von Bernhardi, R			Oligodendrocytes damage in Alzheimer's disease: Beta amyloid toxicity and inflammation	BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						cell death; glial cells; pro-inflammatory cytokines	MATTER STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY; WHITE-MATTER; MICROGLIAL REACTIVITY; COGNITIVE DECLINE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; BRAIN; ASTROCYTES; PEPTIDES; DEATH; DEMENTIA	Research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) focuses mainly on neuronal death and synaptic impairment induced by beta-Amyloid peptide (A beta), events at least partially mediated by astrocyte and microglia activation. However, substantial white matter damage and its consequences on brain function warrant the study of oligodendrocytes' compromise in AD and discuss some experimental data indicative of A beta toxicity in culture. We observed that 1 mu M of fibrilogenic A beta peptide damages of astrocytes reduced the A beta-induced damage. This agrees with our previous results showing an astrocyte-mediated protective effect over A beta-induced damage on hippocampal cells and modulation of the activation of microglial cells in culture. Oligodendrocytes protection by astrocytes could be. either by reduction of A beta peptide damages oligodendrocytes in vitro: while pro-inflammatory molecules (1 mu g/ ml LPS + 1 ng/ml IFN gamma) or the presence of astrocytes reduced the A beta-induced damage on hippocampal cells and modulation of the activation of microglial cells in culture. Oligodendrocytes protection by astrocytes could be either by reduction of A beta fibrilogenesis/deposition or prevention of oxidative damage. Likewise, the decrease of A beta-induced damge by proinflammatory molecules could reflect the production of trophic factors by activated oligodendrocytes and/or a metabolic activation as observed during myelination. Considering the association of inflammation with neurodegenerative disease. oligodendrocytes impairement in AD patients could potentiate cell damage under pathological conditions.

J	Marzullo, G; Fraser, FC				Marzullo, G; Fraser, FC			Similar rhythms of seasonal conceptions in neural tube defects and schizophrenia: A hypothesis of oxidant stress and the photoperiod	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART A-CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR TERATOLOGY			English	Article						neural tube defects; schizophrenia; season of birth; brain asymmetry; handedness; maternal oxidant stress; homocysteine; folic acid	SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; DIABETIC PREGNANCY; GENE-EXPRESSION; FOLIC-ACID; HOMOCYSTEINE; MOUSE; ASYMMETRY; HEART; BIRTH; MELATONIN	BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have found that people with schizophrenia tend to be born most often in late winter and least often in late summer. The same rhythm appears in the birth of children with neural tube defects (NTDs). In the northern hemisphere, both disorders thus show a conception peak in May-June and a trough around November-December. The senior author found the same May-June conception peak among left-handed American baseball players and the opposite effect (a November-December peak) among extreme right-handed players. A similar rhythm appeared with respect to characteristics related to artistic as opposed to scientific modes of thought. DISCUSSION: Schizophrenia has been proposed to involve a deficit in the establishment of lateral asymmetry, as does. left-handedness. The artist-scientist dichotomy is also believed to involve cerebral dominance. Thus, the similarity of seasonal variation in month of conception between NTDs, schizophrenia, left-handedness, and artistic intuition suggests that these four conditions may share some factor affecting the cellular processes involved in both neural tube closure and asymmetry development: during the early-fourth week, neural-fold stages of embryogenesis. We propose that maternal oxidant stress, which can rise with exposure to intense solar radiation, may interfere with both neural tube closure and asymmetry development. The June and December extremes of sunlight would thus explain the peak times of the seasonal fluctuations. Moreover, regardless of mechanisms, the parallel between the two conception rhythms suggests that the same periconceptional folate regimens found effective in preventing NTDs may also lower the risk of schizophrenia. This paper reviews some of the clinical and experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

They have shown that anesthetics act on specific structures that have been known to be important for consciousness at large. They have also helped to show that anesthetics act on specific structures regionally, rather than being non-specific, general depressant of the central nervous system (CNS). A constant finding is that the drugs that we use seem to exert their action on specific sites within the CNS. This is true for a wide variety of drugs like midazolam, anesthetic vapors and opiates. The thalamus has consistently shown marked deactivation coincident with the anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness, appearing to be a very important target of anesthetic effect. Additionally, when vibro-tactile or pain stimulation is given, anesthetics significantly effect cortical structures even before loss of consciousness while loss of transmission at the thalamic level seems to coincide with loss of consciousness. Finally, the use of radioligands allow in vivo characterization of anesthetic effects on neurotransmitter systems.

These deposits disrupt neural and synaptic function and ultimately lead to neuronal degeneration and dementia. In addition to the pathological roles attributed to Abeta, evidence from our laboratory would suggest that Abeta serves a physiological role in the modulation of CRE-directed gene expression. This commentary also highlights some of the pathological consequences of the accumulation of intracellular Abeta. Finally it discusses the impact of cortical Abeta burden on transmitter-specific synaptic numbers as well as the generation of dystrophic neurites. The fundamental thesis of my proposal is that the Abeta pathology seen in AD is a continuous process from an initial abnormal Abeta intracellular accumulation to the well-established extracellular Abeta aggregation, culminating in the formation of amyloid plaques and dystrophic neurites.

J	Ezzine, S; Varin, F				Ezzine, S; Varin, F			Interstitial muscle concentrations of rocuronium under steady-state conditions in anaesthetized dogs: actual versus predicted values	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						pharmacokinetics,rocuronium; pharmacology, rocuronium; model, dog	MICRODIALYSIS; PLASMA; PHARMACODYNAMICS; PHARMACOKINETICS; HUMANS; TISSUE; FLUID; RATS	Introduction. The objective of this study was to compare rocuronium effect (C-e) and peripheral (C-2) compartment concentrations predicted by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling with those measured in plasma (C-p) and in the interstitial fluid of muscle tissue (C-ISF,C-u) by microdialysis in anaesthetized dogs. Methods. After approval by the Animal Care Committee, eight adult male dogs with a body weight ranging from 7 to 18 kg were anaesthetized with pentobarbital. Each dog received a 2-min rocuronium infusion of 0.15 mg kg(-1) min(-1) followed by a 118-min infusion of 60 mug kg(-1) min(-1) via the right jugular vein. Arteriovenous gradient across the hindlimb was measured at 40, 60, 100 and 120 min. Three microdialysis samples were collected at 40-min intervals. Once the infusion stopped, arterial samples were collected every 2 min for the first 10 min and every 20 min for the next 120 min. Neuromuscular function was monitored using train-of-four stimulation until full recovery. Dogs were then killed and a biopsy of muscle tissue was performed (C-m). Results. At steady state, the mean C-ISF,C-u value was 1353 ng ml(-1). After correction for the unbound fraction in plasma, the mean C-e,C-corr and C-2,C-corr were 1681 and 1481 ng ml(-1), respectively. At the terminal sampling point, C-m was 10-fold higher than C-p. Conclusion. Unbound concentration of rocuronium measured in the muscle interstitial fluid under steady-state conditions confirms that parametric PK-PD modelling gives reliable estimates of effect site concentrations. Rocuronium accumulates in muscle tissue, probably by non-specific protein binding in the interstitial space.

Its effect on NMB of the larynx has not been studied yet. Methods: We compared a priming technique with a bolus application of rocuronium on the onset of NMB at the laryngeal adductor and the adductor pollicis muscles (AP). In 30 female patients, after induction of anesthesia a tube with a surface electrode was placed into the trachea prior to the administration of any neuromuscular blocking agent to monitor electromyography (EMG) of the laryngeal adductor muscles. Neuromuscular monitoring consisted of EMG of the laryngeal adductor muscles and the left AP Patients were randomized into two groups. After transcutaneous stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and ulnar nerve, a bolus of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1) (Bolus group) or a priming dose of rocuronium 0.06 mg kg(-1) followed by rocuronium 0.54 mg-kg(-1) three minutes later (Priming group) were injected. Lag time, onset 90%, onset time and peak effect of NMB were recorded and compared; a P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The onset 90% and onset time measured at the laryngeal adductor muscles (onset: 44.7 +/- 7.4 vs 74.0 +/- 23.8 sec) and at the AP (onset: 105.4 +/- 29.9 vs 139.2 +/- 51.5 sec) were significantly shorter in the Priming group than in the Bolus group. Within groups, the onset times were significantly shorter at the laryngeal muscles in comparison to AP. Conclusion: Our results indicate that a priming technique with rocuronium significantly accelerates the onset of NMB at the laryngeal adductor muscles. Our results further support the use of rocuronium as an alternative to succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction.

Sources: MEDLINE, internet, and hand searches up to February 2004 for English and French papers on NIBS. Principal findings: Forty-eight papers were retrieved, with a total of 5,931 cardiac surgery patients monitored by NIBS. More than 83% of patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The majority of studies were prospective for the monitored group. Clinically. NIBS monitoring appears to detect brain desaturation episodes encountered during surgery. However, the majority of studies retrieved suffered from major methodological limitations and a low level of evidence. NIBS validity vs jugular bulb oximetry is questioned together with its predictive value in identifying those who will suffer postoperatively from neurological deficits. The sole randomized controlled trial appears to have recorded negative results in this respect. Conclusion: The clinical application of NIBS in heart surgery as a brain-monitoring device seems interesting. However, NIBS has to be investigated more rigorously to prove its clinical utility in cardiac surgery.

To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of complete paralysis lasting more than ten hours after surgery. Clinical features: We attribute the extended durations of NMB (more than ten hours) to high doses of NMB drugs in combination with magnesium sulphate and moderate renal failure. Advanced age, hepatic disease, aminoglycoside exposure, hypocalcemia, and possible interaction between rocuronium and pancuronium may have played minor roles. Conclusion: We should avoid administering large doses of NMB agents, even in the context of planned postoperative ventilation. If NMB is not monitored intraoperatively in patients who are at risk of prolonged NMB, then train-of-four response should be measured in the intensive care unit. Adequate sedation should be provided until proper recovery of neuromuscular function is documented.

Methods: We used an ecosystem approach, integrating Hg measurements with socio-cultural and politico-economic elements, to provide an integral analysis and comprehensive solutions. Results: Our interdisciplinary research in the Ecuadorian Andean Amazon has shown that comestible fish and riparian communities which rely on fish as a major protein source have mercury levels that could potentially cause subtle but deleterious population health alterations. A parallel study identified deforestation and soil erosion as a significant source of mercury to the aquatic ecosystem. Interpretation: The analysis of these results in conjunction with the prevailing socio-cultural and politico-economic context allowed us to identify economic trends, and especially petroleum exploitation, as pivotal in the deforestation/mercury-exposure dynamic. In collaboration with public health authorities, we shared our results with local health stakeholders, including public health care staff, federal government agencies, researchers and local communities, in such a way as to promote sustainable land use practices and the nutritional benefits of fish eating while reducing toxic exposures.

However, systemic side effects associated with large doses of this drug have limited its widespread use. Treatment with thalidomide would prove more efficacious if the drug could. be delivered directly to target areas in the gut, thereby reducing systemic circulation. Microcapsule encapsulation could enable direct delivery of the drug. To assess the latter, we designed and tested drug-targeting release characteristics of alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules in simulated gastrointestinal environments. The results show that APA capsules enabled delivery of thalidomide in the middle and distal portions of the small intestine. We also compared the APA membrane formulation with an earlier designed alginate chitosan (AC) membrane thalidomide formulation. The results show that both APA and AC capsules allow for successful delivery of thalidomide in the gut and could prove beneficial in the treatment of Crohn's disease. However, further research is required.

Methods: Subjects were instructed to turn the head as fast and as soon as possible in the direction indicated by an illuminated arrow signal (fight, left or none) that was triggered at initial contact of the right (healthy) or paretic (hemiparetic) foot. Head, thorax, and pelvis motions were obtained from a 9-segment model using retro-reflective markers and a Vicon-512 system with 6 high-resolution cameras. Coordination of axial segments in the horizontal plane was characterized using cyclographs and cross-correlation analyses. Stabilization of the segments was quantified using root mean square (RMS) values of the segment's normalized acceleration profile. Results: The healthy subjects showed a direction-dependent modulation of axial segment coordination, with head turns toward and away from the stance limb favoring and hindering, respectively, the contra-rotational pattern of the thorax with respect to the pelvis during locomotion. Meanwhile, pelvis motions remained unaltered. This direction-specific modulation pattern was disrupted in the hemiparetic subjects, both in the spatial and temporal domains. Moreover, larger RMS values for head and thorax segments were observed in the hemiparetic groups, both with and without the superimposition of voluntary head motions. Conclusions: The findings suggest that: (1) head rotations during walking modify axial segment coordination in a direction-specific manner, (2) the pelvic rotations associated with locomotion remained unaffected by head rotations and (3) stroke alters this coordination behavior, which may contribute to balance dysfunctions during locomotion.

This has led to a re-examination of the established roles of cytokines, as the functions of newly identified members are characterized. In this review. we describe how the recent discovery and characterization of interleukin (IL)-23 has led to a re-evaluation or the role of interferon (IFN) gamma and IFNgamma-inducing factors in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Recent studies suggest that IFNgamma-secreting T cells, considered the hallmark of EAE, may not be the major detrimental effector cell, and may even have a regulatory function. The impact of this on current understanding of cytokine networks underlying CNS inflammation in EAE is discussed.

They are believed to play a role in disease states like asthma, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, diabetes, endotoxic and pancreatic shock, and to contribute to the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases. Although kinins are also neuromediators in the central nervous system, their involvement in neurological diseases has not been intensively investigated thus far. This review analyzes the potential of central kinin receptors as therapeutic targets for neurological disorders. Initial data highlight potential roles for B-1 receptor antagonists as antiepileptic agents, and for B-2 receptor antagonists (and/or B-1 agonists) in the treatment of stroke. Functional B-1 receptors located on T-lymphocytes and on the blood brain-barrier are also putative targets for the management of multiple sclerosis. However, successful elucidation of the therapeutic value of these new pharmacological approaches will require refinement of our knowledge on the physiology and cellular localization of central kinin receptors.

In neuronal tissues, cation-chloride cotransporters regulate Cl-homeostasis and the activity and/or expression of these transporters has important implications for the direction and magnitude of anion flow through GABA-A channels. Here we review recent evidence that two cation-chloride cotransporters, NKCC1 and KCC2 are involved in pain and enhanced nociception. On the one hand, NKCC1 activity is upregulated in primary afferents following an inflammatory insult and this produces excessive GABAergic depolarization in primary afferents leading to cross excitation between low and high threshold afferents. On the other hand, KCC2 expression is reduced in dorsal horn neurons following peripheral nerve injury resulting in a loss of GABA-/glycinergic inhibitory tone and, in some cases, inverting its action into net excitation. Pharmacological targeting of these cation chloride cotransporters to restore normal GABA-/glycinergic transmission in the spinal cord represents an entirely novel approach to the development of analgesics.

The system uses a combination of foreground and background features for segmentation of touching digits. The method introduces new algorithms for traversing the top/bottom-foreground-skeletons of the touched digits, and for finding feature points on these skeletons, and matching them to build all the segmentation paths. For the first time a genetic representation is used to show all the segmentation hypotheses. Our genetic algorithm tries to search and evolve the population of candidate segmentations and finds the one with the highest confidence for its segmentation and recognition. We have also used a new method for feature extraction which lowers the variations in the shapes of the digits, and then a MLP neural network is utilized to produce the labels and confidence values for those digits. The NIST SD19 and CENPARMI databases are used for evaluating the system. Our system can get a correct segmentation-recognition rate of 96.07% with rejection rate of 2.61% which compares favorably with those that exist in the literature.

Different batches were prepared while varying polymer and surfactant concentration, as well as homogenization pressure. Two commercial ANNs programs were evaluated: Neuroshell(R) Predictor, a black-box software adopting both neural and genetic strategies, and Neurosolutions(R), allowing a step-by-step building of the network. Results were compared to those obtained by statistical method. Predictions from ANNs were more accurate than those calculated using non-linear regression. Neuroshell(R) Predictor allowed quantification of the relative importance of the inputs. Furthermore, by varying the network topology and parameters using Neurosolutions(R), it was possible to obtain output values which were closer to experimental values. Therefore, ANNs represent a promising tool for the analysis of processes involving preparation of polymeric carriers and for prediction of their physical properties.

In this study, we investigate a novel transport mechanism based on the iron binding protein p97 (or melanotransferrin), which is able to cross the BBB. Methods: The anticancer drug adriamycin (ADR), which is unable to cross the BBB, was conjugated to p97 to determine if it was possible to deliver a therapeutic dose of ADR to the brains of mice. Conjugates of p97-ADR were prepared and tested for efficacy against subcutaneous rat C6 glioma tumours in athymic mice. Results: Conjugate and free ADR were shown to be equally effective in inhibiting the growth of these tumours. The ability of p97 to cross into the brain after conjugation to ADR was demonstrated in a mouse model using 1 1 25 labeled compounds. Transport of p97 and conjugate were shown to be 6-8 fold higher than BSA or lactoferrin. Conjugates were also tested for efficacy against intracranial rat C6 glioma and human ZR-75-1 mammary tumours in athymic mice. Conclusion: The conjugate was shown to significantly increase the Survival of mice compared to repeated injections of PBS or free ADR. These results demonstrate a marked improvement over existing chemotherapy strategies based on ADR alone. p97 may have significant potential as an effective vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic drugs across the BBB.

These methods which are also known as 'conventional techniques' were derived from several in-situ tests, laboratory tests and case records. An alternative general regression neural network (GRNN) model that addresses the collective knowledge built in a simplified procedure is proposed. To meet this objective, a total of 3895 case records including twelve soil and seismic parameters driven mostly from the cone penetration test (CPT) results are introduced into the model. The data includes the results of field tests from the two major earthquakes that took place in Turkey and Taiwan in 1999 and some of the desired input parameters are obtained from correlations existing in the literature. The soil liquefaction decision in terms of seismic demand and capacity is determined by recognized simplified approach, namely a stress-based method and a strain-based method. Furthermore, the liquefaction probability of soils with significant fines is tested with the so-called Chinese Criteria. The proposed GRNN model is developed in four phases, mainly: the identification phase, collection phase, implementation phase, and verification phase. An iterative procedure was followed to maximize the accuracy of the proposed model. The case records were divided randomly into testing, training, and validation datasets. The proposed GRNN model effectively explored the complex relationship between the introduced soil and seismic input parameters and validated the liquefaction decision.

It can be considered as one of the benchmarks in evaluating feature extraction methods and the performance of classifiers. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the recognition accuracy of handwritten numerals by using hybrid feature extraction and random feature selection. First, we present seven feature extraction methods. A novel multi-class divergence criterion for large scale feature analysis is proposed and a random feature selection strategy is used to congregate three new hybrid feature sets. The new congregated features are complementary as they are formed from different original feature sets extracted by different means. Experiments conducted on MNIST database show that our proposed method can increase the recognition accuracy.

The mechanism of action of these phospholipids is thought to be primarily dependent on their specific plasma membrane receptors belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, increasing evidence suggests the existence of a functional intracellular GPCR population. It has been suggested that immediate effects are mediated by cell surface receptors, whereas long-term responses are mediated by intracellular receptors. PAF and LPA(1) receptors localize at the cell nucleus of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells of newborn pig, rat hepatocytes, and cells overexpressing each receptor, and stimulation of isolated nuclei reveal biological functions, including transcriptional regulation of major genes, namely cylooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. This mini review focuses on the nuclear localization and signaling of GPCRs, recognizing PAF and LPA phospholipids as ligands. Theories on how nuclear PAF and LPA(1) receptors activate gene transcription and nuclear localization pathways are discussed. Intracrine signaling for lipid mediators uncover novel pathways to elicit their effects; moreover, intracellular GPCRs constitute a distinctive mode of action for gene regulation.

Methods: We reviewed the charts of 482 children admitted to the Ste-Justine Hospital with FSs between 3 months and 6 years of age and followed for at least 5 years. Results: Children with a positive FH of epilepsy (n=67) showed significantly more focal and recurrent FSs than those without such a FH. The risk of developing partial epilepsy (n= 17) or generalized epilepsy (n= 19) was significantly greater in children with focal or recurrent FSs, respectively. In children with focal FSs, only two out of 30 (6.7%) children with a negative FH of epilepsy developed partial epilepsy compared with four out of nine (44.4%) children with a positive FH. In children with recurrent FSs, as much as seven out of 34 (20.6%) children with a positive FH of epilepsy developed generalized epilepsy compared to only eight out of 161 (0.05%) of those with a negative FH. Nevertheless, when not taking into account the clinical presentation of FSs, the positive FH of epilepsy constituted a risk factor for developing generalized but not partial epilepsy. Finally, children with a positive FH of FSs (n= 120) exhibited significantly more recurrent FSs than those without such a FH, but this did not modify the risk of epilepsy. Conclusion: The FH of FSs and/or epilepsy should be taken into account when evaluating the risk of FSs recurrence and of epilepsy. (c) 2005 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

We have investigated the effects of lateral fluid percussion on the levels of the glutamate transporter proteins GLT-1alpha, its splice variant GLT-1v, GLAST, and EAAC1 in the rat in order to evaluate their pathogenetic role in this model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Immunoblot analysis revealed neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex was accompanied by a 54% decrease in GLT-1v 6 h following the insult which progressed to an 83% loss of the transporter after 24 h. No changes in GLT-1alpha, GLAST, or EAAC1 were observed in this brain region at either time point. GLT-1v content was also decreased by 55% and 68% in the hippocampus and thalamus, respectively, at 6 h post-injury, but recovered fully after 24 h in both brain regions. In contrast, levels of GLT-1alpha were increased in the hippocampus at 6 h and 24 h post-TBI. These alterations in transporter protein content were also confirmed using immunohistochemical methods. Our results show for the first time a pattern of early, dynamic changes in the levels of GLT-1 transporter splice variants in different brain regions in this trauma model. In addition, correlation of GLT-1v levels with both neuronal cell loss and a-internexin content in the injured cortex suggests that loss of this novel glutamate transporter may be a key factor in determining cerebral vulnerability following this type of brain injury.

Context-dependent effects of hippocampal damage on memory in the shock-probe test	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						fear conditioning; avoidance; burying; amnesia; learning	DORSAL HIPPOCAMPUS; ELECTROLYTIC LESIONS; AMYGDALOID-LESIONS; RATTUS-NORVEGICUS; FEAR; RATS; ANTEROGRADE; DEFICITS; ANXIETY; AGENTS	We assessed the role of the hippocampus in anterograde memory, using the shock-probe test. Rats with sham or neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus were given a shock-probe acquisition session during which each time they contacted a probe they received a shock; 24 h later, the rats were given a second shock-probe session to test their retention, but in this instance the probe was not electrified. Rats were tested in either the same context as the one used during acquisition or in a different context. The hippocampal lesions impaired avoidance of the probe and burying on the retention test, suggesting that the lesions induced anterograde amnesia. However, the impairment was context dependent. The hippocampal lesions impaired avoidance only when the rats were tested in the context in which they received the conditioning. The results of the shock-probe test suggest that the anterograde amnesia following hippocampal lesions is due mainly to an inability to associate the context with the shock more than to an inability to associate the probe with shock.

We assessed the effects of neurotoxic hippocampal lesions on anterograde object recognition, using a novel-object preference test, with retention intervals that were considerably longer than in previous studies-24 h, 1 week, and 3 weeks. To promote object recognition after such long intervals, rats were familiarized with a sample object in an open field for 5 min/day for 5 consecutive days. Recognition was assessed by comparing the amount of time spent investigating the sample versus a novel object on a preference test at one of the postlearning intervals. The rats with hippocampal lesions displayed a normal novelty preference after a 3-week interval, and their performance across the three delay conditions was not significantly different from that of control rats. The findings indicate that extensive hippocampal damage spares anterograde object recognition in rats, even after retention intervals lasting days or weeks. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A particularity of the human brain is to store and retrieve better visual information. Most of our knowledge is located in what is called the subconscious mind while declarative memory is part of the conscious mind. Emotional memory plays an important role between these two types of mind. It can reduce and even block the access to knowledge and recall. The Reticular Activating System is the center of balance for the other systems involved in learning. In this paper we show how these systems play an important role. We have developed in this way specific agents able to reassure the learner. This allow to trigger a technique called Visual Based Reasoning for retrieving and remembering better the information. We show how this approach can be developed through the intervention of specific agents.

In this paper, a new set of methods is proposed and compared with the standard approach [Gram-Schmidt method (GS)]. Three redundancy-based algorithms are introduced to compensate for possible loss of markers during data acquisition: regression plane (RP), multiple Gram-Schmidt (MGS), and center of mass least square (CMLS). When combined with the ultrasound instrument, the root-mean-squared (RMS) uncertainty in locating target points, over a working volume of 420 mm x 490 mm x 100 mm, improved by 7% and 24% using MGS and CMLS method respectively, compared to GS. A lower improvement was obtained with RP methods (5%), using the best marker configuration. In conclusion, CMLS method provides a robust and accurate procedure for 3-D freehand ultrasound scanhead tracking, able to manage possible loss of markers, with interesting perspectives for image fusion and body referenced 3-D ultrasound.

The emphasis is placed on the development of data smoothing and analysis framework. The human brain cortex is a highly convoluted surface. Due to the convoluted non-Euclidean surface geometry, data smoothing and analysis on the cortex are inherently difficult. When measurements lie on a curved surface, it is natural to assign kernel smoothing weights based on the geodesic distance along the surface rather than the Euclidean distance. We present a new data smoothing framework that address this problem implicitly without actually computing the geodesic distance and present its statistical properties. Afterwards, the statistical inference is based on the random field theory based multiple comparison correction. As an illustration, we have applied the method in detecting the regions of abnormal cortical thickness in 16 high functioning autistic children.

Aim: To investigate how NOS 1 may influence allergic inflammation, we used NOS 1 knockout mice and their wild-type (WT) controls. Methods: Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) using a protocol known to upregulate NOS 2 in the airways. Results: In addition to expected increases in NOS 2 activity, OVA challenge led to increases in calcium-dependent NOS activity, which was accounted for by increased expression of NOS 1 at both mRNA (n=5, p<0.001) and protein levels (n=5, p<0.01). In NOS-1-deficient mice, OVA challenge induced less eosinophilia (n=7, p<0.05) and much less NO production (n=10, p<0.01) than in WT controls, reflecting not only the expected absence of NOS 1, but also lack of upregulation of NOS 2. This interaction appeared to be stimulus specific as NOS-1-deficient mice did upregulate NOS 2 following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (n=5, p<0.001). Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of NOS 1 in allergic airway inflammation and suggest a mechanism by which NOS 1 may influence overall NO production in the airways.

J	Rao, Y				Rao, Yong			Dissecting Nck/Dock Signaling Pathways in Drosophila Visual System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						axon guidance; neuronal target recognition; signal transduction; fly visual system		The establishment of neuronal connections during embryonic development requires the precise guidance and targeting of the neuronal growth cone, an expanded cellular structure at the leading tip of a growing axon. The growth cone contains sophisticated signaling systems that allow the rapid communication between guidance receptors and the actin cytoskeleton in generating directed motility. Previous studies demonstrated a specific role for the Nck/Dock SH2/SH3 adapter protein in photoreceptor (R cell) axon guidance and target recognition in the Drosophila visual system, suggesting strongly that Nck/Dock is one of the long-sought missing links between cell surface receptors and the actin cytoskeleton. In this review, I discuss the recent progress on dissecting the Nck/Dock signaling pathways in R-cell growth cones. These studies have identified additional key components of the Nck/Dock signaling pathways for linking the receptor signaling to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in controlling growth-cone motility.

The aims of this clinical overview are to raise the dental community's awareness about this important and complex topic and describe the clinical features and management of the main entities. Materials and Methods: A MEDLINE search of the different entities reported in the English and French literature was conducted. The main findings of a field study on oral dyskinesia were also reviewed. Results: Involuntary movement disorders are often drug related, In other cases, excessive oral movements may occur at any age in relation to various neuropsychiatric conditions. Orofacial dystonia apparently triggered by dental procedures has also been reported. Edentulousness has been associated with oral stereotypes. In a survey of 352 edentulous elderly individuals attending daycare centers, only 7% displayed visible oral sterotypes, and ill-fitting dentures were suggested as a possible triggering factor for the majority. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary evaluation is desirable in the care of individuals with oral dyskinesia and in the selection of those who may benefit from a prosthodontic approach. A good knowledge of potentially offending drugs may allow avoidance of unnecessary procedures.

Driver handling behaviour is reflected in two aspects: the mental workload and the performance. Further, this behaviour is exposed through the interactions between driver-vehicle and driver-environment. There is generally a lack of the first principle with which to develop a model for human behaviour. In this study, several more sophisticated artificial neural network architectures for developing models for human drivers in a DVE system were used. The vehicle dynamics are modelled by a 3-d.o.f. model derived from the first principle. The experiment was performed and compared with a DVE simulation system in which the developed human driver behaviour model was included, together with the vehicle dynamics model. The comparative study showed that the simulation result is in good agreement with the experimental result, which further justifies the effectiveness of the developed driver behaviour model.

Mice lacking a protein essential for mood regulation have showed an alteration of emotional behavior, when tested with behavioral paradigms assessing mood or anxiety disorders. In the field of affective disorders, these mice have brought a huge contribution to the understanding of mood disorders, showing that they can be the results of a large amount of different neuronal elements. Since behavioral paradigms to test antidepressant-like activity in rodents show several methodological limitations, the search for a common neurobiological marker linking genotype and phenotype becomes urgent and necessary. Here we propose that the electrophysiological assessment of the serotonin (5-HT) spontaneous firing activity may be an index to measure the 5-HT neurotransmission in mutant mice that is correlated to their mood status. In particular, we have analyzed three fines of mice that show changes of both 5-HT firing activity and mood: 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor and 5HT1A receptor null mice. We concluded that a decrease of 5-HT firing activity corresponds to a depressive-like phenotype, while an increase of 5-HT firing to a "depression-resistant" phenotype. The characterization of the phenotype of these genetically modified animals helps us to better identify putative receptors or neuronal elements involved in the pathogenesis of major depression in humans and to find new targets for antidepressant drugs discovery.

Antibodies raised against mammalian GnRH were used to investigate the distribution of GnRH immunoreactivity in specimens of the triclad turbellarian Bdelloura candida (Maricola, Bdellouridae). While no GnRH immunoreactivity was detected in the brain and nerve cords, both the putative subepidermal and submuscular nerve plexuses appeared to be immunoreactive. GnRH immunoreactivity was also present in epidermal mucous cells, in parenchymal cells, including cells surrounding the branches of the intestine, in putative neuroendocrine cells associated with the testes, and in the vitellogenic gland cells associated with the oviduct. These observations suggest that the GnRH-like material found in specimens of B. candida may be involved in a variety of functions, including a possible pheromone-like role for mucous cells and the control of specific reproductive activities.

The current strategy to identify these children is through developmental surveillance, a continuous procedure in which the health professional observes the infant, takes a developmental history, and elicits any concerns that the caregiver might have. However, identification of delayed children is ineffective when based solely on routine surveillance. A necessary adjunct is developmental screening: the process of systematically identifying children with suspected delay who need further assessment. Screening tests greatly improve the rate of identification. With the advent of intervention programs and the support of organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the topic of developmental screening is a timely and essential one. This review aims to describe the properties of screening tests, to evaluate the available tools for developmental screening while providing a representative sample of the currently available developmental tests, and, finally, to evaluate the efficacy of intervention programs, a needed prerequisite to justify screening.

We investigated possible cGMP elevation in the left ventricle (LV) of rats developing physiologic LV hypertrophy during gestation. Furthermore, expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and oxytocin receptors (OTR) was evaluated because their activation stimulates NO and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release from the heart. Compared with nonpregnant controls, Sprague-Dawley rats on day 7 of gestation had similar heart weights, but, on days 14 and 21, ventricular mass increased by 12% and 28% respectively (P<0.05). LV cGMP concentration was elevated at day 14 of gestation (3.25 +/- 0.12 vs 4.65 +/- 0.17 pmol/g wet weight, P<0.01) but decreased at day 21 (2.45 +/- 0.09 pmol/g, P<0.05) to increase again on postpartum day 1 (6.01 +/- 0.15 pmol/g) and day 4 (9.21 +/- 1.79 pmol/g). Changes in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), OTR and ER&alpha;, but not ER&beta;, proteins paralleled the pregnancy-related cGMP changes in the LV. In contrast, ANP mRNA of the LV remained at control level throughout gestation but increased postpartum, whereas brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression declined at term and increased postpartum. The particulate GC natriuretic peptide receptors (GC-A and GC-B) transcripts were already lower at day 14 of gestation. Natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C) transcript was not altered on days 7 and 14, but increased at term. We conclude that cGMP concentration in the rat LV is influenced by both NOS and natriuretic peptide systems and may be involved in the changes of LV contractility and hypertrophy that occur during rat gestation.

Three complementary strategies are used by researchers investigating how PrP is involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases: elucidation of the normal function of PrP, determination of how PrPs' is toxic to neurons, and unraveling the mechanism for the conversion of PrP to PrPsc. We review the normal function of PrP as an antioxidant and an antiapoptotic protein in vivo and in vitro. This review also addresses contrasting evidence that PrP is cytotoxic. Finally, we discuss the implication of the neuroprotective role of PrP in prion diseases.

It remained to be determined whether this phenomenon also occurred in the brain. To resolve this issue, we analyzed by immunogold histochemistry the subcellular distribution of &delta; ORs in the nucleus accumbens, dorsal neostriatum, and frontal cortex in mice treated or not with morphine (48 h). We observed that prolonged treatment with morphine induced a translocation of &delta; ORs from intracellular to subplasmalemmal and membrane compartments in dendrites from both the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal neostriatum but not from the frontal cortex. We propose that this &mu; OR-&delta; OR interaction might prolong and modulate the sensitivity of neurons to opiates in specific target regions.

As in neocortex, the growth of this innervation mostly occurred within the first two weeks after birth. A preliminary ultrastructural survey indicated that a vast majority of these ChAT-immunostained axon varicosities were asynaptic during development as in the adult. In parallel, we quantified the cholinergic innervations of cerebral cortex and hippocampus in transgenic mice overexpressing human beta-amyloid peptide (hAPP(SW,IND)). A selective, widespread, plaque independent cholinergic denervation was thus demonstrated, first in hippocampus and then neocortex, in addition to a non-selective, plaque-dependent, local neurotoxic effect of aggregated beta-amyloid on ACh and 5-HT axons.

This identified seven potential candidates, including the brain-specific type II membrane protein BRI3. Co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that BACE1 and BRI3 co-localize and interact with each other via the cytosolic tail of BACE1. Furthermore, pulse and pulse-chase analyses revealed that the pro-protein convertases furin, and to a lesser extent PC7 and PC5A, process BRI3 into a C-terminal secreted similar to 4-kDa product. Thus, furin efficiently processes both pro-BACE1 and its novel interacting protein pro-BRI3.

An approach to enhancing MS treatment is to combine drugs that impact on different aspects of the disease process. We have described that the tetracycline derivative, minocycline, attenuates the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Here, we have evaluated the combination of minocycline and glatiramer acetate (GA), a current therapy in MS, on the course of EAE in mice. This combination resulted in a significant reduction of disease severity and disease burden with attenuation of the inflammation, axonal loss and demyelination. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Uri; Taglialatela, Giulio			Signaling pathways mediating a selective induction of nitric oxide synthase II by tumor necrosis factor alpha in nerve growth factor-responsive cells	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article								Background: Inflammation and oxidative stress play a critical role in neurodegeneration associated with acute and chronic insults of the nervous system. Notably, affected neurons are often responsive to and dependent on trophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF). We previously showed in NGF-responsive PC12 cells that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and NGF synergistically induce the expression of the free-radical producing enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). We proposed that NGF-responsive neurons might be selectively exposed to iNOS-mediated oxidative damage as a consequence of elevated TNF alpha levels. With the aim of identifying possible therapeutic targets, in the present study we investigated the signaling pathways involved in NGF/TNF alpha-promoted iNOS induction. Methods: Western blotting, RT-PCR, transcription factor-specific reporter gene systems, mutant cells lacking the low affinity p75NTR NGF receptor and transfections of TNF alpha/NGF chimeric receptors were used to investigate signalling events associated with NGF/TNF alpha-promoted iNOS induction in PC12 cells. Results: Our results show that iNOS expression resulting from NGF/TNF alpha combined treatment can be elicited in PC12 cells. Mutant PC12 cells lacking p75NTR did not respond, suggesting that p75NTR is required to mediate iNOS expression. Furthermore, cells transfected with chimeric TNF alpha/NGF receptors demonstrated that the simultaneous presence of both p75NTR and TrkA signaling is necessary to synergize with TNF alpha to mediate iNOS expression. Lastly, our data show that NGF/TNF alpha-promoted iNOS induction requires activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Conclusion: Collectively, our in vitro model suggests that cells bearing both the high and low affinity NGF receptors may display increased sensitivity to TNF alpha in terms of iNOS expression and therefore be selectively at risk during acute (e.g. neurotrauma) or chronic (e.g. neurodegenerative diseases) conditions where high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the nervous system occur pathologically. Our results also suggest that modulation of NF kappa B-promoted transcription of selective genes could serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent neuroinflammation-induced neuronal damage.

H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were therefore used to investigate de novo lactate synthesis from [1-C-13]glucose in vulnerable (medial thalamus) and nonvulnerable (frontal cortex) brain regions of rats made thiamine deficient by administration of the central thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine. De novo synthesis of lactate was increased in the medial thalamus to 148% and 226% of pair-fed control values at presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of thiamine deficiency, respectively, whereas no such changes were observed in the frontal cortex. Administration of a glucose load selectively worsened the changes in medial thalamus. Pyruvate recycling and peripherally derived lactate did not contribute significantly to the lactate increase within the thiamine-deficient brain. Increases in immunolabeling of the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes (LDH1 and LDH5) were observed in the medial thalamus of thiamine-deficient animals. Metabolic impairment due to thiamine deficiency thus results in increased glycolysis, increased LDH immunolabeling of neurons and astrocytes and increased de novo synthesis of lactate in brain regions vulnerable to thiamine deficiency. These results are consistent with the notion that focal lactate accumulation participates in the worsening of neurologic symptoms in thiamine-deficient patients. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Complexin I and complexin II are two genes labeling principally inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively. Because current evidence supports an important role for complexins in the modulation of neurotransmitter release, we examined the involvement of both proteins in the pathology of the medial thalamus and inferior colliculus in TD rats by immunoblotting. At the symptomatic stage, complexin I and complexin II levels in the medial thalamus were decreased by 63% and 45%, respectively, compared to control animals, but were unchanged in the inferior colliculus. These changes in thalamus were also observed using immunohistochemical methods, and seemed to be due to downregulation of both proteins because synaptophysin levels were unaffected in this brain region. In addition, cotreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented both neuronal loss and downregulation of complexins. Our findings suggest dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release in the medial thalamus, which is not present in the inferior colliculus. Furthermore, loss of complexin I and II in the thalamus may be mediated by processes that involve oxidative stress. Such changes in complexin levels may contribute to the pathophysiology of thalamic damage in TD, and offer a potential basis for the wellknown differences in pathology between this structure and the inferior colliculus in this disorder.

Preservation of hearing has become a standard goal in selected patients undergoing surgery for a vestibular schwannoma (VS). This study was aimed at analyzing the role played by filling of the internal auditory canal (IAC) as well as those played by preoperative hearing quality, and tumor size in the postoperative preservation of serviceable hearing (SH). Methods. Three hundred eighty-six patients with VS were treated. Hearing preservation was attempted in 128 cases (33.2%) by using intraoperative monitoring and following a retrosigmoid approach. The maximal extrameatal size of the tumor, its extension within the IAC, and pre- and postoperative hearing quality, according to the Gardner-Robertson classification, were evaluated. Preservation of SH was achieved in 24.2% of the 128 patients. With respect to tumor size, SH was preserved in 39% of 77 patients harboring a tumor 15 mm wide or smaller and in 2% of 51 patients with lesions 16 mm wide or larger (p < 0.001). With regard to filling of the IAC, among 63 patients harboring a tumor 15 mm or smaller, in whom magnetic resonance images were available, SH was preserved in 52.8% of 36 patients with partial filling and in 25.9% of 27 patients with complete filling (p = 0.032). Concerning preoperative hearing quality, in the patients with tumors 15 mm or smaller, SH was preserved in 46.5% of 43 patients with Gardner-Robertson Class I hearing and 29.4% of 34 patients with Class II hearing (p = 0.126). Both tumor size and the extent of IAC filling proved statistically significant in a multivariable analysis (p < 0.001 and p = 0.026, respectively). Conclusions. Incomplete filling of the IAC and a tumor size of 15 mm or smaller are independent favorable factors in SH preservation. Excellent preoperative hearing appears to have a positive impact but does not have statistical significance. Intraoperative monitoring is useful in guiding the dissection; however, the surgeon's knowledge of topographical landmarks and meticulous surgical technique remain the essential factors of success.

T1-weighted magnetic-resonance images (MRI) were acquired in 19 nmTBI patients, 3-113 months following the injury, and in 19 control subjects matched for age and gender. In addition, nmTBI patients underwent a battery of standardised memory tests. The MRIs were processed in a fully automatic system using voxel-by-voxel methods. Corpus callosum, fornix, anterior limb of the internal capsule, superior frontal gyrus, para-hippocampal gyrus, optic radiation and chiasma showed significant WMd reduction in nmTBI when compared to control subjects. None of the correlations between days of coma and memory performance scores with nmTBI voxels value that showed WMd reduction reached significance, with the exception of a significant negative correlation between WMd in the mid body of corpus callosum and short-story delayed recall. We detected reductions in WM density in several brain locations similar to those described in previous postmortem investigations. In addition, we observed WMd reduction in the optic chiasma and in the optic radiations; this finding may reflect transneural degeneration along the visual pathway. The weak correlations between specific anatomical sites of the reduced WMd and behavior may reflect the diffuse nature of the brain damage and/or the different time of onset between behavioral manifestations and neuropathological modifications occurring in nmTBI.

Brain SAMe can be increased by giving methionine to rats, raising the possibility that methionine may be an antidepressant. We aimed to study whether SAMe and methionine, when given orally to rats, could raise levels of SAMe in the central nervous system (CNS). We also aimed to test the relative abilities of SAMe and methionine to increase tail-flick latency after a thermal stimulus. This test was used to measure changes in CNS function. Methods: Rats were given SAMe and methionine orally at various doses, and biochemical and behavioural testing was carried out at intervals up to 6 hours later. Results: Methionine raised SAMe levels in various regions of the CNS and increased tail-flick latency, both at lower doses than SAMe. Conclusion: Methionine should be tested for antidepressant properties in humans.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether creatine supplementation improves muscle strength and endurance in weak upper limb muscles in persons with tetraplegia, and whether it improves function. Methods: Outpatients with tetraplegia and mild wrist extensor weakness were randomized to receive either creatine or placebo in a double-blind crossover design. During creatine supplementation, participants were loaded with 10 g orally twice per day for 6 days, then maintained on 5 g daily until undergoing testing. Main outcome measures, performed at baseline, after placebo, and after creatine supplementation, included maximal voluntary wrist extensor isometric contraction strength (MVC), endurance times for 5 submaximal wrist extensor contractions, and the Grasp and Release Test for hand function. Results: Eight individuals (7 men, 1 woman) with tetraplegia met inclusion criteria and completed all study phases. The mean age of participants was 48 years, and 7 of 8 had C6 motor level injuries. There were no significant differences in MVC, endurance times, or hand function for creatine vs placebo. Conclusion: Creatine does not improve MVC and endurance of weak wrist extensors and does not improve hand function in individuals with tetraplegia.

A discussion is included of the development of electrophoretic conditions conducive to trace-level enrichment and separation of closely related glycoforms and isoforms, which provided sensitive detection of glycolipids from as little as five bacterial colonies. The chapter also describes the use of mixed MS scanning functions to aid the identification of specific functionalities and immunodeterminants of LPS, such as pyrophosphoethanolamine, phosphocholine, and N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), which represent less than 2% of the overall LPS population. The combination of high-resolution capillary electrophoresis with sensitive tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) provides a unique analytical tool to probe the subtle structural changes resulting from oligosaccharide branching and location of substituted LPS isoforms. The ability to detect a diverse LPS population over a wide dynamic range of expression using CE-MS enables the correlation of structural changes between bacterial strains and isogenic mutants to assign functional gene relationship.

A hypothesis	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES; DORSAL NECK; MOTO-NEURONS; BACK MUSCLES; CAT; STIMULATION; EVOLUTION; MOTONEURONS; ORGANIZATION; MUSCULATURE	To localize objects in space, it is necessary to refer them to a set of coordinates that serve as a frame of reference. Advances in molecular aspects of evolutionary developmental biology reveal how axial coordinates are established in embryos. But we do not yet know how axes of reference are constructed by adult animals. The characteristics of epaxial musculature, spinal connectivity, and organization at the cortical level are reviewed. Although endowed with muscle spindles, epaxial muscles lack the monosynaptic but possess the tonic component of the stretch reflex. Motoneurons of epaxial muscles are devoid of recurrent inhibition and do not show crossed disynaptic inhibition. At motorsensory cortex (MSC), regions corresponding to the body axis receive somatosensory signals that always extend across the midline. Visual and vestibular input also converge in the zone corresponding to the body axis. This region is also endowed with a large number of callosal fibers that, by connecting the two halves of the body axis, may allow them to function and behave as a unity. In contrast, somatic signals from distal extremities are discrete, confined only to the contralaterat MSC, and show short latency of responses. They do not receive either tetereceptive or vestibular input. We propose that Limb movements directed to extrapersonal space take place within a reference frame in which one of the axes is the result of integration at the MSC of tetereceptive, proprio and somatosensory signals from the body.

Altered prostaglandin and nitric oxide production have been observed in children with PNE, and prostaglandin inhibitors are known to be of therapeutic value. Omega-3 fatty acids have the potential to influence the symptoms of PNE by inhibition of prostaglandin and renal nitric oxide production. In addition, children with PNE have an inappropriate startle response and an apparent maturational delay of the central nervous system. Research clearly shows that omega-3 fatty acids play a critical rote in the development and function of the central nervous system. It is our contention that inadequate omega-3 intake may play a rote in the tack of inhibitory input to the startle and micturition centers in PNE. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The key idea is to model white matter fibers as 3D space curves and to then extend Parent and Zucker's 2D curve inference approach [8] by using a notion of co-helicity to indicate compatibility between fibre orientation estimates at each voxel with those in a local neighborhood. We argue that this provides several advantages over earlier regularization methods. We validate the approach quantitatively on a biological phantom and on synthetic data, and qualitatively on data acquired in vivo from a human brain.

We present a methodology for predicting yearly Mini-Mental Score Examination (MMSE) changes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. We begin by generating a non-pathological, multidimensional reference space from a group of 152 healthy volunteers by Principal Component Analyses of (i) T1w MR intensity of linearly registered Volumes of Interest (VOI); and (h) trace of the deformation fields of nonlinearly registered VOIs. We use multiple regression to build linear models from eigenvectors where the projection eigencoordinates of patient data in the reference space are highly correlated with the clinical variable of interest. In our cohort of 47 MCI patients, composed of 16 decliners, 26 stable and 5 improvers (based on MMSE at 1 yr follow-up), there was a significant difference (P = 0.0003) for baseline MMSE scores between decliners and improvers, but no other differences based on age or sex. First, we classified our three groups using leave-one-out, forward step-wise linear discriminant analyses of the projection eigencoordinates with 100% accuracy. Next, we compared various linear models by computing F-statistics on the residuals of predicted vs actual values. The best model was based on 10 eigenvectors + baseline MMSE, with predicted yearly changes highly correlated (r = 0.6955) with actual data. Prospective study of an independent cohort of patients is the next logical step towards establishing this promising technique for clinical use.

Many approaches to estimation are ML (maximum likelihood), which tends to be unstable in the presence sparse data, resulting in registration that is driven by spurious noisy matches instead of valid intensity relationships. We propose instead a method of MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation, which is well-defined for sparse data, or even in the absence of data. This estimator can incorporate a variety of prior assumptions, such as global histogram characteristics, or use a maximum entropy prior when no such assumptions exist. We apply our estimation method to deformable registration of MR (magnetic resonance) and US (ultrasound) images for an IGNS (image-guided guided neurosurgery) application, where our MAP estimation method results in more stable and accurate registration than a traditional ML approach.

Digital atlases are advantageous, since they can be warped nonlinearly to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Two atlas-to-patient warping techniques are compared in this paper. The first technique uses an MRI template as an intermediary to estimate a nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation. The second, is novel, and uses a pseudo-MRI volume, derived from the voxel-label-atlas, to estimate the atlas-to-patient transformation directly. Manual segmentations and functional data are used to validate the two methods.

Distribution of rCBF is still essentially studied by visual observation, searching for abnormalities, and comparing with other studies. In order to facilitate the localization of these abnormalities, we propose a simple, automatic and direct method to register a SPECT rCBF study with a commonly used atlas in the neurological community, the Talairach Atlas.' The Talairach atlas still gives today the most extensive information of regions of interests, coupled with a coordinate system. The proposed method will therefore alloy a physician to precisely navigate in a SPECT image by interpreting the abnormalities coordinates. The registration of these two volumes is carried out in two steps, a rough alignment followed by an elastic registration. The rough alignment step consists in computing the mass centroid of each volume and in scaling the volumes accordin 'gly if necessary. A simple threshold method (30% of the maximum intensity of the SPECT image) is used to determine the volume of the brain being studied. In order to facilitate the fine registration, the Talairach atlas was previously segmented in three classes: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white and gray matters. Then, an automatic intensity transformation as well as a low-pass filtering is performed to closely resemble the spatial resolution and intensities of the SPECT volume. This intensity transformation is a simple method which combines the use of a joint 2D histogram of the segmented atlas and the individual volume as well as a clustering algorithm. The fine registration is then computed with an optical flow methodology The effectiveness of this scheme was tested on a database of virtual patients, simulated from a database of 45 healthy and diseased brains. The rate of pixels misclassification in each class within a one pixel neighborhood (CSF 0.5%; white matter 1.37%, gray matter 2.80%) indicates that this proposed method will be useful for the nuclear physician in helping localize abnormalities.

The ATNAT which takes 5 minutes to administer may be used in clinical setting as well as in research. Clustering of severe to mild neuro-cranial signs in the neonatal period permits identification of children who could benefit from early intervention. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Dopamine neurons in mice lacking VMAT2 are unable to store or release dopamine from their synaptic vesicles. To determine how VMAT2-mediated filling influences synaptic vesicle morphology and function, we examined dopamine terminals from VMAT2 knockout mice. In contrast to the abnormalities reported in glutamatergic terminals of mice lacking VGLUT1, the corresponding vesicular transporter for glutamate, we found that the ultrastructure of dopamine terminals and synaptic vesicles in VMAT2 knockout mice were indistinguishable from wild type. Using the activity-dependent dyes FM1-43 and FM2-10, we also found that synaptic vesicles in dopamine neurons lacking VMAT2 undergo endocytosis and exocytosis with kinetics identical to those seen in wild-type neurons. Together, these results demonstrate that dopamine synaptic vesicle biogenesis and cycling are independent of vesicle filling with transmitter. By demonstrating that such empty synaptic vesicles can cycle at the nerve terminal, our study suggests that physiological changes in VMAT2 levels or trafficking at the synapse may regulate dopamine release by altering the ratio of fillable-to-empty synaptic vesicles, as both continue to cycle in response to neural activity.

The earliest metabolic consequence of thiamine deficiency is a selective loss in activity of the thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH), a rate-limiting tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme. Thiamine deficiency is characterized neuropathologically by selective neuronal cell death in the thalamus, pons, and cerebellum. The cause of this region-selective neuronal loss is unknown, but mechanisms involving cellular energy failure, focal lactic acidosis, and NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity have classically been implicated. More recently, evidence supports a role for oxidative stress. Evidence includes increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase, nitrotyrosine deposition, microglial activation, and lipid peroxidation. Reactive oxygen species production results in decreased expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters and decreased activities of alpha-KGDH, resulting in an amplification of cell death mechanisms in thiamine deficiency.

The main clinical features are new weakness, muscular fatigability, general fatigue, and pain. The primary criteria necessary for the diagnosis of PPS are a history of paralytic poliomyelitis, partial or complete recovery of neurological function followed by a period of stability (usually several decades), persistent new muscle weakness or abnormal muscle fatigability, and the exclusion of other causes of new symptoms. The cause of PPS remains unclear, but is likely due to a distal degeneration of enlarged post-poliomyelitis motor units. Contributing factors to PPS may be aging (with motor neuron loss), overuse, and disuse. PPS is usually a slowly progressive neuromuscular disease. Although there is no specific treatment for PPS, an interdisciplinary management program can be useful in controlling symptoms.

The problem addressed is the parallel parking in a rectangular constrained space with just one backward maneuver. To accomplish the autonomous fuzzy behavior control, the Car-Like-Mobile-Robot has trained to park in just 2 parking dimensions based on the training data obtained from sensor information generated offline by adopting a fifth-order polynomial as the reference trajectory. The proposed controller is an ANFIS architecture that generates turning angle as output. As long as the states (positions and orientations) of the robot are measurable at each discrete-time step during the control process, this controller can make the robot follow feasible trajectories by just knowing the initial configuration of the robot and park successfully at the prescribed goal position. The simulation results which are based on real dimensions of a typical car demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller in practical car maneuvers.

Quaking viable (Qk(v)) mice harboring an autosomal recessive mutation in this locus have uncompacted myelin in the central nervous system owing to the inability of oligodendrocytes to properly mature. Here we show that the expression of two QKI isoforms, absent from oligodendrocytes of Qk(v) mice, induces cell cycle arrest of primary rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Injection of retroviruses expressing QKI into the telencephalon of mouse embryos induced differentiation and migration of multipotential neural progenitor cells into mature oligodendrocytes localized in the corpus callosum. The mRNA encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitor p27(Kip1) was bound and stabilized by QKI, leading to an increased accumulation of p27(Kip1) protein in oligodendrocytes. Our findings demonstrate that QKI is upstream of p27(Kip1) during oligodendrocyte differentiation.

There are growing evidences that these factors play important roles during processes of differentiation and proliferation of several tissues. To better understand their role in the differentiated adult rat pituitary gland, we cloned COUP-TFII and EAR-2 cDNAs from an anterior pituitary cDNA library. Subsequently, we raised and characterized specific antibodies to the N-terminal domain of both nuclear receptors. We next examined their cellular and subcellular distribution in the pituitary gland and determined their regulation during pregnancy. COUP-TFII and EAR-2 pituitary genes display, respectively, 90 and 100% homologies with their human and mouse homologues. Cellular expression of both nuclear receptors was mainly detected in the lactotropes of male and female rats, with a prominent distribution in the nuclear compartment for EAR-2, and interestingly both proteins were significantly upregulated in pituitaries of pregnant vs. cycling female rats. Thus, our results have characterized cloning of rat pituitary COUP-TFII and EAR-2 genes, demonstrated that they are both specifically expressed in lactotropes, and strongly suggested that they may play an important role in modulating prolactin (PRL) gene expression during pregnancy.

This paper examines the precision of this algorithm, its optimal performance parameters, and the sensitivity of the method to subtle, focal changes in cortical thickness. The precision of cortical thickness measurements was studied using a simulated population study and single subject reproducibility metrics. Cortical thickness was shown to be a reliable method, reaching a sensitivity (probability of a true-positive) of 0.93. Six different cortical thickness metrics were compared. The simplest and most precise method measures the distance between corresponding vertices from the white matter to the gray matter surface. Given two groups of 25 subjects, a 0.6-mm (15%) change in thickness can be recovered after blurring with a 3-D Gaussian kernel (full-width half max = 30 mm). Smoothing across the 2-D surface manifold also improves precision; in this experiment, the optimal kernel size was 30 mm. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pilocarpine-treated animals represent an established model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) analysis of hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) slices obtained from epileptic rats 3 wk after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) revealed hyperexcitability in many limbic areas, but not in CA3 and medial EC layer III. By visualizing immunopositivity for FosB/Delta FosB-related proteins-which accumulate in the nuclei of neurons activated by seizures-we found that: (1) 24 h after SE, FosB/Delta FosB immunoreactivity was absent in medial EC layer III, but abundant in dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper (including CA3) and subiculum; (2) FosB/Delta FosB levels progressively diminished 3 and 7 d after SE, whereas remaining elevated (p < 0.01) in subiculum; (3) FosB/Delta FosB levels sharply increased 2 wk after SE (and remained elevated up to 3 wk) in dentate gyrus and in most of the other areas but not in CA3. A conspicuous neuronal damage was noticed in medial EC layer III, whereas hippocampus was more preserved. IOS analysis of the stimulus-induced responses in slices 3 wk after SE demonstrated that IOSs in CA3 were lower (p < 0.05) than in NEC slices following dentate gyrus stimulation, but not when stimuli were delivered in CA3. These findings indicate that CA3 networks are hypoactive in comparison with other epileptic limbic areas. We propose that this feature may affect the ability of hippocampal outputs to control epileptiform synchronization in EC.

The functional neuroanatomy of such elaborately skilled achievements was characterized in the present study by using O-15-water positron emission tomography to image blindfolded pianists performing a concerto by J.S. Bach. The resulting brain activity was referenced to that for bimanual performance of memorized major scales. Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tactile functions after cerebral hemispherectomy	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						touch; direction discrimination; monofilament detection; plasticity	DIRECTIONAL SENSIBILITY; LIGHT TOUCH; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; SPATIAL SUMMATION; POSTURAL CONTROL; CORTEX; SENSITIVITY; REORGANIZATION; DYSFUNCTION; PERCEPTION	Patients that were hemispherectomized due to brain lesions early in life sometimes have remarkably well-preserved tactile functions on their paretic body half. This has been attributed to developmental neuroplasticity. However, the tactile examinations generally have been fairly crude, and subtle deficits may not have been revealed. We investigated monofilament detection and three types of tactile directional sensibility in four hemispherectomized patients and six healthy controls. Patients were examined bilaterally on the face, forearm and lower leg. Normal subjects were examined unilaterally. Following each test of directional sensibility, subjects were asked to rate the intensity of the stimulation. On the nonparetic side, results were almost always in the normal range. On the paretic side, the patients' capacity for monofilament detection was less impaired than their directional sensibility. Despite the disturbed directional sensibility on their paretic side the patients rated tactile sensations evoked by the stimuli, on both their paretic and nonparetic body halves, as more intense than normals. Thus, mechanisms of plasticity seem adequate for tactile detection and intensity coding but not for more complex tactile functions such as directional sensibility. The reason for the high vulnerability of tactile directional sensibility may be that it depends on spatially and temporally precise afferent information processed in a distributed cortical network.

Recent efforts to understand the brain processes that underlie impulsivity have suggested a role for the frontal lobes. However, future thinking is unlikely to be a unitary process, and the frontal lobes are not a homogeneous entity. The present study contrasted the effects of dorsolateral and ventromedial frontal lobe damage on two distinct aspects of future thinking in humans. Temporal discounting, the subjective devaluation of reward as a function of delay, is not affected by frontal lobe injury. In contrast, a normal future time perspective (a measure of the length of an individual's self-defined future) depends on the ventromedial, but not dorsolateral, frontal lobes. Furthermore, investigation of the relationship of these two measures with classical symptoms of frontal lobe damage indicates that future time perspective correlates with apathy, not impulsivity. Apathy may deserve more attention in understanding both impaired future thinking and the impaired decision making that may result. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

At 3, 6 or 12 months of age, groups of rats received forced-choice, training as to the location of food reward in a cross maze. At 12.5 months, rats received bilateral neurotoxic lesions to the hippocampus or a control surgical procedure and 2 weeks later their memory for the spatial location was tested. Their performance was compared to that of rats with hippocampal or control lesions with no prior training on several measures of savings. The hippocampal group with no pre-training, as expected, was severely impaired in learning the location of the food reward. Compared to this group, rats with hippocampal lesions that were pre-trained consistently performed better at the shortest training-surgery interval but not at the longer ones. That is, rats with hippocampal lesions exhibited retrograde amnesia at all training-surgery intervals and a forgetting curve that paralleled that of the control groups. The results were interpreted within a framework that distinguishes between relational and associative context, and as providing evidence that the hippocampus is necessary for the retention and retrieval of memories that are bound to relational context, regardless of the age of the memory.

Sensitivity to first- and second-order local motion stimuli and coherence thresholds for global motion in random dot kinematograms were measured. Relative to full-term controls, premature children showed deficits on all three aspects of motion processing. These problems could not be accounted for by stereo deficits, amblyopia, or attentional problems. A history of mild retinopathy of prematurity and/or intraventricular hemorrhage increased risk, but deficits were observed in some children with no apparent ocular or cerebral pathology. It is important to note that, despite the observed group differences, individual profiles of performance did vary; the results suggest that these three forms of motion processing may involve separate neural mechanisms. These findings serve to increase our understanding of the organization and functional development of motion-processing subsystems in humans, and of the impact of prematurity and associated complications on visual development.

Recognition of degraded pictures of famous people was enhanced by a prior exposure to the same person's face (within-domain self-priming) or name (cross-domain self-priming) as compared to those preceded by neutral or unrelated primes. The ERP results showed first that the amplitude of the N170 component to famous face targets was modulated by within- and cross-domain self-priming, suggesting not only that the N170 component can be affected by top-down influences but also that this top-down effect crosses domains. Second, similar to our behavioral data, later ERPs to famous faces showed larger ERP self-priming effects in the within-domain than in the cross-domain condition. In addition, the present data dissociated between two topographically and temporally overlapping priming-sensitive ERP components: the first one, with a strongly posterior distribution arising at an early onset, was modulated more by within-domain priming irrespective whether the repeated face was familiar or not. The second component, with a relatively uniform scalp distribution, was modulated by within- and cross-domain priming of familiar faces. Moreover, there was no evidence for ERP-induced modulations for unfamiliar face targets in the cross-domain condition. To.-ether, our findings suggest that multiple neurocognitive events that are possibly mediated by distinct brain loci contribute to face priming effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three hypotheses were tested: a limited storage capacity, an impaired executive component. and a reduction of psychomotor speed. Verbal working memory was assessed in 14 PD patients without dementia and 14 matched control participants. Participants were administered a classical verbal span test, working memory tasks that required either updating or manipulation capacities, and Motor and psychomotor speed tasks. Patients' performance was comparable to that of control participants on the verbal span test. However, results on the working memory tasks indicated a deficit in manipulation with normal updating capacities. Motor and psychomotor slowing were found in the patient group, but slowing Could not fully account for the impairment observed in the manipulation task. Results indicated that there is a genuine but selective working memory impairment in patients with PD.

In order to test whether endogenous beta-amylolid peptides play a role in the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase, we investigated the Rapt-extracellular-regulated kinase pathway in PC12 cells expressing human beta-amyloid precursor protein containing familial Alzheimer's disease mutations. In PC12 cells transfected with mutant human beta-amyloid precursor proteins that lead to higher levels of endogenous beta-amyloid, we observed an up-regulation of phospho-extracellular-regulated kinase and higher levels of activity-induced cAMP response element-directed gene expression. These results suggest that moderate levels of endogenous beta-amyloid peptides stimulate cAMP response element-directed gene expression. This stimulation was via a Rapt/MEK/extracellular-regulated kinase signaling pathway, as it was blocked by inhibition of Rapt and MEK activities, and it requires beta-amyloid precursor protein cleavage at the gamma-site as it was abolished by a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Interestingly, in agreement with the previous observations, micromolar levels of extracellular fibrillar beta-amyloid blocked the cAMP response element-regulated gene expression stimulated by potassium and forskolin. This indicates that beta-amyloid can provoke different responses on cAMP response element-directed gene expression, such that low beta-amyloid levels may play a physiological role favoring synaptic plasticity under normal conditions while it would inhibit this mechanism under pathological conditions.

Somatostatin levels are consistently decreased in the cortex of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and in cerebrospinal fluid, and have become reproducible markers of this disease. In the present study, the distributional pattern of SSTR1-5 antigens in the frontal cortex of AD and age-matched control brains was studied using antipeptide polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against the five human somatostatin receptor sub-types. All five SSTRs were differentially expressed as membrane and cytoplasmic proteins in cortical neurons with significant variations in control vs. AD brain. In AD cortical brain region, somatostatin and neuropeptide-Y-positive neurons decreased (> 70%), and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes significantly increased (> 130%) in comparison to control brain. SSTR2 and 4 were the predominant subtypes followed by SSTR1, 3 and 5. AD cortex showed a marked reduction in neuronal expression of SSTR4 and 5 and a modest decrease in SSTR2-like immunoreactivity without any changes in SSTR1 immunoreactive neurons. In contrast, SSTR3 was the only receptor subtype that increased in AD cortex. In AD cortex, SSTR1-, 3- and 4-like immunoreactivities were strongly expressed in glial cells but not SSTR2 and 5. These findings suggest the differential loss of immunoreactivity of SSTR2, 4 and 5 but not SSTR1, and increased SSTIR3 in frontal cortex of AD brain as well as subtype-selective glial expression in AD brain. In summary, subtype-selective changes in the expression of SSTRs at protein levels in AD cortical regions suggest that somatostatin and SSTR-containing neurons are pathologically involved in AD and could possibly be used as markers of this disease.

The nerve growth factor over-expression leads to the appearance of ectopic substance P containing sensory fibers in the white matter of the spinal cord that persist throughout the life of the animal. These transgenic mice have been found to display hypersensitivity to a thermal stimulus following a sensitizing pinch stimulus known to release endogenous substance P. Surprisingly, this hypersensitivity is completely reversed following the administration of morphine, to the extent that transgenic mice become less sensitive to pain than the wild type mice given morphine. Endomorphin-2, an endogenous opioid peptide, has been found co-localized with substance P in primary sensory fibers in the spinal cord. In this study, we show that the ectopic fibers also express endomorphin-2, and describe the postnatal development of such expression, as detected by immunocytochemistry. We confirmed that endomorphin-2 expression starts later in the postnatal period than substance P. Surprisingly, transgenic animals had delayed appearance of endomorphin-2 in the superficial dorsal horn, compared with wild type, and expressed particularly high levels of endomorphin-2 immunoreactivity in the ectopic fibers from postnatal days 10-30, coinciding with the peak of nerve growth factor expression in oligodendrocytes. Endomorphin-2 immunoreactivity was still readily detected in ectopic fibers of 120-day-old animals. Furthermore, we detected immunoreactivity for the mu-opioid receptor in the ectopic fibers, where it was co-localized with endomorphin-2 immunoreactivity. In the superficial dorsal horn, there were no apparent differences in the distribution and intensity of mu-opioid receptor immunoreactivity between wild type and transgenic animals. Taken together, these data could provide an explanation for the enhanced effect of opioid analgesics in transgenic mice, when compared with control mice, as well as provide the basis for studies of the postnatal development of the hyperalgesia and allodynia demonstrated by these animals.

Because basic fibroblast growth factor has been shown to play an important role in morphological changes in astrocytes, we investigated whether basic fibroblast growth factor immunoreactivity would also be influenced by reproductive state and circulating gonadal steroids. To do this we compared astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor and glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity in hypothalamic nuclei and the cingulate cortex, area 2 among groups of cycling, late pregnant and lactating rats as well as in ovariectomized and ovariectomized hormone-rep laced females. Significant differences in both basic fibroblast growth factor and glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity were observed across groups in the supraoptic nucleus, parvocellular paraventricular nucleus, medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus and cingulate cortex 2. The pattern of change in basic fibroblast growth factor and glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity varied across regions both in direction and magnitude. For example, although in the supraoptic nucleus ovariectomized rats had lower levels of basic fibroblast growth factor-ir than cycling females, this pattern was reversed within cingulate cortex. Overall the results of this study suggest that reproductive and hormonal states are associated with robust changes in basic fibroblast growth factor and glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity in a number of brain areas but that the changes observed vary in magnitude as well as direction from one brain region to another.

NKCC1 plays a critical role in neuronal excitability and it has been recently suggested that it can contribute to hyperalgesic states by modulating the chloride concentration inside nociceptive neurons. In the spinal cord, trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors from the cytosol to the plasma membrane has been demonstrated to contribute to the development of hyperalgesia. However, it is unknown if trafficking of co-transporters can also occur in the nervous system or if it can be induced by painful stimulation. In this study, we have induced referred mechanical hyperalgesia in vivo by intracolonic instillation of capsaicin in mice. Using subcellular fractionation of proteins and cross-linking of membrane proteins we have observed that intracolonic capsaicin induced a 50% increase in NKCC1 in the plasma membrane of lumbosacral spinal cord 90 and 180 min after instillation, in parallel with a similar decrease in the cytosolic fraction. These effects returned to basal levels 6 h after capsaicin treatment. Intracolonic capsaicin also evoked a rapid (10 min) and transient phosphorylation of NKCC1, however, intracolonic saline did not produce significant changes in either NKCC1 trafficking or phosphorylation and none of the treatments induced any alterations of NKCC1 in the thoracic spinal cord. These results suggest that phosphorylation and recruitment of NKCC1 might play a role in referred mechanical hyperalgesia evoked by a painful visceral stimulus. The time course of the effects observed suggests that phosphorylation could contribute to the initial generation of hyperalgesia whereas trafficking could participate in the maintenance of hyperalgesic states observed at longer time points.

Recent evidence has implicated the cytoplasmic protein NRAGE (neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE (from Melanoma AntiGEn) homolog) in p75(NTR) signaling. To gain further insight into the role of NRAGE, we investigated the co-expression of NRAGE and p75(NTR) in mature rat brain. In all areas examined, NRAGE appeared to be confined to neurons. In the basal forebrain cholinergic complex, NRAGE immunoreactivity was evident in all p75(NTR-)positive neurons. There were many more NRAGE-positive than p75(NTR)-positive neurons in these regions, however. NRAGE was also expressed in areas of the basal forebrain that did not express p75(NTR), including the lateral septal nucleus and the nucleus accumbens. A finding in marked contrast to previous studies was the presence of p75(NTR) immunoreactivity in neuronal cell bodies in the hippocampus. Hippocampal p75NTR immunoreactivity was apparent in rats 6 months and older, and was localized to the dentate gyrus and stratum oriens. All p75(NTR)-positive neurons in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal formation were positive for NRAGE. The majority of granular cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells in the hippocampal formation were positive for NRAGE and negative for p75(NTR). NRAGE was also present in some neuronal populations that express p75(NTR) after injury, including striatal cholinergic interneurons, and motor neurons. A region of marked disparity was the cerebral cortex, in which NRAGE immunoreactivity was widespread whereas p75(NTR) was absent. The results are consistent with an important role for NRAGE in p75(NTR) signaling, as all cells that expressed p75(NTR) also expressed NRAGE. The wider distribution of NRAGE expression suggests that NRAGE may also participate in other signaling processes. (c) 2005 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular and neurochemical alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of nVH-lesioned animals suggest developmental reorganization of these structures following neonatal lesions. To determine whether nVH lesions lead to neuronal morphological changes, we investigated the effect of nVH lesion on dendritic structure and spine density of pyramidal neurons of the PFC and medium spiny neurons of the NAcc. Bilateral ibotenic acid-induced lesion of the VH was made in Sprague-Dawley pups at postnatal day 7 (P7); and at P70, neuronal morphology was quantified by modified Golgi-Cox staining. The results show that length of basilar dendrites and branching and the density of dendritic spines on layer 3 pyramidal neurons were significantly decreased in rats with nVH lesions. Medium spiny neurons from the NAcc showed a decrease in the density of dendritic spines without significant changes in dendritic length or arborization. The data, comparable to those observed in the PFC of schizophrenic patients, suggest that developmental loss of excitatory projections from the VH may lead to altered neuronal plasticity in the PFC and the NAcc that may contribute to the behavioral changes in these animals.

However, the selectivity of these deficits and their relation with the AP pathology or oxidative stress remain unclear. We therefore investigated amyloidosis-related changes in acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5-HT) innervations of hippocampus and parietal cortex by quantitative choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and 5-HT immunocytochemistry, in 6,12/14 and 18 month-old transgenic mice carrying familial AD-linked mutations (hAPP(Sw,Ind)). Further, using manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity as markers, we evaluated the relationship between oxidative stress and the ACh deficit in 18 month-old mice. Thioflavin-positive AP plaques were seen in both regions at all ages; they were more numerous in hippocampus and increased in number (> 15-fold) and size as a function of age. A majority of plaques exhibited or were surrounded by increased MnSOD immunoreactivity, and dystrophic ACh or 5-HT axons were seen in their immediate vicinity. Counts of immunoreactive axon varicosities revealed significant decreases in ACh innervation, with a sparing of the 5-HT, even in aged mice. First apparent in hippocampus, the loss of ACh terminals was in the order of 20% at 12/14 months, and not significantly greater (26%) at 18 months. In parietal cortex, the ACh denervation was significant at 18 months only, averaging 24% across the different layers. Despite increased perivascular MnSOD immunoreactivity, there was no evidence of dystrophic ACh varicosities or their accentuated loss in the perivascular area. Moreover, there was virtually no sign of tyrosine nitration in ChAT nerve terminals or neuronal cell bodies. These data suggest that aggregated AP exerts an early, non-selective and focal neurotoxic effect on both ACh and 5-HT axons, but that a selective, plaque- and oxidative stress-independent diffuse cholinotoxicity, most likely caused by soluble AP assemblies, is responsible for the hippocampal and cortical ACh denervation.

Contrary to light, however, such feeding schedules have been found not to affect the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) [Genes Dev 14 (2000) 2950; Eur J Neurosci 13 (2001) 1190]. Here, we show that in rats that are arrhythmic as a consequence of prolonged housing in constant light, a daily restricted feeding schedule not only restores behavioral rhythmicity, as previously shown [Physiol Behav 53 (1993) 509], but in addition, induces a rhythm of the clock protein, Period2 in the SCN. These findings challenge the idea that the SCN is invulnerable to feeding schedules and call for a reevaluation of the role of the SCN clock in the circadian effects of such schedules.

It has been suggested that visual stimulus-induced cholinergic activation of the visual cortex may exert a permissive role on thalamocortical inputs. However, it is not known if visual stimulation elicits cholinergic activation of high-order brain areas in the absence of attentional need. In the present study, we measured the effects of patterned visual stimulation (horizontal grating) on the release of acetylcholine with dual-probe in vivo microdialysis in the visual and the prefrontal cortices of anesthetized rats. We also used retrograde tracing to determine the anatomical relationships of cholinergic neurons with neurons of the visual system and the prefrontal cortex. Finally, we evaluated a functional correlate of this stimulation, namely c-fos immunolabeling. Patterned visual stimulation elicited significant increases in acetylcholine release in the visual cortex, accompanied by an increased number of c-fos immunoreactive neurons in this brain area. In contrast, in the prefrontal cortex, neither the level of acetylcholine release nor the number of c-fos immunoreactive neurons was significantly changed because of the stimulation. Cholinergic basal forebrain neurons projecting to the visual or the prefrontal cortices were both localized within the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca but were not immunoreactive for c-fos during visual stimulation. No parts of the visual system were found to directly project to these basal forebrain neurons. These results suggest the differential involvement of cholinergic projections in the integration of sensory stimuli, depending on the level of activity of the targeted cortical area. (c) 2005 IBRO.

DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; MU-OPIOID RECEPTORS; RAT MODEL; INJURY MODEL; SPINAL-CORD; PERIPHERAL MONONEUROPATHY; UP-REGULATION; MORPHINE; ALLODYNIA; HYPERALGESIA	The saphenous partial ligation (SPL) model is a new, easily performed, rodent model of neuropathic pain that consists of a unilateral partial injury to the saphenous nerve. The present study describes behavioral, pharmacological and molecular properties of this model. Starting between 3 and 5 days after surgery, depending on the modality tested, animals developed clear behaviors indicative of neuropathic pain such as cold and mechanical allodynia, and thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia compared with naive and sham animals. These pain behaviors were still present at 1 month. Signs of allodynia also extended to the sciatic nerve territory. No evidence of autotomy or bodyweight loss was observed. Cold and mechanical allodynia but not thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia was reversed by morphine (4 mg/kg i.p.). The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (5 mg/kg i.p.) improved signs of allodynia and hyperalgesia tested except for mechanical hyperalgesia. Gabapentin (50 mg/kg i.p.) was effective against cold and mechanical allodynia but not hyperalgesia. Finally, amitriptyline (10 mg/kg i.p.) failed to reverse allodynia and hyperalgesia and its administration even led to hyperesthesia. Neurobiological studies looking at the expression of &mu; opioid receptor (MOR), cannabinold CB1 and CB2 receptors showed a significant increase for all three receptors in ipsilateral paw skin, L3-L4 dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord of neuropathic rats compared with naive and sham animals. These changes in MOR, CB1 and CB2 receptor expression are compatible with what is observed in other neuropathic pain models and may explain the analgesia produced by morphine and WIN 55,212-2 administrations. In conclusion, we have shown that the SPL is an adequate model that will provide a new tool for clarifying peripheral mechanisms of neuropathic pain in an exclusive sensory nerve. &COPY; 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

Double labeling with fluorescent tracers was used in vitro. Fluorescein-conjugated dextran amines were applied to the proximal stump of the cut trigeminal nerve on both sides, and Texas Red-conjugated dextran amines were injected unilaterally in the middle (MRRN) or the posterior (PRRN) rhombencephalic reticular nuclei. Texas Red retrogradely labeled cells were found ipsi- and contralateral to each injection. Any of these cells with the soma or at least a major dendrite among the fluorescein-labeled trigeminal afferent axons was considered a candidate relay cell. Of these two possibilities, only cells with their soma among the fluorescein-labeled trigeminal afferents were found. The candidate relay cells projecting to the MRRN were mostly clustered at the caudal vestibular nerve level within the trigeminal descending tract, whereas the majority of those projecting to the PRRN were located more caudally. The diameter of candidate relay cells ranged from 9.2 to 24.6 mum and 9.2 to 46.1 mum, after MRRN and PRRN injections, respectively. A possible relay function for these cells was tested with electrophysiological experiments. The intracellular responses to trigeminal nerve stimulation were recorded in reticulospinal cells under control conditions and after ejections of a combination of glutamate ionotropic receptor antagonists over the candidate relay cells in small areas along the sulcus limitans. The synaptic responses elicited in MRRN reticulospinal cells were maximally depressed when ejections were made at the level of the vestibular nerve, in accord with the anatomical data. The synaptic responses in PRRN reticulospinal cells showed maximal depression when ejections were made slightly more caudally. Altogether, these results suggest that cells located within the trigeminal descending tract and projecting to reticular nuclei are likely to be the sensory trigeminal relays to reticulospinal neurones in lampreys.

J	Werk, CM; Harbour, VL; Chapman, CA				Werk, CM; Harbour, VL; Chapman, CA			Induction of long-term potentiation leads to increased reliability of evoked neocortical spindles in vivo	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sensorimotor cortex; layer V; thalamus; slow-wave sleep; high-voltage spindle; rat	CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; LAYER-V; SLEEP; RAT; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; PLASTICITY; SPIKE; TETANIZATION; HIPPOCAMPUS	Large amplitude electroencephalographic spindle waves (7-14 Hz) occur spontaneously in the neocortex during both sleep and awake immobility, and it has been proposed that synchronous neuronal activation during spindles may contribute to learning-related synaptic plasticity. Spindles can also be evoked in the sensorimotor cortex by electrical stimulation of cortical or thalamic inputs in the rat. To determine if strengthening cortical synapses can affect the initiation and maintenance of electrically evoked spindles, stimulation pulses were delivered at a range of intensities to the corpus callosum or ventrolateral thalamus in the awake rat before and after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by tetanization of the corpus callosum. The morphology of evoked spindles was similar to that of naturally occurring spindles. Spindles were evoked less reliably during slow-wave sleep than during waking, and this was correlated with smaller synaptic responses during slow-wave sleep. Similar to previous findings, daily tetanization of the corpus callosum for 15 days decreased the early component and increased the late component of synaptic responses evoked by corpus callosum stimulation, but did not significantly affect synaptic responses evoked by thalamic stimulation. Similarly, LTP induction increased the reliability with which low-intensity corpus callosum stimulation evoked spindles, but increases in spindles evoked by thalamic stimulation were not significant. Synaptic potentiation and the increased reliability of spindles developed with a similar time-course over the 15-day LTP induction period. These results reflect strong correlations between the strength of cortical layer V activation and the initiation of spindles in the sensorimotor cortex, and support the idea that monosynaptic and polysynaptic horizontal collaterals of layer V neurons can play a significant role in the initiation of spindles.

The immediate shock deficit paradigm was used, together with bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry, to isolate the contribution of different aspects of contextual fear conditioning to neurogenesis. Contextual fear learning caused a 33% decrease in the number of proliferating cells that was anatomically restricted to the dentate gyrus with no change in cell survival or differentiation. This attenuation was not related to exposure to the conditioned stimulus alone, the footshock unconditioned stimulus alone, or the expression of fear to the context after training. Instead, the effect of context conditioning on cell proliferation appears to be specifically due to the formation of an association between the context and shock during training, an amygdala dependent function.

To see if these neurons are similarly or differentially modulated by neurotransmitters of the major brainstem arousal systems, the effects of noradrenaline (NA) and carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, were examined on identified Hcrt/Orx and MCH neurons in rat hypothalamic slices. Whereas both agonists depolarized and excited Hcrt/Orx neurons, they both hyperpolarized MCH neurons by direct postsynaptic actions. According to the activity profiles of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus and cholinergic pontomesencephalic neurons across the sleep-waking cycle, the Hcrt/Orx neurons would be excited by NA and acetylcholine (ACh) and thus active during arousal, whereas the MCH neurons would be inhibited by NA and ACh and thus inactive during arousal while disinhibited and possibly active during slow wave sleep. According to the present pharmacological results, Hcrt/Orx neurons may thus stimulate arousal in tandem with other arousal systems, whereas MCH neurons may function in opposition with other arousal systems and thus potentially dampen arousal to promote sleep.

However, the validity of this approach may be questioned since pharmacological procedures are usually required to elicit spontaneous events similar to the EEG activity recorded in vivo. Here, we report that when superfused with control medium, rat brain slices comprising the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices along with a portion of the basolateral/lateral nuclei of the amygdala can synchronously generate periodic oscillatory activity at 5-11 Hz every 5-30 s. The periodic events: (i) correspond intracellularly to synaptic depolarizations in regularly firing neurons analyzed in the three areas; (ii) have no fixed site of onset; (iii) spread with time lags of 8-20 ms; and (iv) continue to occur asynchronously after their surgical isolation. NMDA receptor antagonism reduced the duration of the oscillatory events, while glutamatergic non-NMDA receptor antagonism abolished them. Activation of mu-opioid receptors, a procedure that hyperpolarizes interneurons thus decreasing GABA release, reversibly decreased the rate of occurrence of periodic oscillatory activity (POA). However, periodic events continued to occur during application of GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptor antagonists as well as in the presence of the cholinergic agent carbachol. We also found that POA was. abolished by baclofen and irreversibly reduced by the gap junction decoupler carbenoxolone. These findings demonstrate that parahippocampal networks in a brain slice preparation can generate periodic, synchronous activity under quasi-physiological conditions. These network oscillations (i) reflect the activation of ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors, (ii) are contributed by gap-junction interactions, and (iii) are controlled by GABA(B) receptors that are presumably located presynaptically.

Maternal effects commonly reflect the quality of the environment and are most likely mediated by the quality of the maternal provision (egg, propagule, etc.), which in turn determines growth rates and adult phenotype. In this paper, we review data from the rat that suggest comparable forms of maternal effects on both defensive responses to threat and reproductive behavior and which are mediated by variations in maternal behavior. Ultimately, we will need to contend with the reality that neural development, function and health are defined by social and economic influences. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A substantial proportion of these adults consider that this has come about because they are "not musical" Some of these people may be "true" congenital amusics, characterized by specific and substantial anomalies in the processing of musical pitch and rhythm sequences, while at the same time displaying normal processing of speech and language. It is likely, however, that many adults who believe that they are unmusical are neurologically normal. We could call these adults "false" amusics. Acquisition of musical competence has multiple personal, social, and environmental precursors. Deficiencies in these areas may lead to lack of musical achievement, despite the fact that an individual possesses the necessary underlying capacities. Adults may therefore self-define as "unmusical" or "tone-deaf" for reasons unconnected to any underlying anomaly. This paper reports on two linked research studies. The first is an interview study with adults defining themselves as tone-deaf or unmusical. The interview schedule was designed to discover what criteria are being used in their self-definitions. Preliminary results suggest that performance criteria (e.g., judging oneself as unable to sing) play a major role, even for people who claim and demonstrate no perceptual deficits. The second study reports progress on the development of new subtests for a revised version of the Montreal Battery for the Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA, Peretz et al., 2003). This currently contains six tests that allow for the assessment of melodic perception: contour, intervals, scale, rhythm, meter, and recognition memory. The MBEA does not assess two capacities that are generally accepted as central to normal music cognition: harmony and emotion. The development and norming of the emotion subtest will be described. When completed, the MBEA(R) will form a robust screening device for use with the general population, whose purpose is to discriminate "true" from "false" amusics. Such discrimination is essential to achieve a better understanding of the variety of causes of low musical achievement.

Nearly 17% of over 2000 first-year psychology students at Queen's University self-reported tone deafness. Two hundred students were recruited from this pool of students, comprising 100 who reported tone deafness and 100 who reported that they were not tone-deaf (NTD). The study contained two parts. In part 1, participants completed the six tests of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) developed by Peretz and collaborators. In part 2, participants completed an extensive questionnaire designed to elicit details about musical experiences, abilities, training, and interests. Twenty-eight questionnaire items allowing a quantitative response were subjected to factor analysis. Four orthogonal components emerged from the analysis. The components reflected self-report of (1) vocal production, (2) music instruction, (3) listening attitudes, and (4) childhood memories of musical environment. Results for each of the MBEA tests and composite scores for all tests were regressed on participants' factor scores. The best and significant predictors of the MBEA scores were factor I and factor II, followed by factor III. Factor scores accounted for a higher percentage of the variance in MBEA composite test results (27%) than the self-report of tone deafness alone (7%). The musical difficulties revealed by the MBEA test results for some participants warrant further attention and study. However, an encouraging conclusion from the MBEA results is that many individuals who consider themselves "tone-dear' may not, in fact, have perceptual difficulties, and these individuals should be supported in any of their efforts to proceed with music enjoyment and instruction.

Two questionnaire studies addressing the role of music in everyday life, and unusual reactions to sound, are described. Additionally, the findings from two empirical behavioral studies and a neuroimaging study are reviewed. The findings show that individuals with Williams syndrome tend to be more engaged in musical activities than others, and I report a possible neuroanatomical correlate of this engagement, with increased activation in the right amygdala to music and to noise. Williams syndrome represents a compelling model of the relationship between genes, brains, and such complex cognitive behaviors as music.

The underlying cause of this ligand-dependent neurodegenerative disease is expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene which leads to lengthening of the polyglutamine tract in the AR protein. Recently, the effects of the polyglutamine-expanded AR have been explored in a number of cellular and animal models. Common themes include research on polyglutamine-containing nuclear inclusions and the effect of molecular chaperone overexpression on their formation. In addition, investigations have highlighted the role that abnormal transcriptional regulation, proteasome dysfunction and altered axonal transport may play in disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest a number of potential treatments for restoring neuronal function. One of the most interesting advances in SBMA research has been the creation of mouse models that recapitulate the key features of SBMA progression in men. Lowering testosterone levels in affected transgenic male mice rescued, and even reversed the polyglutamine-induced neuromuscular phenotype, indicating that manipulating androgen levels in men could be of therapeutic benefit. Although the question of why only a distinct subset of neurons is affected by polyglutamine expansion of the AR remains unsolved, future research will provide further insights into the mechanisms contributing to disease progression in SBMA.

Genetic work in Drosophila has suggested that Staufen plays a role in the de-repression of translation of oskar mRNA following localization. To determine whether Staufen1 can play a similar role in mammals, we studied translation of transcripts in the presence or in the absence of Staufen1. Translationally repressed mRNAs were generated by fusing the structured human immunodeficiency virus type 1 trans-activating response (TAR) element to the 5' end of a reporter transcript. In rabbit reticulocyte lysates and in mammalian cultured cells, the addition of Staufen1 resulted in the up-regulation of reporter activity when translation was driven by the TAR-bearing RNA. In contrast, Staufen1 had no effect on translation of efficiently translated mRNAs lacking an apparent structured 5' end, suggesting that Staufen1-binding to the 5' end is required for enhanced translation. Consistently, Staufen1 RNA-binding activity is necessary for this translational effect. In addition, similar up-regulation of translation was observed when Staufen1 was tethered to the 5' end of mRNAs via other structured RNAs, the highest level of translational increase being obtained with the bona fide Staufen1-binding site of the Arf1 transcript. The expression of Staufen1 promoted polysomal loading of TAR-luciferase transcripts resulting in enhanced translation. Our results support a model in which the expression of Staufen1 and its interaction with the 5' end of RNA and ribosomes facilitate translation initiation.

We have used a novel stimulus, termed a 'sinring', that is a radially modulated sine-wave arc, Gaussian enveloped in both angular and radial directions. This stimulus overcomes the problem inherent in Gabor stimuli of confounding stimulus spatial frequency, size, and eccentricity and so allows contrast sensitivity to be tracked accurately into the periphery. Our results show that L/M cone opponency declines steeply across the human periphery and becomes behaviourally absent by 25 - 30 deg (in the nasal field). This result suggests that any L/M cone-opponent neurons found in primate peripheral retina beyond this limit are unlikely to be significant for colour contrast detection measured behaviourally.

Triptans are selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists that represent effective therapeutic options for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks but with higher acquisition costs relative to usual care therapies. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of rizatriptan treatment compared with 'Usual Care' or other triptans available in Canada for patients with moderate-to-severe migraine for whom other therapies (e.g. NSAIDs, simple analgesics) are insufficient or contraindicated. Methods: A decision-analysis model was created to estimate migraine treatment costs over a 24-hour period in patients with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe migraine as defined by the International Headache Society criteria. Costs and clinical outcomes were observed over a 24-hour period from therapy initiation. Efficacy measures consisted of 'pain-free response at 2 hours' and 'sustained pain free for 2-24 hours'. Oral rizatriptan 10mg was compared with other oral triptans (i.e. sumatriptan 50 or 100mg), naratriptan 2.5mg and zolmitriptan 2.5mg, based on a meta-analysis and compared with 'Usual Care' based on a naturalistic study of people who experience migraine and who were similar to the target population. 'Usual Care' was defined as an aggregate of medications prescribed for the Canadian population for the indication of migraine, weighted by the relative frequency of use of prescriptions over a 1-year period. Analyses were conducted from the Ontario (Canada) Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOH&LTC) perspective and the broader societal perspective. Results are presented as the cost per migraine attack aborted (i.e. pain free at 2 hours), as well as the cost per QALY. Several one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. All costs are expressed in 2002 $Can. Results: Cost estimates are similar to previously published Canadian studies. Rizatriptan compared with 'Usual Care' produced an incremental cost per attack aborted of $Can49.82 and a cost per QALY gained of $Can31 845 from the MOH&LTC perspective. When a societal perspective was considered (which included time loss from paid and unpaid work activities), rizatriptan dominates 'Usual Care': that is, it is cost saving and more effective. All other triptans are also dominated by rizatriptan as they offer higher costs and lower efficacy. Conclusions: This study shows that rizatriptan treatment for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraines may represent a cost-effective strategy for improving care of migraine patients in Canada.

Ischemic retinopathy remains a common cause of visual impairment and blindness in the industrialized world due to relatively ineffective treatment. Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is an established model of retinopathy of prematurity associated with vascular cell injury culminating in microvascular degeneration, which precedes an abnormal neovascularization. The retina is a tissue particularly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the ischemic retina becomes highly sensitive to lipid peroxidation initiated by oxygenated free radicals. Retinal tissue responds to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli by the activation of phospholipases and the consequent release from membrane phospholipids of biologically active metabolites. Activation of phospholipase A(2) is the first step in the synthesis of two important classes of lipid second messengers, the eicosanoids and a membrane-derived phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF). These lipid mediators accumulate in the retina in response to injury and a physiologic role of these metabolites in retinal vasculature remains for the most part to be determined; albeit proposed roles have been suggested for some. The eicosanoids, in particular the prostanoids, thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) and PAF are abundantly generated following an oxidant stress and contribute to neurovascular injury. TXA(2) and PAF play an important role in the retinal microvacular degeneration of OIR by directly inducing endothelial cell death and potentially could contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathies. This review focuses on mechanisms that precede the development of neovascularization, most notably regarding the role of lipid mediators that partake in microvascular degeneration.

The first subcomponent renders the closed-loop system globally practically stable. The second one is a robust adaptive sliding tracking controller which utilizes a special gaussian RBF neural network for online estimation of rolling moment coefficient as the main uncertainty of the model. To show the ability of the proposed combinatory control structure, it has been implemented to delta wing system to follow a sophisticated reference trajectory. Implementing the proposed combinatory control structure (controller with internal loop) enhanced the tracking performance in comparison to the controller without internal loop. Adding two more control inputs as a fraction of the first control input in the combinatory control structure (can be interpreted as perturbations in the vortex breakdown dynamics), also enhanced the tracking controller performance compared with the case without perturbations. Delta wing system simulation study demonstrated acceptable performance of the proposed combinatory control structure.

The neural network takes analog sensor data as input and outputs to stepper motors controlling steering and throttle. The robot follows a randomly moving target in a closed environment 67% better than by chance, based on average distance to target. Simulation results suggest that silicon neural networks based on biological computing principles are effective, efficient, and compact embedded controllers. Test results should be confirmed on a physical implementation of the robot, and research should continue in network and circuit optimisation, as well as in the creation of robot societies.

Computer simulations are performed with fuzzy ARTMAP networks trained for one fio epoch, through cross-validation, and until network convergence, using several data sets representing these pattern recognition problems. By comparing the generalisation error and resources required by these networks, the extent of overtraining due to factors such as data set structure, training strategy, number of training epochs, data normalisation, and training set size, is demonstrated. A significant degradation in fuzzy ARTMAP performance due to overtraining is shown to depend on the training set size and the number of training epochs for pattern recognition problems with overlapping class distributions.

To study cortico-striatal and cortico-subthalamic connectivity in the human brain we studied normal volunteers and parkinsonian patients undergoing stereotactic surgery for bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulators. Normal volunteers were investigated with [C-11]raclopride PET following repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and primary motor cortex (MC) and parkinsonian patients were studied using intra-operative single unit recordings from STN during stereotactic surgery while stimulating the MC with single-pulse TMS. In normals, repetitive TMS of the DLPFC was shown to induce release of dopamine in the ipsilateral caudate nucleus while repetitive TMS of the MC decreased significantly [C-11]raclopride binding potentials in the ipsilateral putamen. In parkinsonian patients, TMS induced an excitation in 74.9% of STN neurons investigated. This activation was followed by a long-lasting inhibition of the STN neuronal activity which did not correlate with PD severity. These in-vivo studies suggest that cortico-striatal and cortico-subthalamic projections may promote a powerful modulatory control of their subcortical target regions in the human brain.

Two standpoints have been considered so far. On the one hand, effective connectivity describes the influence that regions exert on each other. Yet, it requires the prior definition of a structural model that often turns out to be unknown. On the other hand, functional connectivity, based on marginal correlation, sets the framework for exploratory data-driven measures of statistical interdependency between regions. Unfortunately, one usually cannot use this knowledge to infer potential patterns of effective connectivity from the data. In this abstract, we emphasize the main reason why effective connectivity remains out of reach of functional connectivity. More precisely, we show that marginal correlation is unable to deal with mediation. Using a simple instance of structural equation modeling (SEM), we demonstrate how this model entails certain patterns of functional interaction that can be discriminated by functional connectivity and how other patterns cannot be differentiated. We then introduce conditional correlation as a way to achieve such a differentiation and show how it is related to mediated interaction.

Now suppose we replace the numbers by vector-valued images in any number of dimensions. The correlation random field is the 'image' of correlations at all possible pairs of points in the two images. We use random field theory to set a threshold on the correlations so that those above the threshold are statistically significant, corrected for searching over all pairs of points. We apply this idea to resting state networks of fMRI images of brain activity, and networks of connectivity in cortical thickness.

Towards this end, a dynamic multilayer perceptron (DMLP) network with dynamic neurons is considered. The neuron model consists of a second order linear IIR filter and a nonlinear activation function with adjustable parameters. Based on a given set of input-output data pairs collected from the attitude control subsystem, the network parameters are adjusted to minimize a performance index specified by the output estimation error. The proposed dynamic neural network structure is applied for detecting faults in a reaction wheel (RW) that is often used as an actuator in the ACS of a satellite. The performance and capabilities of the proposed dynamic neural network is investigated and compared to a model-based observer residual generator design that is to detect various fault scenarios.

A model-based adaptive nonlinear parameter estimation technique is used based on a highly accurate reaction wheel dynamical model while each parameter is an indication of a specific type of fault in the system. The estimation is based on the nonlinear finite-memory filtering strategy that is solved for optimal estimation functions. To make the optimization feasible for on-line application, the optimal estimation functions are approximated by MLP neural networks thus reducing the functional optimization problem to a nonlinear programming problem, namely, the optimization of the neural weights. The well-known standard back-propagati on algorithm and back-propagation through-time algorithm were employed inside the neural adaptation algorithms to obtain the required gradients. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the methodology for the proposed application.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): brain activation in 12 FA+ schizophrenia patients during passive viewing of sad film excerpts was studied before and after a median of 5.5-months treatment with quetiapine. Random-effects 'paired sample t-test' analyses of brain activation before quetiapine (contrast=sad-neutral, before-after) revealed significant activation in the brainstem (pons, medulla). After quetiapine, the same contrast showed significant prefrontal activation (BA 9: 10 and 11)Activation of key prefrontal areas involved in emotion processing and significant symptoms improvement as measured by the subjective rating scale and PANSS suggests the potential effect of quetiapine in improving blunted affect related symptoms (i.e., passive withdrawal, emotional withdrawal, social avoidance) in schizophrenia.

J	Bermack, JE; Debonnel, G				Bermack, JE; Debonnel, G			Distinct modulatory roles of sigma receptor subtypes on glutamatergic responses in the dorsal hippocampus	SYNAPSE			English	Article						electrophysiology; 4-IBP; NE-100; haloperidol	METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; INDUCED NEURONAL ACTIVATION; LONG-TERM TREATMENTS; BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE; MEMORY PROCESSES; INVERSE AGONISM; LIGANDS; BINDING; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	Sigma ligands have been previously shown to modulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) response in the dorsal hippocampus, such that low doses of sigma agonists dose-dependently potentiate the response. Recent studies with the sigma ligand 4-IBP found it to act differently from the sigma ligands (+)-pentazocine and DTG in the modulation of 5-HT firing activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), as its effects were not blocked by the sigma antagonists which reversed those of (+)-pentazocine or DTG. Thus, this study set out to characterize 4-IBP's action at sigma receptors using the hippocampal paradigm of sigma ligand activity. Interestingly, we found that in 50% of the neurons recorded, 4-IBP (20 mug/kg i.v.) produced a potentiation of both NMDA- and quisqualate (QUIS)-induced responses. In the other 50% of neurons, 4-IBP produced an attenuation of both QUIS and NMDA responses. The sigma, antagonist NE-100 blocked the reduction induced by 4-IBP, while the nonselective sigma antagonist haloperidol blocked all responses induced by 4-1BP. These data suggest that, in this model, 4-1BP may be acting as an agonist or inverse agonist of sigma receptors. Furthermore, the initial responses to NMDA and QUIS were higher in the group in which 4-1BP induced an attenuation of the firing activity. This suggests a modulatory role for 4-IBP on glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, which appears to involve two distinct pathways, mediated by different sigma, receptor subtypes, an NE-100 and haloperidol-sensitive sigma, receptor, and an NE-100-insensitive, haloperidol-sensitive sigma, receptor. This modulatory role has implications for disorders that involve glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Although most people are unable to name or place pitch values in consistent, well-defined categories, as they do for color, stable long-term memory for pitch has been shown in certain animal species, in infants, and in both adult musicians and non-musicians. 'Absolute pitch', the rare ability to label pitches without external reference, appears to require acquisition early in life, and involves specialized brain mechanisms, now partially identified. Research on pitch coding strategies informs wider theories in cognitive science of semantic memory, and the nature of perceptual categories.

We examined whether gaze perception affects face processing during two tasks: Online gender judgement, and later incidental recognition memory. Individual faces were presented with eyes directed either straight towards the viewer or away, while these faces were seen in either frontal or three-quarters view. Participants were slower to make gender judgements for faces with direct versus averted eye gaze, but this effect was particularly pronounced for faces with opposite gender to the observer, and seen in three-quarters view. During subsequent surprise recognition-memory testing, recognition was better for faces previously seen with direct than averted gaze, again especially for the opposite gender to the observer. The effect of direct gaze was stronger in both tasks when the head was seen in three-quarters rather than in frontal view, consistent with the greater salience of perceived eye contact for deviated faces. However, in the memory test, face recognition was also relatively enhanced for faces of opposite gender in front views when their gaze was averted rather than direct. Together, these result, indicate that perceived eye contact can interact with facial processing during gender judgements and recognition memory, even when gaze direction is task-irrelevant, and particularly for faces of opposite gender to the observer (an influence which controls for stimulus factors when considering observers of both genders). These findings appear consistent with recent neuroimaging evidence that social facial cues can modulate visual processing in cortical regions involved in face processing and memory, presumably via interconnections with brain systems specialized for gaze perception and social monitoring.

Here we examine the dependence of neuronal direction selectivity on stimulus contrast, both for first-order (luminance-modulated, sine-wave grating) and second-order (contrast-modulated envelope) stimuli. We measured responses from single neurons in area 18 of cat visual cortex to both kinds of moving stimuli over a wide range of contrasts (1.25-80%). Direction-selective contrast response functions (CRFs) were calculated as the preferred-minus-null difference in average firing frequency as a function of contrast. We also applied receiver operating characteristic analysis to our CRF data to obtain neurometric functions characterizing the potential ability of each neuron to discriminate motion direction at each contrast level tested. CRFs for sine-wave gratings were usually monotonic; however, a substantial minority of neurons (35%) exhibited nonmonotonic CRFs (such that the degree of direction selectivity decreased with increasing contrast). The underlying preferred and nonpreferred direction CRFs were diverse, often having different shapes in a given neuron. Neurometric functions for direction discrimination showed a similar degree of heterogeneity, including instances of nonmonotonicity. For contrast-modulated stimuli, however, CRFs for either carrier or envelope contrast were always monotonic. In a given neuron, neurometric thresholds were typically much higher for second- than for first-order stimuli. These results demonstrate that the degree of a cell's direction selectivity depends on the contrast at which it is measured, and therefore is not a characteristic parameter of a neuron. In general, contrast response functions for first-order stimuli were very heterogeneous in shape and sensitivity, while those for second-order stimuli showed less sensitivity and were quite stereotyped in shape.

The NIRS receiver makes use of dynamic threshold transistors (DTMOS) for low voltage (1-V), low power and low noise enhancement. The design is composed of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). The OTA differential input pairs are in a class AB configuration, and uses DTMOS devices for input common-mode range enhancement. Post-layout simulations under a 5 pF load, using 0.18 mu m CMOS technology results are, for the OTA, an input referred noise of 134 nV/root Hz at 1 kHz, and a power consumption of 16.7 mu W without any extra noise reduction technique. Also, the TIA gives 208 pA/root Hz at 1 kHz, while having a power consumption of only 10.9 mu W. The proposed analog front-end circuits have been used to implement a NIRS receiver instrument with improved ultra low-light level measurements, high resolution and good temperature stability.

Inspired by the physiological nature of functioning of a neuron, i.e., production of a bundle of actions potentials corresponding to a stimulus of sufficient strength, an analog to digital (A/D) converter is implemented using transistors in a standard CMOS integrated circuit technology. The approach is simple and the result is a low voltage low power unipolar A/D converter working in middle frequency range. The converter is very competitive with other known converters in terms of power consumption vs. bits of resolution and the clock frequency.

Activation of neuronal 5HT(1A) receptors appears to be involved in the neuroprotective effects. It remains to be elucidated if astroglial cells are responsive to the 5HT(1A) neuroprotective effects. The participation of astroglial S100B trophic factor has been proposed since 5HT(1A) activation leads to S100B release and nanomolar concentration level of this molecule showed pro-survival activity in neuronal cultures. Using the cortical devascularization model (CD; unilateral pial disruption), a procedure that results in localized ischemia without producing direct physical damage to brain tissue, we tested the effects of a full 511TIA agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, or the antagonist WAY-100635 on cortical neuronal survival, astroglial cell response and S 10013 expression. Wistar rats were subjected to CD lesion which consisted of a craniotomy followed by physical damage to the underlying pial blood vessels. Two and twenty-four hours after the CD lesion, animals received intraperitoneally 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg), WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (sterile saline). At 3, 7 or 14 days post-lesion, animals were sacrificed and their brains processed for immunohistochemistry to detect GFAP, vimentin, MAP-2, S100B and nuclear Hoechst staining. S100B level in the brain cortex and serum was quantified by an ELISA assay. Serum S100B was considered an index of S100B release. 8-OH-DPAT treatment reduced neuronal death, dendrite loss, astroglial hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In contrast, WAY-100635 treatment increased these parameters of damage. S100B intracellular immunoreactivity in astrocytes and total S100B level showed long-lasting changes after the CD lesion and subsequent treatments depending on the 5HT(1A) activity. The level of serum S100B was increased in 8-OH-DPAT-treated animals. Increased damage observed in WAY-100635-treated animals supports the hypothesis that the protective 8-OH-DPAT action may be mediated by specific 5HT(1A) receptors. The reduction in astroglial hypertrophy and hyperplasia as well as long-term changes in S100B immunoreactivity and increased S100B release that we observed allows us to hypothesize that astroglial cells may play an important role in 5HT(1A)-mediated neuroprotection.

Internally deleted forms of PrPC resembling Dpl such as PrPDelta32-121 produce a similar PrPC-sensitive pro-apoptotic phenotype in transgenic mice. Here we demonstrate that these phenotypic attributes of wt Dpl, wt PrPC, and PrPDelta132-121 can be accurately recapitulated by transfected mouse cerebellar granule cell cultures. This system was then explored by mutagenesis of the co-expressed prion proteins to reveal functional determinants. By this means, neuroprotective activity of wt PrPC was shown to be nullified by a deletion of the N-terminal charged region implicated in endocytosis and retrograde axonal transport (PrPDelta23-28), by deletion of all five octarepeats (PrPDelta51-90), or by glycine replacement of four octarepeat histidine residues required for selective binding of copper ions (Prnp"H/G"). In the case of Dpl, overlapping deletions defined a requirement for the gene interval encoding helices B and B' (DplDelta101-125). These data suggest contributions of copper binding and neuronal trafficking to wt PrPC function in vivo and place constraints upon current hypotheses to explain Dpl/PrPC antagonism by competitive ligand binding. Further implementation of this assay should provide a fuller understanding of the attributes and subcellular localizations required for activity of these enigmatic proteins.

The extracellular domains of N-cadherin play important roles in homophilic cell adhesion, but the contribution of each domain to this phenomenon has not been fully evaluated. In particular, the following questions remain unanswered: what is the minimal domain combination that can generate cell adhesion, how is domain organization related to adhesive strength, and does the cytoplasmic domain serve to facilitate extracellular domain interaction? To address these issues, we made serial constructs of the extracellular domains of N-cadherin and produced various cell lines to examine adhesion properties. We show that the first domain of N-cadherin alone on the cell surface fails to generate adhesive activity and that the first two domains of N-cadherin form the "minimal essential unit" to mediate cell adhesion. Cell lines expressing longer extracellular domains or N-cadherin wild type cells formed larger cellular aggregates than those expressing shorter aggregates. However, adhesion strength, as measured by a shearing test, did not reveal any differences among these aggregative cell lines, suggesting that the first two domains of N-cadherin cells generate the same strength of adhesive activity as longer extracellular domain cells. Furthermore, truncations of the first two domains of N-cadherin are also sufficient to form cis-dimerization at an adhesive junction. Our findings suggest that the extracellular domains of N-cadherin have distinct roles in cell adhesion, i.e. the first two domains are responsible for homophilic adhesion activity, and the other domains promote adhesion efficiency most likely by positioning essential domains relatively far out from the cell surface.

These animals carry both the amyloid precursor protein Swedish and 717 mutation (APP(SW+717)) as well as the presenilin 1 Finnish mutation (PS1(FINN)). This transgenic rat model displays intracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) in neurons of the neocortex and the hippocampus (CA2 and CA3). The hippocampus was selected as it is one of the first brain regions affected in AD and is involved in the processing of short-term memory and spatial memory. Applying a proteomic approach, we demonstrate that the expression of APP(SW+717) and PS1(FINN) transgenes causes changes in expression of hippocampal proteins, some of which have been previously linked to learning and memory formation. The protein alterations documented here occur in the absence of plaque formation and prior to the onset of cognitive deficits later observed in these transgenic rats. This indicates that molecular changes take place in the hippocampal neurons in response to expression of mutant proteins APP(SW+717) and PS1(FINN), which precede the occurrence of overt extracellular accumulation of extracellular amyloid. The implications of these findings on our understanding of the early stages of AD are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Decreases in parkin activity may also contribute to neurodegeneration in sporadic forms of PD. Here, we show that bcl-2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5), a BAG family member, directly interacts with parkin and the chaperone Hsp70. Within this complex, BAG5 inhibits both parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and Hsp70-mediated refolding of misfolded proteins. BAG5 enhances parkin sequestration within protein aggregates and mitigates parkin-dependent preservation of proteasome function. Finally, BAG5 enhances dopamine neuron death in an in vivo model of PD, whereas a mutant that inhibits BAG5 activity attenuates dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This contrasts with the antideath functions ascribed to BAG family members and suggests a potential role for BAG5 in promoting neurodegeneration in sporadic PD through its functional interactions with parkin and Hsp70.

Here, we test if the SEF encodes desired gaze directions in a simple retinal (eye-centered) frame, such as the superior colliculus, or in some other, more complex frame. We electrically stimulated 55 SEF sites in two head-unrestrained monkeys to evoke 3D eye-head gaze shifts and then mathematically rotated these trajectories into various reference frames. Each stimulation site specified a specific spatial goal when plotted in its intrinsic frame. These intrinsic frames varied site by site, in a continuum from eye-, to head-, to space/body-centered coding schemes. This variety of coding schemes provides the SEF with a unique potential for implementing arbitrary reference frame transformations.

HSA is a heterogeneous group of disorders in which pyramidal tract features overlap cerebellar characteristics. The families are assumed to have the same condition as, although apparently unrelated, all originate in a. historically isolated cluster of rural communities and link to the same locus at 12p13, SAX1. Clinically the phenotype is very variable but lower limb hypertonicity and hyper-reflexia are early and prominent generally preceded by eye movement abnormality, an impaired vertical downward saccade and a typical involuntary head jerk. These are followed by variable levels of ataxia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Onset occurs in the first two decades and can be detected in most by early adulthood. Significant mobility problems are present by the fourth decade with a broad based ataxic and spastic gait. MRI scans of brain and spinal cord were normal. Neuropathology showed degeneration of corticospinal tracts and posterior columns and midbrain neuronal loss. The phenotype is striking in its diversity among and within families and the variability of expression can be observed within the same sibship. Pedigree analysis shows no evidence of anticipation or any sex differences in severity. The condition is unusually prevalent in the province of Newfoundland, which is characteristic of a founder effect followed by isolation and large family size. Fine mapping efforts have reduced the critical interval of the SAX1 locus to 1.9 Mb. Identification of the SAX1 gene will help to clarify the pathogenesis of this type of HSA.

Unlike ho-2, the ho-1 gene in neural (and many systemic) tissues is exquisitely sensitive to Upregulation by a host of pro-oxidant and other noxious stimuli. In Alzheimer disease, HO-1 immunoreactivity is significantly augmented in neurons and astrocytes of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex relative to age-matched, nondemented controls and colocalizes to senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and corpora amylacea. In Parkinson disease, HO-I decorates Lewy bodies of affected dopaminergic neurons and is highly overexpressed in astrocytes residing within the substantia nigra. The ho-1 gene is also upregulated in glial cells within multiple sclerosis plaques; in the vicinity of human cerebral infarcts, hemorrhages, and contusions; and in various other degenerative and non degenerative human CNS disorders. The products of the heme oxygenase reaction, free ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin/bilirubin, are all biologically active molecules that may profoundly influence tissue redox homeostasis under a wide range of pathophysiological conditions. Evidence adduced from whole animal and in vitro studies indicates that enhanced HO-1 activity may either ameliorate or exacerbate neural injury, effects likely contingent upon the specific model employed, the duration and intensity of HO-I induction, and the chemistry of the local redox microenvironment. HO-1 hyperactivity also promotes mitochondrial sequestration of nontransferrin iron in oxidatively challenged astroglia and may thereby contribute to the pathological iron deposition and bioenergetic failure amply documented in aging and degenerating human neural tissues.

Visuo-spatial tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were administered to assess cognitive performances in 88 subjects. The Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS) was used to measure dimensions of community functioning. Our results showed that the sustained attention score was significantly associated with the global community functioning score and with two specific dimensions: "adjustment to living" and "behavioral problems". No association was found between other cognitive indices and MCAS scores. Since the sustained attention task mainly involves the executive component of working memory. these findings suggest that attentional control processes are limiting factors for community functioning in schizophrenia outpatients. Measures of such processes could serve as key indices of disability in clinical practice. Attention and working memory training may be helpful to improve community functioning in subjects with schizophrenia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective: To determine whether direct forced-choice techniques and indirect face-priming methods yielded similar behavioral estimates of covert ability in a series of prosopagnosic patients. Methods: The authors tested seven control subjects and seven prosopagnosic patients. Six patients had an apperceptive prosopagnosia: one with childhood onset, three with bilateral lesions, and two with unilateral occipitotemporal lesions. The last had an associative prosopagnosia from bilateral anterior temporal lesions. The direct tests of covert function involved sorting faces by occupation or the forced choosing of which of two faces was famous with a name cue. The indirect test assessed name classification by occupation after priming with a facial stimulus. Results: In normal subjects, the chief priming effect was facilitation by the true face. In the six patients with apperceptive prosopagnosia, direct covert measures were correlated with the face-priming effect, with better covert ability in patients with unilateral posterior lesions. In the patient with associative prosopagnosia, there was a dissociation between excellent direct covert function and absent face priming. Conclusions: Direct and indirect covert functions likely share similar mechanisms in patients with apperceptive prosopagnosia and may reflect residual activity in anterior and left hemispheric components of the normal face-processing network. However, face priming may be ineffectual in patients with severely degraded facial memories from anterior temporal damage. This may indicate a difference between residual patterns of face-related activity in associative and apperceptive prosopagnosia.

Mutations in the Vangl2 gene cause a neural tube defect (craniorachischisis) characteristic of the looptail (Lp) mouse. Studies in model organisms indicate that Vangl proteins play a key developmental role in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) and in regulating convergent extension (CE) movements during embryogenesis. The role of Vangl1 in these processes is virtually unknown, and the molecular function of Vangl1 and Vangl2 in PCP and CE is poorly understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that both mouse Vangl1 and Vangl2 physically interact with the three members of the cytoplasmic Dishevelled (Dvl) protein family. This interaction is shown to require both the predicted cytoplasmic C-terminal half of Vangl1/2 and a portion of the Dvl protein containing PDZ and DIX domains. In addition, we show that the two known Vangl2 loss-of-function mutations identified in two independent Lp alleles associated with neural tube defects impair binding to Dvl1, Dvl2, and Dvl3. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the neural tube defect seen in Lp mice. Our observations indicate that Vangl1 biochemical properties parallel those of Vangl2 and that Vangl1 might, therefore, participate in PCP and CE either in concert with Vangl2 or independently of Vangl2 in discrete cell types.

We investigated the effects of the dual cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine in such patients. Methods: Patients in whom mild-to-moderate dementia developed at least 2 years after they received a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 3 to 12 mg of rivastigmine per day for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy variables were the scores for the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinician's Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). Secondary clinical outcomes were the scores for the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, the 10-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Mini-Mental State Examination, Cognitive Drug Research power of attention tests, the Verbal Fluency test, and the Ten Point Clock-Drawing test. Results: A total of 541 patients were enrolled, and 410 completed the study. The outcomes were better among patients treated with rivastigmine than among those who received placebo; however, the differences between these two groups were moderate and similar to those reported in trials of rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease. Rivastigmine-treated patients had a mean improvement of 2.1 points in the score for the 70-point ADAS-cog, from a baseline score of 23.8, as compared with a 0.7-point worsening in the placebo group, from a baseline score of 24.3 (P<0.001). Clinically meaningful improvements in the scores for the ADCS-CGIC were observed in 19.8 percent of patients in the rivastigmine group and 14.5 percent of those in the placebo group, and clinically meaningful worsening was observed in 13.0 percent and 23.1 percent, respectively (mean score at 24 weeks, 3.8 and 4.3, respectively; P=0.007). Significantly better outcomes were seen with rivastigmine with respect to all secondary efficacy variables. The most frequent adverse events were nausea (affecting 29.0 percent of patients in the rivastigmine group and 11.2 percent of those in the placebo group, P<0.001), vomiting (16.6 and 1.7 percent, P<0.001), and tremor (10.2 and 3.9 percent, P=0.01). Conclusions: In this placebo-controlled study, rivastigmine was associated with moderate improvements in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease but also with higher rates of nausea, vomiting, and tremor.

Central leptin and insulin administration can suppress the rewarding impact of the stimulation. To determine whether there are additional peripheral signals that mediate the effect of weight loss on brain reward circuitry, we assessed changes in LH-self-stimulation following food restriction in the obese Zucker rat which develops resistance to circulating leptin and insulin. In addition, we examined the impact of acute food deprivation and leptin administration on LH self-stimulation in lean and obese Zucker rats. The number of brain stimulation rewards earned was measured over a range of LH stimulation frequencies that drove reward rates from zero to asymptotic levels. Restriction reduced frequency thresholds in a subset of lean and obese rats, whereas BSR was unaltered by acute food deprivation. Despite impairment in leptin signaling, intraventricular leptin (4 mug) increased thresholds in most lean and obese rats in which the rewarding effect was sensitive to restriction. These results show that brain reward circuitry in the obese Zucker rat is sensitive to weight loss and leptin. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among them, N-cadherin is redistributed, undergoes activity-dependent conformational changes, and is required for synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that depolarization induces the enlargement of the width of spine head, and that cadherin activity is essential for this synaptic rearrangement. Dendritic spines visualized with green fluorescent protein in hippocampal neurons showed an expansion by the activation of AMPA receptor, so that the synaptic apposition zone may be expanded. N-cadherin-venus fusion protein laterally dispersed along the expanding spine head. Overexpression of dominant-negative forms of N-cadherin resulted in the abrogation of the spine expansion. Inhibition of actin polymerization with cytochalasin D abolished the spine expansion. Together, our data suggest that cadherin-based adhesion machinery coupled with the actin-cytoskeleton is critical for the remodeling of synaptic apposition zone.

The mechanisms of these actions are not well understood. In this study, the evaluation of the effects of acute and repeated administration of BPC157 on serotonin (5-HT) synthesis in the rat brain is reported. The alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) autoradiographic method was used to measure regional 5-HT synthesis rates. In the first series of experiments, a single dose treatment of BPC157 (10 mug/kg) administered intraperitoneally 40 min before the alpha-MTrp tracer injection significantly reduced the regional rate of 5-HT synthesis in the dorsal thalamus, hippocampus, lateral geniculate body and hypothalamus. 5-HT synthesis rates in the substantia nigra reticulate and medial anterior olfactory nucleus in BPC157 treated rats were significantly higher than in the control rats. No significant change in the synthesis rate was observed in the raphe nuclei. In the second series of experiments, following a 7-day treatment with BPC157 (10 mug/kg; s.c.), a significant reduction in the 5-HT synthesis rate was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and significant increases were observed in the substantia nigra, lateral caudate, accumbens nucleus and superior olive. This data suggests that BPC157, a gut peptide, influences brain 5-HT synthesis in rats, but we cannot determine, from this data, the mechanism of this action. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In children, however, description of a resonance motor mechanism is still preliminary In the present study, we recorded electroencephalographic signals from a subdural 64-contact grid electrode in a 36-month-old child with epilepsy. Spectral analysis was performed on sequences where the child drew with her right hand, watched an experimenter drawing with his right hand or was at rest. Contact sites corresponding to sensorimotor areas were discovered where absolute power was decreased during both observation and execution of hand/arm actions. These data suggest the presence of a mirror neuron system early in the developing brain.

Objectives: We aimed to determine the effects of orally administered folic acid and of folic acid combined with vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, or both on tHcy in adults with trisomy 21. The study was also intended to analyze the possible influence of gene polymorphisms. Design: One hundred sixty adults with trisomy 21 and 160 healthy, unrelated subjects aged 26 +/- 4 y were included. Plasma tHcy, red blood cell folate, serum folate, and vitamin B-12 were measured. Genotyping for the common methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C --> T, MTHFR 1298A --> C, cystathionine beta-synthase 844Ins68, methionine synthase 2756A --> C, methionine synthase reductase 66A --> G, and reduced folate carrier 80G --> A polymorphisms was carried out. Results: The mean tHcy concentration (9.8 +/- 0.7 mumol/L) of cases who did not use vitamins was not significantly different from that of controls (9.4 +/- 0.3 mumol/L). Plasma tHcy concentrations (7.6 +/- 0.3 mmol/L) in cases who used folic acid were significantly lower than in cases who did not. Folic acid combined with vitamin B-12 did not significantly change tHcy concentrations compared with those in cases who used only folic acid. Folic acid combined with vitamins B-6 and B-12 significantly lowered tHcy (6.5 +/- 0.5 mumol/L). The difference in tHcy according to MTHFR genotype was not significant. However, tHcy concentrations were slightly higher in TT homozygotes among the controls but not among the cases. Conclusion: This study provides information on the relation between several polymorphisms in genes involved in homocysteine and folate metabolism in adults with trisomy 21.

A2B5(+) cells represented 3 to 5% of the total cell suspension derived from adult specimens. Results of protein (immunostaining) and RNA (polymerase chain reaction) analyses indicated that the adult A2B5(+) cells were more committed to the OLG lineage than their fetal counterparts white continuing to retain properties of progenitor cells compared to the postmitotic mature OLGs. Although the adult A2B5(+) cells retained the capacity to divide, albeit at a reduced rate compared to fetal A2B5(+) cells, they showed reduced survival and process outgrowth compared not only to fetal cells but also to mature OLGs. Our results confirm the presence of progenitor cells committed to the OLG lineage in the adult human central nervous system but raise the issues regarding the intrinsic capacity of these cells to contribute to the process of remyelination that may be necessary during demyelinating diseases.

When RET is overexpressed in the HoxB7/Ret transgenic mouse, kidneys are small and cystic, and in some of the mice, the ureters are grossly dilated. Here, we report that the observed ureteral dilatation is associated with the urinary tract abnormality vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), in which urine flows retrogradely from the bladder to the ureter. Reflux was determined in vitro by injecting methylene blue into the bladders of HoxB7/Ret and wild-type mice. At postnatal day 1, 30% of HoxB7/Ret mice had VUR compared with 4% of wild- type mice ( P < 0.05). The length of the intravesical ureteral tunnel was shorter in HoxB7/Ret mice compared with wild- type mice, on both the right and the left sides ( P < 0.05), suggesting a basis for the higher incidence of VUR in these mutants. At embryonic day 11, the ureteric bud was found to exit more caudally from the mesonephric duct in HoxB7/Ret mice, and this may predispose them to VUR ( P < 0.05). Wild-type and HoxB7/Ret mice were tested for reflux at embryonic day 17, and both showed a high frequency of VUR ( 59 and 75%, respectively). These results suggest that VUR may occur transiently during normal urinary tract development before the ureter has completed its insertion into the bladder. In the HoxB7/Ret mouse, overexpression of RET appears to delay the maturation of the distal ureter, resulting in postnatal VUR. The HoxB7/Ret mouse is thus an important model in which to examine how vesicoureteric reflux arises during urinary tract development.

In experiments conducted in the field and in captivity on Carib grackles, Quiscalus lugubris, in Barbados, we showed that: (1) dunking rate in the field was influenced by food type and that moistening dry food seems to be one of the major benefits of dunking; (2) most dunking observed in the field was performed by a minority of individuals, but the vast majority (86%) of grackles tested in captivity were capable of dunking; (3) a higher density of conspecifics at a water source was associated with a lower dunking rate and an increased risk of kleptoparasitism when dunking; and (4) there were consistent individual differences in dunking and stealing frequency. We conclude that dunking is part of the normal behavioural repertoire of Carib grackles in Barbados, and that the low frequency of the behaviour in the field did not result from the inability of some individuals to perform the technique, but more likely from the balance of costs and benefits affecting its expression.

The exact role of the mammillary bodies (MBs) in human memory remains elusive, since few cases of selective MB damage have been reported. Objective: To study a case of severe anterograde amnesia due to a third-ventricle craniopharyngioma with severe MB compression. Design: Case report. Setting: Neurosurgery clinic of an academic hospital Patient: A 53-year old woman who developed severe anterograde amnesia due to a third-ventricle craniopharyngioma strongly compressing the MBs and, to a lesser extent, the right hippocampus. Interventions: Surgical excision of the tumor and neuropsychological testing and positron emission tomography during an associative memory test before and 2 months after tumor removal. A postsurgical magnetic resonance image did not show evidence of damage to the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, or MBs. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in brain imaging data and results of neuropsychological testing. Results: After tumor removal, the patient showed a complete recovery of memory functions. Performance on the associative memory test was at chance level before surgery and dramatically improved postoperatively. Results of the preoperative positron emission tomographic study showed no activity in memory-related structures. In contrast, a significant blood flow increase occurred in the anterior thalamic nuclei postoperatively. Conclusions: These behavioral and brain imaging data stress the importance of the MBs in this patient's amnesia. Our data further suggest that the clinical prognosis of decompressing the mammillothalamic tract is excellent, even in cases of massive compression.

These act in concert to activate signaling pathways that will lead to the desensitization of activated receptors and, for most receptor types, their trafficking to intracellular compartments. This review focuses mainly on the endocytic pathways used by a G protein-coupled receptor and on the proteins that play an essential role in the regulation of the internalization process, most specifically the ADP-ribosylation factors. This family of proteins has been shown to be important for vesicle trafficking between different cellular membranes. The latest findings regarding the molecular mechanisms that regulate internalization of an agonist-stimulated receptor are presented here. Finally, a perspective on how ARF6 proteins might regulate the internalization process is also proposed.

The focus of this review is the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) subfamily of receptor PTPs (RPTPs). This subfamily is composed of three vertebrate homologs, LAR, RPTP-sigma, and RPTP-delta, as well as few invertebrates orthologs such as Dlar. LAR-RPTPs have a predominant function in nervous system development that is conserved throughout evolution. Proteolytic cleavage of LAR-RPTP proproteins results in the noncovalent association of an extracellular domain resembling cell adhesion molecules and intracellular tandem PTPs domains, which is likely regulated via dimerization. Their receptor-like structures allow them to sense the extracellular environment and transduce signals intracellularly via their cytosolic PTP domains. Although many interacting partners of the LAR-RPTPs have been identified and suggest a role for the LAR-RPTPs in actin remodeling, very little is known about the mechanisms of action of RPTPs. LAR-RPTPs recently raised a lot of interest when they were shown to regulate neurite growth and nerve regeneration in transgenic animal models. In addition, LAR-RPTPs have also been implicated in metabolic regulation and cancer. This RPTP subfamily is likely to become important as drug targets in these various human pathologies, but further understanding of their complex signal transduction cascades will be required.

The mediators of tissue injury remain unknown. Glutamate, which can be released by activated immune cells or produced within the CNS, has been implicated as a potential mediator of tissue injury in multiple sclerosis. alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA) and kainate are highly toxic when added to rodent OL cultures. Using OLs derived from human adult surgical specimens, we investigated AMPA/kainate receptor expression and the effects of receptor stimulation on the viability of human OLs. We find that human adult OLs in vitro express low levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors and are resistant to excitotoxicity mediated by high and sustained doses of AMPA or kainate, even when receptor desensitization is blocked. In contrast, rat OLs show strong AMPA receptor expression and are susceptible to excitotoxicity, as previously demonstrated. Furthermore, we show in human brain sections that OLs do not express AMPA receptors in situ and that glial expression of AMPA receptors is limited to astrocytes. The apparent lack of glutamate receptor expression on human OLs and their resistance to AMPA/kainate toxicity should be considered when postulating mechanisms of tissue injury in multiple sclerosis.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of treating mice chronically with [Dmt(1)]DALDA. The AD(50) of [Dmt(1)]DALDA (s.c.) increased eight-fold in animals given this drug chronically; in contrast, the AD(50) increased two-fold in mice chronically treated with morphine. The AD(50) of morphine (s.c.) in these [Dmt(1)]DALDA-treated animals was increased more than 120 times, while that of the more selective mu agonist [D-Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO) given intrathecally was increased more than 240 times. However, the AD(50) of DAMGO given intracerebroventricularly was essentially the same in animals treated chronically with [Dmt(1)]DALDA as in naive animals. The dose of naloxone required to precipitate withdrawal in [Dmt(1)]DALDA-treated animals was 20 times lower than that in morphine-tolerant animals. 2 Using real-time quantitative PCR, we found that expression of the m opioid receptor, delta opioid receptor, preproenkephalin and preprodynorphin genes was upregulated in the brain by [Dmt(1)] DALDA treatment. No significant changes in expression of opioid receptor or opioid peptide genes were detected in the spinal cord of [Dmt(1)]DALDA-treated mice, nor in the brain or spinal cord of morphine-treated mice. We conclude that a high degree of tolerance to [Dmt(1)]DALDA develops in the spinal cord but not brain, and cannot be accounted for by changes in expression of opioid receptors or opioid peptides in these tissues.

The model accounts for the planar geometry of the group (pile diameter, pile spacing, and pile arrangement) and incorporates the effect of pile installation, pile length, cap condition, soil condition, and type of loading on the group efficiency. The results produced by the proposed ANN model compared well with the available results of laboratory and field tests. The ANN model is a viable design tool that assists foundation engineers in predicting the pile group efficiency in an accurate and realistic manner. In addition, this model can be easily updated to incorporate new data and accommodate new design parameters.

Using a pruning algorithm of artificial neural networks, powerful species-tailored models constrained to water temperature, water depth, and dissolved organic carbon were developed from a 109-lake training set from northwestern Canada and Alaska. The reasoning behind the approach is that the implementation of a single, gradient-based, organism-environment relationship should only use species that are comprehensively influenced by the variable of interest. By pruning species according to their relevance to each of the three studied variables, the cross-validated performances of all three models were significantly increased, suggesting that nonrelevant species have corrupting influences and need to be removed. The removal of corrupting species also suggests that palaeolimnological transfer functions based on an appropriate subset of useful species are more independent.

We report the results of a comprehensive survey on musical behaviors and background administered to the largest sample of individuals with WS to date (n = 118, mean age = 20.4), and compare the results to those obtained from a control group of typically developing normal individuals (n = 118, mean age = 20.9) and two groups of individuals with other neurodevelopmental genetic disorders, Autism (n = 30, mean age = 18.2) and Down Syndrome (n = 40, mean age = 17.2). Individuals with WS were found to be rated higher in musical accomplishment, engagement, and interest than either of the comparison groups, and equivalent on most measures to the control group. Compared to all other groups including the controls, the WS individuals displayed greater emotional responses to music, manifested interest in music at an earlier age, and spent more hours per week listening to music. In addition, the effects of music listening (whether positive or negative) tended to last longer in the WS group. A factor analysis extracted seven principal components that characterize the musical phenotype in our sample, and discriminant function analysis of those factors was able to successfully predict group membership for the majority of cases. We discuss the neurobiological implications of these findings.

Each task required the subject to generate 10 chronologically ordered and necessary actions toward a goal. There were 3 levels of structure of the tasks (highly structured, moderately structured, unstructured) and each of these levels comprised a familiar and an unfamiliar script. The ADHD group made more sequencing errors on all the scripts, significantly so on the highly structured unfamiliar and on the moderately structured unfamiliar script tasks. The two groups were similar however with regard to the semantic structure (content) of the scripts and the total number of actions generated. Errors of omission, commission and perseveration were similar for the two groups. The results are interpreted as supportive of Barkley's (1997) frontal lobe dysfunction model of ADHD.

Methods: Fourteen children with intractable neocortical epilepsy (age: 1-16 years) who had subsequent resective surgery were retrospectively studied. The subjects underwent a high-resolution MRI and prolonged subdural EEG recording. Spectral analysis was applied to 3 habitual focal seizures. After fast Fourier transformation of the EEG epoch at ictal onset, an amplitude spectral curve (square root of the power spectral curve) was created for each electrode. The EEG magnitude of ictal rhythmic discharges was defined as the area under the amplitude spectral curve within a preset frequency band including the ictal discharge frequency, and calculated for each electrode. The topography mapping of ictal EEG magnitude was subsequently displayed on a surface-rendered MRI. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the consistency between quantitatively and visually defined ictal onset zones. Results: The electrode showing the maximum of the averaged ictal EEG magnitude was part of the visually defined ictal onset zone in all cases. ROC analyses demonstrated that electrodes showing >30% of the maximum of the averaged ictal EEG magnitude had a specificity of 0.90 and a sensitivity of 0.74 for the concordance with visually defined ictal onset zones. Significance: Quantitative ictal subdural EEG analysis using spectral analysis may supplement conventional visual inspection in children with neocortical epilepsy by providing an objective definition of the onset zone and its simple visualization on the patient's MRI.

Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, PEDro, EMBASE and DocOnline were searched for controlled studies. Physical therapy was divided into 10 intervention categories, which were analysed separately. If statistical pooling (weighted summary effect sizes) was not possible due to lack of comparability between interventions, patient characteristics and measures of outcome, a best-research synthesis was performed. This best-research synthesis was based on methodological quality (PEDro score). Results: In total, 151 studies were included in this systematic review; 123 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 28 controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Methodological quality of all RCTs had a median of 5 points on the 10-point PEDro scale (range 2-8 points). Based on high-quality RCTs strong evidence was found in favour of task-oriented exercise training to restore balance and gait, and for strengthening the lower paretic limb. Summary effect sizes (SES) for functional outcomes ranged from 0.13 (95% CI 0.03-0.23) for effects of high intensity of exercise training to 0.92 (95% CI 0.54-1.29) for improving symmetry when moving from sitting to standing. Strong evidence was also found for therapies that were focused on functional training of the upper limb such as constraint-induced movement therapy (SES 0.46; 95% CI 0.07-0.91), treadmill training with or without body weight support, respectively 0.70 (95% CI 0.29-1.10) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.56-/1.61), aerobics (SES 0.39; 95% CI 0.05-0.74), external auditory rhythms during gait (SES 0.91; 95% CI 0.40-1.42) and neuromuscular stimulation for glenohumeral subluxation (SES 1.41; 95% CI 0.76-2.06). No or insufficient evidence in terms of functional outcome was found for: traditional neurological treatment approaches; exercises for the upper limb; biofeedback; functional and neuromuscular electrical stimulation aimed at improving dexterity or gait performance; orthotics and assistive devices; and physical therapy interventions for reducing hemiplegic shoulder pain and hand oedema. Conclusions: This review showed small to large effect sizes for task-oriented exercise training, in particular when applied intensively and early after stroke onset. In almost all high-quality RCTs, effects were mainly restricted to tasks directly trained in the exercise programme.

The ability to distinguish self-generated sensory events from those that arise externally is thus essential for perceptual stability and accurate motor control. Recently, progress has been made towards understanding how this distinction is made. It has been proposed that an internal prediction of the consequences of our actions is compared to the actual sensory input to cancel the resultant self-generated activation. Evidence in support of this hypothesis has been obtained for early stages of sensory processing in the vestibular, visual and somatosensory systems. These findings have implications for the sensory-motor transformations that are needed to guide behavior.

We show that mau-2 encodes a novel, previously uncharacterized protein that is highly conserved among animals. Maternal mau-2 gene expression is sufficient for normal development until the fourth larval stage, and a MAU-2::GFP fusion protein localizes to the cytoplasm of neurones. mau-2 is ubiquitously expressed in embryos by late gastrulation and becomes predominantly expressed in the nervous system as morphogenesis progresses. Expression of mau-2 within individual neurones rescues the guidance defects of mau-2 mutants, indicating that mau-2 functions cell-autonomously. Altering the activity of both the dorsal repellent slt-1 and mau-2 leads to the abnormal dorsal projection of the AVM axon, a phenotype that is novel and specific to the interaction of these two genes, indicating that mau-2 participates in the guidance of AVM by a slt-1-independent mechanism. Taken together, mau-2 defines a novel guidance factor that might be involved in the intracellular processing of guidance cues encountered by migrating cells and axons; during development.

The trait of neuroticism is common among individuals with major affective disorders. We hypothesized that high neuroticism among parents affects the family environment and parenting practices and thereby increases the risk of psychosocial problems among offspring. This hypothesis is tested in a sample of participants at high and low risk for major affective disorders, which contained parents with bipolar disorder (55), major depression (21), or no mental disorder (148) and their 146 children between 4 and 14 years of age. Parents with high neuroticism scores were characterized by low psychosocial functioning, poor parenting, more dependent stressful life events, and the use of more emotion-focused and less task-oriented coping skills. High neuroticism in parents was associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among the children, as assessed by parent and teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist and clinician ratings. The results suggest that high neuroticism in parents with major affective disorders is associated with inadequate parenting practices and the creation of a stressful family environment, which are subsequently related to psychosocial problems among the offspring.

The TINC-NIMA interaction is stabilized in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors and in the presence of kinase-inactive NIMA, suggesting that the interaction is enhanced when NIMA is not fully activated. TINC is a cytoplasmic protein. TINC homologues and a TINC-like protein (A. nidulans HETC) are conserved in other filamentous fungi. Neither deletion of tinC nor deletion of both tinC and A. nidulans hetC is lethal, but deletion of tinC does produce cold sensitivity as well as osmotic sensitivity. Expression of an amino-terminal-truncated form of TINC (DeltaN-TINC) inhibits colony growth in Aspergillus and localizes to membrane-like structures within the cell. Examination of cell cycle progression in these cells reveals that they progress through multiple defective mitoses. Many cells contain large polyploid single nuclei, while some appear to have separated masses of DNA. Examination of the nuclear envelopes of cells containing more than one DNA mass reveals that both DNA masses are contained within a single nuclear envelope, indicating that nuclear membrane fission is defective. The ability of these cells to separate DNA segregation from nuclear membrane fission suggests that this coordination is normally a regulated process in A. nidulans. Additional experiments demonstrate that expression of DeltaN-TINC results in premature NIMA disappearance in mitotic samples. We propose that TINC's interaction with NIMA and the cell cycle defects produced by DeltaN-TINC expression suggest possible roles for TINC and NIMA during nuclear membrane fission.

Currently the extent to which arm activity can modulate reflex excitability of leg muscles is not fully understood. We showed recently that rhythmic arm movement significantly suppresses soleus H-reflex amplitude probably via modification of presynaptic inhibition of the IA afferent pathway. Further, during walking reflexes evoked in leg muscles by stimulation of a cutaneous nerve at the wrist (superficial radial nerve; SR) are phase and task dependent. However, during walking both the arms and legs are rhythmically active thus it is difficult to identify the locus of such modulation. Here we examined the influence of SR nerve stimulation on transmission through the soleus H-reflex pathway in the leg during static contractions and during rhythmic arm movements. Nerve stimulation was delivered with the right shoulder in flexion or extension. H-reflexes were evoked alone (unconditioned) or with cutaneous conditioning via stimulation of the SR nerve (also delivered alone without H-reflex in separate trials). SR nerve stimulation significantly facilitated H-reflex amplitude during static contractions with the arm extended and countered the suppression of reflex amplitude induced by arm cycling. The results demonstrate that cutaneous feedback from the hand on to the soleus H-reflex pathway in the legs is not suppressed during rhythmic arm movement. This contrasts with the observation that rhythmic arm movement suppresses facilitation of soleus H-reflex when cutaneous nerves innervating the leg are stimulated. In conjunction with other data taken during walking, this suggests that the modulation of transmission through pathways from the SR nerve to the lumbosacral spinal cord is partly determined by rhythmic activity of both the arms and legs.

In the dorsal raphe nucleus, administration of atropine (1 mg/kg i.v.) prevented the suppressant effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) on the spontaneous firing activity of 5-HT neurons, suggesting that atropine could induce an attenuation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors responsiveness. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT decreased both immobility in the forced swim test and the body core temperature. Pre-treatment with atropine (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) enhanced antidepressant-like effect of 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg s.c.) and reduced 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg s.c.)induced hypothermia. In conclusion, the present study reports a functional role of muscarinic receptors in the modulation of pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors mediated responses.

During the first hour postinjection, [Dmt(1)]DALDA (0.025-250 mug/rat, IV) evoked a dose-dependent diuresis. The dose of 2.5 mug increased urine volume from 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.3 mL/h (P < 0.001, n = 30), urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, and cGMP and induced a mild antihypertensive effect. This dose increased cumulative 4-hour urine volume but significantly inhibited sodium and potassium excretions. The renal and cardiovascular effects were abolished by naloxone (4 mg/kg), but not by naloxonazine (35 mg/kg SC), a selective mu-1 receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with 8 mg/kg naloxone methiodide, an opioid antagonist with limited access to the brain, partially inhibited the renal effects of [Dmt(1)]DALDA. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthases with L-NAME (1 mg/kg) had no effect on the renal and cardiovascular actions of [Dmt(1)]DALDA. Plasma ANP and AVP, measured at 20 and 120 minutes after injection, were not altered by 2.5 and 25 mug [Dmt(1)]DALDA. Therefore, [Dmt(1)]DALDA evokes renal and cardiovascular effects that may primarily be mediated by central naloxonazine-insensitive mu opioid receptors (non-mu-1). These findings indicate that the central mu opioid system is involved in the regulatory mechanism of renal handling of sodium and water.

Chronic daily headache was defined as persistent or daily headaches of at least 3 months' duration. Children with persistent headaches owing to a serious medical condition were specifically excluded from analysis. Of 1669 children (24% of total seen) referred over an 11-year inclusive interval for the evaluation of headaches, 50 (3%) merited a diagnosis of chronic daily headache. The overwhelming majority were female (45/50; 900/6), with a mean age at diagnosis of 12.9 years (range 7-16 years). Transformed migraine was determined to be the etiology in the majority (35/50; 70%), with a minority attributable either to postconcussion syndrome (7/50; 14%) or new daily persistent headaches (6/50; 12%). Analgesic abuse was evident in a majority (26/50; 52%). Treatment consisted predominantly of migraine and analgesic education, with a majority of children (42/50; 84%) also receiving daily prophylaxis. Four fifths (41/50; 82%) returned for at least one follow-up. Of these, 56% (23/41) were improved, 32% (13/41) unchanged, and 12% (5/41) worse. Eventually, almost half (20/41) experienced complete resolution of their headache symptoms, with a mean time to resolution of 8 months (range 2-48 months). Children with chronic daily headache are thus a small subset of children with headache seen in general ambulatory practice. They tend to be females in the midteen years experiencing a transformed migraine complicated by analgesic abuse, suggesting potential preventability. Simple measures, which can include the use of prophylactic agents, can be expected to result in improvement and eventual resolution of headache symptoms.

Of these, 295 cases were collected from the scientific literature and 340 from medical records at seven hospitals in Canada. Different sets of predictors emerged for the Wechsler Verbal and Performance IQ values, accounting for differing variances (ie, 12.4% and 20.1%, respectively). The volume of the lesion was the factor that explained the most variance (ie, 4.95% and 11.7%, respectively). Age at lesion onset was significantly and positively correlated with verbal intelligence scores. This variable, considered independently or in interaction with other predictors, did not account for a large portion of the variance explained in intelligence. This refutes the commonly held notion that early onset of the insults results in a better prognosis.

Patients develop progressive neuropsychiatric problems, mental retardation, hearing loss, and relatively minor visceral manifestations. The pattern of transmission is consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The aim of this study was to find a locus for MPS IIIC using a homozygosity mapping approach. A genomewide scan was performed on DNA from 27 affected individuals and 17 of their unaffected relatives. Additional patients were recruited, and DNA was obtained from a total of 44 affected individuals and 18 unaffected family members from 31 families from 10 countries. A working candidate interval was defined by looking for excess homozygosity in patients compared with their relatives. Additional markers were genotyped in regions of interest. Linkage analysis was performed to support the informal analysis. Inspection of the genomewide scan data showed apparent excess homozygosity in patients compared with their relatives for markers on chromosome 8. Additional genotyping identified 15 consecutive markers (from D8S1051 to D8S2332) in an 8.3 cM interval for which the genotypes of affected siblings were identical in state. A maximum multipoint lod score of 10.61 was found at marker D8S519. A locus for MPS IIIC maps to an 8.3 cM (16 Mbp) interval in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8.

These associations might be due to a variety of van der Waals interactions or hydrogen bonding. Neurotransmitters all contain OH or NH groups, which are prone to form hydrogen bonds with those of the neurotransmitter receptors. These could be perturbed by anaesthetics. Aromatic rings in amino acids can act as weak hydrogen bond acceptors. On the other hand the acidic hydrogen in halothane type anaesthetics are weak proton donors. These two facts together lead to a probable mechanism of action for all general anaesthetics. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Converging lines of evidence also point to dysfunctions in the cortical cholinergic system in neuropsychiatric disorders. In previous studies, we observed alterations in dopaminergic modulation of acetylcholine (Ach) release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in postpubertal NVH-lesioned rats. These two neurotransmitter systems are involved in the stress response as PFC release of DA and Ach is enhanced in response to some stressful stimuli. As adult NVH-lesioned rats are behaviorally more reactive to stress, we investigated the effects of NVH lesions on tail-pinch stress-induced Ach and DA release in the PFC. Using in vivo microdialysis, we observed that tail-pinch stress resulted in significantly greater increases in prefrontal cortical Ach release in post-pubertal NVH-lesioned rats (220% baseline) compared with sham-operated controls (135% baseline). Systemic administration of the D-1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or the D(2)(-)like receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.), as well as intra-PFC administration of the D2-like antagonist sulpiride (100 mum), reduced stress-induced Ach release in PFC of adult NVH-lesioned rats. By contrast, intra-PFC administration of SCH 23390 (100 pm) failed to affect stress-induced Ach release in PFC of NVH-lesioned rats. Interestingly, using in vivo voltammetry, stress-induced stimulation of PFC DA release was found to be attenuated in adult NVH-lesioned rats. Taken together, these data suggest developmentally specific reorganization of prefrontal cortical cholinergic innervation notably regarding its regulation by DA neurotransmission.

The goal of the present study was to precisely evaluate the dynamics of VOR suppression immediately before, throughout, and just after gaze shifts. A torque motor was used to apply rapid (100degrees/s), short-duration (20-30 ms) horizontal head perturbations in three Rhesus monkeys. The status of the VOR elicited by this transient head perturbation was first compared during 15, 40, and 60degrees gaze shifts. The level of VOR suppression just after gaze-shift onset (40 ms) increased with gaze-shift amplitude in two monkeys, approaching values of 80 and 35%. In contrast, in the third monkey, the VOR was not significantly attenuated for all gaze-shift amplitudes. The time course of VOR attenuation was then studied in greater detail for all three monkeys by imposing the same short-duration head perturbations 40, 100, and 150 ms after the onset of 60degrees gaze shifts. Overall we found a consistent trend, in which VOR suppression was maximal early in the gaze shift and progressively recovered to reach normal values near gaze-shift end. However, the high variability across subjects prevented establishing a unifying description of the absolute level and time course of VOR suppression during gaze shifts. We propose that differences in behavioral strategies may account, at least in part, for these differences between subjects.

To evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of tramadol 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg (tramadol/APAP) combination tablets for treatment of chronic low back pain (LBP). Methods. This 91 day, multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study enrolled 338 patients with chronic LBP requiring daily medication for greater than or equal to 3 months. Patients with at 19 least moderate pain [pain visual analog scale (VAS) with scores greater than or equal to 40/100 mm] after washout were randomized to tramadol/APAP or placebo. After 10 day titration, patients received 1 or 2 tablets QID. Primary outcome measure was final pain VAS score. Secondary measures included pain relief, quality of life and physical functioning, efficacy failure, and overall medication assessments. Results. In total, 336 intent-to-treat patients received tramadol/APAP (n = 167) or placebo (n = 169). Mean baseline pain VAS score was 67.8. Intent-to-treat analysis showed significantly better mean final pain VAS scores (47.4 vs 62.9; p < 0.001) and mean final pain relief scores (1.8 vs 0.7; p < 0.001) for tramadol/APAP than tor placebo. Roland Disability Questionnaire scores and physical-related subcategories of the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 Health Survey were significantly better for traadol/APAP patients. More patients rated tramadol/APAP as "very good" or "good" than placebo (63.6 vs 25.2%; p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative discontinuation rates due to efficacy failures were 22.9% (tramadol/APAP) vs 54.7% (placebo; p < 0.001). The most common treatment related adverse events with tramadol/APAP were nausea (12.0%), dizziness (10.8%), and constipation (10.2%). Average daily dose of tramadol/APAP was 4.2 tablets (tramadol 158 mg/APAP 1369 mg). Conclusion. Tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets show efficacy in pain reduction, in measures of physical functioning and quality of life, and in overall medication assessments, with a tolerability profile comparable with other opioids used for the treatment of chronic LBP.

Increased concentrations of endogenous benzodiazepines with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex were proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism to explain increased GABAergic tone in HE. However, results of controlled trials with benzodiazepine receptor antagonists have yielded equivocal results and increases in benzodiazepine levels in body fluids of cirrhotic patients were suggested to be largely accounted for by previous pharmaceutical benzodiazepine intake. In the present study the issue of benzodiazepine receptor ligands in brains of cirrhotic patients, and their contribution to alterations of GABA-A receptor complex in HE are addressed. "Benzodiazepine-like" ligands were present in trace amounts in autopsied brain tissue from control subjects (0.2 +/- 0.2 ng/g tissue), and from cirrhotic patients not previously exposed to benzodiazepine medication (0.8 +/- 0.4 ng/g tissue). In contrast, these ligands accumulate in brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines by up to 200-fold (161.5 +/- 93.2 DE ng/g tissue). Brain extracts from cirrhotic patients increased the binding of the GABA-A receptor agonist [H-3]muscimol. This increase was minimal with brain extracts from controls (6.8 +/- 2.8%), but was significant with brain extracts from cirrhotic patients without (29.4 +/- 2.7%), or with (55.1 +/- 7.6%) previous exposure to benzodiazepines. Addition of flumazenil, a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist did not significantly modify the increase of [H-3]muscimol binding by brain extracts from patients without prior exposure to benzodiazepines and only partially inhibited the increase of [H-3]muscimol binding in presence of brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines. These findings suggest the presence of nonbenzodiazepine substances (possibly neurosteroids) with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex in brain in hepatic encephalopathy.

More than two decades ago, the role of altered GABAergic neurotransmission was proposed following evidence of "increased GABAergic tone" in HE. Increased GABAergic tone was based on several observations: (i) Similarity of visual evoked response potential patterns between rabbits with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure and animals treated with various allosteric agonists of the GABA receptor complex (GRC). (ii) Spontaneous activities of isolated Purkinje neurons from rabbits with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure are more depressed by GRC modulator compounds compared to normal animals. (iii) Flumazenil, a high selective benzodiazepine antagonist at the GRC, ameliorates behavioral symptoms and EEG activity in some HE patients. Pathophysiological mechanisms put forward to explain increased GABAergic tone in HE include (1) increase in brain GABA content due to increased brain GABA uptake through altered permeability of the blood brain barrier, (2) alteration of the integrity of constituents of the GRC, and (3) increase of endogenous GRC modulators such as benzodiazepines (and more recently neurosteroids) with potent agonist properties at the GRC. Studies performed subsequently excluded alterations of either GABA content or GRC integrity in favor of increased brain concentrations of endogenous agonists. While the role of endogenous benzodiazepines remains controversial, the presence of neurosteroids with GABA agonist properties affords a plausible explanation for increased GABAergic tone in HE.

Brain serotonin, a neurotransmitter with widespread distribution in the CNS, plays a role in the regulation of a wide range of physiological behaviors and functions. In addition, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathological processes, including HE. This work reviews the relationship between brain serotonergic dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients and experimental animals. The existing changes in the synthesis, metabolism, storage, and release of neuronal serotonin in HE point to a serotonergic synaptic deficit in this condition. Given the established role of the brain serotonergic system in the regulation of sleep, circadian rhythmicity, and locomotion, selective alterations of this system could be an important part of the neurophysiological background responsible for the behavioral changes in rats with portacaval anastomosis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of HE in cirrhotic patients. The findings that serotoninergic turnover is exquisitely and selectively sensitive to the degree of porto-systemic shunting and hyperammonemia suggest a role for serotonin in early neuropsychiatric symptoms of HE. Pharmacological manipulation of the brain serotonergic system may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of HE in cirrhotic patients.

In particular, it is unclear whether neurotensin acts as an agonist, inverse agonist, or antagonist at this site. In view of the growing evidence for a role of NTS2 in antinociception, the elucidation of the pharmacological and coupling properties of this receptor is particularly critical. In the present study, we demonstrate that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the rat NTS2 receptor, neurotensin (NT), levocabastine, neuromedin N, and the high-affinity NT receptor antagonist SR48692[2-{[1-(-7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl] amino}adamantane-2-carboxylic acid] all bind to and activate the NTS2 receptor. This activation is followed by ligand-induced internalization of receptor-ligand complexes, as evidenced by confocal microscopy using a fluorescent NT analog. All compounds tested produced a rapid and sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) but were without specific effect on Ca2+ mobilization. The agonist-induced activation of ERK1/2 was completely abolished by preincubation of the cells with the endocytosis inhibitors phenylarsine oxide and monodansylcadaverine as well as overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin 1 (DynK44A), indicating that receptor internalization was required for ERK1/2 activation. NTS2-induced activation of ERK1/2 was not species-specific, because the same agonistic effects of NT and analogs were observed in CHO cells transfected with the human NTS2 receptor. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NTS2 is a bona fide NT receptor and that activation of this receptor by NT or NT analogs results in an internalization-dependent activation of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade.

Molecular analysis showed midsize GAA repeat expansion sizes in all 3 individuals. Gait spasticity in FA, although rare, has been described in a few patients who are compound heterozygotes for a point mutation, or who had GAA expansions of less than 200 repeats. The occurrence of spastic paraplegia in our family, in the presence of homozygous midsize GAA repeat expansions, is an unusual finding. Spasticity can be the main feature in both sporadic and familial patients with FA, either as an isolated finding, or in addition to other neurological abnormalities, and should be included as a rare feature in the clinical spectrum of FA. This family also demonstrates that in FA, marked intrafamilial phenotypic variability can arise in the presence of similar GAA expansion sizes. Therefore, in familial FA, the disease course in relatives therefore cannot be predicted solely from repeat length. Factors such as somatic mosaicism, repeat interruptions, modifying mutations and environmental factors must also be considered. (C) 2004 Movement Disorder Society.

MnSOD, CuZnSOD, nNOS and eNOS mRNA and protein expression were examined 3 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion under acute hyperglycemic or normoglycemic conditions. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) treatment post-mortem revealed a significant area at risk of infarction following ischemia in hyperglycemic compared to normoglycemic rats. Although no changes in MnSOD, CuZnSOD, nNOS and eNOS mRNA expression were detected, Western blots of ischemic cortex revealed an increase in MnSOD and CuZnSOD protein expression in hyperglycemic compared to normoglycemic rats. Pre-treatment of hyperglycemic rats with the NOS inhibitors L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) or dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), a superoxide scavenger, significantly reduced the TTC delineated zone. The hyperglycemia-induced post-transcriptional upregulation of MnSOD and CuZnSOD levels suggest a response to increased superoxide production which, in the presence of increased nitric oxide production, may play a major role in the increased risk of damage following hyperglycemic stroke.

J	Galan, A; Laird, JMA; Cervero, F				Galan, A; Laird, JMA; Cervero, F			In vivo recruitment by painful stimuli of AMPA receptor subunits to the plasma membrane of spinal cord neurons	PAIN			English	Article						glutamate; pain; hyperalgesia; synaptic plasticity; receptor trafficking; spinal cord	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DORSAL-HORN; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; NOXIOUS-STIMULATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; VISCERAL PAIN; HYPERALGESIA; SYNAPSES; RAT	The persistent increase in pain sensitivity observed after injury, known as hyperalgesia, depends on synaptic plasticity in the pain pathway, particularly in the spinal cord. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, including post-synaptic exocytosis of the AMPA subclass of glutamate receptors (AMPA-R), which is known to play a critical role in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. AMPA-R trafficking has been described in spinal neurons in culture but it is unknown if it can also occur in spinal neurons in vivo, or if it can be induced by natural painful stimulation. Here we have induced referred mechanical hyperalgesia in vivo by intracolonic instillation of capsaicin in mice and have observed a recruitment of GluR1 AMPA-R subunits to neuronal plasma membranes in the lumbar spinal cord. Intracolonic capsaicin induced a rapid (10 min) increase in GluR1, but not GluR2/3 in the synaptosomal membrane fraction which lasted at least 3 It and a decrease in GluR1 subunit in the cytosolic fraction. Capsaicin treatment also provoked CaMKII activation and pre-treatment with a specific CaMKII inhibitor prevented the GluR1 trafficking. Brefeldin-A, an antibiotic that inhibits exocytosis of proteins, not only prevented GluR1 trafficking to the membrane but also inhibited referred hyperalgesia in capsaicin-treated mice. Our results show that delivery of GluR1 AMPA receptor subunits to the cell membrane through a CaMKII activity-dependent exocytotic regulated pathway contributes to the development of hyperalgesia after a painful stimulus. We conclude that AMPA-R trafficking contributes to the synaptic strengthening induced in the pain pathway by natural stimulation. (C) 2004 International Association for the Study of Pain.

First, each class is divided into several clusters by the k-means algorithm. The optimal discriminant analysis is implemented by multi-modal mapping. Our method utilizes only those training samples on and near the effective decision boundary to generate a between-class scatter matrix, which requires less CPU time than other nonparametric discriminant analysis (NDA) approaches [Fukunaga and Mantock in IEEE Trans PAMI 5(6):671-677, 1983; Bressan and Vitria in Pattern Recognit Lett 24(5):2473-2749, 2003]. In addition, no prior assumptions about class and cluster densities are needed. In order to achieve a high verification performance of confusing handwritten numeral pairs, a hybrid feature extraction scheme is developed, which consists of a set of gradient-based wavelet features and a set of geometric features. Our proposed dimensionality reduction algorithm is used to congregate features, and it outperforms the principal component analysis (PCA) and other NDA approaches. Experiments proved that our proposed method could achieve a high feature compression performance without sacrificing its discriminant ability for classification. As a result, this new method can reduce artificial neural network (ANN) training complexity and make the ANN classifier more reliable.

Recently, we showed that benzodiazepine-GABA(A)ergic mechanisms play an important role in U-50,488H (U50) analgesia and its tolerance. Hence, in the present study, the effect of melatonin on U50 analgesia and its tolerance was investigated. Furthermore, the possible role of benzodiazepine-GABAAergic mechanisms in the actions of melatonin on U50 analgesia was investigated. All experiments were performed using the radiant tail-flick test for mice. Melatonin [0.2, 1 and 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)] neither produced analgesia nor affected the acute U50 (40 mg/kg, i.p.) analgesia. Tolerance to U50 analgesia was induced by administering U50 (40 mg/kg, i.p.) twice daily over 6 days. Treatment with melatonin (I and 5 mg/kg, i.p) 15 min prior to each dose of U50 inhibited the development of tolerance, whereas a low dose of melatonin (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) did not. The inhibition of U50 tolerance by melatonin was reversed by the chronic treatment with flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and picrotoxin (I mg/kg), a GABA(A)-gated chloride channel blocker. Flumazenil and picrotoxin neither affected tail-flick latencies nor altered acute U50 analgesia and its tolerance. Interestingly, chronic 6-day melatonin treatment in a vehicle (U50-naive) group did not alter U50 analgesia measured on day 7. Together, these findings suggest that melatonin interferes with the neural mechanisms involved in the development of tolerance to U50 analgesia. The inhibition of U50 tolerance by melatonin was reversed by flumazenil and picrotoxin treatment, suggesting that benzodiazepine-GABAAergic mechanisms play an important role in the development of tolerance to U50 analgesia and that melatonin inhibits the development of U50 tolerance via benzodiazepine-GABAAergic mechanisms.

Methods: This 3-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of IFNbeta-1b included 939 subjects from the United States and Canada with SPMS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores ranging from 3.0 to 6.5. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or IFNbeta-1b (250 mug or 160 mug/m(2) body surface area), administered subcutaneously every other day. The primary outcome was time to progression by greater than or equal to1.0 EDSS point (0.5 point if EDSS score was 6.0 to 6.5 at entry) confirmed at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included mean change in EDSS score from baseline, relapse-related measures, MRI activity, and a standardized neuropsychological function test. Results: There was no significant difference in time to confirmed progression of EDSS scores between placebo-treated patients and either of the IFNbeta-1b treatment groups. However, IFNbeta-1b treatment resulted in improvement on secondary outcome measures involving clinical relapses, newly active MRI lesions, and accumulated burden of disease on T2-weighted MRI. Effects were similar for both IFNbeta-1b treatment groups. Neutralizing antibodies to IFNbeta-1b were detected in 23% of 250-mug and 32% of 160-mug/m(2) recipients, but their presence did not consistently affect clinical or MRI outcomes. IFNbeta-1b was also well tolerated at both doses. Conclusions: Although no treatment benefit was seen on the time to confirmed progression of disability, relapse- and MRI-related outcomes showed significant benefit with both dosing regimens tested, a result consistent with the outcomes of earlier clinical trials.

The molecular mechanisms underlying Netrin-1-DCC signaling are still poorly characterized. Here, we show that DCC is phosphorylated in vivo on tyrosine residues in response to Netrin-1 stimulation of CN and that the Src family kinase inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 block both Netrin-1-dependent phosphorylation of DCC and axon outgrowth. PP2 also blocks the reorientation of Xenopus laevis retinal ganglion cells that occurs in response to Netrin-1, which suggests an essential role of the Src kinases in Netrin-1-dependent orientation. Fyn, but not Src, is able to phosphorylate the intracellular domain of DCC in vitro, and we demonstrate that Y1418 is crucial for DCC axon outgrowth function. Both DCC phosphorylation and Netrin-1-induced axon outgrowth are impaired in Fyn(-/-),CN and spinal cord explants. We propose that DCC is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and that Fyn is essential for the response of axons to Netrin-1.

Here, we report the discovery of a Trk-like receptor, ApTrkl, in Aplysia. We show that it is expressed in the sensory neurons, the locus for synaptic facilitation, which is a cellular model for memory formation. Serotonin, the facilitatory neurotransmitter, activates ApTrkl, which, in turn, leads to activation of ERK. Finally, inhibiting the activation of ApTrkl with the Trk inhibitor K252a or using dsRNA to inhibit ApTrkl blocks the serotonin-mediated activation of ERK in the cell body, as well as the cell-wide long-term facilitation induced by 5-HT application to the cell body. Thus, transactivation of the receptor tyrosine kinase ApTrkl by serotonin is an essential step in the biochemical events leading to long-term facilitation in Aplysia.

Our and other laboratories have used several analytical methods to reveal the presence of catecholamines and indoleamines in cnidarians, some of which are traceable to specific subsets of neurons. Evidence was also provided of amine biosynthesis, and of neuronal catecholamine release. Adrenergic-like and serotonin-like receptors were pharmacologically characterized by bioassays and by radiobinding assays in the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri, and these receptors appear to mediate activities such as bioluminescence and peristaltic contractions. The search for their structural identity has led to the molecular cloning and characterization the sea pansy of two new G protein-coupled receptors, Ren1 and Ren2, exhibiting homologies with aminergic receptors. In contrast to the receptors characterized in sea pansy membranes, none of the two cloned receptors responded to conventional amines when expressed in mammalian cell lines. Ren1 displayed constitutive cyclic AMP-generating activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

Tachykinins were also reported in the CNS of lampreys using immunohistochemistry, chromatography, and radioimmunoassay methods, but the use of substance P (SP)-specific antibodies to reveal those tachykinins could have led to an underestimation of their number in this genus. Therefore, we carried out a new immunohistochemical study on Petromyzon marinus using a commercial polyclonal antibody that binds not only to mammalian SP, but also to other neurokinins. This antibody labeled all previously described lamprey tachykinin-containing neuronal populations, but more important, labeled new populations in several parts of the brain. These include the dorsal gray of the rostral spinal cord, the dorsal column nuclei, the octavolateral area, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the medial rhombencephalic reticular formation, the lateral tegmenturn of the rostral rhombencephalon, the torus semicircularis, the optic tectum, the habenula, the mammillary area, the dorsal thalamic area, the lateral hypothalamus, and the septum area. Preabsorption experiments confirmed the binding of the antibody to neurokinins and allowed us to propose that the CNS of P. marinus contains at least two different tachykinins.

In addition, CVD frequently contributes to cognitive loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progress in understanding the pathogenetic mechanism involved in vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and vascular dementia (VaD) has resulted in promising treatments of these conditions. Cholinergic deficits in VaD are due to ischemia of basal forebrain nuclei and of cholinergic pathways and can be treated with the use of the cholinesterase inhibitor agents used in AD. Controlled clinical trials with donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine in VaD, as well as in patients with AD plus CVD, have demonstrated improvements in cognition, behavior and activities of daily living.

Recent experimental studies also suggest that the toxicity observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, is not only related to the mature fibrils themselves, but also to the soluble oligomers formed early in the process of fibrillogenesis. This raises the interest in studying the early steps of the aggregation process. Although fibril formation follows the nucleation-condensation process, characterized by the presence of lag phase, the exact pathways remain to be determined. In this study, we used the activation-relaxation technique and a generic energy model to explore the process of self-assembly and the structures of the resulting aggregates of eight KFFE peptides. Our simulations show, starting from different states with a preformed antiparallel dimer, that eight chains can self-assemble to adopt, with various orientations, four possible distant oligomeric well-aligned structures of similar energy. Two of these structures show a double-layer sheet organization, in agreement with the structure of amyloid fibrils as observed by x-ray diffraction; another two are mixtures of dimers and trimers. Our results also suggest that octamers are likely to be below the critical size for nucleation of amyloid fibrils for small peptides.

Objective: To test the hypotheses that FXS individuals 1) have a pervasive visual motion perception impairment affecting neocortical circuits in the parietal lobe and 2) have deficits in integrative neocortical mechanisms necessary for perception of complex stimuli. Methods: Psychophysical tests of visual motion and form perception defined by either first-order (luminance) or second-order (texture) attributes were used to probe early and later occipito-temporal and occipito-parietal functioning. Results: When compared to developmental- and age-matched controls, FXS individuals displayed severe impairments in first- and second-order motion perception. This deficit was accompanied by near normal perception for first- order form stimuli but not second-order form stimuli. Conclusions: Impaired visual motion processing for first- and second-order stimuli suggests that both early- and later-level neurologic function of the parietal lobe are affected in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Furthermore, this deficit likely stems from abnormal input from the magnocellular compartment of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Impaired visual form and motion processing for complex visual stimuli with normal processing for simple (i.e., first-order) form stimuli suggests that FXS individuals have normal early form processing accompanied by a generalized impairment in neurologic mechanisms necessary for integrating all early visual input.

In skeletal muscle, although CAR is expressed in immature fibers, its transcript levels are barely detectable in mature muscle. This is in contrast to the robust expression observed in the heart. However, both heart and skeletal muscle are susceptible to infection with the Coxsackie B virus which utilizes primarily CAR for cellular internalization. The specific point of viral entry in skeletal and heart muscle remains unknown. Results: Using antibodies directed against the extracellular and the cytoplasmic domains of CAR, we show CAR in normal human and mouse skeletal muscle to be a novel component of the neuromuscular junction. In cardiac muscle, CAR immunoreactivity is observed at the level of intercalated discs. We demonstrate a single isoform of CAR to be expressed exclusively at the human neuromuscular junction whereas both predominant CAR isoforms are expressed at the intercalated discs of non-diseased human heart. Conclusion: The localization of CAR to these important junctional complexes suggests that CAR may play both a structural and a regulatory role in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and that these complexes may serve as a point of entry for Coxsackie B virus.

Our goal was to examine the role of PPC in the context of learning new dynamics of arm movements. We assessed this possibility by stimulating PPC with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while subjects learned to make reaching movements with their right hand in a velocity-dependent force field. We reasoned that, if PPC is necessary to adjust the trajectory of the arm as it interacts with a novel mechanical system, interfering with the functioning of PPC would impair adaptation. Single pulses of TMS were applied over the left PPC 40 msec after the onset of movement during adaptation. As a control, another group of subjects was stimulated over the visual cortex. During early stages of learning, the magnitude of the error ( measured as the deviation of the hand paths) was similar across groups. By the end of the learning period, however, error magnitudes decreased to baseline levels for controls but remained significantly larger for the group stimulated over PPC. Our findings are consistent with a role of PPC in the adjustment of motor commands necessary for adapting to a novel mechanical environment.

We therefore sought to identify the strain-dependent ameliorating gene. We biochemically isolated caspase-7 from B6-caspase-3-null (Casp3(-/-)) tissues as being the enzyme with caspase-3-like properties and capability of performing a caspase-3 surrogate function, apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to the human enzymes, mouse caspase-7 is as efficient as caspase-3 at cleaving and thus inactivating ICAD ( inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase), the inhibitor of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Low levels of caspase-7 expression and activation correlate with lack of DNA fragmentation in 129-Casp3(-/-) apoptotic precursor neurons, whereas B6-Casp3(-/-) cells, which can fragment their DNA, show higher levels of caspase-7 expression and activation. The amount of caspase-7 activation in apoptotic precursor neurons is independent of the presence of caspase-3. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time a strong correlation between caspase-7 activity, normal brain development, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation in Casp3(-/-) mice.

However, the coordination and intracellular localization of the cyclooxygenases (COXs) and prostaglandin E synthases (PGESs) that convert arachidonic acid to PGE2 in brain tissue are not known. We aimed to determine whether microsomal and cytosolic PGES (mPGES-1 and cPGES) colocalize and coordinate activity with either COX-1 or COX-2 in brain tissue, particularly during development. Importantly, we found that cytosolic PGES also associates with microsomes (cPGES-m) from the cerebrum and cerebral vasculature of the pig and rat as well as microsomes from various cell lines; this seemed dependent on the carboxyl terminal 35-amino acid domain and a cysteine residue (C58) of cPGES. In microsomal membranes from the postnatal brain and cerebral microvessels of mature animals, cPGES-m colocalized with both COX-1 and COX-2, whereas mPGES-1 was undetectable in these microsomes. Accordingly, in this cell compartment, cPGES could coordinate its activity with COX-2 and COX-1 (partly inhibited by NS398); albeit in microsomes of the brain microvasculature from newborns, mPGES-1 was also present. In contrast, in nuclei of brain parenchymal and endothelial cells, mPGES-1 and cPGES colocalized exclusively with COX-2 (determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry); these PGESs contributed to conversion of PGH(2) into PGE(2). Hence, contrary to a previously proposed model of exclusive COX-2/mPGES-1 coordination, COX-2 can coordinate with mPGES-1 and/or cPGES in the brain, depending on the cell compartment and the age group.

J	Renaud, S; Guile, JM				Renaud, S; Guile, JM			A neurobiological approach to temperamental traits associated with personality disorders	ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES			French	Article						endophenotype; environment; neurobiology; personality disorders; temperament	BORDERLINE PERSONALITY; SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY; ENVIRONMENT CORRELATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; SPECTRUM PERSONALITY; FACTORIAL STRUCTURE; SALIVARY CORTISOL; CONDUCT DISORDERS; EARLY ADOLESCENCE; GENETIC-STRUCTURE	Recent publications in the field of neurobiology related to personality disorders allow some consideration on the bidirectional relationship between genetically determined temperamental traits and environment, interactions observed in the normal development of personality during childhood and adolescence or on the contrary in the building of a disordered personality revealed at adulthood. Based on the review of studies about development of personality disorders in children, adolescents and adults, this article puts forward the interactive quality of relations between genetic background and environmental factors and proposes hypotheses concerning the role of temperament in the development of personality. Correlations between genes and environment (rGE) and interactions gene-environment (GxE) are examined. Bidirectional feedback between temperament and environment where individual temperamental characteristics determine environment selection or adjustment and not the opposite is an example of an interaction of evocative type. However, actual research designs face difficulties in the establishment of a causal link due to the multitude and complexity of involved factors linking personality traits with temperamental genetic markers. This might explain the emergence of an endophenotype concept as it has been used with autism. An endophenotype consists in a mesurable cognitive, neurophysiological or neurochemical variable expressing the genetic defect present before the onset of the illness. Some studies put forward possible endophenotypes for borderline, antisocial and schizotypal personality disorders. Longitudinal research has shown the predictive quality of externalized conduct disorders of childhood leading to antisocial and to a lesser extent borderline personality disorders in adulthood. Impulsivity and affective lability might be based on minor neurocognitive abnormalities, subclinical attention deficits and/or marked neuropsychological dimensions such as strong extraversion. Suboptimal serotoninergic regulation has been established in destructive impulsivity and suicidability. Abnormalities in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems might also be implicated but it remains unclear to what extent repeated trauma and abuse during childhood might modify the hypothalamic-pituitary-corticotropic axis in response to chronic stress and transform permanently the modulation of physiological and psychological reactions of these children to their perturbed environment. Researches on conduct disorders have also demonstrated the evocative interaction of a particular temperament with the environment responding to marked novelty seeking behaviour, hyperactivity, impulsivity and lack of proper physiological reaction to extreme stimuli. Lack of behaviour inhibition found in antisocial individuals is. attributed to noradrenergic and serotoninergic abnormalities and neurocognitive deficits. The dimensional continuity of schizotypal personality to schizophrenia is well established and electrophysiological markers such as abnormal eye tracking movements, P300 evoked potentials, prolonged electrodermal reactions with cognitive disorganization and deficits in inhibition of attention to usual stimuli might be the future endophenotypical markers to schizophrenia susceptibility. Further studies on temperamental traits might lead to the identification of genetic markers as precursors to personality disorders. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves.

This study used a reversible unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion model to investigate the expression and distribution of cytoskeletal components and Rho GTPases at protein and mRNA levels in proximal tubule fractions. Ischemia strongly increased beta-actin and alpha-tubulin expressions that were predominantly found in nuclear fractions. Rho GTPases and caveolin-1 expression were upregulated by ischemia and were enriched mainly in Triton-soluble membranes. Rac1 expression was stimulated in the soluble fractions during reperfusion. Rho GTPases mRNA levels were similarly regulated by ischemia-reperfusion suggesting that changes in their expressions could occur at gene or mRNA levels. ERM protein expression and distribution were unaffected by ischemia-reperfusion. Together, these data show that renal ischemia-reperfusion induced expression and redistribution of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton components in addition to Rho GTPases in proximal tubules, suggesting that they participate in an adaptive response to cellular lesions.

The approach has been applied to isolated organelles and major suborganellar structures and each study has identified known proteins not previously understood to associate with the compartment and novel proteins that had been described only as predicted open-reading frames from genome sequencing data. We have utilized subcellular proteomics to analyse the protein components of CCVs (clathrin-coated vesicles) isolated from adult brain. Accounting for identified fragmented peptides allows for a quantitative assessment of protein complexes associated with CCVs, and the identification of many of the known components of post-fusion synaptic vesicles demonstrates that a main function for brain CCVs is to recycle synaptic vesicles. In addition, we have identified a number of novel proteins that participate in CCV formation and function at the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane. Characterization of two of these proteins, NECAP1 and NECAP2, has led to the identification of a new consensus motif that mediates protein interactions with the clathrin adaptor protein 2. These studies highlight the ability of proteomics to reveal new insights into the mechanisms and functional roles of subcellular compartments.

Methods: The study was a review of questionnaires returned retrospectively by physicians and other sources reporting ice hockey related spinal injuries in Canada. Physicians reported on the mechanism of injury, vertebral level of injury, presence of neurologic deficit, type of event, and type of fracture. Results: Between 1943 and 1999, 271 major spinal injuries were reported in Canadian ice hockey players, of which 49.0% occurred to players 16-20 years of age. Ontario has had a disproportionately large number of injuries compared to some provinces, especially Quebec. Of the spinal cord injuries, 65.8% resulted from colliding with the boards, and 36.6% were due to players being pushed or checked from behind. The recent survey shows that there has been a decline in the number of major spinal cord injuries in Canadian ice hockey, especially those causing paralysis due to checking or pushing from behind. Conclusions: Impact of the head with the boards after being checked or pushed from behind was the most common mechanism of spinal cord injury. Injury prevention programs are becoming effective in reducing the overall number of injuries, especially those due to checking from behind. Greater awareness of the occurrence and mechanisms of injury through educational programs and rules changes by organized hockey have reduced the annual incidence of catastrophic spinal injuries in Canadian ice hockey.

This study explored the convergent and discriminant construct validity of the Standardized Finger-Nose Test (SFNT) in a neuromuscular disorder with ataxic features. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 24 participants with recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. Convergent construct validity was tested by correlating the SFNT with other upper extremity function tests, a functional independence measure and social participation. Upper extremity function tests included gross and fine dexterity (Box and Block Test and Purdue Pegboard), upper extremity strength (dynamometry) and global upper extremity performance (TEMPA). The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Assessment of Life Habits scale (LIFE-H) measured functional independence and social participation respectively. Discriminant construct validity was explored by comparing performance on the SFNT between two age groups (<40 years and &GE;40 years). Results: Convergent validity of the SFNT was demonstrated by moderate to strong correlations with gross and fine finger dexterity (r=0.82-0.84), global upper extremity performance (0.74-0.79), functional independence (r=0.74) and social participation (r=0.78). Upper extremity coordination of the older group was significantly lower than in the younger group, suggesting the ability of the SFNT to discriminate between different levels of function. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the convergent and discriminant construct validity of the SFNT in a neuromuscular disorder with ataxic features.

J	Chalk, C				Chalk, C			The academic half-day in Canadian neurology residency programs	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							TEACHING HOSPITALS	Background: The academic half-day (AHD) appears to have become widespread in Canadian neurology residency programs, but there is little published information about the structure, content, or impact of the AHD. Methods: A written questionnaire was sent to the directors of all active Canadian adult and child neurology residency programs. Results: All 21 program directors responded. An AHD was operating in 15/15 adult and 5/6 child neurology programs. The AHD typically lasts three hours, and occurs weekly, 10 months per year. Most of the weekly sessions are lectures or seminars, usually led by clinicians, with about 90% resident attendance. Course-like features (required textbook, examinations) are present in many AHDs. There is a wide range of topics, from disease pathophysiology to practice management, with considerable variation between programs. Conclusions: Almost all Canadian neurology programs now have an AHD. Academic half-days are broadly similar in content and format across the country, and residents now spend a substantial portion of their training attending the AHD. The impact of the AHD on how residency programs are organized, and on the learning, clinical work, and professional development of residents merits further study.

How layer-specific connectivity is established during development remains largely unknown. In the Drosophila adult visual system, photoreceptor (R cell) axons innervate one of two optic ganglia layers; R1-R6 axons connect to the lamina layer, while R7 and R8 axons project through the lamina into the deeper medulla layer. Here, we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Off-track (Otk) is specifically required for lamina-specific targeting of R1-R6 axons. Otk is highly expressed on R1-R6 growth cones. In the absence of otk, many R1-R6 axons connect abnormally to medulla instead of innervating lamina. We propose that Otk is a receptor or a component of a receptor complex that recognizes a target-derived signal for R1-R6 axons to innervate the lamina layer.

Although this knock-in allele was hypomorphic, expressing tenfold less Erbb2 protein than wild type, the knock-in animals were healthy. However, a further twofold reduction in Erbb2 levels in hemizygous knock-in animals resulted in perinatal lethality with defects in the innervation of the diaphragm. Genetic rescue of this hypomorph was accomplished by expression of the Erbb2-Y1028F mutant in a comparable knock-in allele. Interestingly, hemizygous Y1028F animals were viable with normal innervation of the diaphragm. Molecular analyses revealed that the Y1028F allele expressed higher levels of Erbb2 and that Y1028 promoted the turnover of the receptor. In addition, ablation of the Shc-binding site in Erbb2 (Y1227) resulted in subtle defects in the sensory nerves not observed in the other mutant erbb2 strains. Thus, we have established how Erbb2 levels may be modulated through development and that a minimum threshold level of Erbb2 is required.

For menopausal women the most important of these appear to result from the severe estrogen deficiency caused by ovarian dysfunction. The consequences among others include hot flashes, osteoporosis, obesity, impaired memory, higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. Ovarian function and steroidogenesis are influenced by pituitary gonadotropins, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), whose actions are mediated through ovarian receptors. This article highlights our recent data pertinent to aging as derived from a novel genetically modified animal model [the FORKO mouse (FOllitropin Receptor KnockOut) lacking the FSH receptor. FORKO female mice experience a chronic depletion of estrogen (E2) from early development, and have phenotypes similar to aging women, with ovarian failure, obesity, skeletal changes, and ovarian tumors. A variety of findings support the conclusion that E2 deficiency in FORKO mice is responsible for their neural impairments associated with glial cell hypertrophy, region-specific brain cells loss, and abnormal behavior. Findings from mice with FSH receptor haploinsufficiency mice ('menopausal mice') are also shedding light on the molecular basis of menopausal conditions that include degeneration of the hippocampus. Many phenotypes noted in the null condition also occur in +/- females but in an age related manner. Thus, the FORKO mouse becomes an excellent model to investigate mechanisms underlying age-related changes especially when these events are accelerated, as in menopausal women. Opportunities abound to assess the potential benefits/adverse effects of hormone replacement regimen on various targets. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Progesterone modulation of this sex difference was examined in mice. Analgesia against thermal nociception was produced by forced cold water swim or by systemic administration of the kappa-opioid agonist, U50,488. As seen previously, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocked both forms of analgesia in male but not female mice. Also as in previous studies, this sex difference was found to be dependent on ovarian hormones such that, ovariectomy induced female mice to "switch" to the male-like, NMDAergic system. We now demonstrate that a single injection of progesterone (50 mug), systemically administered 30 min before analgesia assessment, is sufficient to restore female-specific mediation of analgesia (i.e., insensitivity to MK-801 blockade) in ovariectomized female mice. The rapidity of this neurochemical "switching" action of progesterone suggests mediation via cell surface receptors or the action of neuroactive steroid metabolites of progesterone.

Elevated blood pressure is presumed one of the main risk factors, although data are almost exclusively derived from cross-sectional studies. We assessed in 10 European cohorts the relation between concurrently and previously measured blood pressure levels, hypertension, its treatment, and severe cerebral white matter lesions. In total, 1805 nondemented subjects aged 65 to 75 years were sampled from ongoing community-based studies that were initiated 5 to 20 years before the MRI. White matter lesions in the periventricular and subcortical region were rated separately using semiquantitative measures. We performed logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders in 1625 people with complete data. Concurrently and formerly assessed diastolic and systolic blood pressure levels were positively associated with severe white matter lesions. Both increases and decreases in diastolic blood pressure were associated with more severe periventricular white matter lesions. Increase in systolic blood pressure levels was associated with more severe periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions. People with poorly controlled hypertension had a higher risk of severe white matter lesions than those without hypertension, or those with controlled or untreated hypertension. Higher blood pressure was associated with an increased risk of severe white matter lesions. Successful treatment of hypertension may reduce this risk; however, a potential negative effect of decreasing diastolic blood pressure level on the occurrence of severe periventricular white matter lesions should be taken into account.

To gain insight into the functionality of neurotensin receptor-3, we examined the neurotensin-induced intracellular trafficking of this receptor in the human carcinoma cell line HT29, which expresses both neurotensin receptor-1 and -3 sub-types. At steady state, neurotensin receptor-3 was found by sub-cellular fractionation and electron microscopic techniques to be predominantly associated with intracellular elements. A small proportion (similar to10%) was associated with the plasma membrane, but a significant amount (similar to25%) was observed inside the nucleus. Following stimulation with neurotensin (NT), neurotensin/neurotensin receptor-3 complexes were internalized via the endosomal pathway. This internalization entailed no detectable loss of cell surface receptors, suggesting compensation through either recycling or intracellular receptor recruitment mechanisms. Internalized ligand and receptors were both sorted to the pericentriolar recycling endosome/Trans-Golgi Network (TGN), indicating that internalized neurotensin is sorted to this compartment via neurotensin receptor-3. Furthermore, within the Trans-Golgi Network, neurotensin was bound to a lower molecular form of the receptor than at the cell surface or in early endosomes, suggesting that signaling and transport functions of neurotensin receptor-3 may be mediated through different molecular forms of the protein. In conclusion, the present work suggests that the neurotensin receptor-3 exists in two distinct forms in HT29 cells: a high molecular weight, membrane-associated form responsible for neurotensin endocytosis from the cell surface and a lower molecular weight, intracellular form responsible for the sorting of internalized neurotensin to the Trans-Golgi Network.

The theory is based on a delta-lognormal equation which can be used to globally describe the basic properties of velocity profiles using seven parameters. This realistic model has been of great use to solve pattern recognition problems (signature verification, handwriting analysis and segmentation, etc.). To go further in that direction, a better understanding of the model is a prerequisite. This can be either in the context of psychophysical studies involving human subjects or in the context of computer simulations. In this paper, we use the same model form to develop a simulator that generates human-like velocity profiles. A basic subsystem model is both proposed and constructed with a Simulink Matlab tool; then many of these axe connected to create an artificial neuromuscular network. Combining two networks in parallel, one agonist and the other antagonist, a synergy simulator is constructed. The similarity of the velocity patterns produced by the simulator is analyzed using a delta-lognormal parameter extractor. It is shown that the parameters extracted from artificially generated profiles vary in the same intervals as those of experimental profiles produced by human subjects. In future works the simulator tool will be used to study the control of rapid human movements.

However, researchers do not know whether these histories combine in additive or interactive ways. The authors tested 303 male young adults from a community sample whose trajectories of teacher-rated physical aggression and motoric hyperactivity from kindergarten to age 15 were well defined. No significant interaction was found. In a 1st model, both histories of problem behavior were independently associated with cognitive-neuropsychological function in most domains. In a 2nd model controlling for IQ, general memory, and test motivation, the 3 working-memory tests (relevant to executive function) remained associated with physical aggression, and 1 remained associated with hyperactivity. These results support an additive model.

J	Al-Futaisi, A; Shevell, M				Al-Futaisi, A; Shevell, M			Comparative audit of clinical research in pediatric neurology	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article								Clinical research involves direct observation or data collection on human subjects. This study was conducted to evaluate the profile of pediatric neurology clinical research over a decade. Trends in pediatric neurology clinical research were documented through a systematic comparative review of articles published in selected journals. Eleven journals (five pediatric neurology, three general neurology, three general pediatrics) were systematically reviewed for articles involving a majority of human subjects less than IS years of age for the years 1990 and 2000. Three hundred thirty-five clinical research articles in pediatric neurology were identified in the 11 journals for 1990 and 398 for 2000, a 19% increase. A statistically significant increase in analytic design (21.8% vs 39.5%; P = .01), statistical support (6% vs 16.6%; P < .0001), and multidisciplinary team (69.9% vs 87%; P = .003) was observed. In terms of specific study design, a significant decline in case reports (34.3% vs 10.3%; P < .0001) and an increase in case-control studies (11.3% vs 22.9%; P = .02) were evident over the 10-year interval. This comparative audit revealed that there has been a discernible change in the methodology profile of clinical research in child neurology over a decade. Trends apparently suggest a more rigorous approach to study design and investigation in this field.

By targeting specifically the inhibitory epitopes, we have investigated whether vaccination with a recombinant DNA molecule encoding multiple domains of myelin inhibitors may be useful in CNS repair. We show here that the recombinant DNA vaccine is able to activate the immune system but does not induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats. Importantly, it promotes axonal regeneration in a spinal cord injury model. Thus, the application of DNA vaccine, encoding multiple specific domains of major inhibitory proteins and/or their receptors, provides another promising approach to overcome the inhibitory barriers during CNS regeneration.

Impairment of MTHFR will increase homocysteine levels and compromise SAM-dependent methylation reactions. Mild MTHFR deficiency is common in many populations due to a polymorphism at bp 677. To assess how impaired MTHFR activity affects folate metabolism in various tissues in vivo, we used affinity/HPLC with electrochemical detection to analyze the distribution of folates in plasma, liver, and brain of Mthfr-deficient mice. The most pronounced difference in total folate was observed in plasma. In Mthfr -/- mice, plasma total folate levels were similar to25% of those in wild-type (Mthfr +/+) mice. Only 40% of plasma folate in Mthfr -/- mice was comprised of 5-methylTHF, compared with at least 80% in the other 2 genotype groups. In liver and brain, there were no differences in total folate. However, the proportion of 5-methylTHF in both tissues was again markedly reduced in mice with the Mthfr -/- genotype. In this genotype group, 5-methylTHF is likely derived from the diet. Our study demonstrated reduced total circulatory folate and altered distribution of folate derivatives in liver and brain in Mthfr deficiency. Decreased methylfolates and increased nonmethylfolates would affect the flux of one-carbon units between methylation reactions and nucleotide synthesis. This altered flux has implications for several common disorders, including cancer and vascular disease.

Data concerning the physiology of desire, arousal, and orgasm in women are limited because of ethical constraints. Aim. To gain knowledge of physiology of female sexual function through animal models. Methods. To provide state-of-the-art knowledge concerning female sexual function in animal models, representing the opinions of seven experts from five countries developed in a consensus process over a 2-year period. Main Outcome Measure. Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. Results. Sexual desire may be considered as the presence of desire for, and fantasy about, sexual activity. Desire in animals can be inferred from certain appetitive behaviors that occur during copulation and from certain unconditioned copulatory measures. Proceptive behaviors are dependent in part on estrogen, progesterone, and drugs that bind to D I dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, oxytocin receptors, opioid receptors, or gamma-amino butyric acid receptors. Peripheral arousal states are dependent on regulation of genital smooth muscle tone. Multiple neurotransmitters/inediators are involved including adrenergic, and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic agents such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, nitric oxide, neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and substance P. Sex steroid hormones, estrogens and androgens, are critical for structure and function of genital tissues including modulation of genital blood flow, lubrication, neurotransmitter function, smooth muscle contractility, mucification, and sex steroid receptor expression in genital tissues. Orgasm may be investigated by urethrogenital (UG) reflex, in which genital stimulation results in rhythmic contractions of striated perineal muscles and contractions of vagina, anus, and uterine smooth muscle. The UG reflex is generated by a multisegmental spinal pattern generator involving the coordination of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic efferents innervating the genital organs. Serotonin and dopamine may modulate UG reflex activity. Conclusions. More research is needed in animal models in the physiology of female sexual function.

Some factors have been implicated in early events of pituitary induction and morphogenesis while other factors like Pit-1 and SF-1 have been associated with differentiation of particular lineages. In POMC-expressing cells, Pitx1, NeuroD1 and Tpit were shown to be important for cell specific transcription of the POMC gene. SinceTpit is exclusively expressed in pituitary POMC-expressing lineages, the corticotrophs and melonotrophs, we investigated the TPIT gene coding sequences in 17 patients presenting with congenital isolated ACTH deficiency (IAD). We demonstrated that human TPIT gene mutations cause a neonatal onset form of IAD (8/11), but not juvenile forms of this deficiency (0/6). In the absence of glucocorticoid replacement, IAD can lead to neonatal death by acute adrenal insufficiency. To assess the importance of Tpit in pituitary differentiation and function, we produced Tpit-null mice. Concordant with the human phenotype, Tpit-null mice have IAD: plasma ACTH is greatly reduced in these mice, their plasma corticosterone is undetectable and the adrenals are hypoplastic. Analysis of the pituitary in Tpit-null mice revealed multiple roles of this factor in cell differentiation. First, Tpit is a positive regulator for POMC cell differentiation. Tpit is also a negative regulator of the pituitary gonadotroph fate. Thus, Tpit operates as a molecular switch to orient differentiation of a common precursor towards either POMC or gonadotroph fate. A binary choice model of pituitary cell differentiation is presented.

The failure to control invasive cell subpopulations may be the key reason for local glioma recurrence after radical tumor resection and may contribute substantially to the failure of the other treatment modalities such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy. As a model for this invasion, we have implanted spheroids from a human glioma cell line (U251) in three-dimensional collagen type I matrices, which these cells readily invade. We first observed that the Src family kinase-specific pharmacologic inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 significantly inhibited the invasion of the cells in this assay. We confirmed this result by showing that expression of two inhibitors of Src family function, dominant-negative-Src and CSK, also suppressed glioma cell invasion. To characterize this effect at the level of the cytoskeleton, we used fluorescent time-lapse microscopy on U251 cells stably expressing a YFP-actin construct and observed a rapid change in actin dynamics following addition of PP2 in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures. In monolayer cultures, PP2 caused the disappearance of peripheral membrane ruffles within minutes. In three-dimensional cultures, PP2 induced the loss of actin bursting at the leading tip of the invadopodium. The inhibition of Src family activity is thus a potential therapeutic approach to treat highly invasive malignant glioma.

Here we address this question, focusing on SKPs, a cultured adult stem cell from the dermis that generates both neural and mesodermal progeny. We show that SKPs derive from endogenous adult dermal precursors that exhibit properties similar to embryonic neural-crest stem cells. We demonstrate that these endogenous SKPs can first be isolated from skin during embryogenesis and that they persist into adulthood, with a niche in the papillae of hair and whisker follicles. Furthermore, lineage analysis indicates that both hair and whisker follicle dermal papillae contain neural-crest-derived cells, and that SKPs from the whisker pad are of neural-crest origin. We propose that SKPs represent an endogenous embryonic precursor cell that arises in peripheral tissues such as skin during development and maintains multipotency into adulthood.

We describe a method that can produce a network with invariance to changes in visual input caused by eye movements and covert attention shifts. Training of the network is controlled by signals associated with eye movements and covert attention shifting. A temporal perceptual stability constraint is used to drive the output of the network toward remaining constant across temporal sequences of saccadic motions and covert attention shifts. We use a four-layer neural network model to perform the position-invariant extraction of local features and temporal integration of invariant presentations of local features in a bottom-up structure. We present results on both simulated data and real images to demonstrate that our network can acquire both position and attention shift invariance.

We studied the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway in brain in animal models of hyperammonemia and liver failure and in patients died with liver cirrhosis. Activation of glutamate receptors increases intracellular calcium that binds to calmodulin and activates neuronal nitric oxide synthase, increasing nitric oxide, which activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), increasing cGMR This glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway modulates cerebral processes such as circadian rhythms, the sleep-waking cycle, and some forms of learning and memory. These processes are impaired in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Activation of sGC by NO is significantly increased in cerebral cortex and significantly reduced in cerebellum from cirrhotic patients died in hepatic coma. Portacaval anastomosis in rats, an animal model of liver failure, reproduces the effects of liver failure on modulation of sGC by NO both in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In vivo brain microdialisis studies showed that sGC activation by NO is also reduced in vivo in cerebellum in hyperammonentic rats with or without liver failure. The content of alpha but not beta subunits of sGC are increased both in frontal cortex and cerebellum from patients died due to liver disease and from rats with portacaval anastomosis. We assessed whether determination of activation of sGC by NO-generating agent SNAP in lymphocytes could serve as a peripheral marker for the impairment of sGC activation by NO in brain. Chronic hyperammonemia and liver failure also alter sGC activation by NO in lymphocytes from rats or patients. These findings show that the content and modulation by NO of sGC are strongly altered in brain of patients with liver disease. These alterations could be responsible for some of the neurological alterations in hepatic encephalopathy such as sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous cross-sectional studies have suggested a relationship between measures of cortical atrophy and disability. Our objective was to develop a method for automatically measuring the apparent cGM thickness as well as the integrity of the interface between cGM and subcortical white matter (GM/WM) both globally and regionally on T-1-weighted MRI, and use this method in a longitudinal investigation of how these measures differed between patients with stable MS and patients with progressing disability. Measurements were made over the whole brain and for anatomically specified cortical regions, both cross-sectionally at baseline and longitudinally on two MRI scans performed on average I year apart. We found a higher average rate of apparent loss of cGM thickness across the whole brain in the group that progressed over the intersean interval compared to the group that remained stable (progressing = -3.13 +/- 2.88%/year, stable = 0.06 +/- 2.31%/year, P = 0.002). This difference was detected with regional measures in parietal and precentral cortex. In contrast, change in the GM/WM interface integrity did not show detectable regional differences, although the group of MS patients whose disability progressed showed a significant decrease in GM/WM interface integrity compared to the stable group (P = 0.003). Regional measures of apparent loss of cGM thickness enhance sensitivity to cortical pathological changes. A measure of integrity offers a new index of disease-associated cortical changes at the GM/WM interface. The results suggest that progression of disability in MS is associated with the progression of MRI-detectable cortical pathology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Accuracy, however, is lost in the laboratory or surgical setting when the localization of brain structures depends on nonstereotaxic tracking methods. Here we present an image-guided stereotaxic system that is able to localize and access anatomical brain structures using the monkey's MRI. This system, which is also known as frameless stereotaxy, is capable of computing the relation of the physical "real space" of the monkey's head to the corresponding image space, while a position sensor enables the tracking of the animal's head and the localization of brain areas and favorable paths to targets within the brain using real time display software. Surgical procedures make use of an adjustable upright chair and a surgical headclamp instead of the traditional restrictive head holder with ear bars. This novel system allows for the flexible positioning of the animal and the ability to reach areas of the brain that were difficult to access in the past. The headclamp also serves as a tool holder, which in the present application guided a cannula of retrograde tracer to the desired location in the frontal lobe. Histological examination of the brain showed that the injection reached the target site, and tests using an MRI compatible phantom demonstrated that the precision of the system in bringing an injection to target is less than 1.2 mm. This system can be used to inject accurately tracers for anatomical tract-tracing, to make precise lesions, and to position electrodes for electrophysiological studies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Plasma prolactin (PRL), an indirect indicator of dopaminergic functioning, has been shown to vary with Mn exposure in adults, but little is known about this relation in the developing brain. The objective of this study was to examine the relations between maternal and cord Mn blood concentrations at birth and PRL cord blood levels. Blood Mn levels were determined in 87 pregnant women at delivery, and PRL was measured in the cord blood plasma. Mn cord blood concentration (mean 34.4 mug/l, range 16.7-89.4) was significantly and positively related to cord PRL levels. These findings suggest that Mn accumulation in utero could contribute to PRL level variation in neonates, which, in turn, may influence important developmental parameters. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: A total of 168 rats from three sets of experiments with different serotonergic drugs to evaluate changes in cerebral serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) synthesis rate were used. In the acute treatment study, rats received a drug injection 30 min before the tracer experiment. In the repeated treatment study, the same dose of drug was injected for 7 days. The two-time point method provided a parameter of brain trapping constant (K*) from the slope of linear regression of the Patlak plot, from which 5-HT synthesis rate is calculated. The measured exposure time (theta(M)) for 60 and 150 min after the tracer injection obtained from individual blood sampling in the original method and the theta(S) calculated from theta(M) were used for evaluation of differences in K* values. Results: No significant difference in theta(M) was noted among different experiments, although plasma radioactivity at the end of experiment was significantly different between the acute and the repeated treatments for one of the three drugs. No difference in K* for each treatment was observed between the original method and the simplified single blood sampling method because there was no difference in theta, among three experiments and between theta(M) and theta(S). Conclusion: The simplified alpha-MTrp ARG method, which uses theta(S) and a single arterial blood sample at the end of each experiment, can be used for the measurement of 5-HT synthesis rate in the rat brain.

The method involves placing a tourniquet (a tight fitting O-ring) on one hindlimb of an anesthetized ratjust proximal to the ankle joint for 3 h, and removing it to allow reperfusion prior to termination of the anesthesia. Rats exhibit hyperemia and edema/plasma extravasation of the ischemic hindpaw for a period of 2-4 h after reperfusion. Hyperalgesia to noxious mechanical stimulation (pin prick) and cold (acetone exposure), as well as mechanical allodynia to innocuous mechanical stimulation (von Frey hairs), are evident in the affected hindpaw as early as 8 h after reperfusion, and extend for at least 4 weeks in approximately 70% of the rats. The rats also exhibit spontaneous pain behaviors (hindpaw shaking, licking and favoring), and spread of hyperalgesia/allodynia to the uninjured contralateral hindpaw. Light-microscopic examination of the fibial nerve taken from the region just proximal to the tourniquet reveals no signs of nerve damage. Consistent with the hypothesis that the generation of free radicals may be partly responsible for CRPS-I and CPIP, two free radical scavengers, N-acetyl-Lcysteine (NAC) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperydine-i-oxyI (Tempol), were able to reduce signs of mechanical allodynia in this model.

The use of these modes allows unambiguous flavor tagging and a combined fit of the D-0 decay time and D*+-D-0 mass difference (DeltaM) distributions. The high-statistics sample of unmixed semileptonic D-0 decays is used to model the DeltaM distribution and time dependence of mixed events directly from the data. Neural networks are used to select events and reconstruct the D-0. A result consistent with no charm mixing has been obtained, R-mix=0.0023+/-0.0012+/-0.0004. This corresponds to an upper limit of R-mix<0.0042 (90% C.L.).

Distortions of the aortic wall are due mainly to left ventricular output and to reflected waves arising from the arterial tree. Distortions are generally believed to be useful in cardiac control since stretch receptors or aortic baroreceptors embedded in the adventitia of the aortic wall, transduce the distortions to cardiovascular neural reflex pathways responsible for beat-to-beat regulation of heart rate. Aortic neuroanatomy studies have also found a continuous strip of mechanosensory neurites spread along the aortic inner arch. Although their purpose is now unknown, such a combined sensing capacity would allow measurement of the space and time dependence of inner arch wall distortions due, among other things, to traveling waves associated with pulsatile flow in an elastic tube. We call this sensing capability-"smart baroreception." In this paper we use an arterial tree model to show that the cumulative effects of wave reflections, from many sites far downstream, have a surprisingly pronounced effect on the pressure distribution in the root segment of the tree. By this mechanism global hemodynamics can be focused by wave reflections back to the aortic arch, where they can rapidly impact cardiac control via smart baroreception. Such sensing is likely important to maintain efficient heart function. However, alterations in the arterial tree due to aging and other natural processes can lead in such a system to altered cardiac control and essential hypertension.
