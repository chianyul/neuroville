High-Resolution Optical Microscopy Imaging of Cortical Oxygen Delivery and Consumption	2014 CONFERENCE ON LASERS AND ELECTRO-OPTICS (CLEO)	Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO)	JUN 08-13, 2014	San Jose, CA				BLOOD-FLOW; TISSUE; TRANSPORT; MICROCIRCULATION; VESSELS	We applied multimodal microscopic imaging of intravascular partial pressure of O-2 (PO2) and blood flow complemented by numerical modeling to reveal the properties of the cortical microvascular oxygenation that allow uninterrupted oxygen delivery to all tissue regions in a very dynamic and energetically demanding brain. Our measurements show that at the baseline level of neuronal activity small arterioles are responsible for a significant oxygen extraction, while the most of the remaining oxygen release is taking place at the level of the first few capillary branches after precapillary arterioles. The majority of capillaries (i.e. high branching order capillaries) release little O-2 at rest and our measurements and modeling show that they act as a dynamic O-2 reserve that is recruited on demand to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation during increased neuronal activity or decrease in blood flow. These findings have potential to overturn our textbook knowledge of the capillary oxygen delivery, impact our understanding of progression of diseases that affect cerebral microcirculation, and help improving the quantitative interpretation of brain imaging modalities.

HFOs are often characterized by variable durations (10-100 ms) and rates of occurrence (17.5 +/- 9.5 / min). The total duration of HFOs is extremely small compared to the entire length of the EEG signals to be analyzed which, in the case of intracerebral recordings, are generally acquired over several days and sometimes up to weeks. As a result, visual marking of HFOs events associated with large amounts of EEG data is extremely tedious, inevitably subjective and requires a great deal of mental concentration. Therefore, automatic detection of HFOs can be very useful to propel the clinical use of HFOs as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue and is crucial when conducting large-scale investigations of HFO activity. As a first step towards robust and reliable automatic detection, we propose in this paper a new method for HFOs detection based on Decision Tree analysis. The performance and added value of the proposed method are evaluated by comparing it with five other previously proposed methods. The HFO detection performances were tested in terms of sensitivity, False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Our results demonstrate that the decision-tree approach yields low false detection (FDR=8.62 %) but that, in its current implementation, it is not highly sensitive to HFO events (sensitivity=66.96 %). Nevertheless some advantages of the method are discussed and paths for further improvements are outlined.

Since they do not require assistance from a human expert, unsupervised segmentation approaches are especially useful for this task. In this paper, we present two novel unsupervised segmentation methods based on random walks. The proposed methods find the probability mode in a local region around pixels, defined by a stochastic diffusion process. As the well-known Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) algorithm, these methods can also adapt dynamically to the distribution of pixel intensities by recomputing iteratively the parameters of these distributions. Experiments carried out on real 3D brain MRI from the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) show these methods to be computationally efficient and outperform approaches based on HMRF and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), in terms of mean segmentation agreement.

Nevertheless, studies do not always implicate the same anatomical neural networks in intellectual function. Here we used T1-weighted brain MRI scans obtained from a sample of 82 healthy young adults to study four potential sources of variability affecting the reproducibility of brain-cognition relationships: the neuroimaging protocol used, different measures of cortical gray matter, the nature of the cognitive measurement, and sample characteristics. We found that brain networks implicated in individual differences in cognition were not consistent when derived from different gray matter measures, or from different surface-based processing pipelines, even in equivalent samples of participants. Differences in the networks associated with cognition may reflect differences in the methods used to analyze them; in addition, different individuals may reach equivalent psychological goals through disparate brain networks.

Whereas this is primarily motivated to save as many scans as possible if corrupted by motion, users do not fully understand the consequences of different types of interpolation schemes on the final analysis. Nonetheless, interpolation might increase the partial volume effect while not preserving the volume of the diffusion profile, whereas excluding poor DWIs may affect the ability to resolve crossing fibers especially with small separation angles. In this paper, we investigate the effect of interpolating diffusion measurements as well as the elimination of bad directions on the reconstructed fiber orientation diffusion functions and on the estimated fiber orientations. We demonstrate such an effect on synthetic and real HARDI datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that the effect of interpolation is more significant with small fibers separation angles where the exclusion of motion-corrupted directions decreases the ability to resolve such crossing fibers.

EEG is a widely used recording technique for the study of many brain related diseases such as epilepsy. The detection and removal of muscle artifacts from the EEG signal poses a real challenge and is crucial for the reliable interpretation of EEG-based quantitative measures. In this paper, an automatic method for detection and removal of muscle artifacts from scalp EEG recordings, based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA), is introduced. To this end we exploit the fact that the EEG signal may exhibit altered autocorrelation structure and spectral characteristics during periods when it is contaminated by muscle activity. Therefore, we design classifiers in order to automatically discriminate between contaminated and non-contaminated EEG epochs using features based on the aforementioned quantities and examine their performance on simulated data and in scalp EEG recordings obtained from patients with epilepsy.

Although considered among the safest transportation methods, pipelines are still prone to failure due to corrosion and other types of defects. Such failures can lead to serious accidents resulting in big losses to life and the environment. It is therefore crucial for pipeline operators to reliably detect pipeline defects in an accurate and timely manner. Because of the size and complexity of pipeline systems, however, relying on human operators to perform the inspection is not possible. Automating the inspection process has been an important goal for the pipeline industry for a number of years. Significant progress has been made in that regard, and available techniques combine analytical modeling, numerical computations, and machine learning. This paper presents a survey of state-of-the-art methods used to assess the safety of the oil and gas pipelines. The paper explains the principles behind each method, highlights the setting where each method is most effective, and shows how several methods can be combined to achieve a higher level of accuracy.

Research on Cultural Intelligence provides a new perspective and a promising means of reducing intercultural conflicts and obstacles. Up until now, research in this domain has used traditional methods in aiding cultural experts, and has relied mainly on questionnaires to test manually the Cultural Intelligence of individuals. This paper provides an opportunity which attempted to improve one's Cultural Intelligence without cultural experts. To reach this goal, a Cultural Intelligence computational model has been created and implemented in an intelligent system, based on an innovative breed of Artificial Intelligence technologies. The purpose of this intelligent system is to support individuals and organizations in solving the intercultural adaptation problems that they face in various authentic situations. The system is considered as highly intelligent due to its wealth of knowledge, openness, scalability, flexibility, adaptability, and capability to self-learn. As a result of these qualities, the system allows better interaction and more effective aid in the evaluation process so as to improve users' cultural skills in different cultural settings in a shorter time.

Although externalizing behaviors are distributed continuously across clinical and nonclinical samples, little is known about how brain variations may confer risk for problematic behavior. Here, we studied cortical thickness, amygdala volume, and cortico-amygdalar network correlates of externalizing behavior in a large sample of healthy children. Methods: Two hundred ninety-seven healthy children (6-18 years; mean 12 +/- 3 years), with 517 magnetic resonance imaging scans, from the National Institutes of Health Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Normal Brain Development, were studied. Relationships between externalizing behaviors (measured with the Child Behavior Checklist) and cortical thickness, amygdala volume, and cortico-amygdalar structural networks were examined using first-order linear mixed-effects models, after controlling for age, sex, scanner, and total brain volume. Results significant at p <= .05, following multiple comparison correction, are reported. Results: Left orbitofrontal, right retrosplenial cingulate, and medial temporal cortex thickness were negatively correlated with externalizing behaviors. Although amygdala volume alone was not correlated with externalizing behaviors, an orbitofrontal cortex-amygdala network predicted rates of externalizing behavior. Children with lower levels of externalizing behaviors exhibited positive correlations between orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala structure, while these regions were not correlated in children with higher levels of externalizing behavior. Conclusions: Our findings identify key cortical nodes in frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortex associated with externalizing behaviors in children; and indicate that orbitofrontal-amygdala network properties may influence externalizing behaviors, along a continuum and across healthy and clinical samples.

Human isoprenoid synthase enzymes as therapeutic targets	FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY			English	Review						isoprenoids; mevalonate pathway; farnesyl pyrophosphate; geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; squalene		In the human body, the complex biochemical network known as the mevalonate pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids, which consists of a vast array of metabolites that are vital for proper cellular functions. Two key isoprenoids, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) are responsible for the post-translational prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins, and serve as the biosynthetic precursors to numerous other biomolecules. The down-stream metabolite of FPP and GGPP is squalene, the precursor to steroids, bile acids, lipoproteins, and vitamin D. In the past, interest in prenyl synthase inhibitors focused mainly on the role of the FPP in lytic bone diseases. More recently pre-clinical and clinical studies have strongly implicated high levels of protein prenylation in a plethora of human diseases, including non-skeletal cancers, the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we focus mainly on the potential therapeutic value of down-regulating the biosynthesis of FPP GGPP, and squalene. We summarize the most recent drug discovery efforts and the structural data available that support the current on-going studies.

With NIRS, neural activation can be explored indirectly via hemodynamic changes in the imaged region. In studies of aging, changes in baseline physiology and brain anatomy confound NIRS measures seeking to investigate age-related changes in neuronal activity. The field is thus hampered by the complexity of the aging process itself, and statistical inferences from functional data acquired by optical imaging techniques must be interpreted with care. Multimodal integration of NIRS with both structural and baseline physiological assessments is crucial to avoid misinterpreting neuroimaging signals. In this study, a combination of two different optical techniques, anatomical MRI and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), was used to investigate age-related changes in activation during a lexical-semantic processing task. Quantitative analysis revealed decreased baseline oxyhemoglobin and cerebral blood flow in the older adults. Using baseline physiology measures as regressors in the investigation of functional concentration changes when doing analyses of variance, we found significant changes in task-induced areas of activity. In the right hemisphere, more significant age-related activity was observed around the junction of the inferior frontal gyrus and inferior precentral sulcus, along with engagement of Wernicke's area. In the left hemisphere, the degree and extent of frontal activation, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, differed between age groups. Measuring background physiological differences and using their values as regressors in statistical analyses allowed a more appropriate, age-corrected understanding of the functional differentiations between age groups. Age-corrected baselines are thus essential to investigate which components of the NIRS signal are altered by aging.

Bruce			Beyond crossing fibers: bootstrap probabilistic tractography using complex subvoxel fiber geometries	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						diffusion MRI; fiber orientation distribution function; high angular resolution diffusion imaging; fiber dispersion; curve inference		Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging fiber tractography is a powerful tool for investigating human white matter connectivity in vivo. However, it is prone to false positive and false negative results, making interpretation of the tractography result difficult. Optimal tractography must begin with an accurate description of the subvoxel white matter fiber structure, includes quantification of the uncertainty in the fiber directions obtained, and quantifies the confidence in each reconstructed fiber tract. This paper presents a novel and comprehensive pipeline for fiber tractography that meets the above requirements. The subvoxel fiber geometry is described in detail using a technique that allows not only for straight crossing fibers but for fibers that curve and splay. This technique is repeatedly performed within a residual bootstrap statistical process in order to efficiently quantify the uncertainty in the subvoxel geometries obtained. A robust connectivity index is defined to quantify the confidence in the reconstructed connections. The tractography pipeline is demonstrated in the human brain.	[Campbell, Jennifer S.

Given the necessity for rigorous quality control and motion correction, users are often left to use simple heuristics to select correction schemes, which involves simple qualitative viewing of the set of DWI data, or the selection of transformation parameter thresholds for detection of motion outliers. The scientific community offers strong theoretical and experimental work on noise reduction and orientation distribution function (ODF) reconstruction techniques for HARDI data, where post-acquisition motion correction is widely performed, e.g., using the open-source DTlprep software (1), FSL (the FMRIB Software Library) (2), or TORTOISE (3). Nonetheless, effects and consequences of the selection of motion correction schemes on the final analysis, and the eventual risk of introducing confounding factors when comparing populations, are much less known and far beyond simple intuitive guessing. Hence, standard users lack clear guidelines and recommendations in practical settings. This paper reports a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the outcome of different motion correction choices commonly used by the scientific community on different DWI-derived measures. We make use of human brain HARDI data from a well-controlled motion experiment to simulate various degrees of motion corruption and noise contamination. Choices for correction include exclusion/scrubbing or registration of motion corrupted directions with different choices of interpolation, as well as the option of interpolation of all directions. The comparative evaluation is based on a study of the impact of motion correction using four metrics that quantify (1) similarity of fiber orientation distribution functions (fODFs), (2) deviation of local fiber orientations, (3) global brain connectivity via graph diffusion distance (GDD), and (4) the reproducibility of prominent and anatomically defined fiber tracts. Effects of various motion correction choices are systematically explored and illustrated, leading to a general conclusion of discouraging users from setting ad hoc thresholds on the estimated motion parameters beyond which volumes are claimed to be corrupted.

It remains unclear whether OSAS leads to structural brain changes, and if so, in which brain regions. Brain region-specific gray and white matter volume (GMV and WMV) changes can be measured with voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The aims of this study were to use VBM to analyze GMV and WMV in untreated OSAS patients compared to healthy controls (HC); examine the impact of OSAS-related variables (nocturnal hypoxemia duration and sleep fragmentation index) on GMV and WMV; and assess the effects of therapeutic vs. sham continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. We discuss our results in light of previous findings and provide a comprehensive literature review. Methods:Twenty-seven treatment-naive male patients with moderate to severe OSAS and seven healthy age- and education-matched HC were recruited. After a baseline fMRI scan, patients randomly received either active (therapeutic, n=14) or sham (subtherapeutic, n=13) nasal CPAP treatment for 2 months. Results: Significant negative correlations were observed between nocturnal hypoxemia duration and GMV in bilateral lateral temporal regions. No differences in GMV or WMV were found between OSAS patients and HC, and no differences between CPAP vs. sham CPAP treatment effects in OSAS patients. Conclusion: It appears that considering VBM GMV changes there is little difference between OSAS patients and HC. The largest VBM study to date indicates structural changes in the lateral aspect of the temporal lobe, which also showed a significant negative correlation with nocturnal hypoxemia duration in our study. This finding suggests an association between the effect of nocturnal hypoxemia and decreased GMV in OSAS patients.

To avoid any a priori hypothesis, we use a data-driven analysis assessing differences between groups independently of structures involved. Shared and specific independent component analysis (SSICA) is an exploratory method based on independent component analysis, which performs between-group network comparison. It extracts and classifies components (networks) in those common between groups and those specific to one group. Resting fMRI data were collected from 10 healthy subjects and 10 MILE patients. SSICA was applied multiple times with altered initializations and different numbers of specific components. This resulted in many components specific to patients and to controls. Spatial clustering identified the reliable resting-state networks among all specific components in each group. For each reliable specific network, power spectrum analysis was performed on reconstructed time-series to estimate connectivity in each group and differences between groups. Two reliable networks, corresponding to statistically significant clusters robustly detected with clustering were labeled as specific to MILE and one as specific to the control group. The most reliable MILE network included hippocampus and amygdala bilaterally. The other MTLE network included the postcentral gyri and temporal poles. The control-specific network included bilateral precuneus, anterior cingulate, thalamus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Results indicated that the two MTLE networks show increased connectivity in patients, whereas the control-specific network shows decreased connectivity in patients. Our findings complement results from seed-based connectivity analysis (1). The pattern of changes in connectivity between mesial temporal lobe structures and other areas may help us understand the cognitive impairments often reported in patients with MTLE.

Adaptive dram shut-down counteracts neuroinflammation in the near-term ovine fetus	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						fetus; microglia; ECoG; EEG; hypoxia; acidemia; labor; sheep		Objective: Repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCOs) in ovine fetus leading to severe acidemia result in adaptive shut-down of electrocortical activity [electrocorticogram (ECoG)] as well as systemic and brain inflammation. We hypothesized that the fetuses with earlier ECoG shut-down as a neuroprotective mechanism in response to repetitive UCOs will show less brain inflammation and, moreover, that chronic hypoxia will impact this relationship. Methods: Near-term fetal sheep were chronically instrumented with ECoG leads, vascular catheters, and a cord occluder and then underwent repetitive UCOs for up to 4 h or until fetal arterial pH was <700. Eight animals, hypoxic prior to the UCOs (SaO(2) <55%), were allowed to recover 24 h post insult, while 14 animals, 5 of whom also were chronically hypoxic, were allowed to recover 48 h post insult, after which brains were perfusion-fixed. Time of ECoG shut-down and corresponding pH were noted, as well as time to then reach pH <7.00 (Delta T). Microglia (MG) were counted as a measure of inflammation in gray matter layers 4-6 (GM4-6) where most ECoG activity is generated. Results are reported as mean +/- SEM for p < 0.05. Results: Repetitive UCOs resulted in worsening acidosis over 3-4 h with arterial pH decreasing to 6.97 +/- 0.02 all UCO groups' animals, recovering to baseline by 24 h. ECoG shut-down occurred 52 +/- 7 min before reaching pH <7.00 at pH 7.23 +/- 0.02 across the animal groups. MG counts were inversely correlated to Delta T in 24 h recovery animals (R = -0.84), as expected. This was not the case in normoxic 48 h recovery animals, and, surprisingly, in hypoxic 48 h recovery animals, this relationship was reversed (R = 0.90). Conclusion: Adaptive brain shut-down during labor-like worsening acidemia counteracts neuroinflammation in a hypoxia- and time-dependent manner.

During mechanical ventilation, the variability of ventilatory pressure is dependent on the ventilatory mode. During neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA), the support is proportional to electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), which reflects the respiratory center output. The variability of EAdi is, therefore, translated into a similar variability in pressures. Contrastingly, conventional ventilatory modes deliver less variable pressures. The impact of the mode on the patient's own respiratory drive is less clear. This study aims to compare the impact of NAVA, pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV), and pressure support ventilation (PSV) on the respiratory drive patterns in infants. We hypothesized that on NAVA, EAdi variability resembles most of the endogenous respiratory drive pattern seen in a control group. Methods: Electrical activity of the diaphragm was continuously recorded in 10 infants ventilated successively on NAVA (5 h), PCV (30 min), and PSV (30 min). During the last 10 min of each period, the EAdi variability pattern was assessed using non-rhythmic to rhythmic (NRR) index. These variability profiles were compared to the pattern of a control group of 11 spontaneously breathing and non-intubated infants. Results: In control infants, NRR was higher as compared to mechanically ventilated infants (p < 0.001), and NRR pattern was relatively stable over time. While the temporal stability of NRR was similar in NAVA and controls, the NRR profile was less stable during PCV. PSV exhibited an intermediary pattern. Perspectives: Mechanical ventilation impacts the breathing variability in infants. NAVA produces EAdi pattern resembling most that of control infants. NRR can be used to characterize respiratory variability in infants. Larger prospective studies are necessary to understand the differential impact of the ventilatory modes on the cardio-respiratory variability and to study their impact on clinical outcomes.

J	Jednak, R				Jednak, Roman			The evolution of bladder augmentation: from creating a reservoir to reconstituting an organ	FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS			English	Review						myelomeningocele; neurogenic bladder; bladder augmentation; tissue engineering		Bladder augmentation was first described in 1899. The goal at the time was to establish the ideal method to create a simple capacious reservoir for the safe storage of urine. That simple idea has over the last 100 years grown into one of the most dynamic areas in Pediatric Urology. Creative minds and hands from individuals in multiple disciplines have led us from creating a reservoir to the threshold of recreating a functional organ. In this review, we look at the historical evolution of bladder augmentation and how it exponentially grew in scope from those initial descriptions of intestinocystoplasty to the work being reported today in the field of tissue engineering.

The combination of internal and external information is crucial to constitute our sense of self. Although the underlying neuronal networks, the so-called intrinsic and extrinsic systems, have been well-defined, the associated biochemical mechanisms still remain unclear. We used a well-established functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm for internal (heartbeat counting) and external (tone counting) awareness and combined this technique with [F-18]FMZ-PET imaging in the same healthy subjects. Focusing on cortical midline regions, the results showed that both stimuli types induce negative BOLD responses in the mPFC and the precuneus. Carefully controlling for structured noise in fMRI data, these results were also confirmed in an independent data sample using the same paradigm. Moreover, the degree of the GABA(A) receptor binding potential within these regions was correlated with the neuronal activity changes associated with external, rather than internal awareness when compared to fixation. These data support evidence that the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is an influencing factor in the differential processing of internally and externally guided awareness. This in turn has implications for our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying awareness in general and its potential impact on psychiatric disorders. Hum Brain Mapp 35:173-184, 2014.

Despite most of proposed control schemes for saturated systems which employed linear in parameter neural networks (LPNNs), in the present work nonlinear in parameter neural network (NLPNN) is introduced to support global approximation property. To compensate the effect of the input saturation constraint an auxiliary system is introduced and the error dynamics are modified based on the auxiliary states. Then, learning rules are achieved based on the back propagation (BP) algorithm and by adding two robustifying terms to the standard BP learning rules the stability of the overall system is ensured via Lyapunov direct method. Finally simulations performed on a ''generalized pendulum'' nonlinear system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking control scheme.	[Esfandiari, K.; Abdollahi, F.; Talebi, H.

Neuropathologic Heterogeneity Does Not Impair Florbetapir-Positron Emission Tomography Postmortem Correlates	JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						beta-amyloid; Neuropathogenesis; Alzheimer disease; Argyrophilic grains; Autopsy; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Leuko-araiosis; Lewy bodies; PET imaging; Plaques; TDP-43; Vascular dementia; White matter	PARKINSONS-DISEASE DEMENTIA; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BETA-AMYLOID PATHOLOGY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LEWY BODIES; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; ARGYROPHILIC GRAINS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; PET RADIOLIGAND	Neuropathologic heterogeneity is often present among Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. We sought to determine whether amyloid imaging measures of AD are affected by concurrent pathologies. Thirty-eight clinically and pathologically defined AD and 17 nondemented patients with quantitative florbetapir F-18 (18F-AV-45) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging during life and postmortem histological beta-amyloid quantification and neuropathologic examination were assessed. AD patients were divided on the basis of concurrent pathologies, including those with Lewy bodies (LBs) (n = 21), white matter rarefaction (n = 27), severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 11), argyrophilic grains (n = 5), and TAR DNA binding protein-43 inclusions (n = 18). Many patients exhibited more than 1 type of concurrent pathology. The ratio of cortical to cerebellar amyloid imaging signal (SUVr) and immunohistochemical beta-amyloid load were analyzed in 6 cortical regions of interest. All AD subgroups had strong and significant correlations between SUVr and histological beta-amyloid measures (p mu 0.001). All AD subgroups had significantly greater amyloid measures versus nondemented patients, and mean amyloid measures did not significantly differ between AD subgroups. When comparing AD cases with and without each pathology, AD cases with LBs had significantly lower SUVr measures versus AD cases without LBs (p = 0.002); there were no other paired comparison differences. These findings indicate that florbetapir-PET imaging is not confounded by neuropathological heterogeneity within AD.

The developed method combines surrounding image sampling, saliency map, self-organizing map neural network, k-Means segmentation and similarity measurement. Saliency map can provide valuable information to reduce over-segmentation. The surrounding image sampling always extracts the regions which are close to the centroid of the latest tracked target. The self-organizing map quantizes the image samples into a topological space, it compresses information while preserving the most important topological and metric relationships of the primary features. The k-Means algorithm will generate segmentation based on the output of the self-organizing map. Then, according to the segmentation results of the new frame and the first frame, a similarity measurement is used to get the most similar image sample to the specified object in the first frame and thus object position in new frame is found. We apply the developed method to track objects in the real-world environment of surveillance videos, computer simulations indicate that the proposed approach presents better results than those obtained by a direct method approach.

In this paper, we describe Neuron Time Warp (NTW), a part of the NEURON project for development of multi-scale tools for simulations of brain parts and brains. NTW relies upon the Next Subvolume Method, a stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate chemical reactions within the membrane of a neuron. We make use of a model of a dendrite branch on which to evaluate NTW's performance using MPI and shared memory on a multi-core machine.

We evaluated an affordable VR system for arm rehabilitation, developed by Jintronix Inc, based on the Microsoft Kinect and providing three unilateral and two bilateral activities, each with ten difficulty levels. Our objectives were to 1) determine which activities and levels of difficulty are appropriate for rehabilitation of arm movements in stroke patients with different degrees of motor impairment; and 2) determine the ease of use and subjective experience of patients using the VR arm rehabilitation system. Stroke patients participated in three 20-minute practice sessions supervised by a rehabilitation professional. We determined the highest level of difficulty attained by patients in each activity with a performance score of at least 50% and mapped these to arm impairment level according to the Chedoke-McMaster Arm Scale. Over 80% of the participants provided positive feedback in terms of ease of use and VR experience. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of using an affordable VR arm rehabilitation system in a clinical setting and provide clinical guidelines for the selection of impairment-specific difficulty levels.

An open science resource for establishing reliability and reproducibility in functional connectomics	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article								Efforts to identify meaningful functional imaging-based biomarkers are limited by the ability to reliably characterize inter-individual differences in human brain function. Although a growing number of connectomics-based measures are reported to have moderate to high test-retest reliability, the variability in data acquisition, experimental designs, and analytic methods precludes the ability to generalize results. The Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) is working to address this challenge and establish test-retest reliability as a minimum standard for methods development in functional connectomics. Specifically, CoRR has aggregated 1,629 typical individuals' resting state fMRI (rfMRI) data (5,093 rfMRI scans) from 18 international sites, and is openly sharing them via the International Data-sharing Neuroimaging Initiative (INDI). To allow researchers to generate various estimates of reliability and reproducibility, a variety of data acquisition procedures and experimental designs are included. Similarly, to enable users to assess the impact of commonly encountered artifacts (for example, motion) on characterizations of inter-individual variation, datasets of varying quality are included.

These molecules have been the subject of growing interest as they are believed to control the regulation of a large number of genes, including those expressed in the brain. Evidence suggests that miRNAs could be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Alterations in metabolic enzymes of the polyamine system have been reported to play a role in predisposition to suicidal behaviour. We have previously shown the expression of the polyamine genes SAT1 and SMOX to be down-regulated in the brains of suicide completers. In this study, we hypothesized that the dysregulation of these genes in depressed suicide completers could be influenced by miRNA post-transcriptional regulation. Using a stringent target prediction analysis, we identified several miRNAs that target the 3'UTR of SAT1 and SMOX. We profiled the expression of 10 miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex (BA44) of suicide completers (N=15) and controls (N=16) using qRT-PCR. We found that several miRNAs showed significant up-regulation in the prefrontal cortex of suicide completers compared to psychiatric healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated a significant correlation between these miRNAs and the expression levels of both SAT1 and SMOX. Our results suggest a relationship between miRNAs and polyamine gene expression in the suicide brain, and postulate a mechanism for SAT1 and SMOX down-regulation by post-transcriptional activity of miRNAs.

It has been shown to be a sensitive in vivo measurement of changes of cholinergic innervation densities following lesion of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) in rat. The current study used [F-18]FEOBV with PET imaging to detect the effect of a highly selective lesion of the pedunculopontine (PPTg) nucleus in rat. Methods: After bilateral and selective lesions of the PPTg cholinergic neurons, rats were scanned using [F-18] FEOBV, then sacrificed, and their brain tissues collected for immunostaining and quantification of the VAChT. Results: Comparisons with control rats revealed that cholinergic losses can be detected in the brainstem, lateral thalamus, and pallidum by using both in vivo imaging methods with [F-18]FEOBV, and ex vivo measurements. In the brainstem PPTg area, significant correlations were observed between in vivo and ex vivo measurements, while this was not the case in the thalamic and pallidal projection sites. Conclusions: These findings support PET imaging with [F-18]FEOBV as a reliable in vivo method for the detection of neuronal terminal losses resulting from lesion of the PPTg. Useful applications can be found in the study of neurodegenerative diseases in human, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or dementia with Lewy bodies.

J	Zendel, BR; Alain, C				Zendel, Benjamin Rich; Alain, Claude			Enhanced attention-dependent activity in the auditory cortex of older musicians	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Aging; Musical training; Auditory; Event-related potentials; Auditory cortex	CONCURRENT SOUND SEGREGATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; MUSICAL EXPERIENCE; BACKGROUND-NOISE; SCENE ANALYSIS; AGE; PERCEPTION	Musical training improves auditory processing abilities, which correlates with neuro-plastic changes in exogenous (input-driven) and endogenous (attention-dependent) components of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Evidence suggests that musicians, compared to non-musicians, experience less age-related decline in auditory processing abilities. Here, we investigated whether lifelong musicianship mitigates exogenous or endogenous processing by measuring auditory ERPs in younger and older musicians and non-musicians while they either attended to auditory stimuli or watched a muted subtitled movie of their choice. Both age and musical training-related differences were observed in the exogenous components; however, the differences between musicians and non-musicians were similar across the lifespan. These results suggest that exogenous auditory ERPs are enhanced in musicians, but decline with age at the same rate. On the other hand, attention-related activity, modeled in the right auditory cortex using a discrete spatiotemporal source analysis, was selectively enhanced in older musicians. This suggests that older musicians use a compensatory strategy to overcome age-related decline in peripheral and exogenous processing of acoustic information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Different susceptibility of medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia atrophy rates to vascular risk factors	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Medial temporal lobe; Hippocampus; Basal ganglia; Thalamus; Atrophy; Aging; Vascular risk factor	SMALL-VESSEL DISEASE; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E GENOTYPE; VIRCHOW-ROBIN SPACES; WHITE-MATTER LESIONS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; AGES-REYKJAVIK; MIDLIFE; POPULATION	Atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and basal ganglia (BG) are characteristic of various neurodegenerative diseases in older people. In search of potentially modifiable factors that lead to atrophy in these structures, we studied the association of vascular risk factors with atrophy of the MTL and BG in 368 nondemented men and women (born, 1907-1935) who participated in the Age, Gene/Environment, Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study. A fully automated segmentation pipeline estimated volumes of the MTL and BG from whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at baseline and 2.4 years later. Linear regression models showed higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and the presence of Apo E epsilon 4 were independently associated with increased atrophy of the MTL but no association of vascular risk factors with atrophy of the BG. The different susceptibility of MTL and BG atrophy to the vascular risk factors suggests perfusion of the BG is relatively preserved when vascular risk factors are present. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin in bitransgenic A/T mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe,Ind)) and a constitutively active form of transforming growth factor-beta 1. These mice feature the AD amyloid beta (Ab) and cerebrovascular pathology. Simvastatin significantly decreased insoluble A beta peptide levels and Ab plaque load despite no effect on beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme and A beta-degrading enzyme neprilysin protein levels. However, simvastatin failed to improve spatial learning and memory deficits and the decreased baseline levels of the memory-related protein early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in the hippocampus CA1 area. The impaired hyperemic response to whisker stimulation in A/T mice was not improved with treatment, but simvastatin fully restored constitutive nitric oxide synthesis in vessel walls and exacerbated agonist-mediated dilatory deficits. These findings point to the efficacy of simvastatin on selective AD features in a complex model of the disease, likely reflecting the challenges faced by recent clinical trials in assessing statin efficacy.

Here, we aimed to assess whether cognitive impairment in PD could drive these differences. Nondemented patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and participated in our Wisconsin Card Sorting task functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Patients were separated into 2 groups according to the presence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Patients with MCI displayed reduced activity in the cognitive corticostriatal loop, which includes the caudate nucleus and prefrontal cortex while planning a set shift, whereas non-MCI patients exhibited activation patterns similar to those of healthy participants from our previous studies. Furthermore, reduced activation was observed in the premotor cortex of the MCI patients. Finally, hippocampal activity, correlated with individual memory scores, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in patients with preserved memory. These results suggest that the presence of MCI in PD affects activity in the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus as well as motor-related regions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the demyelinating autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, OLGs are damaged and those remaining fail to fully remyelinate CNS lesions. Therefore, current therapies directed to restrain the inflammation process with approaches that protect and reconstitute oligodendrocyte density would be essential to pave the way of myelin repair. A critical signal for oligodendrocytes is insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which promotes their development and ultimately myelin formation. PTEN inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, a convergence downstream pathway for growth factors such as IGF-1. In this report, we temporarily inhibited PTEN activity by treating rat and human oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) cultured alone or with dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs) with bisperoxovanadium (phen). Our findings show that phen potentiates IGF-1 actions by increasing proliferation of OLPs in a concentration-dependent manner, and caused a sustained and time-dependent activation of the main pathways: PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and MEK/ERK. At low concentrations, IGF-1 and phen stimulated the differentiation of rat and human OLPs. Concordantly, the PTEN inhibitor together with IGF-1 robustly augmented myelin basic protein accumulation in rat newborn and human fetal OLGs co-cultured with DRGNs in a longer timeframe by promoting the elaboration of organized myelinated fibers as evidenced by confocal microscopy. Thus, our results suggest that a transient suppression of a potential barrier for myelination in combination with other therapeutic approaches including growth factors may be promising to improve the functional recovery of CNS injuries.

Baseline MRI measures included hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensities. Neuropsychological assessment focused on different aspects of episodic memory (i.e., familiarity, free recall, and associative memory) and executive control functions (i.e., working memory, switching, and planning). Global and regional cortical thinning was observed in MCI patients who progressed to dementia compared to those who remained stable, whereas no differences were found between groups for baseline hippocampal volume and white matter hyperintensities. The strongest neuroimaging predictors were baseline cortical thickness in the right anterior cingulate and middle frontal gyri. For cognitive predictors, we found that deficits in both free recall and recognition episodic memory tasks were highly suggestive of progression to dementia. Cortical thinning in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, combined to controlled and familiarity-based retrieval deficits, achieved a classification accuracy of 87.5%, a specificity of 90.9%, and a sensitivity of 83.3%. This predictive model including both classes of measures provided more accurate predictions than those based on neuroimaging or cognitive measures alone. Overall, our findings suggest that detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease is probably best accomplished by combining complementary information from targeted neuroimaging and cognitive classifiers, and highlight the importance of taking into account both structural and functional changes associated with the disease.

This phase I study aimed to explore the safety and toxicity of this combination in pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors. ProcedurePatients 21 years of age with recurrent/refractory solid tumors (including CNS) were eligible. Sirolimus was administered daily by mouth or nasogastric (NG) tube, with doses adjusted to achieve a target trough concentration of 10-15ng/ml, with weekly intravenous vinblastine (dose escalated 4-6mg/m(2)/dose according to 3+3 phase I design). ResultsFourteen patients were enrolled (median age 8.7 years; range 2.3-19) of whom 12 were evaluable for toxicity and 11 for response. One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 mucositis) at the highest vinblastine dose level. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity. Dose-adjusted sirolimus trough concentrations were significantly lower in patients receiving drug via NG tube (1.500.75ng/ml/mg vs. 2.25 +/- 1.07ng/ml/mg for oral administration). Correlative biomarker analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in serum concentration of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR2) at 28 days compared to baseline consistent with inhibition of angiogenesis. One patient had a partial response and three had stable disease for more than 3 months. ConclusionsThe combination of mTOR inhibitor and vinblastine given over an extended continuous schedule is safe, associated with a reduction in circulating angiogenic factor (CAF) VEGFR2 and resulted in clinical responses.

Chaperones may have a crucial role in AD due to their involvement in protein quality control, folding, and degradation. In this study, we investigated the mRNA and promoter DNA methylation levels of two chaperones, HSPA8 and HSPA9, in postmortem brain tissue (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus) from healthy elderly and AD subjects as well as in peripheral blood of healthy elderly and AD patients. mRNA quantification was performed by qRT-PCR and DNA methylation by mass spectrometry. In the peripheral blood, we did not observe a significant difference in HSPA8 and HSPA9 expression between elderly controls and AD. Asignificant downregulation of HSPA8 and HSPA9 was observed in AD across the three brain regions compared to the controls, suggesting their participation in AD pathogenesis. However, no important DNA methylation differences were observed, suggesting that other mechanism may be involved in controlling these genes expression.

The cost of road accidents is estimated to be 10-25 billion Canadian dollars annually. Accordingly, it is necessary for municipalities to develop a strategic cost-effective plan in order to renew and restripe pavement markings. Therefore, the objective of the present research is to model the effect of various factors on pavement marking conditions. Data on Alkyd paint pavement marking material are collected from the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Since the collected data from municipalities in Canada always include input variables and fail to provide output variable(s) (e.g. condition), an unsupervised neural network (UNN) model is first developed to generate the condition of pavement marking (output). Then, regression and neurofuzzy models are developed based upon the results of UNN model. The developed models are validated in which they show satisfactory results. A sensitivity analysis is performed to show the effect of changing the input variables on the developed models' output(s).

Our aim was to compare patients who differ in age-of-onset, while controlling for illness duration, and number of depressive episodes. By directly comparing early-(EOD) and late-onset (LOD) patients, we examined whether age-of-onset is associated with changes in the extent or spatial pattern of cortical thickness. Cross-sectional comparison of cortical thickness in EOD vs. LOD. Age-of-onset was determined based on self-report, with EOD defined as onset prior to age 25. Reduced cortical thickness in the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), pre- and postcentral gyrus, and the lingual gyrus were found in EOD compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001). In linear regression models controlling for number of episodes, illness duration, severity, and sex, differences (at p < 0.001) were found between EOD and LOD in the bilateral posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyri, right precuneus, lingual, and fusiform gyri, but not the DLPFC. EOD is associated with greater disturbances in cortical thickness than LOD, even when duration of illness and other factors are controlled. These results provide novel insights on how development of depression is differentiated by age. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

LCFA metabolism in the MBH plays a key role in the control of food intake and glucose homeostasis, yet it is not known if glucose regulates LCFA oxidation and esterification in the MBH and, if so, which hypothalamic cell type(s) and intracellular signaling mechanisms are involved. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of glucose on LCFA metabolism, assess the role of AMP-activated Kinase (AMPK), and to establish if changes in LCFA metabolism and its regulation by glucose vary as a function of the kind of LCFA, cell type, and brain region. We show that glucose inhibits palmitate oxidation via AMPK in hypothalamic neuronal cell lines, primary hypothalamic astrocyte cultures, and MBH slices ex vivo but not in cortical astrocytes and slice preparations. In contrast, oleate oxidation was not affected by glucose or AMPK inhibition in MBH slices. In addition, our results show that glucose increases palmitate, but not oleate, esterification into neutral lipids in neurons and MBH slices but not in hypothalamic astrocytes. These findings reveal for the first time the metabolic fate of different LCFA in the MBH, demonstrate AMPK-dependent glucose regulation of LCFA oxidation in both astrocytes and neurons, and establish metabolic coupling of glucose and LCFA as a distinguishing feature of hypothalamic nuclei critical for the control of energy balance.

J	Menard, C; Bastianetto, S; Quirion, R				Menard, Caroline; Bastianetto, Stephane; Quirion, Remi			Neuroprotective effects of resveratrol and epigallocatechin gallate polyphenols are mediated by the activation of protein kinase C gamma	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						PKC; polyphenols; neuroprotection; resveratrol; epigallocatechin gallate; hippocampal cultured cells	AMYLOID-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; GREEN TEA CATECHINS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; CELL-DEATH; PKC-GAMMA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; COGNITIVE DECLINE; PRECURSOR PROTEIN	Polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and resveratrol have received a great deal of attention because they may contribute to the purported neuroprotective action of the regular consumption of green tea and red wine. Many studies, including those published by our group, suggest that this protective action includes their abilities to prevent the neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid, a protein whose accumulation likely plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the scavenging activities of polyphenols on reactive oxygen species and their inhibitory action of cyclooxygenase likely explain, at least in part, their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Besides these well-documented properties, the modulatory action of these polyphenols on intracellular signaling pathways related to cell death/survival (e.g., protein kinase C, PKC) has yet to be investigated in detail. Using rat hippocampal neuronal cells, we aimed to investigate here the effects of EGCG and resveratrol on cell death induced by GE 109203X, a selective inhibitor of PKC. The MTT/resazurin and spectrin assays indicated that EGCG and resveratrol protected against GE 109203X-induced cell death and cytoskeleton degeneration, with a maximal effect at 1 and 3 mu M, respectively. Moreover, immunofluorescence data revealed that cells treated with these polyphenols increased PKC gamma (gamma) activation and promoted neuronal interconnections. Finally, we found that the protective effects of both polyphenols on the cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity were mediated by the PKC gamma subunit. Taken together, the results suggest that PKC, and more specifically its gamma subunit, plays a critical role in the protective action of EGCG and resveratrol on neuronal integrity.

This study investigated the impact of inflammation on locoregional cerebral oxygen saturation in a newborn rodent model using photoacoustic imaging. Methods: 1 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide(LPS) diluted in saline or saline alone was injected under ultrasound guidance directly in the corpus callosum of P3 rat pups. Coronal photoacoustic images were carried out 24 h after LPS exposure. Locoregional oxygen saturation (SO2) and resting state connectivity were assessed in the cortex and the corpus callosum. Microvasculature was then evaluated on cryosection slices by lectin histochemistry. Results: Significant reduction of SO2 was found in the corpus callosum; reduced SO2 was also found in the cortex ipsilateral to the injection site. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis showed that bilateral connectivity was not affected by LPS exposure. Changes in locoregional oxygen saturation were accompanied by a significant reduction in the average length of microvessels in the left cortex but no differences were observed in the corpus callosum. Conclusion: Inflammation in the developing brain induces marked reduction of locoregional oxygen saturation, predominantly in the white matter not explained by microvascular degeneration. The ability to examine regional saturation offers a new way to monitor injury and understand physiological disturbance non-invasively.

BACE1 has a transmembrane sequence (TMS), which makes it unique among related proteases. We noticed that the BACE1 TMS contains an uncommon sulfur-rich motif. The sequence MxxxCxxxMxxxCxMxC spans the entire TMS, resembles metal ion binding motifs, and is highly conserved among homologues. We used a synthetic 31-mer model peptide comprising the TMS to study metal ion binding and oligomerization. Applying diverse biochemical and biophysical techniques, we detected dimer and trimer formation of the TMS peptide with copper ions. Replacement of the central Cys466 by Ala essentially abolished these effects. We show that the peptide undergoes a redox reaction with copper ions resulting in a disulfide bridge involving Cys466. Further, we find peptide trimerization that depends on the presence of monovalent copper ions and the sulfhydryl group of Cys466. We identified Cys466 as a key residue for metal ion chelation and to be the core of an oligomerization motif of the BACE1-TMS peptide. Our results demonstrate a novel metal ion controlled oligomerization of the BACE1 TMS, which could have an enormous therapeutic importance against Alzheimer disease.

The clustering of MetS components suggests shared etiologies, but these are largely unknown and may vary between males and females. Here, we investigated the latent structure of pre-clinical MetS in a community-based sample of 286 male and 312 female adolescents, assessing their abdominal adiposity (VF) directly with magnetic resonance imaging. Principal component analysis of the five MetS-defining variables (VF, blood pressure [BP], fasting serum triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and glucose) identified independent two components 111 both males and females. The first component was sex-similar; it explained >30% of variance and was loaded by all but BP variables. The second component explained >20% of variance; it was loaded by BP similarly in both sexes but additional loading by metabolic variables was sex-specific. This sex-specificity was not detected in analyses that used waist circumference instead of VF. In adolescence, MetS-defining variables cluster into at least two sub-syndromes: (1) sex-similar metabolic abnormalities of obesity-induced insulin resistance and (2) sex-specific metabolic abnormalities associated with BP elevation. These results suggest that the etiology of MetS may involve more than one pathway and that some of the pathways may differ between males and females. Further, the sex-specific metabolic abnormalities associated in BP elevation suggest he need for sex-specific prevention and treatment strategies MetS.

It aims at producing a message to be imprinted as an ink trace left on a writing medium. The generated trajectory of the pen tip is made up of strokes superimposed over time. The Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its family of lognormal models provide analytical representations of these strokes, often considered as the basic unit of handwriting. This paradigm has not only been experimentally confirmed in numerous predictive and physiologically significant tests but it has also been shown to be the ideal mathematical description for the impulse response of a neuromuscular system. This latter demonstration suggests that the lognormality of the velocity patterns can be interpreted as reflecting the behavior of subjects who are in perfect control of their movements. To illustrate this interpretation, we present a short overview of the main concepts behind the Kinematic Theory and briefly describe how its models can be exploited, using various software tools, to investigate these ideal lognormal behaviors. We emphasize that the parameters extracted during various tasks can be used to analyze some underlying processes associated with their realization. To investigate the operational convergence hypothesis, we report on two original studies. First, we focus on the early steps of the motor learning process as seen as a converging behavior toward the production of more precise lognormal patterns as young children practicing handwriting start to become more fluent writers. Second, we illustrate how aging affects handwriting by pointing out the increasing departure from the ideal lognormal behavior as the control of the fine motricity begins to decline. Overall, the paper highlights this developmental process of merging toward a lognormal behavior with learning, mastering this behavior to succeed in performing a given task, and then gradually deviating from it with aging.

Methods: Multiple decision tree models and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to compare the administration of magnesium sulphate with the alternative of no treatment. Two separate cost perspectives were utilized in this series of analyses: a health system and a societal perspective. In addition, two separate measures of effectiveness were utilized: cases of cerebral palsy (CP) averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results: From a health system and a societal perspective, respectively, a savings of $2,242 and $112,602 is obtained for each QALY gained and a savings of $30,942 and $1,554,198 is obtained for each case of CP averted when magnesium sulphate is administered to patients in whom preterm birth is imminent. From a health system perspective and a societal perspective, respectively, a cost of $2,083 is incurred and a savings of $108,277 is obtained for each QALY gained and a cost of $28,755 is incurred and a savings of $1,494,500 is obtained for each case of CP averted when magnesium sulphate is administered to patients in whom preterm birth is threatened. Conclusions: Administration of magnesium sulphate to patients in whom preterm birth is imminent is a dominant (i.e. cost-effective) strategy, no matter what cost perspective or measure of effectiveness is used. Administration of magnesium sulphate to patients in whom preterm birth is threatened is a dominant strategy from a societal perspective and is very likely to be cost-effective from a health system perspective.

Overexpression of 14-3-3z Promotes Tau Phosphorylation at Ser(262) and Accelerates Proteosomal Degradation of Synaptophysin in Rat Primary Hippocampal Neurons	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; FTDP-17 MISSENSE MUTATIONS; HELICAL FILAMENT-TAU; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; MICROTUBULE-BINDING; TRANSGENIC MICE; PROTEASOMAL DEGRADATION; REACTIVE ASTROCYTES	b-amyloid peptide accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and synapse loss are characteristic neuropathological symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau hyperphosphorylation is suggested to inhibit the association of tau with microtubules, making microtubules unstable and causing neurodegeneration. The mechanism of tau phosphorylation in AD brain, therefore, is of considerable significance. Although PHF-tau is phosphorylated at over 40 Ser/Thr sites, Ser(262) phosphorylation was shown to mediate b-amyloid neurotoxicity and formation of toxic tau lesions in the brain. In vitro, PKA is one of the kinases that phosphorylates tau at Ser(262), but the mechanism by which it phosphorylates tau in AD brain is not very clear. 14-3-3z is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and is upregulated in AD brain. In this study, we show that 14-3-3z promotes tau phosphorylation at Ser(262) by PKA in differentiating neurons. When overexpressed in rat hippocampal primary neurons, 14-3-3z causes an increase in Ser(262) phosphorylation, a decrease in the amount of microtubule-bound tau, a reduction in the amount of polymerized microtubules, as well as microtubule instability. More importantly, the level of pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin was significantly reduced. Downregulation of synaptophysin in 14-3-3z overexpressing neurons was mitigated by inhibiting the proteosome, indicating that 14-3-3z promotes proteosomal degradation of synaptophysin. When 14-3-3z overexpressing neurons were treated with the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol, tau Ser(262) phosphorylation decreased and synaptophysin level was restored. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of 14-3-3z accelerates proteosomal turnover of synaptophysin by promoting the destabilization of microtubules. Synaptophysin is involved in synapse formation and neurotransmitter release. Our results suggest that 14-3-3z may cause synaptic pathology by reducing synaptophysin levels in the brains of patients suffering from AD.

However, induced GBA in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is susceptible to artifacts caused by miniature fixational saccades. Recent studies have demonstrated that fixational saccades also reflect high-level representational processes. Do high-level as opposed to low-level factors influence fixational saccades? What is the effect of these factors on artifact-free GBA? To investigate this, we conducted separate eye tracking and EEG experiments using identical designs. Participants classified line drawings as objects or non-objects. To introduce low-level differences, contours were defined along different directions in cardinal color space: S-cone-isolating, intermediate isoluminant, or a full-color stimulus, the latter containing an additional achromatic component. Prior to the classification task, object discrimination thresholds were measured and stimuli were scaled to matching suprathreshold levels for each participant. In both experiments, behavioral performance was best for full-color stimuli and worst for S-cone isolating stimuli. Saccade rates 200-700 ms after stimulus onset were modulated independently by low and high-level factors, being higher for full-color stimuli than for S-cone isolating stimuli and higher for objects. Low-amplitude evoked GBA and total GBA were observed in very few conditions, showing that paradigms with isoluminant stimuli may not be ideal for eliciting such responses. We conclude that cortical loops involved in the processing of objects are preferentially excited by stimuli that contain achromatic information. Their activation can lead to relatively early exploratory eye movements even for foveally-presented stimuli.

J	Nickels, S; Opitz, B; Steinhauer, K				Nickels, Stefanie; Opitz, Bertram; Steinhauer, Karsten			ERPs show that classroom-instructed late second language learners rely on the same prosodic cues in syntactic parsing as native speakers	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Second language acquisition; Critical period; Prosody; Syntactic ambiguity; Speech		The loss of brain plasticity after a 'critical period' in childhood has often been argued to prevent late language learners from using the same neurocognitive mechanisms as native speakers and, therefore, from attaining a high level of second language (L2) proficiency [7,11]. However, more recent behavioral and electrophysiological research has challenged this 'Critical Period Hypothesis', demonstrating that even late L2 learners can display native-like performance and brain activation patterns 1171, especially after longer periods of immersion in an L2 environment. Here we use event-related potentials (ERPs) to show that native-like processing can also be observed in the largely under-researched domain of speech prosody - even when L2 learners are exposed to their second language almost exclusively in a classroom setting. Participants listened to spoken sentences whose prosodic boundaries would either cooperate or conflict with the syntactic structure. Previous work had shown that this paradigm is difficult for elderly native speakers, however, German L2 learners of English showed very similar ERP components for on-line prosodic phrasing as well as for prosody-syntax mismatches (garden path effects) as the control group of native speakers. These data suggest that L2 immersion is not always necessary to master complex L2 speech processing in a native-like way. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Making decisions necessitates both implicit/associative and explicit/analytic processes. Here, we explored explicit mechanisms, and hypothesized that suicide attempters fail to use explicit understanding to make favorable choices. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was used to assess decision-making in 151 non-depressed patients with a history of mood disorder and suicidal act, 81 nondepressed patients with a history of mood disorders but no suicidal act, and 144 healthy individuals. After performing the task, we assessed the explicit understanding of the participants of the contingencies in the task, i.e. which options yielded higher gain or loss. Correct explicit understanding was reported less often in suicide attempters and affective controls than in healthy controls (45.7% and 42.0% vs. 66.0%). Moreover, understanding was associated with better performance in healthy and affective controls, but not in suicide attempters, with no between-group difference among those who did not reach understanding. Patients with histories of suicide attempt, therefore, show a disconnection between what they "know" and what they "do", possibly reflecting underlying impairments in implicit associative processes. These cognitive alterations should be addressed in preventative interventions targeting suicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TrkB signaling alterations are linked to numerous neurodegenerative diseases and conditions. Herein we report the synthesis, biological evaluation and radiosynthesis of the first TrkB radioligands based on the recently identified 7,8-dihydroxyflavone chemotype. 2-(4-[F-18]fluorophenyl)-7,8-dihydroxy-4H-chromen-4-one ([F-18]10b) was synthesized in high radiochemical yields via an efficient SNAr radiofluorination involving a para-Michael acceptor substituted aryl followed by BBr3-promoted double demethylation. Selective N-[C-11]methylation afforded 2-(4-([N-methyl-C-11]-dimethylamino) phenyl)-7,8-dihydroxy-4H-chromen4- one ([C-11]10c) from the fully deprotected catechol-bearing normethyl precursor 13 with [C-11]MeOTf. In vitro autoradiography of [F-18]10b with transverse rat brain sections revealed high specific binding in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus in accordance with expected TrkB distribution. Blockade experiments with both 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (1a) and TrkB cognate ligand, BDNF, led to decreases of 80% and 85% of radioligand binding strongly supporting the hypothesis that 7,8-dihydroxyflavones exert their effect on TrkB phosphorylation via direct TrkB extracellular domain (ECD) binding. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies revealed that [F-18]10b and [C-11]10c brain uptake is minimal and that they are rapidly eliminated from the plasma (effective plasma half-life 5-10 min) via hepatic secretion. Nevertheless, the high specific binding and TrkB specificity derived from in vitro experiments suggests that the 7,8-disubstituted flavone chemotype represents a promising scaffold for the development of TrkB radiotracers for PET.

The gold nanoparticles were electrodeposited to modify the gold surface and to increase the electrochemical active area by a factor of approximately 3, i.e. by 68%. Protein G was used as scaffold for well oriented EGFR antibodies immobilization. Under optimal experimental parameters, the impedance changes were used for the detection of EGFR with a wide dynamic range of 1 pg mL(-1)-1 mu g mL(-1). The immunosensor showed an excellent reproducibility and selectivity against biomarkers, murine double minute 2 and platelet derived growth factor receptor. The excellent analytical performance of the EGFR immunosensor in terms of selectivity, sensitivity and low detection limit might be attributed to the synergetic effect between the Au nanoparticles and the protein G scaffold. The matrix effect from mouse brain tissue homogenate was also studied and the immunosensor showed excellent recoveries ranging from 98.3% to 115% and RSD of 1.55-6.17. Finally, our developed strategy could open new avenues for clinical screening and prognosis of tumors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is not known if the mutation results in a gain of function, a loss of function or if, perhaps both mechanisms are linked to pathogenesis. We generated a genetic model of ALS to explore the biological consequences of a null mutation of the Caenorhabditis elegans C9ORF72 orthologue, F18A1.6, also called alfa-1. alfa-1 mutants displayed age-dependent motility defects leading to paralysis and the specific degeneration of GABAergic motor neurons. alfa-1 mutants showed differential susceptibility to environmental stress where osmotic stress provoked neurodegeneration. Finally, we observed that the motor defects caused by loss of alfa-1 were additive with the toxicity caused by mutant TDP-43 proteins, but not by the mutant FUS proteins. These data suggest that a loss of alfa-1/C9ORF72 expression may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in a pathway associated with other known ALS genes.	[Therrien, Martine; Parker, J.

Multimodal Integration of Self-Motion Cues in the Vestibular System: Active versus Passive Translations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corollary discharge; efference copy; head motion; neuron; otolith; proprioception	HEAD DIRECTION CELLS; HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; LINEAR DISPLACEMENT; FIRING PROPERTIES; PATH-INTEGRATION; THALAMUS NEURONS; NUCLEI NEURONS; SPATIAL MEMORY; EYE-MOVEMENT	The ability to keep track of where we are going as we navigate through our environment requires knowledge of our ongoing location and orientation. In response to passively applied motion, the otolith organs of the vestibular system encode changes in the velocity and direction of linear self-motion (i.e., heading). When self-motion is voluntarily generated, proprioceptive and motor efference copy information is also available to contribute to the brain's internal representation of current heading direction and speed. However to date, how the brain integrates these extra-vestibular cues with otolith signals during active linear self-motion remains unknown. Here, to address this question, we compared the responses of macaque vestibular neurons during active and passive translations. Single-unit recordings were made from a subgroup of neurons at the first central stage of sensory processing in the vestibular pathways involved in postural control and the computation of self-motion perception. Neurons responded far less robustly to otolith stimulation during self-generated than passive head translations. Yet, the mechanism underlying the marked cancellation of otolith signals did not affect other characteristics of neuronal responses (i.e., baseline firing rate, tuning ratio, orientation of maximal sensitivity vector). Transiently applied perturbations during active motion further established that an otolith cancellation signal was only gated in conditions where proprioceptive sensory feedback matched the motor-based expectation. Together our results have important implications for understanding the brain's ability to ensure accurate postural and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during active self-motion.

Network efficiency in autism spectrum disorder and its relation to brain overgrowth	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism; brain size; network analysis; connectivity; tractography; optimal wiring; scaling	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SMALL-WORLD; INTRACRANIAL VOLUME; HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE; MRI DATA; IN-VIVO; SIZE; CONNECTIVITY	A substantial body of evidence links differences in brain size to differences in brain organization. We have hypothesized that the developmental aspect of this relation plays a role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder which involves abnormalities in brain growth. Children with ASD have abnormally large brains by the second year of life, and for several years thereafter their brain size can be multiple standard deviations above the norm. The greater conduction delays and cellular costs presumably associated with the longer long-distance connections in these larger brains is thought to influence developmental processes, giving rise to an altered brain organization with less communication between spatially distant regions. This has been supported by computational models and by findings linking greater intra-cranial volume, an index of maximum brain-size during development, to reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity in individuals with ASD. In this paper, we further assess this hypothesis via a whole-brain analysis of network efficiency. We utilize diffusion tractography to estimate the strength and length of the connections between all pairs of cortical regions. We compute the efficiency of communication between each network node and all others, and within local neighborhoods; we then assess the relation of these measures to intra-cranial volume, and the differences in these measures between adults with autism and typical controls. Intra-cranial volume is shown to be inversely related to efficiency for wide-spread regions of cortex. Moreover, the spatial patterns of reductions in efficiency in autism bear a striking resemblance to the regional relationships between efficiency and intra-cranial volume, particularly for local efficiency. The results thus provide further support for the hypothesized link between brain overgrowth in children with autism and the efficiency of the organization of the brain in adults with autism.

This "repetition suppression" (RS) is a primitive mechanism involved in learning of unfamiliar faces, which can be detected through amplitude reduction of the N170 event-related potential (ERP). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) exerts top-down influence on early visual processing. However, its contribution to N170 RS and learning of unfamiliar faces remains unclear. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) transiently increases or decreases cortical excitability, as a function of polarity. We hypothesized that DLPFC excitability modulation by tDCS would cause polarity-dependent modulations of N170 RS during encoding of unfamiliar faces. tDCS-induced N170 RS enhancement would improve long-term recognition reaction time (RT) and/or accuracy rates, whereas N170 RS impairment would compromise recognition ability. Participants underwent three tDCS conditions in random order at,72 hour intervals: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal and sham. Immediately following tDCS conditions, an EEG was recorded during encoding of unfamiliar faces for assessment of P100 and N170 visual ERPs. The P3a component was analyzed to detect prefrontal function modulation. Recognition tasks were administered similar to 72 hours following encoding. Results indicate the right anodal/left cathodal condition facilitated N170 RS and induced larger P3a amplitudes, leading to faster recognition RT. Conversely, the right cathodal/left anodal condition caused N170 amplitude and RTs to increase, and a delay in P3a latency. These data demonstrate that DLPFC excitability modulation can influence early visual encoding of unfamiliar faces, highlighting the importance of DLPFC in basic learning mechanisms.

Neuroplastic effects of music lessons on hippocampal volume in children with congenital hypothyroidism	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						congenital hypothyroidism; hippocampus; musical training; thyroid hormone	THYROID-HORMONE; TASK-PERFORMANCE; SPATIAL MEMORY; DENTATE GYRUS; NEUROGENESIS; PLASTICITY; LOCATION; BRAIN; RATS	Children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) who experience a neonatal thyroid hormone deficiency have reduced hippocampal volumes compared with healthy controls. Interestingly, evidence suggests that musical training can contribute to structural plasticity in a number of brain areas, including the hippocampus. Therefore, we investigated whether taking music lessons could ameliorate the volumetric reductions of the hippocampus in children with CH. Left and right hippocampal volumes were measured in four groups of children: children with CH with and without music lessons, and healthy controls with and without music lessons. We found that the volume of the right hippocampus was comparable between children with CH who had taken music lessons and the healthy controls. Children with CH who had not taken music lessons had reduced hippocampal volumes compared with the other three groups. These results suggest that music lessons may induce structural neuroplasticity in children with atypical hippocampal development because of early thyroid hormone deficiencies.

ACTIVATION OF MAS ONCOGENE-RELATED GENE (MRG) C RECEPTORS ENHANCES MORPHINE-INDUCED ANALGESIA THROUGH MODULATION OF COUPLING OF mu-OPIOID RECEPTOR TO GI-PROTEIN IN RAT SPINAL DORSAL HORN	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dorsal root ganglia; G proteins; Mas oncogene-related gene (Mrg); mu-opioid receptors; spinal dorsal horn; morphine analgesia	ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; GTP-BINDING PROTEIN; AGONIST BAM8-22; SENSORY NEURONS; TOLERANCE; EXPRESSION; MICE; PAIN; FAMILY; BRAIN	Mas oncogene-related gene (Mrg) G protein-coupled receptors are exclusively expressed in small-sized neurons in trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in mammals. The present study investigated the effect of MrgC receptor activation on morphine analgesic potency and addressed its possible mechanisms. Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the specific MrgC receptor agonist bovine adrenal medulla 8-22 (BAM8-22, 3 nmol) increased morphine-induced analgesia and shifted the morphine dose response curve to the left in rats. Acute morphine (5 mu g) reduced the coupling of mu-opioid receptors (MORs) to Gi-, but not Gs-, protein in the spinal dorsal horn. The i.t. BAM8-22 (3 nmol) prevented this change of G-protein repertoire while the inactive MrgC receptor agonist BAM8-18 (3 nmol, i.t.) failed to do so. A double labeling study showed the co-localization of MrgC and MORs in DRG neurons. The i.t. BAM8-22 also increased the coupling of MORs to Gi-protein and recruited Gi-protein from cytoplasm to the cell membrane in the spinal dorsal horn. Application of BAM8-22 (10 nM) in the cultured ganglion explants for 30 min increased Gi-protein mRNA, but not Gs-protein mRNA. The present study demonstrated that acute administration of morphine inhibited the repertoire of MOR/Gi-protein coupling in the spinal dorsal horn in vivo. The findings highlight a novel mechanism by which the activation of MrgC receptors can modulate the coupling of MORs with Gi-protein to enhance morphine-induced analgesia. Hence, adjunct treatment of MrgC agonist BAM8-22 may be of therapeutic value to relieve pain. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Perinatal inflammatory stress in preterm babies is associated with increased rates of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and adverse neurological dysfunction. In this study, we set out to determine the consequences of severe systemic inflammatory stress on developmental retinal vascularization and evaluate the subsequent outcome on retinal function in later life. METHODS. Systemic inflammatory stress was induced in C57BL/6J mouse pups by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/kg) at postnatal day 4. In response to LPS, retinal inflammation was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of diverse inflammatory markers. A detailed and systematic analysis of retinal microglial infiltration, retinal vascular morphology, density, and growth rate was performed at key time points throughout retinal vascularization. Retinal function in adult life was assessed by using electroretinography at 6 weeks postinjection. RESULTS. As early as 48 hours after intraperitoneal administration of LPS, a significant increase in retinal vascular density was noted throughout the retina. A pronounced increase in the number of activated microglial cell was observed in the retinal ganglion cell layer and in the outer plexiform layer just prior to their vascularization; direct physical contact between activated microglia and sprouting vessels suggested that microglia partake in promoting the aberrant retinal vascularization. With maturity, animals subjected to perinatal inflammatory stress displayed depleted retinal vascular beds and had significantly decreased retinal function as determined by electroretinography. CONCLUSIONS. Our data reveal that early severe postnatal inflammatory stress leads to abnormal retinal vascular development and increased vessel anastomosis and, ultimately, permanently compromises retinal function. The aberrant and initially exaggerated retinal vascularization observed is associated with microglial activation, providing a cellular mechanism by which perinatal sepsis predisposes to ROP.

No Evidence for Impairment of Venous Hemodynamics in Children or Young Adults with Pediatric-Onset Multiple Sclerosis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							MCDONALD CRITERIA; INSUFFICIENCY; FLOW; MRI; MS; ASSOCIATION; RELAPSE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is a postulated etiologic factor for multiple sclerosis, but the higher frequency with longer disease duration and progressive disability suggests that chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is secondary to chronic disease. We evaluated the presence of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in pediatric-onset MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six pediatric patients with MS (18 years of age or younger), 26 age-matched healthy controls, and 13 young adults with pediatric-onset MS underwent sonography of the internal jugular, vertebral, and deep cerebral veins. Five venous hemodynamic criteria were assessed, with 2 criteria required for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. MR imaging studies, performed in the pediatric patients with MS and healthy control groups, included intracranial 2D time-of-flight MR venography and velocity-sensitive phase-contrast sequences. Contrast-enhanced brain MR images were obtained in pediatric patients with MS to further evaluate venous patency. We used paired t tests, Wilcoxon matched pairs, McNemar tests, and exact conditional logistic regression to estimate the association of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency with MS. RESULTS: Fifty participants (73.5%) had normal ultrasound findings, 15 (23.1%) met 1 venous hemodynamic criterion, and 2 pediatric patients with MS and 1 young adult with pediatric-onset MS met chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency was not associated with MS (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 0.19-infinity). Demographic and disease characteristics did not differ between the patients with MS meeting chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria (n = 3) and those who did not (n = 36; all, P > .05). The mean (SD) MR imaging measures of intracerebral flow did not differ between the 2 pediatric patients with MS meeting chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria (0.85 +/- 0.11) and healthy controls (0.87 +/- 0.16, P = .50); no child demonstrated venous obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is rarely observed in children or young adults with pediatric-onset MS. Venous anatomy and flow rates indicate that venous outflow is intact in pediatric patients with MS. Our findings argue against chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency as a component of MS etiology.

This model presents with neuropathological and electroencephalographic features that are seen in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. It is also characterized by a latent period that follows the initial precipitating injury (i.e., status epilepticus) until the appearance of recurrent seizures, as observed in the human condition. Finally, the kainic acid model can be reproduced in a variety of species using either systemic, intrahippocampal or intra-amygdaloid administrations. In this review, we describe the various methodological procedures and evaluate their differences with respect to the behavioral, electroencephalographic and neuropathological correlates. In addition, we compare the kainic acid model with other animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy such as the pilocarpine and the kindling model. We conclude that the kainic acid model is a reliable tool for understanding temporal lobe epilepsy, provided that the differences existing between methodological procedures are taken into account.

Detection of Slipped-DNAs at the Trinucleotide Repeats of the Myotonic Dystrophy Type I Disease Locus in Patient Tissues	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; NUCLEIC-ACID QUANTIFICATION; REPLICATION ORIGIN; COMPETITIVE PCR; (CTG)CENTER-DOT(CAG) REPEATS; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; TRANSGENIC MICE; CAG REPEAT; REPAIR	Slipped-strand DNAs, formed by out-of-register mispairing of repeat units on complementary strands, were proposed over 55 years ago as transient intermediates in repeat length mutations, hypothesized to cause at least 40 neurodegenerative diseases. While slipped-DNAs have been characterized in vitro, evidence of slipped-DNAs at an endogenous locus in biologically relevant tissues, where instability varies widely, is lacking. Here, using an anti-DNA junction antibody and immunoprecipitation, we identify slipped-DNAs at the unstable trinucleotide repeats (CTG)n center dot(CAG)n of the myotonic dystrophy disease locus in patient brain, heart, muscle and other tissues, where the largest expansions arise in non-mitotic tissues such as cortex and heart, and are smallest in the cerebellum. Slipped-DNAs are shown to be present on the expanded allele and in chromatinized DNA. Slipped-DNAs are present as clusters of slip-outs along a DNA, with each slip-out having 1-100 extrahelical repeats. The allelic levels of slipped-DNA containing molecules were significantly greater in the heart over the cerebellum (relative to genomic equivalents of pre-IP input DNA) of a DM1 individual; an enrichment consistent with increased allelic levels of slipped-DNA structures in tissues having greater levels of CTG instability. Surprisingly, this supports the formation of slipped-DNAs as persistent mutation products of repeat instability, and not merely as transient mutagenic intermediates. These findings further our understanding of the processes of mutation and genetic variation.

As such, clinicians may be faced with requests to prescribe enhancers for their paediatric patients. In this article, we analyse the ethics of cognitive enhancement in paediatrics in the light of the best interests standard, a guiding principle, often used to make decisions for minors in moral, legal, social and medical contexts. ConclusionCognitive enhancement in children and adolescents does not represent an ethical ideal that societies should strive for. Furthermore, paediatric cognitive enhancement does not meet the criteria for a minimally acceptable practice, given the health-related risks posed by these medications and the coercive environments such a practice creates. In line with a recent policy statement by the American Academy of Neurology, ethical and clinical arguments based on the best interests of paediatric patients encourage clinicians to refrain from engaging in this practice.

In order to create an experimental system in which these could be better elucidated, we designed, built and tested a system for recording EEG and EMG signals in-ovo from chicken embryos incubated for 16-21 days. This system can remain attached to the individual subject through the process of hatching and continue to be worn post-natally. Electrode wires surgically implanted on the head of the embryo are connected to a battery-operated ultraportable transmitter which can either be attached to the eggshell or worn on the back. The transmitter processes up to 6 channels of data with a maximum sampling frequency of 500 Hz and a resolution of 12 bits. The radio link uses a carrier frequency of 4 MHz, and has a maximum transfer rate of 500 kbit/s; receiving antennas compatible with both in-egg recordings and post-natal recordings from freely-moving birds were produced. A receiver connected with one USB port of a PC transmits the data for digital storage. This system is based on discrete, off-the-shelf components, can provide a few days of continuous operation with a single lithium coin battery, and has a noise floor level of 0.35 mu V. The transmitter dimensions are 16 x 13 x 1.5 mm and the weight without the battery is 0.7 g. The microprocessor allows flexible operation modes not usually made available in other small multichannel acquisition systems implemented by means of ad hoc mixed signal chips.

The mechanisms governing this protracted and unique development are unknown. Here we identify dcc as the first DA neuron gene to regulate mPFC connectivity during adolescence and dissect the mechanisms involved. Reduction or loss of dcc from DA neurons by Cre-lox recombination increased mPFC DA innervation. Underlying this was the presence of ectopic DA fibers that normally innervate non-cortical targets. Altered DA input changed the anatomy and electrophysiology of mPFC circuits, leading to enhanced cognitive flexibility. All phenotypes only emerged in adulthood. Using viral Cre, we demonstrated that dcc organizes mPFC wiring specifically during adolescence. Variations in DCC may determine differential predisposition to mPFC disorders in humans. Indeed, DCC expression is elevated in brains of antidepressant-free subjects who committed suicide.	[Manitt, C.; Eng, C.; Pokinko, M.; Ryan, R. T.; Torres-Berrio, A.; Lopez, J. P.; Yogendran, S.

Objectives: To describe the phenotypic and genotypic features in five Bulgarian Jewish patients, from different families, with autosomal dominant OPMD. Methods: We performed clinical follow-up, electrodiagnostic tests and mutation detection. Blood samples were obtained after informed Consent and DNA was extracted; measurement of GCG repeats in both PABPN1 alleles and sequencing of OPMD mutations were performed according to standard techniques. Results: We identified five patients (four females), aged 58 to 71 years, with bilateral ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia (n=3) and myopathic motor units by electromyography. In all patients we noticed proximal weakness of the upper limbs with winging scapulae in three of them. All cases shared the (GCG)13-(GCG)10 PABPN1 genotype. Conclusions: OPMD among Bulgarian Jews is produced by a (GCG)43 expansion, identical to the mutation in Uzbek Jews and French Canadians. In addition to the classical neurological and neuro-ophthalmological features, early shoulder girdle weakness is common in Bulgarian Jewish patients; this is an unusual feature during the early stages of OPMD produced by the same mutation in other populations. We suggest that besides the disease-producing GCG expansion, additional ethnicity-related genetic factors may influence the OPMD phenotype. OPMD is a rare disease, and the identification of five affected families in the rather small Bulgarian Jewish community in Israel probably represents a new cluster; future haplotype studies May elucidate whether a founder effect occurred.

GBM displays a cellular complexity that includes brain tumour-initiating cells (BTICs), which are considered as potential key targets for GBM therapies. Here we show that the transcription factors FOXG1 and Groucho/TLE are expressed in poorly differentiated astroglial cells in human GBM specimens and in primary cultures of GBM-derived BTICs, where they form a complex. FOXG1 knockdown in BTICs causes downregulation of neural stem/progenitor and proliferation markers, increased replicative senescence, upregulation of astroglial differentiation genes and decreased BTIC-initiated tumour growth after intracranial transplantation into host mice. These effects are phenocopied by Groucho/TLE knockdown or dominant inhibition of the FOXG1: Groucho/TLE complex. These results provide evidence that transcriptional programmes regulated by FOXG1 and Groucho/TLE are important for BTIC-initiated brain tumour growth, implicating FOXG1 and Groucho/TLE in GBM tumourigenesis.

Update in the understanding of altitude-induced limitations to performance in team-sport athletes	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Review						Altitude; Exercise physiology; Fatigue; Soccer	REPEATED-SPRINT ABILITY; HIGH-INTENSITY ACTIVITY; PREMIER LEAGUE SOCCER; RUGBY UNION PLAYERS; EXERCISE PERFORMANCE; NORMOBARIC HYPOXIA; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; ARTERIAL HYPOXEMIA; MATCH PERFORMANCE; ENDURANCE RUNNERS	The internationalism of field-based team sports (TS) such as football and rugby requires teams to compete in tournaments held at low to moderate altitude (approximate to 1200-2500m). In TS, acceleration, speed and aerobic endurance are physical characteristics associated with ball possession and, ultimately, scoring. While these qualities are affected by the development of neuromuscular fatigue at sea level, arterial hypoxaemia induced by exposure to altitude may further hinder the capacity to perform consecutive accelerations (CAC) or sprint endurance and thereby change the outcome of a match. The higher the altitude, the more severe the hypoxaemia, and thus, the larger the expected decline in aerobic endurance, CAC and match running performance. Therefore, it is critical for athletes and coaches to understand how arterial hypoxaemia affects aerobic endurance and CAC and the magnitude of decline they may face at altitude for optimal preparation and increased chances of success. This mini review summarises the effects of acute altitude/hypoxia exposure on aerobic endurance, CAC and activity profiles of TS athletes performing in the laboratory and during matches at natural altitude, and analyses the latest findings about the consequences of arterial hypoxaemia on the relationship between peripheral perturbations, neural adjustments and performance during repeated sprints or CAC. Finally, we briefly discuss how altitude training can potentially help athletes prepare for competition at altitude.

Perinatal Nutrition Programs the Hypothalamic Melanocortin System in Off spring	HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH			English	Review						appetite programming; arcuate nucleus; gestation; lactation; gene expression; epigenetic mechanisms	DIET-INDUCED OBESITY; HIGH-FAT DIET; MODERATE CALORIC RESTRICTION; SYNAPTIC INPUT ORGANIZATION; REGULATING FOOD-INTAKE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; LEPTIN SENSITIVITY; MATERNAL OBESITY; GENE-EXPRESSION; ENERGY-BALANCE	Epidemiological studies initially suggested that maternal undernutrition leading to low birth weight may predispose for long-lasting energy balance disorders. High birth weight due to maternal obesity or diabetes, inappropriate early postnatal nutrition, and rapid catch-up growth, may also sensitize to increased risk of obesity. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease concept, the perinatal perturbation of fetus/neonate nutrient supply might be a crucial determinant of individual programming of body weight set-point. The hypothalamic melanocortin system composed of the melanocortin receptor 4, its agonist -melanin-stimulating hormone (-MSH), and its antagonist agouti-related protein (AgRP) is considered as the main central anorexigenic pathway controlling energy homeostasis. Studies in numerous animal models demonstrated that this system is a prime target of developmental programming by maternal nutritional manipulation. In rodents, the perinatal period of life corresponds largely to the period of brain maturation (i.e., melanocortin neuronal differentiation and development of their neural projections). In contrast, these phenomena essentially take place before birth in bigger mammals. Despite these different developmental time windows, altricial and precocial species share several common offspring programming mechanisms. Offspring from malnourished dams present a hypothalamic melanocortin system with a series of alterations: impaired neurogenesis and neuronal functionality, disorganization of feeding pathways, modified glucose sensing, and leptin/insulin resistance. Overall, these alterations may account for the long-lasting dysregulation of energy balance and obesity. Following maternal malnutrition, hormonal and epigenetic mechanisms might be responsible for melanocortin system programming in offspring.

Here we recorded from single neurons in the vestibular nuclei to understand how vestibular pathways encode self-motion under natural conditions, during which proprioceptive and motor-related signals as well as vestibular inputs provide feedback about an animal's movement through the world. We recorded neuronal responses in alert behaving mice focusing on a group of neurons, termed vestibular-only cells, that are known to control posture and project to higher-order centers. We found that the majority (70%, n = 21/30) of neurons were bimodal, in that they responded robustly to passive stimulation of proprioceptors as well as passive stimulation of the vestibular system. Additionally, the linear summation of a given neuron's vestibular and neck sensitivities predicted well its responses when both stimuli were applied simultaneously. In contrast, neuronal responses were suppressed when the same motion was actively generated, with the one striking exception that the activity of bimodal neurons similarly and robustly encoded head on body position in all conditions. Our results show that proprioceptive and motor-related signals are combined with vestibular information at the first central stage of vestibular processing in mice. We suggest that these results have important implications for understanding the multisensory integration underlying accurate postural control and the neural representation of directional heading in the head direction cell network of mice.

Netrin-1 receptor-deficient mice show age-specific impairment in drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity but still self-administer methamphetamine	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Methamphetamine; Self-administration; Conditioning; Mouse	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COLORECTAL-CANCER DCC; DOPAMINERGIC INNERVATION; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; ADDICTIVE DRUGS; D-AMPHETAMINE; NEURAL BASIS; SENSITIZATION; COCAINE	Rationale The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system undergoes significant reorganization of neuronal connectivity and functional refinement during adolescence. Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), a receptor for the guidance cue netrin-1, is involved in this reorganization. Previous studies have shown that adult mice with a heterozygous (het) loss-of-function mutation in DCC exhibit impairments in sensitization and conditioned place preference (CPP) to psychostimulants. However, the commonly abused psychostimulant methamphetamine (METH) has not been assessed, and the role of DCC in drug self-administration remains to be established. Objectives Using dcc het mice and wildtype (WT) littermates, we extended previous findings on dcc haplodeficiency by examining self-administration of METH in adult mice, including cue-induced drug seeking following abstinence. We also examined hyperactivity, sensitization, and CPP to a METH-paired context in adult and adolescent mice. Results While adult dcc het mice expressed largely similar METH self-administration and cue-induced drug seeking as WT littermates, they failed to modulate responding according to dose of METH. Compared to WT, both adult and adolescent dcc het mice expressed impaired locomotor hyperactivity to acute METH but nevertheless showed comparable behavioral sensitization. Conditioned hyperactivity increased with age in WT but not in dcc het mice. Conclusions Impaired METH-induced hyperactivity and dose-related responding in adult dcc het mice suggest that reduced DCC alters METH-related behaviors. Adolescence is identified as a vulnerable period during which impairment in hyperactivity due to reduced DCC can be overcome with repeated METH injections. Nevertheless, DCC appears to have a somewhat limited role in METH-consumption and seeking following abstinence.

We then move on to discuss the results of 20 years of investigation of those ideas. First, evidence is described from animal studies consistent with the ideas that memory for different kinds of information is stored in different brain systems, and that the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal striatum are each central structures in one of the systems. We then focus on the 3 tasks used in the original triple dissociation: win-stay learning, conditioned cue preference, and win-shift learning. Each of these tasks is specific to behavior resulting from the type of information stored in one of the systems, but the use of other behavioral tests that are sensitive to the types of information stored in other systems has revealed that, in each case, other types of information are acquired in parallel. Next, evidence consistent with the idea that the outputs of the systems compete for control of behavior is discussed together with alternative forms of more direct interactions among the systems. Finally, some evidence that many of these ideas about multiple parallel memory systems may apply to humans is reviewed.

A Triple Dissociation of Memory Systems: Hippocampus, Amygdala, and Dorsal Striatum	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CAUDATE-NUCLEUS LESIONS; STIMULUS-REWARD ASSOCIATIONS; CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; SINGLE-ALTERNATION GO; WORKING-MEMORY; SPATIAL MEMORY; CONTEXTUAL RETRIEVAL; PASSIVE-AVOIDANCE; CUE TASKS; OLFACTORY DISCRIMINATION	This study investigated the respective roles of the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the dorsal striatum in learning and memory. A standard set of experimental conditions for studying the effects of lesions to the three brain areas using an 8-arm radial maze was used: a win-shift version, a conditioned cue preference (CCP) version, and a win-stay version. Damage to the hippocampal system impaired acquisition of the win-shift task but not the CCP or win-stay tasks. Damage to the lateral amygdala impaired acquisition of the CCP task but not the win-shift or win-stay tasks. Damage to the dorsal striatum impaired acquisition of the win-stay task but not the win-shift or CCP tasks. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mammalian brain may be capable of acquiring different kinds of information with different, more-or-less independent neural systems. A neural system that includes the hippocampus may acquire information about the relationships among stimuli and events. A neural system that includes the amygdala may mediate the rapid acquisition of behaviors based on biologically significant events with affective properties. A neural system that includes the dorsal striatum may mediate the formation of reinforced stimulus-response associations.

The aim of this systematic literature review was to identify the neurocognitive markers associated with suicide vulnerability in elderly people. Method: a systematic English Medline literature search of cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies published between January 1960 and December 2012 was performed, combining the MeSH terms "Suicide", "Neuropsychology", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Executive Function", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", and "Diffusion Tensor Imaging". The abstract selection was based on the Strobe checklist for observational studies. Results: of the 446 original articles, 10 neuropsychological and 4 brain imaging studies were selected. The number of suicidal subjects ranged from 10 to 29 (mean age=66.8 to 79.1 years old, 0-85% women). Executive functions, in particular decision-making and cognitive inhibition, were more impaired in the depressed elderly with a history of suicide attempts compared to those without such a history. fMRI data, which need to be confirmed in further details, showed abnormalities of fronto-limbic circuits which are involved in suicide vulnerability in the elderly independently of any associated psychopathological conditions including depression. Conclusion: this literature review confirms the existence of neurocognitive markers of suicide vulnerability in elderly people. A neuropsychological assessment could thus help to identify the suicide vulnerability of a depressed elderly person, a first step for both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic cares.

Endocannabinoids are important modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity throughout the central nervous system. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) is extensively expressed in the adult retina of rodents, while CB2R mRNA and protein expression have been only recently demonstrated in retinal tissue. The activation of cannabinoid receptors modulates neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors and could also affect bipolar cell synaptic release. However, the impact of CB1R and CB2R on the retinal function as a whole is currently unknown. METHODS. In the present study, we investigated the function of cannabinoid receptors in the retina by recording electroretinographic responses (ERGs) from mice lacking either CB1 or CB2 receptors (cnr1(-/-) and cnr2(-/-), respectively). We also documented the precise distribution of CB2R by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS. Our results showed that CB2R is localized in cone and rod photoreceptors, horizontal cells, some amacrine cells, and bipolar and ganglion cells. In scotopic conditions, the amplitudes of the a-wave of the ERG were increased in cnr2(-/-) mice, while they remained unchanged in cnr1(-/-) mice. The analysis of the velocity-time profile of the a-wave revealed that the increased amplitude was due to a slower deceleration rather than an increase in acceleration of the waveform. Under photopic conditions, b-wave amplitudes of cnr2(-/-) mice required more light adaptation time to reach stable values. No effects were observed in cnr1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS. The data indicated that CB2R is likely to be involved in shaping retinal responses to light and suggest that CB1 and CB2 receptors could have different roles in visual processing.

MethodsWe reviewed the initial presentation (n=40) and early clinical evolution (n=50) of a large ARSACS cohort that was followed at the Saguenay Neuromuscular clinic. ResultsThe average age at presentation was 3.411.55 years. Increased deep tendon reflexes were more common than spasticity initially, and the neuropathy only became apparent clinically in the second decade. Despite a homogeneous genetic background, some patients showed no signs of neuropathy or spasticity by the age of 18 years. ConclusionsAt presentation, ARSACS lacks certain features that are considered typical in adults after years of evolution. Considering that ARSACS is probably under-diagnosed, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of early onset ataxias with or without pyramidal features and is worthwhile to consider in older patients, even when some features are absent.

It is also a known predictor of Parkinson disease (PD). Alexithymia has been associated with disturbances in sleep and dreaming (e. g., nightmares) and is a non-motor symptom of PD. We assessed alexithymia and disturbed dreaming in iRBD patients with the aim of determining if these two factors are elevated and interrelated among this population. Design: Questionnaire study of clinically diagnosed patients. Setting: Clinical sleep disorders center. Patients or participants: Thirty-two iRBD patients and 30 healthy age-and sex-matched control participants. Measurements and Results: Participants completed the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Dream Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory. iRBD patients obtained higher TAS-20 total scores (62.16 +/- 13.90) than did controls (52.84 +/- 7.62; F-1,F-59 = 10.44, P < 0.01), even when controlling for depressive symptoms, and more frequently attained the suggested cutoff for alexithymia than did controls (P < 0.01). iRBD patients obtained higher scores on the Difficulty Identifying Feelings alexithymia subscale. For both iRBD and control groups, the Difficulty Indentifying Feelings subscale correlated positively with the Nightmare Distress scale of the Dream Questionnaire. Conclusions: Elevated alexithymia scores among idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and especially a difficulty in identifying feelings, parallels evidence of dysautonomia in this population. The higher incidence of distressing nightmares and the association of nightmares with alexithymia further extend similar findings for both clinical and non-clinical samples and suggest that an affect regulation disturbance may be common to the two sets of symptoms.

We investigated the hypothesis that gabapentin (GP), an anticonvulsant without effect on glutamate receptors acting as GABA analog, has neuroprotective properties. For comparison, we chose topiramate (TPM), which has been reported to be neuroprotective via AMPA receptors blockade. For this purpose, we used rat cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) cultures and we triggered apoptosis independent of glutamate receptors with staurosporine, a broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor. GP at therapeutic range concentration significantly increased cell viability in CGN cultures maintained in physiological KCl concentration and reversed apoptosis induced by staurosporine. Blockade of NMDA or AMPA receptors by MK801 or NBQX, respectively, did not alter GP neuroprotection, which was reversed instead by GABA. In contrast, protective effect of TPM on STS-treated CGN cultures was annihilated by NBQX, and not altered by MK801 or GABA. Treatments with neuroprotective concentrations of GP or TPM did not modify the expression of neuronal cell adhesion molecule or synaptophysin or the morphological aspect of neuronal endings. In summary, we report that GP is neuroprotective through glutamate-receptor independent mechanisms and without alteration of neuronal plasticity markers, which makes it a possible candidate for clinical neuroprotection trials.

In addition to defining the brain architecture, astrocytes are primary elements of brain ion, pH and neurotransmitter homoeostasis. GS (glutamine synthetase), which catalyses the ATP-dependent condensation of ammonia and glutamate to form glutamine, is an enzyme particularly found in astrocytes. GS plays a pivotal role in glutamate and glutamine homoeostasis, orchestrating astrocyte glutamate uptake/release and the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Furthermore, astrocytes bear the brunt of clearing ammonia in the brain, preventing neurotoxicity. The present review depicts the central function of astrocytes, concentrating on the importance of GS in glutamate/glutamine metabolism and ammonia detoxification in health and disease.

Establishing and maintaining these relationships requires understanding of emotional stimuli, such as facial emotions. A failure to adequately interpret emotional facial expressions has previously been associated with various mental disorders that emerge during adolescence. The current study examined sex differences in emotional face processing during adolescence. Participants were adolescents (n = 1951) with a target age of 14, who completed a forced-choice emotion discrimination task. The stimuli used comprised morphed faces that contained a blend of two emotions in varying intensities (11 stimuli per set of emotions). Adolescent girls showed faster and more sensitive perception of facial emotions than boys. However, both adolescent boys and girls were most sensitive to variations in emotion intensity in faces combining happiness and sadness, and least sensitive to changes in faces comprising fear and anger. Furthermore, both sexes overidentified happiness and anger. However, the overidentification of happiness was stronger in boys. These findings were not influenced by individual differences in the level of pubertal maturation. These results indicate that male and female adolescents differ in their ability to identify emotions in morphed faces containing emotional blends. The findings provide information for clinical studies examining whether sex differences in emotional processing are related to sex differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders within this age group.

We conducted a large, two-stage meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In stage 1, we used genotyped and imputed data (7,055,881 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously published GWAS data sets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls. In stage 2, 11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer's disease cases and 11,312 controls. In addition to the APOE locus (encoding apolipoprotein E), 19 loci reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis, of which 11 are newly associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Methods: A systematic quantitative review of the effects of antipsychotics on peripheral cytokine levels in schizophrenia was performed, using follow-up studies providing in vivo cytokine assessments before and after treatment. Results: We retrieved 23 studies (total of 762 subjects) which showed that antipsychotic treatment significantly increases plasma levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and reduces the plasma levels of interleukin-1 beta and interferon-gamma. Conclusions: These results show that antipsychotics produce anti-inflammatory effects in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They are involved in many physiological and reparative processes. MMPs can break down all extracellular constituents; therefore, their expression is very tightly regulated and their abnormal activity or over production has been linked to many diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS) which is a leading cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults in North America. Recently many studies, both in animals and humans, have been conducted to better elucidate the underlying causes, mechanisms and pathophysiology of MS. In this review, we discuss the potential role of pathological upregulation of MMPs in MS and future challenges which if properly addressed might help in development of potential cure for this disease.

Recommendations for Screening and Detection of Connective Tissue Disease-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension	ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM			English	Article							MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGS; OF-RHEUMATOLOGY GUIDELINES; BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; SYSTEMIC-SCLEROSIS; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; ARTHRITIS; MULTICENTER; PREVALENCE; PREDICTORS; MANAGEMENT	ObjectivePulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) affects up to 15% of patients with connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Previous recommendations developed as part of larger efforts in PAH did not include detailed recommendations for patients with CTD-associated PAH. Therefore, we sought to develop recommendations for screening and early detection of CTD-associated PAH. MethodsWe performed a systematic review of the literature on the screening and diagnosis of PAH in CTD. Using the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles consensus methodology, we developed case scenarios followed by 2 stages of voting. First, international experts from a variety of specialties voted anonymously on the appropriateness of each case scenario. The experts then met face-to-face to discuss and resolve discrepant votes to arrive at consensus recommendations. ResultsThe key recommendation stated that all patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) should be screened for PAH. In addition, patients with mixed connective tissue disease or other CTDs with scleroderma features (scleroderma spectrum disorders) should be screened for PAH. It was recommended that screening pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, transthoracic echocardiogram, and measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) be performed in all patients with SSc and scleroderma spectrum disorders. In patients with SSc and scleroderma spectrum disorders, transthoracic echocardiogram and PFTs should be performed annually. The full screening panel (transthoracic echocardiogram, PFTs, and measurement of NT-proBNP) should be performed as soon as any new signs or symptoms are present. ConclusionWe provide consensus-based, evidence-driven recommendations for screening and early detection of CTD-associated PAH. It is our hope that these recommendations will lead to earlier detection of CTD-associated PAH and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Computational model of motor learning and perceptual change	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Reaching movement; Motor learning; Somatosensory perceptual change; Computational model; Force field	MULTIJOINT ARM MOVEMENT; NEURAL-NETWORK; ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR; IMPEDANCE CONTROL; ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; ADAPTATION; COORDINATION; TRAJECTORIES; STIFFNESS; DYNAMICS	Motor learning in the context of arm reaching movements has been frequently investigated using the paradigm of force-field learning. It has been recently shown that changes to somatosensory perception are likewise associated with motor learning. Changes in perceptual function may be the reason that when the perturbation is removed following motor learning, the hand trajectory does not return to a straight line path even after several dozen trials. To explain the computational mechanisms that produce these characteristics, we propose a motor control and learning scheme using a simplified two-link system in the horizontal plane: We represent learning as the adjustment of desired joint-angular trajectories so as to achieve the reference trajectory of the hand. The convergence of the actual hand movement to the reference trajectory is proved by using a Lyapunov-like lemma, and the result is confirmed using computer simulations. The model assumes that changes in the desired hand trajectory influence the perception of hand position and this in turn affects movement control. Our computer simulations support the idea that perceptual change may come as a result of adjustments to movement planning with motor learning.

The mechanisms mediating the impact of early life environment on the phenotype are proposed to involve a change in the state of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and, as a consequence, in the stable programming of gene expression. Recent studies suggest that the changes in DNA methylation affect broad genomic regions, as well as peripheral tissues in addition to brain regions. Although the data are still scarce, it points to the possibility that DNA methylation is a mechanism of genome adaptation to signals from early life social environment. This modulation of the DNA methylation pattern is proposed to result in long-term impact on the phenotype that could become maladaptive under certain contexts later in life. This model has implications on our understanding of behavioural and mental health pathologies, as well as their diagnosis and therapeutics.

Atorvastatin has been shown to be neuroprotective after transient ischaemia or traumatic injury. The aim of this study was to establish if systemic administration of Atorvastatin could improve functional muscle reinnervation after complete sciatic nerve section. Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. After a complete right sciatic nerve section, end-to-end microsuture repair was performed and fibrin glue was added. Three groups were studied: (1) sutures (S) + fibrin glue (F) only + saline administration for 14 days; (2) S+F+Atorvastatin administration for 14 days; and (3) uninjured nerve. Five months later, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle were isolated to perform in vivo electrophysiological measurements. Better kinematics was observed in atorvastatin-treated rats 5 months after its administration. Indeed, a larger excursion of the hip-ankle-toe angle during walking was observed. This effect was associated with the preservation of electromyographic activity (2.91 mV vs 0.77 mV) and maximal muscle force (85.1 g vs 28.6 g) on stimulation of the proximal nerve section. Five months after a neurotmetic lesion, the recovery is incomplete when using suture and fibrin glue only. Furthermore, the systemic administration of Atorvastatin for 14 days after lesion was beneficial in improving locomotion capability associated with the re-establishment of muscle strength and EMG activity.

Quantifying the local tissue volume and composition in individual brains with magnetic resonance imaging	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; IN-VIVO; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; WATER-CONTENT; RAT-BRAIN; RELAXATION; DIFFUSION; MYELIN; IMAGES; CORTEX	Here, we describe a quantitative neuroimaging method to estimate the macromolecular tissue volume (MTV), a fundamental measure of brain anatomy. By making measurements over a range of field strengths and scan parameters, we tested the key assumptions and the robustness of the method. The measurements confirm that a consistent quantitative estimate of MTV can be obtained across a range of scanners. MTV estimates are sufficiently precise to enable a comparison between data obtained from an individual subject with control population data. We describe two applications. First, we show that MTV estimates can be combined with T1 and diffusion measurements to augment our understanding of the tissue properties. Second, we show that MTV provides a sensitive measure of disease status in individual patients with multiple sclerosis. The MTV maps are obtained using short clinically appropriate scans that can reveal how tissue changes influence behavior and cognition.

Although pain-related behaviors have been studied in critically ill patients, those with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been either excluded or underrepresented. Because these patients also likely experience pain, research is urgently needed to generate knowledge in this field. This pilot study aimed to explore pain-related behaviors of critically ill TBI patients when exposed to common procedures in the intensive care unit (ICU), using video recording at the bedside and a newly developed coding system. Ten TBI patients hospitalized in the ICU participated. A 44-item behavioral checklist created from existing tools was used as a coding system to identify behaviors before, during, and 20 minutes after a nociceptive procedure (turning) and a nonnociceptive procedure (noninvasive blood pressure [NIBP]). Patients were video recorded to check for interrater agreement between two trained observers. TBI patients exhibited more behaviors during turning than at rest or during NIBP (p < .001). The following behaviors were observed during turning: levator contraction (n = 7), frowning (n = 5), opening eyes (n = 5), weeping eyes (n = 5), raising eyebrows (n = 5), activating the ventilator alarms (n = 7), and muscle tension (n = 5). No change in behaviors was noted during NIBP. After educational training and using videos, the average percentage of agreement for observed behaviors between two trained research assistants was 96%. Pain in critically ill TBI patients can be detrimental to health and recovery. ICU clinicians should be aware of pain-related behaviors to enable better detection and treatment in this highly vulnerable group.

Proposed mechanistic description of dose-dependent BDE-47 urinary elimination in mice using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						PBPK; PBDE; BDE-47; m-MUP; P-gp; Mouse	POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; HOUSE MOUSE; METHYLSULFONYL METABOLITE; POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL; MOLECULAR HETEROGENEITY; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; GENETIC-VARIATION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; PROTEINS	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been used in a wide variety of consumer applications as additive flame retardants. In North America, scientists have noted continuing increases in the levels of PBDE congeners measured in human serum. Some recent studies have found that PBDEs are associated with adverse health effects in humans, in experimental animals, and wildlife. This laboratory previously demonstrated that urinary elimination of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) is saturable at high doses in mice; however, this dose-dependent urinary elimination has not been observed in adult rats or immature mice. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to examine the mechanism of urinary elimination of BDE-47 in adult mice using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. To support this objective, additional laboratory data were collected to evaluate the predictions of the PBPK model using novel information from adult multi-drug resistance 1a/b knockout mice. Using the PBPK model, the roles of mouse major urinary protein (a blood protein carrier) and P-glycoprotein (an apical membrane transporter in proximal tubule cells in the kidneys, brain, intestines, and liver) were investigated in BDE-47 elimination. The resulting model and new data supported the major role of m-MUP in excretion of BDE-47 in the urine of adult mice, and a lesser role of P-gp as a transporter of BDE-47 in mice. This work expands the knowledge of BDE-47 kinetics between species and provides information for determining the relevancy of these data for human risk assessment purposes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

These include changes in G-protein-mediated signaling and subsequent modification of gene expression via transcription factors such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). MethodsWe investigated levels of CREB in lymphoblasts from patients with BD, all responders to lithium prophylaxis (n=13), and healthy control subjects (n=15). Phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) was measured by immunoblotting in subjects with BD (n=15) as well as in their affected (n=17) and unaffected (n=18) relatives, and healthy controls (n=16). ResultsBasal CREB levels were comparable in patients and control subjects and were not changed by lithium treatment. pCREB levels were increased in both patients and their relatives compared to controls (p=0.003). Forskolin stimulation led to a 24% increase in pCREB levels in cells from healthy subjects (p=0.002) but not in the other three groups. When using basal and stimulated pCREB levels as a biochemical phenotype in a preliminary linkage study, we found the strongest support for linkage in regions largely overlapping with those showing linkage with the clinical phenotype (3p, 6p, 16p, 17q, 19q, and 21q). ConclusionsAbnormal pCREB signaling could be considered a biochemical phenotype for lithium-responsive BD.

J	Nielsen, T; Powell, RA; Kuiken, D				Nielsen, Tore; Powell, Russell A.; Kuiken, Don			Nightmare frequency is related to a propensity for mirror behaviors	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Dreaming; Nightmares; Mirror behaviors; Mirror neurons; Empathy; Emotional resonance; Sex differences	DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER; SOCIOCOGNITIVE MODEL; EMOTIONAL CONTAGION; SLEEP DISTURBANCES; SUICIDAL IDEATION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; NEURON SYSTEM; POPULATION; SYMPTOMS; CONTEXT	We previously reported that college students who indicated engaging in frequent dream-enacting behaviors also scored high on a new measure of mirror behaviors, which is the propensity to imitate another person's emotions or actions. Since dream-enacting behaviors are frequently the culmination of nightmares, one explanation for the observed relationship is that individuals who frequently display mirror behaviors are also prone to nightmares. We used the Mirror Behavior Questionnaire (MBQ) and self-reported frequencies of nightmares to assess this possibility. A sample of 480 students, consisting of 188 males (19.2 +/- 1.73 years) and 292 females (19.0 +/- 1.55 years) enrolled in a first-year university psychology course, participated for course credit. They completed a battery of questionnaires that included the 16-item MBQ plus an item about nightmare frequency (NMF) in the past 30 days. NMF scores were split to create low, medium, and high NMF groups. MBQ total scores were significantly higher for female than for male subjects, but an interaction revealed that this was true only for Hi-NMF subjects. MBQ Factor 4, Motor Skill Imitation, paralleled this global interaction for females, whereas MBQ Factor 3, Sleepiness/Anger Contagion, was elevated only for Hi-NMF males. Item analyses indicated that Hi- and Med-NMF females scored higher than Lo-NMF females on the 3 items of Factor 4 that reflect voluntary imitation (imitating famous/cartoon voices, being a physically active spectator, and learning new skills by observing), as well as on 2 other items that reflect involuntary imitation (contagious yawning and self-rated empathy). Although Hi- and Lo-NMF males differed most clearly on the sleepiness item of Factor 3, all 3 items on this factor (including anger contagion and contagious yawning) are plausibly associated with perception of and response to social threat. Results provide evidence that among females nightmares are associated with voluntary and involuntary mirror behaviors during wakefulness, while among males nightmares are associated with threat-related mirror behaviors during wakefulness. They thus support the possibility that the association between mirror behaviors and dream-enacting behaviors is due to a common mirror neuron mechanism that underlies mirror behaviors and nightmares and that involves motor, rather than emotional, resonance. These results have implications for understanding the comorbidity of nightmares and other pathological symptoms such as imitative suicidal behaviors, the influence of observational learning on dissociative symptomatology, and the predominance of threat and aggression in the dream enacting behaviors of REM sleep behavior disorder.

A new level of complexity was recently added to the study of this disorder by the evidence that TLE also appears to chronically alter the activity of several brain-wide neural networks involved in the control of higher order brain functions and not traditionally linked to epilepsy. Recently developed brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis of resting state connectivity, have greatly contributed to these observations by allowing the precise characterization of several brain networks with distinct functional signatures in the resting brain, and therefore also known as resting state networks. These significant advances in imaging represent an opportunity to investigate the still elusive origins of the disabling cognitive and psychiatric manifestations of TLE, and could have important implications for its pathophysiology and, perhaps, its therapy. Herein we review recent studies in this field by focusing on resting state networks that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment in patients with epilepsy: the default mode network, the attention network, and the reward/emotion network.

EEG/fMRI is gaining interest as a presurgical evaluation tool. This study aims to determine how hemodynamic responses related to epileptic activity can help predict surgical outcome in patients considered for epilepsy surgery. MethodsThirty-five consecutive patients with focal epilepsy who had significant hemodynamic responses and eventually surgical resection, were studied. The statistical map of hemodynamic responses were generated and coregistered to postoperative anatomic imaging. Patients were classified into four groups defined by the relative relationship between the location of the maximum hemodynamic response and the resection: group 1, fully concordant; group 2, partially concordant; group 3, partially discordant; and group 4, fully discordant. These findings were correlated with surgical outcome with at least 12-month follow-up. Key FindingsTen patients in group 1 had the maximum t value (t-max) inside the resection; nine in group 2 had the t-max outside but close to the resection and the cluster with t-max overlapped the resection; five in group 3 had the t-max remote from resection, but with another less significant cluster in the resection; and 11 in group 4 had no response in the resection. The degree of concordance correlated largely with surgical outcome: a good surgical outcome (Engel's class I) was found in 7 of 10 patients of group 1, 4 of 9 of group 2, 3 of 5 of group 3, and only 1 of 11 of group 4. These results indicate that the partially concordant and partially discordant groups are best considered as inconclusive. In contrast, in the fully concordant and fully discordant groups, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were high, 87.5%, 76.9%, 70%, and 90.9%, respectively. SignificanceThis study demonstrates that hemodynamic responses related to epileptic activity can help delineate the epileptogenic region. Full concordance between maximum response and surgical resection is indicative of seizure freedom, whereas a resection leaving the maximum response intact is likely to lead to a poor outcome. EEG/fMRI is noninvasive but is limited to patients in whom interictal epileptic discharges can be recorded during the 60-90min scan.

FMN2 encodes FORMIN-2, a member of the formin homology family, which is primarily expressed in the developing and mature brain, and has an important role in cytoskeletal organization and actin nucleation. A heterozygous deletion of FMN2 along with 2 other genes has been recently reported in a boy with non-syndromic intellectual disability.

Blocking brain-derived neurotrophic factor inhibits injury-induced hyperexcitability of hippocampal CA3 neurons	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						axonal sprouting; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GAP43; organotypic hippocampal slices; post-traumatic epilepsy	GABA(A) RECEPTOR PHOSPHORYLATION; ORGANOTYPIC SLICE CULTURES; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; DENTATE GYRUS; KAINIC ACID; IN-VITRO; SYNAPTIC REORGANIZATION; DEPENDENT REGULATION	Brain trauma can disrupt synaptic connections, and this in turn can prompt axons to sprout and form new connections. If these new axonal connections are aberrant, hyperexcitability can result. It has been shown that ablating tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), a receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can reduce axonal sprouting after hippocampal injury. However, it is unknown whether inhibiting BDNF-mediated axonal sprouting will reduce hyperexcitability. Given this, our purpose here was to determine whether pharmacologically blocking BDNF inhibits hyperexcitability after injury-induced axonal sprouting in the hippocampus. To induce injury, we made Schaffer collateral lesions in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. As reported by others, we observed a 50% reduction in axonal sprouting in cultures treated with a BDNF blocker (TrkB-Fc) 14days after injury. Furthermore, lesioned cultures treated with TrkB-Fc were less hyperexcitable than lesioned untreated cultures. Using electrophysiology, we observed a two-fold decrease in the number of CA3 neurons that showed bursting responses after lesion with TrkB-Fc treatment, whereas we found no change in intrinsic neuronal firing properties. Finally, evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potential recordings indicated an increase in network activity within area CA3 after lesion, which was prevented with chronic TrkB-Fc treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrate that blocking BDNF attenuates injury-induced hyperexcitability of hippocampal CA3 neurons. Axonal sprouting has been found in patients with post-traumatic epilepsy. Therefore, our data suggest that blocking the BDNF-TrkB signaling cascade shortly after injury may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of post-traumatic epilepsy.

At first, the unmodeled dynamics is divided into two parts using the differential expansion of the control input at the last time instant; then, the two parts are estimated by the ANFIS. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm overcomes the problem that the unknown control input is embedded in unmodeled dynamics, which makes the true value of unmodeled dynamics difficult obtain. Moreover, the method improves the precision of the estimation of unmodeled dynamics. Second, under the assumption that the growth rate of unmodeled dynamics does not exceed its input vector, the "one-to-one mapping" and "regularization technique" are adopted to deal with the input and output data and the unmodeled dynamics, respectively. As a result, the data vector can be guaranteed to lie inside a compact set, which ensures the use of the universal approximation property of the ANFIS. On the other hand, it has been shown that datum of a system can be fully used to obtain the parameters (centers, widths) in membership functions and the network connection weights in the ANFIS by offline training. These parameters are tuned online to improve the estimation convergence rate of the unmodeled dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation method is illustrated by comparing it with the simulation results that are obtained from the other existing methods. Finally, the proposed estimation method is applied to the nonlinear switching control design. Both simulation and theoretical analysis have confirmed that the nonlinear switching control which adopts the proposed estimation method cannot only guarantee the stability and convergence of the system but can exhibit a desired dynamic performance for the closed-loop system as well.

Analogous behavioral evidence of an interaction between visual and auditory processing during purely auditory tasks comes from studies of short-term visual deprivation on the perception of auditory cues, however, the results of such studies remain equivocal. Although some data have suggested that visual deprivation significantly increases loudness and pitch discrimination and reduces spatial localization inaccuracies, it is still unclear whether such improvement extends to the perception of spectrally complex cues, such as those involved in speech and music perception. We present data demonstrating that a 90-min period of visual deprivation causes a transient improvement in the perception of harmonicity: a spectrally complex cue that plays a key role in music and speech perception. The results provide clear behavioral evidence supporting a role for the visual system in the processing of complex auditory stimuli, even in the absence of any visual component to the task.

Because money and food are closely related, exchangeable resources, financially dissatisfied people may be motivated to replenish their need for financial resources by consuming caloric resources or food energy. Five experiments provide support for this hypothesis across various measures of caloric desire and actual eating behavior. The findings have notable implications for marketing and public policy. Whereas marketing researchers have increasingly investigated the interplay of taste and health considerations in food consumption, this research demonstrates the importance of investigating food energy considerations.

However little is known about individual differences in how people experience reward in music-related activities. The goal of the present study was to describe the main facets of music experience that could explain the variance observed in how people experience reward associated with music. To this end we developed the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ), which was administrated to three large samples. Our results showed that the musical reward experience can be decomposed into five reliable factors: Musical Seeking, Emotion Evocation, Mood Regulation, Social Reward, and Sensory-Motor. These factors were correlated with socio-demographic factors and measures of general sensitivity to reward and hedonic experience. We propose that the five-factor structure of musical reward experience might be very relevant in the study of psychological and neural bases of emotion and pleasure associated to music.

It is sustained over time and is resistant to distraction, suggesting automaticity. We hypothesized that ITL-induced changes in cerebral activation may differ between single-breath ITL and continuous ITL, with differences resembling those observed after cortical automatization of motor tasks. We analyzed the brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of 11 naive healthy volunteers during 5 min of random, single-breath ITL and 5 min of continuous ITL. Single-breath ITL increased BOLD in many areas (premotor cortices, bilateral insula, cerebellum, reticular formation of the lateral mesencephalon) and decreased BOLD in regions colocalizing with the default mode network. Continuous ITL induced signal changes in a limited number of areas (supplementary motor area). These differences are comparable to those observed before and after overlearning of motor tasks. We conclude that the respiratory-related cortical activation observed in response to ITL is likely due to automated, attention-independent mechanisms. Also, ITL activates cortical circuits right from the first breath. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A growing body of evidence suggests that neurologic dysfunction may be present in a significant proportion of this high-risk population in the early newborn period prior to surgical interventions. We recently provided the first evidence that brain growth impairment in fetuses with complex CHD has its origins in utero. Here, we extend these observations by characterizing global and regional brain development in fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques, we compared in vivo brain growth in 18 fetuses with HLHS and 30 control fetuses from 25.437.0 weeks of gestation. Our findings demonstrate a progressive third trimester fall-off in cortical gray and white matter volumes (P 0.001), and subcortical gray matter (P 0.05) in fetuses with HLHS. Significant delays in cortical gyrification were also evident in HLHS fetuses (P 0.001). In the HLHS fetus, local cortical folding delays were detected as early as 25 weeks in the frontal, parietal, calcarine, temporal, and collateral regions and appear to precede volumetric brain growth disturbances, which may be an early marker of elevated risk for third trimester brain growth failure.

A Neuroimaging Study of Patients with Primary Headache and NABT Using Magnetization Transfer Imaging and Diffusion Magnetic Resonance	CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MR; MIGRAINE; EVOLUTION; LESIONS; AURA	Novel diagnostics can allow us to "look beyond" normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) to unravel subtle alterations pertinent to the pathophysiology of primary headache, one of the most common complaints of patients who present to their physician across the medical specialties. Using both magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), we assessed the putative microstructural changes in patients with primary headache who display the NABT on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (conventional MRI). Subjects were 53 consecutive patients with primary headache disorders (40 = migraine with aura; 9 = tension headache; 4 = cluster headache) and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent evaluation with MRI, MTI, and DWI in order to measure the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), respectively, in eight and six different regions of interest (ROIs). Compared to healthy controls, we found a significant 4.3 % increase in the average ADC value of the occipital white matter in the full sample of patients (p = 0.035) and in patients with migraine (p = 0.046). MTR values did not differ significantly in ROIs between patients and healthy controls (p > 0.05). The present study lends evidence, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, for a statistically significant microstructural change in the occipital lobes, as measured by ADC, in patients with primary headache who exhibit a NABT on MRI. Importantly, future longitudinal mechanistic clinical studies of primary headache (e.g., vis-A -vis neuroimaging biomarkers) would be well served by characterizing, via DWI, occipital white matter microstructural changes to decipher their broader biological significance.

Forty-eight well functioning older adults (70.5 +/- 5.3 years old; 20 men, 28 women) were included in this study. Two median splits were conducted based on each individual's performance for the 10MWT and TUG. Comparisons between groups of slower and faster individuals were made with regard to executive functions and physical fitness parameters. A correlational approach was used to assess the association between variables. Between groups comparisons revealed that faster individuals in mobility tests demonstrate better performances in measures of cognitive flexibility (0.68 < g < 0.90). After including covariates from the medical/social domain, significant correlations were established between faster mobility tests and better cognitive flexibility (TUG: r = 0.565; 10MWT: r = 0.324). Between groups comparisons also revealed that faster individuals in mobility tests presented higher physical fitness levels (aerobic: 0.49 < g < 0.77, strength: 0.34 < g < 1.31). Significant correlations were found between better physical fitness and better cognitive flexibility (strength: r = -0.380; VO2 peak: r = -0.325) even after including age, education, fat-free mass and gender as covariates. These results suggest that the TUG and the 10MWT could potentially help distinguish individuals with poor neuromuscular, aerobic and cognitive flexibility performances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Cardiac signaling molecules and plasma biomarkers after cardiac transplantation: Impact of tacrolimus versus cyclosporine	JOURNAL OF HEART AND LUNG TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article						biomarkers; immunosuppression; transplantation; inflammation; signal transduction	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; HEART-TRANSPLANTATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALLOGRAFT VASCULOPATHY; GENE-EXPRESSION; RAT-HEART; REJECTION; INHIBITORS; HYPERTENSION; INFLAMMATION	BACKGROUND: We investigated cardiac proinflammatory, mitogenic, and apoptotic signaling events, and plasma biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in de novo adult cardiac transplant (CTX) patients receiving tacrolimus (TAC) or cyclosporine A (CsA). METHODS: One hundred CTX recipients were randomized 1:1 to TAC/CsA in a prospective, randomized open-label multicenter study. Biomarkers of inflammation, immunity, oxidative stress, and cardiac signaling underlying growth and inflammation (extracellular signal related kinase 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases [MEK] 1/2 and 3/6, c-Src), and apoptosis and survival (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases [INK], Bax/Bcl2, Akt) were assessed at 2, 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post-CTX. Plasma from healthy controls (n = 30) and tissue from explanted non-falling hearts (n = 6) were used as controls. RESULTS: Biomarkers of inflammation/immunity (interleukin -6 and -18, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule, E-selectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, osteopontin, fibrinogen, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide, high-sensitive C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, nitrotyrosine) were increased, and antioxidant capacity was (glutathione/glutathione disulfide) decreased in patients vs healthy controls (p < 0.05). Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt was increased, and Bax/Bcl was decreased in transplanted vs non-transplanted hearts. Except for plasma fibrinogen, which was lower in TAC vs CsA, (p = 0.01), there were no significant differences in parameters studied between TAC vs CsA immunoprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: De novo CTX recipients exhibit significant sub-clinical inflammation and oxidative stress that persists 12 months after transplantation. Associated with this is activation of myocardial growth and inflammatory signaling and decreased apoptosis. Our findings suggest that CTX is an inflammatory condition associated with oxidative stress and myocardial growth regardless of CsA or TAC immunoprophylaxis and independently of rejection status.

J	Nzokou, A; Weil, AG; Shedid, D				Nzokou, Andre; Weil, Alexander G.; Shedid, Daniel			Minimally invasive removal of thoracic and lumbar spinal tumors using a nonexpandable tubular retractor	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE			English	Article						intradural tumor; extradural tumor; oncology; minimally invasive surgery; schwannoma; spinal neoplasm	COLUMN DEFORMITY; INTERBODY FUSION; LAMINECTOMY; MICRODISCECTOMY; HEMILAMINECTOMY; EXPERIENCE; STENOSIS; CHILDREN; LESIONS; ADULTS	Object. Resection of spinal tumors traditionally requires bilateral subperiosteal muscle stripping, extensive laminectomy, and, in cases of foraminal extension, partial or radical facetectomy. Fusion is often warranted in cases of facetectomy to prevent deformity, pain, and neurological deterioration. Recent reports have demonstrated safety and efficacy of mini-open removal of these tumors using expandable tubular retractors. The authors report their experience with the minimally invasive removal of extradural foraminal and intradural-extramedullary tumors using the nonexpandable tubular retractor. Methods. A retrospective chart review of consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive resection of spinal tumors at Notre Dame Hospital was performed. Results. Between December 2005 and March 2012, 13 patients underwent minimally invasive removal of spinal tumors at Notre Dame Hospital, Montreal. There were 6 men and 7 women with a mean age of 55 years (range 20-80 years). There were 2 lumbar and 2 thoracic intradural-extramedullary tumors and 7 thoracic and 2 lumbar extradural foraminal tumors. Gross-total resection was achieved in 12 patients. Subtotal resection (90%) was attained in 1 patient because the tumor capsule was adherent to the diaphragm. The average duration of surgery was 189 minutes (range 75-540 minutes), and the average blood loss was 219 ml (range 25-500 ml). There were no major procedure-related complications. Pathological analysis revealed benign schwannoma in 8 patients and meningioma, metastasis, plasmacytoma, osteoid osteoma, and hemangiopericytoma in 1 patient each. The average equivalent dose of postoperative narcotics after surgery was 66.3 mg of morphine. The average length of hospitalization was 66 hours (range 24-144 hours). All working patients returned to normal activities within 4 weeks. The average MRI and clinical follow-up were 13 and 21 months, respectively (range 2-68 months). At last follow-up, 92% of patients had improvement or resolution of pain with a visual analog scale score that improved from 7.8 to 1.2. All patients with neurological impairment improved. The American Spinal Injury Association grade improved in all but 1 patient. Conclusions. Intradural-extramedullary and extradural tumors can be completely and safely resected through a minimally invasive approach using the nonexpandable tubular retractor. This approach may be associated with even less tissue destruction than mini-open techniques, translating into a quicker functional recovery. In cases of foraminal tumors, by eliminating the need for facetectomy, this minimally invasive approach may decrease the incidence of postoperative deformity and eliminate the need for adjunctive fusion surgery.

The protective effect of the obesity-associated rs9939609 A variant in fat mass- and obesity-associated gene on depression	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						depression; FTO; rs9939609	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; FTO GENE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RISK-FACTORS; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; RECURRENT DEPRESSION; ADULT OBESITY; CONFERS RISK; POPULATION; DISORDER	Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have not identified common variants, which are reliably associated with depression. The recent identification of obesity predisposing genes that are highly expressed in the brain raises the possibility of their genetic contribution to depression. As variation in the intron 1 of the fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene contributes to polygenic obesity, we assessed the possibility that FTO gene may contribute to depression in a cross-sectional multi-ethnic sample of 6561 depression cases and 21 932 controls selected from the EpiDREAM, INTERHEART, DeCC (depression case-control study) and Cohorte Lausannoise (CoLaus) studies. Major depression was defined according to DSM IV diagnostic criteria. Association analyses were performed under the additive genetic model. A meta-analysis of the four studies showed a significant inverse association between the obesity risk FTO rs9939609 A variant and depression (odds ratio = 0.92 (0.89, 0.97), P = 3 x 10(-4)) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity/population structure and body-mass index (BMI) with no significant between-study heterogeneity (I-2 = 0%, P = 0.63). The FTO rs9939609 A variant was also associated with increased BMI in the four studies (beta 0.30 (0.08, 0.51), P = 0.0064) adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity/population structure. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that the FTO rs9939609 A variant may be associated with a lower risk of depression independently of its effect on BMI. This study highlights the potential importance of obesity predisposing genes on depression.

J	Wu, BR; Tian, ZG; Chen, MY				Wu, Bairong; Tian, Zhigang; Chen, Mingyuan			Condition-based Maintenance Optimization Using Neural Network-based Health Condition Prediction	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Condition-based maintenance; artificial neural networks; prediction; optimization	RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; DEGRADATION SIGNALS; SYSTEMS; MODEL; AVAILABILITY; PROGNOSIS; FAILURES; POLICIES; REPAIR	Artificial neural network (ANN)-based methods have been extensively investigated for equipment health condition prediction. However, effective condition-based maintenance (CBM) optimization methods utilizing ANN prediction information are currently not available due to two key challenges: (i) ANN prediction models typically only give a single remaining life prediction value, and it is hard to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predicted value; (ii) simulation methods are generally used for evaluating the cost of the CBM policies, while more accurate and efficient numerical methods are not available, which is critical for performing CBM optimization. In this paper, we propose a CBM optimization approach based on ANN remaining life prediction information, in which the above-mentioned key challenges are addressed. The CBM policy is defined by a failure probability threshold value. The remaining life prediction uncertainty is estimated based on ANN lifetime prediction errors on the test set during the ANN training and testing processes. A numerical method is developed to evaluate the cost of the proposed CBM policy more accurately and efficiently. Optimization can be performed to find the optimal failure probability threshold value corresponding to the lowest maintenance cost. The effectiveness of the proposed CBM approach is demonstrated using two simulated degradation data sets and a real-world condition monitoring data set collected from pump bearings. The proposed approach is also compared with benchmark maintenance policies and is found to outperform the benchmark policies. The proposed CBM approach can also be adapted to utilize information obtained using other prognostics methods. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

An ERP study of vocal emotion processing in asymmetric Parkinson's disease	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; vocal emotion perception; asymmetry; striatum; event-related potentials	NEURAL RESPONSES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; MEANINGLESS SPEECH; BASIC EMOTIONS; ANGRY PROSODY; RECOGNITION; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION	Parkinson's disease (PD) has been related to impaired processing of emotional speech intonation (emotional prosody). One distinctive feature of idiopathic PD is motor symptom asymmetry, with striatal dysfunction being strongest in the hemisphere contralateral to the most affected body side. It is still unclear whether this asymmetry may affect vocal emotion perception. Here, we tested 22 PD patients (10 with predominantly left-sided [LPD] and 12 with predominantly right-sided motor symptoms) and 22 healthy controls in an event-related potential study. Sentences conveying different emotional intonations were presented in lexical and pseudo-speech versions. Task varied between an explicit and an implicit instruction. Of specific interest was emotional salience detection from prosody, reflected in the P200 component. We predicted that patients with predominantly right-striatal dysfunction (LPD) would exhibit P200 alterations. Our results support this assumption. LPD patients showed enhanced P200 amplitudes, and specific deficits were observed for disgust prosody, explicit anger processing and implicit processing of happy prosody. Lexical speech was predominantly affected while the processing of pseudo-speech was largely intact. P200 amplitude in patients correlated significantly with left motor scores and asymmetry indices. The data suggest that emotional salience detection from prosody is affected by asymmetric neuronal degeneration in PD.

TERT promoter mutations are highly recurrent in SHH subgroup medulloblastoma	ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA			English	Article						TERT promoter mutations; SHH pathway; Adult; Medulloblastoma	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RISK STRATIFICATION; TELOMERASE ACTIVITY; SELF-RENEWAL; BRAIN-TUMORS; DISTINCT; CANCER; ADULT; CELLS; METHYLATION	Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations were recently shown to drive telomerase activity in various cancer types, including medulloblastoma. However, the clinical and biological implications of TERT mutations in medulloblastoma have not been described. Hence, we sought to describe these mutations and their impact in a subgroup-specific manner. We analyzed the TERT promoter by direct sequencing and genotyping in 466 medulloblastomas. The mutational distributions were determined according to subgroup affiliation, demographics, and clinical, prognostic, and molecular features. Integrated genomics approaches were used to identify specific somatic copy number alterations in TERT promoter-mutated and wild-type tumors. Overall, TERT promoter mutations were identified in 21 % of medulloblastomas. Strikingly, the highest frequencies of TERT mutations were observed in SHH (83 %; 55/66) and WNT (31 %; 4/13) medulloblastomas derived from adult patients. Group 3 and Group 4 harbored this alteration in < 5 % of cases and showed no association with increased patient age. The prognostic implications of these mutations were highly subgroup-specific. TERT mutations identified a subset with good and poor prognosis in SHH and Group 4 tumors, respectively. Monosomy 6 was mostly restricted to WNT tumors without TERT mutations. Hallmark SHH focal copy number aberrations and chromosome 10q deletion were mutually exclusive with TERT mutations within SHH tumors. TERT promoter mutations are the most common recurrent somatic point mutation in medulloblastoma, and are very highly enriched in adult SHH and WNT tumors. TERT mutations define a subset of SHH medulloblastoma with distinct demographics, cytogenetics, and outcomes.	[Remke, Marc; Ramaswamy, Vijay; Peacock, John; Shih, David J.

Methods: In three experiments we measured the MMN to tones that differed in pitch from a repeated standard tone presented with a silent subtitled movie, with the soundtrack played forward or backward, or with soundtracks set at different intensity levels. Results: MMN amplitude was reduced when the soundtrack was presented either forward or backward compared to the silent subtitled movie. With the soundtrack, MMN amplitude increased proportionally to the increments in the sound-to-noise intensity ratio. Conclusion: MMN was reduced in amplitude but had normal morphology with a concurrent soundtrack, most likely because of basic acoustical interference from the soundtrack with MMN-critical tones rather than from attentional effects. Significance: A normal MMN can be recorded with a concurrent movie soundtrack, but signal amplitudes need to be set with caution to ensure a sufficiently high sound-to-noise ratio between MMN stimuli and the soundtrack.

Here we characterized mGluR5 immunoreactivity in hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), and subiculum of TLE specimens with confirmed HS, with neocortical TLE (non-HS) and necropsy controls. We correlated mGluR5 immunoreactivity with neuronal density, mossy fiber sprouting, astrogliosis (GFAP), and dendritic alterations (MAP2). TLE specimens showed increased mGluR5 expression, which was most pronounced in the EC, subiculum, CA2, and dentate gyrus outer molecular layer. Increased mGluR5 expression was seen in hippocampal head and body segments and was independent of neuronal density, astrogliosis, or dendritic alterations. Positive correlation between mGluR5 expression with mossy fiber sprouting and with MAP2 in CA3 and CA1 was found only in HS specimens. Negative correlation between mGluR5 expression with seizure frequency and epilepsy duration was found only in non-HS cases. Specimens from HS patients without previous history of febrile seizure (FS) showed higher mGluR5 and MAP2 expression in CA2. Our study suggests that mGluR5 upregulation is part of a repertoire of post-synaptic adaptations that might control overexcitation and excessive glutamate release rather than a dysfunction that leads to seizure facilitation. That would explain why non-HS cases, on which seizures are likely to originate outside the hippocampal formation, also exhibit upregulated mGluR5. On the other hand, lower mGluR5 expression was related to increased seizure frequency. In addition to its role in hyperexcitability, mGluR5 upregulation could play a role in counterbalance mechanisms along the hyperexcitable circuitry uniquely altered in sclerotic hippocampal formation.

Impairments in Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity following Prenatal Ethanol Exposure are Dependent on Glutathione Levels	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						dentate gyrus; diethyl maleate; fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; long-term potentiation; N-acetyl cysteine; oxidative stress	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DENTATE GYRUS; RAT-BRAIN; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; RECEPTOR FUNCTION; FREE-RADICALS; IN-VITRO	Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that prenatal ethanol exposure (PNEE) causes a significant deficit in synaptic plasticity, namely long-term potentiation (LTP), in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus of male rats. PNEE has also been shown to induce an increase in oxidative stress and a reduction in antioxidant capacity in the brains of both male and female animals. In this study the interaction between LTP and the major antioxidant in the brain, glutathione (GSH), is examined. We show that depletion of the intracellular reserves of GSH with diethyl maleate (DEM) reduces LTP in control male, but not female animals, mirroring the effects of PNEE. Furthermore, treatment of PNEE animals with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a cysteine donor for the synthesis of GSH, increases GSH levels in the hippocampus and completely restores the deficits in LTP in PNEE males. These results indicate that in males GSH plays a major role in regulating LTP, and that PNEE may cause reductions in LTP by reducing the intracellular pool of this endogenous antioxidant.

We exploit the simplicity and similarity of statistics of human anatomy among different subjects to develop new noise level estimation algorithm for magnetic resonance images of brain. Objects of the experiment are noise-free 3D brain MRI of 422 subjects. There are 21 slices for each subject. For each slice, total clique potential (TCP) of Markov random field, computed from local clique potential, is indexed by 200 different levels of noise. The sample space is the set of TCP-noise level data of each slice. The random variable is the set of indices of noise level of TCP in each element of sample space that is closest in numerical value to TCP measured from a test MRI slice. Noise level is estimated from the mean and variance of the random variable. We also report the formulation of a generalized mathematical model describing relationship between TCP and Rician noise level in brain MRI images. Our proposal can operate in the absence of signals in the background and significantly reduce modeling errors inherent in strong parametric assumptions adopted by some of the current algorithms.

The Relationship Between Gross Motor Function and Manual Ability in Cerebral Palsy	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						rehabilitation; cerebral palsy; functional assessment of children; motor function	CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM MACS; CHILDREN; GMFCS; DIPLEGIA; SUBTYPE	A retrospective cohort study was conducted to describe the relationship between gross motor function and manual ability in children with cerebral palsy and explore differences between cerebral palsy subtypes and associated comorbidities. Children with cerebral palsy born between 1999 and 2008 were included from the Registre de la Paralyse Cerebrale de Quebec identifying 332 children. The overall agreement between Gross Motor Function Classification System and Manual Ability Classification Scale Levels was moderate (kappa 0.457, standard error 0.034) with a strong positive correlation (Spearman rho of 0.820, standard error 0.023). This agreement was moderate among children with spastic quadriparesis and dysketic cerebral palsy, fair in children with spastic diplegia, and poor in children with spastic hemiplegia. Children with cognitive impairment showed a higher correlation than those without cognitive impairment. The correlation between gross motor function and manual ability in children with CP varies based on neurologic subtype and cognitive level.

We retrospectively reviewed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 122 cases of HIV-infected patients with documented early syphilis who underwent an LP to rule out NS, and we evaluated 3 laboratory-developed validated real-time PCR assays, the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay, the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) assay, and the line immunoassay INNO-LIA Syphilis, for the diagnosis of NS from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of these patients. NS was defined by a reactive CSF-VDRL test result and/or a CSF white blood cell (WBC) count of >20 cells/mu l. Thirty of the 122 patients (24.6%) had early NS. Headache, visual symptoms, a CD4 cell count of <500 cells/mu l, and viremia, as defined by an HIV-1 RNA count of >= 50 copies/ml, were associated with NS in multivariate analysis (P = <0.001 for each factor). Blood serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titers were not associated with early NS (P = 0.575). For the diagnosis of NS, the PCR, FTA-ABS, TPPA, and INNO-LIA assays had sensitivities of 58%, 100%, 68%, and 100%, specificities of 67%, 12%, 49%, and 13%, and negative predictive values of 85%, 100%, 84%, and 100%, respectively. Visual disturbances, headache, uncontrolled HIV-1 viremia, and a CD4 cell count of <500 cells/mu l were predictors of NS in HIV-infected patients with early syphilis, while blood serum RPR titers were not; therefore, RPR titers should not be used as the sole criterion for deciding whether to perform an LP in early syphilis. When applied to CSF samples, the INNO-LIA Syphilis assay easily helped rule out NS.

Cortical asymmetry may play a role in modulating the functional maturation (or degradation) of language and cognition in humans, but its evolution over the lifespan is unknown. Here cortical thickness was negatively correlated with age in 274 5-59 year old, right-handed healthy participants. Pre-adolescents showed limited regions of cortical asymmetry focused on medial occipital lobe (R > L) and inferior frontal gyrus (R > L), namely vision and language relevant areas. More extensive frontal (lateral R > L, medial L > R) and parietal lobe (lateral L > R, medial R > L) asymmetries emerged after adolescence, and increased during aging. Changes of cortical asymmetry in these regions may be linked to specialization of the brain with maturity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to examine this question closer, we acquired T1 weighted magnetic resonance images from 17 subjects with congenital anosmia and from 17 age- and sex-matched controls. We compared white and gray matter volumes as well as cortical thickness between both groups. We found subjects with congenital anosmia to exhibit larger gray matter volumes in the left entorhinal and piriform cortices. Further, they had thicker orbitofrontal cortices bilaterally. Their left piriform cortex was also thicker than that of controls. These findings are in contrast to those observed in acquired anosmia, where reduced olfactory function is associated with reduced volumes and thickness. However, they fit well with observations from other sensory systems, e.g., vision, where congenital sensory loss is associated with a thicker primary cortex. This finding has been attributed to reduced or absent synaptic pruning as a result of missing peripheral sensory input. Our findings suggest that similar mechanisms take place in the olfactory system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we evaluated the hypothesis that rapidly delivered cocaine facilitates the addiction process by promoting the development of enhanced motivation for the drug. Rats lever-pressed for cocaine delivered intravenously over 5 or 90 s under fixed ratio (FR) during 6-h sessions. The motivation for cocaine was subsequently assessed using a progressive ratio (PR) schedule, where each successive drug injection cost an exponentially greater number of lever presses, until the cessation of responding. Throughout all self-administration sessions, all rats could only take one injection every 90 s. The 5-s groups self-administered more drug than the 90-s groups across the FR sessions. Under PR, animals that had chronically self-administered rapidly delivered cocaine took more cocaine across a range of doses and regardless of whether the drug was delivered over 5 or 90 s during PR testing. The speed of delivery also determined the long-term neurobiological impact of cocaine. Fourteen days following cocaine withdrawal, caudate-putamen D2 levels were decreased only in the 90-s rats, and quinpirole-mediated G alpha(i/o)-protein activation was increased to a greater extent in the 90- vs 5-s rats. Thus, rapid delivery promotes the pursuit of cocaine in the face of rising costs and alters cocaine-induced changes in striatal D2 receptor number and function. As such, rapidly delivered cocaine might facilitate addiction because it more readily alters brain motivation circuits in ways that contribute to the compulsive pursuit of the drug.

However, because offspring brain and behavior are commonly assessed years after birth, the timing of such maternal influences is unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between antenatal maternal depressive symptomatology and neonatal amygdala volume and microstructure and thus establish evidence for the transgenerational transmission of vulnerability for affective disorders during prenatal development. Methods: Our study recruited Asian mothers at 10 to 13 weeks pregnancy and assessed maternal depression at 26 weeks gestation using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were performed with 157 nonsedated, 6- to 14-day-old newborns and then analyzed to extract the volume, fractional anisotropy, and axial diffusivity values of the amygdala. Results: Adjusting for household income, maternal age, and smoking exposure, postconceptual age at magnetic resonance imaging, and birth weight, we found significantly lower fractional anisotropy (p = .009) and axial diffusivity (p = .028), but not volume (p = .993), in the right amygdala in the infants of mothers with high compared with those with low-normal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores. Conclusions: The results reveal a significant relation between antenatal maternal depression and the neonatal microstructure of the right amygdala, a brain region closely associated with stress reactivity and vulnerability for mood anxiety disorders. These findings suggest the prenatal transmission of vulnerability for depression from mother to child and that interventions targeting maternal depression should begin early in pregnancy.

Each SVM classifier is designed to deal with a specific noise configuration and, when combined together - by means of the Iterative Boolean Combination (IBC) technique - they provide high robustness to different noise-to-signal ratio. In order to produce a high amount of vibration signals, considering different defect dimensions and noise levels, the BEAring Toolbox (BEAT) is employed in this work. The experiments indicate that the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the error rates, even in the presence of very noisy signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our objectives are to describe the predictors of major bleeding and the association between bleeding and mortality in medical-surgical critically ill patients receiving heparin thromboprophylaxis. We prospectively studied patients from 67 intensive care units and six countries enrolled in a thromboprophylaxis trial (NCT00182143) comparing dalteparin with unfractionated heparin. Patients with trauma, orthopedic surgery or neurosurgery were excluded. Trained research coordinators used a validated tool to document bleeding, which underwent duplicate independent blinded adjudication. Major bleeding was defined as hypovolemic shock, bleeding into critical sites, requiring an invasive intervention or transfusion of at least two units of red blood cells, or associated with hypotension or tachycardia in the absence of other causes. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify major bleeding predictors and the association between bleeding and mortality. Among 3,746 patients, bleeding occurred in 208 [5.6 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 4.9-6.3 %]. Time-dependent predictors were prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time [hazard ratio (HR) 1.10, 1.05-1.14 per 10 s increase], lower platelet count (HR 1.16, 1.09-1.24 per 50 x 10(9)/L decrease), therapeutic heparin (HR 3.26, 1.72-6.17), antiplatelet agents (HR 1.38, 1.02-1.88), renal replacement therapy (HR 1.75, 1.20-2.56), and recent surgery (HR 1.64, 1.01-2.65). Type of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis was not associated with bleeding. Patients with bleeding had a higher risk of in-hospital death (HR 2.09, 1.69-2.57). As major bleeding has modifiable risk factors and is associated with in-hospital mortality, strategies to mitigate these factors should be evaluated in critically ill patients.

Methods In this phase I dose-escalation study, patients received oral sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing (CDD) schedule (37.5 mg/day) or Schedule 2/1 (2 weeks on treatment, 1 week off treatment; 37.5 or 50 mg/day). Pemetrexed (400-500 mg/m(2) IV) and carboplatin (AUC = 5 mg center dot min/ml IV) were administered q3w. At the MTD for the chosen schedule, a cohort of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or mesothelioma was further evaluated. Results Twenty-one patients were enrolled on Schedule 2/1 (expansion cohort included) and 3 patients on the CDD schedule. The MTD on Schedule 2/1 was sunitinib 37.5 mg/day with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC = 5 mg center dot min/ml; MTD on the CDD schedule was not established. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3/4 neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome. The most common grade 3/4 drug-related non-hematologic adverse events at Schedule 2/1 MTD were fatigue/asthenia and diarrhea (both n = 4). Grade 3/4 hematologic abnormalities included neutropenia (83 %) and leukopenia (83 %). Pharmacokinetic data revealed no clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Best response at the Schedule 2/1 MTD was stable disease a parts per thousand yen8 weeks in 3/5 evaluable patients (60 %). Conclusions With this combination, in patients with advanced solid malignancies, sunitinib MTD on Schedule 2/1 was 37.5 mg/day. Sunitinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin were tolerable at the MTD, although sunitinib dose delays and reductions were often required due to myelosuppression.

However, its contribution to brain development remains unclear. We addressed this issue by analyzing brain phenotype in postnatal CaSR null mice, a model of human neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism. One- and 2-week-old CaSR null mice exhibited decreased brain weight and size with a developmental delay in expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Neuronal and glial differentiation markers, neuronal specific nuclear protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and myelin basic protein, were also decreased compared with age-matched wild-type littermates. Moreover, deletion of the parathyroid hormone gene that corrects hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and whole-body growth retardation normalized brain cell proliferation, but not differentiation, in CaSR null mice. Cultured neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from the subventricular zones of CaSR null neonatal mice exhibited normal proliferation capacity but decreased differentiation capacity, compared with wild-type controls. These results demonstrate that direct effects of CaSR absence impair NSC differentiation, while secondary effects of parathyroid hormone-related endocrine abnormalities impair NSC proliferation, both of which contribute to delayed brain development in CaSR null newborn mice.

We previously showed that transgenic mice that overexpress human ApoD show a better resistance against paraquat or OC43 coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration. Here, we identified several nuclear factors from the cortex of control and OC43-infected mice which bind a fragment of the proximal ApoD promoter in vitro. Of interest, we detected apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Human ApoE consists of three isoforms (E2, E3, and E4) with the E4 and E2 alleles representing a greater and a lower risk for developping AD, respectively. Our results show that ApoE is located in the nucleus and on the ApoD promoter in human hepatic and glioblastoma cells lines. Furthermore, overexpression of ApoE3 and ApoE4 isoforms but not ApoE2 significantly inhibited the ApoD promoter activity in U87 cells (E3/E3 genotype) cultured under normal or different stress conditions while ApoE knock-down by siRNA had a converse effect. Consistent with these results, we also demonstrated by ChIP assay that E3 and E4 isoforms, but not E2, bind the ApoD promoter. Moreover, using the Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization database, we observed an inverse correlation between ApoD and ApoE mRNA expression during development and in several regions of the mouse brain, notably in the cortex, hippocampus, plexus choroid, and cerebellum. This negative correlation was also observed for cortex layers IV-VI based on a new Transcriptomic Atlas of the Mouse Neocortical Layers. These findings reveal a new function for ApoE by regulating ApoD gene expression.

Using data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge), a cross-sectional analysis was conducted to examine the associations between vitamin K status, measured as serum phylloquinone concentrations, and performance in verbal and non-verbal episodic memory, executive functions, and speed of processing. The sample included 320 men and women aged 70 to 85 years who were free of cognitive impairment. After adjustment for covariates, higher serum phylloquinone concentration (log-transformed) was associated with better verbal episodic memory performances (F = 2.43, p = 0.048); specifically with the scores (Z-transformed) on the second (beta = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.82), third (beta = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.06-0.75), and 20-minute delayed (beta= 0.47; 95% CI = 0.12-0.82) free recall trials of the RL/RI-16 Free and Cued Recall Task. No associations were found with nonverbal episodic memory, executive functions, and speed of processing. Our study adds evidence to the possible role of vitamin K in cognition during aging, specifically in the consolidation of the memory trace. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Executive function, self-regulation and attribution in acquired brain injury: A scoping review	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Executive function; Self-regulation; Attribution; Rehabilitation; Brain injury	SOCIAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; FRONTAL-LOBE; CAUSAL ATTRIBUTIONS; REHABILITATION; MOTIVATION; EMOTION; PERFORMANCE; SUBREGIONS; ATTENTION; STUDENTS	Impairments in executive function, self-regulation and attribution individually have been implicated in impairment in goal-directed behaviour, resulting in reduced participation in daily activities by individuals with brain injury. There is minimal literature that explicitly addresses the relationships among these constructs, how these may be affected by brain injury and the implications for rehabilitation. The objectives of this study were to determine what is known about the relationship between executive function, self-regulation and attribution, and to understand how these inter-relationships affect goal-directed behaviour in adults with acquired brain injury. A scoping review of the cognitive neuroscience, neuropsychology, rehabilitation, educational and social psychology literature from 1985 to 2011 was performed. The identified literature provided definitions of the constructs and insight into the relationships between them according to their neural underpinnings and theoretical models. These data also provided for the development of a new model illustrating the hypothesised relationships between constructs. This review and the model developed, suggest that attribution may play an important role in executive function and self-regulation. Rehabilitation interventions that address formulation of appropriate attributions should be considered in conjunction with those targeting self-regulation and executive function for individuals with brain injury.

Left Lateralized Enhancement of Orofacial Somatosensory Processing Due to Speech Sounds	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						neuroimaging; speech perception; speech production		Purpose: Somatosensory information associated with speech articulatory movements affects the perception of speech sounds and vice versa, suggesting an intimate linkage between speech production and perception systems. However, it is unclear which cortical processes are involved in the interaction between speech sounds and orofacial somatosensory inputs. The authors examined whether speech sounds modify orofacial somatosensory cortical potentials that were elicited using facial skin perturbations. Method: Somatosensory event- related potentials in EEG were recorded in 3 background sound conditions ( pink noise, speech sounds, and nonspeech sounds) and also in a silent condition. Facial skin deformations that are similar in timing and duration to those experienced in speech production were used for somatosensory stimulation. Results: The authors found that speech sounds reliably enhanced the first negative peak of the somatosensory event- related potential when compared with the other 3 sound conditions. The enhancement was evident at electrode locations above the left motor and premotor area of the orofacial system. The result indicates that speech sounds interact with somatosensory cortical processes that are produced by speech- production- like patterns of facial skin stretch. Conclusion: Neural circuits in the left hemisphere, presumably in left motor and premotor cortex, may play a prominent role in the interaction between auditory inputs and speech- relevant somatosensory processing.

Characterization of cys-loop receptor genes involved in inhibitory amine neurotransmission in parasitic and free living nematodes	PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							GATED ION-CHANNEL; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; CHLORIDE CHANNEL; C-ELEGANS; HAEMONCHUS-CONTORTUS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; POSITIVE SELECTION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BINDING	We have isolated two genes, Hco-lgc-53 and Hco-mod-1, from the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, which are orthologs of previously characterized genes that encode dopamine and serotonin-gated chloride channels, respectively, in Caenorhabditis elegans. A search of transcriptome data for the filarial nematode parasites Loa loa, Brugia malayi, and Wucheria bancrofti revealed predicted coding sequences for orthologs of acetylcholine, serotonin and dopamine-gated chloride channels, which correspond to the C. elegans clades acc-1, mod-1 and ggr-3, respectively. Genome data for the more distantly related nematode parasite, Trichinella spiralis, contain genes predicted to encode members of the acc-1 clade only, but all three clades were absent from the trematode Schistosoma mansoni. Analysis of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (omega) for receptor subunit sequences revealed strong selective constraint over the entire protein, consistent with the known highly conserved 3D structure of cys-loop receptors. This constraint was significantly greater for binding loop residues that are predicted to contact bound ligand and residues of the transmembrane domains. The substitution rate for ligand binding residues was significantly higher for branches leading to the acc-1 and mod-1 clades, where the convergent evolution for binding acetylcholine and serotonin, respectively, is thought to have occurred. Homology models of both Hco-MOD-1 and Hco-LGC-53 channels revealed the presence of binding structures typical of the cys-loop receptor family, including the presence of an aromatic box that is important for the formation of the binding pocket Both receptors contain a tryptophan in loop C that appears to be a key residue important for the binding of amines to ligand-gated chloride channels. As additional ligand-gated chloride-channel sequences become available for a wider range of species the combination of molecular modeling and analysis of sequence evolution should provide an effective tool to understand the wide diversity of neurotransmitters that bind to this unique group of receptors.

Our aim is to demonstrate that these two apparently distinct conditions of the aging body - one affecting the male reproductive system, the other primarily the brain - are addressed in similar fashion in recent public health activities because of a growing emphasis on a cardiovascular logic'. We suggest that this is a form of reductionism, and argue that it leaves us with a dangerous paradox: while re-transcending, at least partially, the conceptual separation of body and brain, it clouds much-needed discussion and research, such as contingent issues of socio-economic and socio-cultural disease disparities.

Endothelial cells are the central component of the BBB and control of their barrier phenotype resides on astrocytes and pericytes. Interactions between these cells and the endothelium promote and maintain many of the physiological and metabolic characteristics that are unique to the BBB. In this review we describe recent findings related to the involvement of astroglial cells, including radial glial cells, in the induction of barrier properties during embryogenesis and adulthood. In addition, we describe changes that occur in astrocytes and endothelial cells during injury and inflammation with a particular emphasis on alterations of the BBB phenotype.

P2Y6 metabotropic G(q)-coupled receptors, also expressed in microglia, are involved in the initial response to nerve injury, triggering phagocytosis upon activation by UDP. It has been reported recently that expression of both P2X4 and P2Y6 is upregulated in activated microglia following nerve injury. We show here, in resting as well as LPS-activated primary microglia, that P2Y6 decreases P2X4-mediated calcium entry and inhibits the dilation of P2X4 channels into a large-conductance pore measured with a YO-PRO-1 uptake assay. Furthermore, P2Y6 activation modulates the ATP-dependent migration of microglia, a process likely involved in their shift from migratory to phagocytic phenotype. Reconstituting the P2X4-P2Y6 interaction in recombinant systems shows that P2Y6 activation decreases P2X4 current amplitude, activation and desensitization rates, and reduces P2X4 channel permeability to the large cation NMDG(+). Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P-2, a necessary cofactor for P2X4 channel function, underlies this inhibitory crosstalk. As extracellular levels of both ATP and UDP are increased in the spinal cord following nerve injury, the control of P2X4 activity by P2Y6 might play a critical role in regulating neuropathic pain-inducing microglial responses.

However, it is not clear if these deficits are linked to each other, and if they may be related to more basic alterations in attention. This is a relevant question in the perspective of future interventions targeting cognitive deficits to prevent suicidal acts. Method: Two different populations of patients with histories of suicide attempts were assessed (N=142 and 119). The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was used to measure decision-making in both populations. We used a D2 cancellation task and a verbal working memory task in population 1; the Stroop test, the N-Back task, the Trail Making Test, and the Hayling Sentence Completion test in population 2. Results: Regarding decision-making, we only found a small negative correlation between the Hayling test error score (r = -0.24; p=0.01), and the net score from the second half of the IGT. In contrast, working memory, cognitive flexibility and cognitive inhibition measures were largely inter-correlated. Limitation: Most patients were medicated. Only patients with mood disorders. Conclusion: These results add to previous findings suggesting that the neurocognitive vulnerability to suicidal behavior may rely on impairments in two distinct anatomical systems, one processing value-based decision-making (associated with ventral prefrontal cortex, among others) and one underlying cognitive control (associated with more dorsal prefrontal regions). This distinction may result in tailored-made cognitive interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Exposure to light directly enhances alertness and performance, so light is an important regulator of wakefulness and cognition. The roles of rods, cones, and ipRGCs in the impact of light on cognitive brain functions remain unclear, however. A small percentage of blind individuals retain non-image-forming photoreception and offer a unique opportunity to investigate light impacts in the absence of conscious vision, presumably through ipRGCs. Here, we show that three such patients were able to choose nonrandomly about the presence of light despite their complete lack of sight. Furthermore, 2 sec of blue light modified EEG activity when administered simultaneously to auditory stimulations. fMRI further showed that, during an auditory working memory task, less than a minute of blue light triggered the recruitment of supplemental prefrontal and thalamic brain regions involved in alertness and cognition regulation as well as key areas of the default mode network. These results, which have to be considered as a proof of concept, show that non-image-forming photoreception triggers some awareness for light and can have a more rapid impact on human cognition than previously understood, if brain processing is actively engaged. Furthermore, light stimulates higher cognitive brain activity, independently of vision, and engages supplemental brain areas to perform an ongoing cognitive process. To our knowledge, our results constitute the first indication that ipRGC signaling may rapidly affect fundamental cerebral organization, so that it could potentially participate to the regulation of numerous aspects of human brain function.

This activity serves functionally relevant brain systems supporting cognition. Here, we analyze changes in resting-state functional connectivity after videogame practice applying a test-retest design. Twenty young females were selected from a group of 100 participants tested on four standardized cognitive ability tests. The practice and control groups were carefully matched on their ability scores. The practice group played during two sessions per week across 4 weeks (16 h total) under strict supervision in the laboratory, showing systematic performance improvements in the game. A group independent component analysis (GICA) applying multisession temporal concatenation on test-retest resting-state fMRI, jointly with a dual-regression approach, was computed. Supporting the main hypothesis, the key finding reveals an increased correlated activity during rest in certain predefined resting state networks (albeit using uncorrected statistics) attributable to practice with the cognitively demanding tasks of the videogame. Observed changes were mainly concentrated on parietofrontal networks involved in heterogeneous cognitive functions. Hum Brain Mapp 34:3143-3157, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The present study tested whether this occurs in humans. Methods: The effects of a laboratory psychological stressor (Montreal Imaging Stress Task, MIST) on mesocortical dopamine release in healthy young adults (11 males, mean age +/- SD, 20.6 +/- 2.4 years) was measured using positron emission tomography and [F-18]fallypride. Each subject was scanned in two separate days in counterbalanced order: one with the MIST and one with the control task. Binding potential (BPND) maps of the whole brain were calculated for each scan, using a simplified reference tissue compartmental model. Then BPND was compared between subjects. Heart rate, galvanic skin response, and salivary cortisol level were measured during the scans. Results: The psychological stressor significantly decreased [F-18]fallypride binding values in the dorsal part of the medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), corresponding to the rostal part of the cingulate motor zone. The greater the stress-induced decrease in [F-18]fallypride binding in the dmPFC, the greater the stress-induced increases in heart rate.

Serotonin selectively enhances perception and sensory neural responses to stimuli generated by same-sex conspecifics	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						neuromodulation; neuroethology; excitability; neural coding	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; POTASSIUM CURRENTS; ISOLATED SPIKES; NEURONS; MODULATION; BURSTS; SK; NEUROMODULATION; DOMINANT	Centrifugal serotonergic fibers innervating sensory brain areas are seen ubiquitously across systems and species but their function remains unclear. Here we examined the functional role of serotonergic innervation onto electrosensory neurons in weakly electric fish by eliciting endogenous release through electrical stimulation as well as exogenous focal application of serotonin in the vicinity of the cell being recorded from. Both approaches showed that the function of serotonergic input onto electrosensory pyramidal neurons is to render them more excitable by reducing the spike afterhyperpolarization amplitude and thereby promoting burst firing. Further, serotonergic input selectively improved neuronal responses to stimuli that occur during interactions between same-sex conspecifics but not to stimuli associated with either prey or that occur during interactions between opposite-sex conspecifics. Finally, we tested whether serotonin-mediated enhanced pyramidal neuron responses to stimuli associated with same-sex conspecifics actually increase perception by the animal. Our behavioral experiments show that exogenous injection and endogenous release of serotonin both increase the magnitude of behavioral responses to stimuli associated with same-sex conspecifics as well as simultaneously decrease aggressive behaviors. Thus, our data indicate that the serotonergic system inhibits aggressive behavior toward same-sex conspecifics, while at the same time increasing perception of stimuli associated with these individuals. This function is likely to be conserved across systems and species.

P2X receptors constitute a gene family of calcium-permeable ATP-gated cation channels therefore the regulation of P2X signaling is critical for both membrane potential and intracellular calcium homeostasis. Phosphoinositides (PIP) are anionic signaling phospholipids that act as functional regulators of many types of ion channels. Direct PIP, binding was demonstrated for several ligand- or voltage-gated ion channels, however no generic motif emerged to accurately predict lipid-protein binding sites. This review presents what is currently known about the modulation of the different P2X subtypes by phospholipids and about critical determinants underlying their sensitivity to PIP, levels in the plasma membrane. All functional mammalian P2X subtypes tested, with the notable exception of P2X5, have been shown to be positively modulated by PIPn, i.e., homomeric P2X1, P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7, as well as heteromeric P2X1/5 and P2X2/3 receptors. Based on various results reported on the aforementioned subtypes including mutagenesis of the prototypical PIPn-sensitive P2X4 and PIPn-insensitive P2X5 receptor subtypes, an increasing amount of functional, biochemical and structural evidence converges on the modulatory role of a short polybasic domain located in the proximal C-terminus of P2X subunits. This linear motif, semi-conserved in the P2X family, seems necessary and sufficient for encoding direct modulation of AIR gated channels by PIP,. Furthermore, the physiological impact of the regulation of ionotropic purinergic responses by phospholipids on pain pathways was recently revealed in the context of native crosstalks between phospholipase C (PLC)-linked metabotropic receptors and P2X receptor channels in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons and rnicroglia.

Here we report the first evidence of the existence of neurons showing selective tuning for contrast in area V4d of the behaving macaque (Macaca mulatta), i.e., narrow bandpass filter neurons with peak activity encompassing the whole range of visible contrasts and pronounced attenuation at contrasts higher than the peak. Crucially, we found that contrast tuning emerges after a considerable delay from stimulus onset, likely reflecting the contribution of inhibitory mechanisms. Selective tuning for luminance contrast might support multiple functions, including contrast identification and the attentive selection of low contrast stimuli.

Taking advantage of a binary genetic approach, we selectively targeted Na(v)1.8 (+) sensory neurons for conditional expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) channels. Acute blue light illumination of the skin produced robust nocifensive behaviors, evoked by the remote stimulation of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptive fibers as indicated by c-Fos labeling in laminae I and II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Anon-nociceptive component also contributes to the observed behaviors, as shown by c-Fos expression in lamina III of the dorsal horn and the expression of ChR2-EYFP in a subpopulation of large-diameter Nav1.8 (+) dorsal root ganglion neurons. Selective activation of Nav1.8 (+) afferents in vivo induced central sensitization and conditioned place aversion, thus providing a novel paradigm to investigate plasticity in the pain circuitry. Long-term potentiation was similarly evoked by light activation of the same afferents in isolated spinal cord preparations. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the optical control of nociception and central sensitization in behaving mammals and enables selective activation of the same class of afferents in both in vivo and ex vivo preparations. Our results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that optical dissection of the contribution of specific classes of afferents to central sensitization is possible. The high spatiotemporal precision offered by this non-invasive model will facilitate drug development and target validation for pain therapeutics.

In this study, we tracked progressive structural changes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy at a subregional level. Furthermore, we evaluated the relation between disease progression and surgical outcome. Methods: We combined cross-sectional modeling of disease duration in a large cohort of patients (n = 134) and longitudinal analysis in a subset that delayed surgery (n = 31). To track subregional pathology, we applied surface-shape analysis techniques on manual mesiotemporal labels. Results: Longitudinal and cross-sectional designs showed consistent patterns of progressive atrophy in hippocampal CA1, anterolateral entorhinal, and the amygdalar laterobasal group bilaterally. These regions also exhibited more marked age-related volume loss in patients compared with controls. We found a faster progression of hippocampal atrophy in patients with a seizure frequency >= 6 per month. High rates of contralateral entorhinal cortex atrophy predicted post-surgical seizure relapse. Conclusion: We observed progressive atrophy in hippocampal, amygdalar, and entorhinal subregions that frequently display neuronal loss on histology. The bilateral character of cumulative atrophy highlights the importance of early surgery. In patients who nevertheless delay this procedure, serial scanning may provide markers of surgical outcome.

In this study, we investigated whether the transition to seizure is associated with changes in brain dynamics detectable in the wideband EEG, and whether differences exist across underlying pathologies. Depth electrode ictal EEG recordings from 40 consecutive patients with pharmacoresistant lesional focal epilepsy were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Predefined EEG sections were selected immediately before (immediate preictal), and 30 seconds before the earliest EEG sign suggestive of seizure activity (baseline). Spectral analysis, visual inspection and discrete wavelet transform were used to detect standard (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) and high-frequency bands (ripples and fast ripples). At the group level, each EEG frequency band activity increased significantly from baseline to the immediate preictal section, mostly in a progressive manner and independently of any modification in the state of vigilance. Preictal increases in each frequency band activity were widespread, being observed in the seizure-onset zone and lesional tissue, as well as in remote regions. These changes occurred in all the investigated pathologies (mesial temporal atrophy/sclerosis, local/regional cortical atrophy, and malformations of cortical development), but were more pronounced in mesial temporal atrophy/sclerosis. Our findings indicate that a brain state change with distinctive features, in the form of unidirectional changes across the entire EEG bandwidth, occurs immediately prior to seizure onset. We postulate that these changes might reflect a facilitating state of the brain which enables a susceptible region to generate seizures.

Methods: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 21 BN patients and 23 healthy controls (HCs) completed two paradigms: 1) processing of visual food stimuli and 2) comparing their own appearance with that of slim women. Participants also rated food craving and anxiety levels. Results: Brain activation patterns in response to food cues did not differ between women with and without BN. However, when evaluating themselves against images of slim women, BN patients engaged the insula more and the fusiform gyrus less, compared to HCs, suggesting increased self-focus among women with BN whilst comparing themselves to a 'slim ideal'. In these BN patients, exposure to food and body image stimuli increased self-reported levels of anxiety, but not craving. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that women with BN differ from HCs in the way they process body image, but not in the way they process food stimuli.

IBIS Network	Diffusion imaging quality control via entropy of principal direction distribution	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; Diffusion tensor imaging; Quality assessment; Entropy	SPIN-ECHO; IN-VIVO; FIBER TRACTOGRAPHY; OUTLIER REJECTION; MRI DATA; TENSOR; BRAIN; MODEL; DISTORTIONS; PROJECTIONS	Diffusion MR imaging has received increasing attention in the neuroimaging community, as it yields new insights into the microstructural organization of white matter that are not available with conventional MRI techniques. While the technology has enormous potential, diffusion MRI suffers from a unique and complex set of image quality problems, limiting the sensitivity of studies and reducing the accuracy of findings. Furthermore, the acquisition time for diffusion MRI is longer than conventional MRI due to the need for multiple acquisitions to obtain directionally encoded Diffusion Weighted Images (DWI). This leads to increased motion artifacts, reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and increased proneness to a wide variety of artifacts, including eddy-current and motion artifacts, "venetian blind" artifacts, as well as slice-wise and gradient-wise inconsistencies. Such artifacts mandate stringent Quality Control (QC) schemes in the processing of diffusion MRI data. Most existing QC procedures are conducted in the DWI domain and/or on a voxel level, but our own experiments show that these methods often do not fully detect and eliminate certain types of artifacts, often only visible when investigating groups of DWI's or a derived diffusion model, such as the most-employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Here, we propose a novel regional QC measure in the DTI domain that employs the entropy of the regional distribution of the principal directions (PD). The PD entropy quantifies the scattering and spread of the principal diffusion directions and is invariant to the patient's position in the scanner. High entropy value indicates that the PDs are distributed relatively uniformly, while low entropy value indicates the presence of clusters in the PD distribution. The novel QC measure is intended to complement the existing set of QC procedures by detecting and correcting residual artifacts. Such residual artifacts cause directional bias in the measured PD and here called dominant direction artifacts. Experiments show that our automatic method can reliably detect and potentially correct such artifacts, especially the ones caused by the vibrations of the scanner table during the scan. The results further indicate the usefulness of this method for general quality assessment in DTI studies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Participants retained one or two simultaneously presented tones. After a two second interval a test tone was presented and the task was to determine if that tone was in memory. We focused on brain activity during the retention interval that increased as the number of sounds retained in auditory short-term memory (ASTM) increased. Source analyses revealed that the superior temporal gyrus in both hemispheres is involved in ASTM. In the right hemisphere, the inferior temporal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal structures also play a role. Our method provides good spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neuronal correlates of ASTM and, as it is the first MEG study using a memory load manipulation without using sequences of tones, it allowed us to isolate brain regions that most likely reflect the simple retention of tones.

A new method for structural volume analysis of longitudinal brain MRI data and its application in studying the growth trajectories of anatomical brain structures in childhood	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Longitudinal brain MRI; Longitudinal analysis; Structural volume analysis; Brain development; Growth trajectories	SEGMENTATION; TEMPLATE; REGISTRATION; VALIDATION; IMAGES; AGE; MS	Cross-sectional analysis of longitudinal anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data may be suboptimal as each dataset is analyzed independently. In this study, we evaluate how much variability can be reduced by analyzing structural volume changes in longitudinal data using longitudinal analysis. We propose a two-part pipeline that consists of longitudinal registration and longitudinal classification. The longitudinal registration step includes the creation of subject-specific linear and nonlinear templates that are then registered to a population template. The longitudinal classification step comprises a four-dimensional expectation-maximization algorithm, using a priori classes computed by averaging the tissue classes of all time points obtained cross-sectionally. To study the impact of these two steps, we apply the framework completely ("LL method": Longitudinal registration and Longitudinal classification) and partially ("LC method": Longitudinal registration and Cross-sectional classification) and compare these with a standard cross-sectional framework ("CC method": Cross-sectional registration and Cross-sectional classification). The three methods are applied to (1) a scan-rescan database to analyze reliability and (2) the NIH pediatric population to compare gray matter growth trajectories evaluated with a linear mixed model. The LL method, and the LC method to a lesser extent, significantly reduced the variability in the measurements in the scan-rescan study and gave the best-fitted gray matter growth model with the NIH pediatric MRI database. The results confirm that both steps of the longitudinal framework reduce variability and improve accuracy in comparison with the cross-sectional framework, with longitudinal classification yielding the greatest impact. Using the improved method to analyze longitudinal data, we study the growth trajectories of anatomical brain structures in childhood using the NIH pediatric MRI database. We report age- and gender-related growth trajectories of specific regions of the brain during childhood that could be used as a reference in studying the impact of neurological disorders on brain development.

Highly interconnected brain regions (so-called 'hubs') seem to be important in these epileptic networks. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG recordings are recently discovered biomarkers that can identify the epileptogenic area and are thought to result from altered neuronal interactions. We studied whether the epileptogenic zone (identified by HFOs and seizure onset zone) is associated with pathological hubs. Bilateral depth electrode recordings from the hippocampus and amygdala were available from twelve patients suspected of temporal lobe epilepsy. HFOs, classified as ripples (80-250Hz) and fast ripples (250-500Hz), and epileptiform spikes were marked for all patients in a five-minute epoch of slow-wave sleep. For each channel, we computed hub-measures from a period without epileptiform spikes and found that the epileptogenic zone was associated with a decreased hub-value in the theta frequency band. The amount of HFOs, especially fast ripples, was negatively correlated with the hub-value per channel. Results from post-hoc analyses of other frequency bands, particularly the broad- and gamma frequency band, pointed in the same direction as the results for the theta frequency band. These findings suggest a pathological functional 'isolation' of the epileptogenic zone in the interictal state. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In recent years, the G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) was suggested as a cannabinoid receptor based on its activation by anandamide and tetrahydrocannabinol. Yet, its formal classification is still a matter of debate. CB1R and CB2R expression patterns are well described for rodent and monkey retinas. In the monkey retina, CB1R has been localized in its neural (cone photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells) and CB2R in glial components (Muller cells). The aim of this study was to determine the expression pattern of GPR55 in the monkey retina by using confocal microscopy. Our results show that GPR55 is strictly localized in the photoreceptor layer of the extrafoveal portion of the retina. Co-immunolabeling of GPR55 with rhodopsin, the photosensitive pigment in rods, revealed a clear overlap of expression throughout the rod structure with most prominent staining in the inner segments. Additionally, double-label of GPR55 with calbindin, a specific marker for cone photoreceptors in the primate retina, allowed us to exclude expression of GPR55 in cones. The labeling of GPR55 in rods was further assessed with a 3D visualization in the XZ and YZ planes thus confirming its exclusive expression in rods. These results provide data on the distribution of GPR55 in the monkey retina, different than CB1R and CB2R. The presence of GPR55 in rods suggests a function of this receptor in scotopic vision that needs to be demonstrated.

IMAGEN Consortium	A Phenotypic Structure and Neural Correlates of Compulsive Behaviors in Adolescents	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; BINGE-EATING DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Background: A compulsivity spectrum has been hypothesized to exist across Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD), Eating Disorders (ED), substance abuse (SA) and binge-drinking (BD). The objective was to examine the validity of this compulsivity spectrum, and differentiate it from an externalizing behaviors dimension, but also to look at hypothesized personality and neural correlates. Method: A community-sample of adolescents (N=1938; mean age 14.5 years), and their parents were recruited via high-schools in 8 European study sites. Data on adolescents' psychiatric symptoms, DSM diagnoses (DAWBA) and substance use behaviors (AUDIT and ESPAD) were collected through adolescent-and parent-reported questionnaires and interviews. The phenotypic structure of compulsive behaviors was then tested using structural equation modeling. The model was validated using personality variables (NEO-FFI and TCI), and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis. Results: Compulsivity symptoms best fit a higher-order two factor model, with ED and OCD loading onto a compulsivity factor, and BD and SA loading onto an externalizing factor, composed also of ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms. The compulsivity construct correlated with neuroticism (r=0.638; p <= 0.001), conscientiousness (r=0.171; p <= 0.001), and brain gray matter volume in left and right orbitofrontal cortex, right ventral striatum and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The externalizing factor correlated with extraversion (r=0.201; p <= 0.001), novelty-seeking (r=0.451; p <= 0.001), and negatively with gray matter volume in the left inferior and middle frontal gyri. Conclusions: Results suggest that a compulsivity spectrum exists in an adolescent, preclinical sample and accounts for variance in both OCD and ED, but not substance-related behaviors, and can be differentiated from an externalizing spectrum.

Here, we investigated directly the effects of increased and decreased availability of extracellular dopamine on pain perception in healthy volunteers. In Study 1, participants ingested, in separate sessions, a placebo and a low dose of the centrally acting D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride, intended to increase synaptic dopamine via predominant pre-synaptic blockade. No effects were seen on thermal pain thresholds, tolerance, or temporal summation. Study 2 used the acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method to transiently decrease dopamine availability. In one session participants ingested a mixture that depletes the dopamine amino acid precursors, phenylalanine and tyrosine. In the other session they ingested a nutritionally balanced control mixture. APTD led to a small mood-lowering response following aversive thermal stimulation, but had no effects on the perception of cold, warm, or pain stimuli. In both studies the experimental manipulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission was successful as indicated by manipulation checks. The results contradict proposals that dopamine has direct anti-nociceptive effects in acute experimental pain. Based on dopamine's well-known role in reward processing, we hypothesize that also in the context of pain, dopamine acts on stimulus salience and might play a role in the initiation of avoidance behavior rather than having direct antinociceptive effects in acute experimental pain.

Recent evidence, however, suggests that these two mechanisms could interact extensively, with spontaneous activity affecting the expression and function of guidance molecules at early developmental stages. Here, using the developing chick spinal cord and the mouse visual system to ectopically express the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 in individual embryonic neurons, we demonstrate that cell-intrinsic blockade of spontaneous activity in vivo does not affect neuronal identity specification, axon pathfinding, or EphA/ephrinA signaling during the development of topographic maps. However, intrinsic spontaneous activity is critical for axon branching and pruning once axonal growth cones reach their correct topographic position in the target tissues. Our experiments argue for the dissociation of spontaneous activity from hard-wired developmental programs in early phases of neural circuit formation.

Studies have demonstrated that a concurrently presented voice can alter the way that an emotional face expression is perceived, and vice versa, leading to emotional conflict if the information in the two modalities is mismatched. Additionally, evidence suggests that incongruence of emotional valence activates cerebral networks involved in conflict monitoring and resolution. However, it is currently unclear whether this is due to task difficultythat incongruent stimuli are harder to categorizeor simply to the detection of mismatching information in the two modalities. The aim of the present fMRI study was to examine the neurophysiological correlates of processing incongruent emotional information, independent of task difficulty. Subjects were scanned while judging the emotion of face-voice affective stimuli. Both the face and voice were parametrically morphed between anger and happiness and then paired in all audiovisual combinations, resulting in stimuli each defined by two separate values: the degree of incongruence between the face and voice, and the degree of clarity of the combined face-voice information. Due to the specific morphing procedure utilized, we hypothesized that the clarity value, rather than incongruence value, would better reflect task difficulty. Behavioral data revealed that participants integrated face and voice affective information, and that the clarity, as opposed to incongruence value correlated with categorization difficulty. Cerebrally, incongruence was more associated with activity in the superior temporal region, which emerged after task difficulty had been accounted for. Overall, our results suggest that activation in the superior temporal region in response to incongruent information cannot be explained simply by task difficulty, and may rather be due to detection of mismatching information between the two modalities	[Watson, Rebecca] Maastricht Univ, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, NL-6229 EV Maastricht, Netherlands; [Watson, Rebecca; Latinus, Marianne; Noguchi, Takao; Garrod, Oliver; Crabbe, Frances; Belin, Pascal] Univ Glasgow, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Latinus, Marianne; Belin, Pascal] Inst Neurosci Timone, Marseille, France; [Latinus, Marianne; Belin, Pascal] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Noguchi, Takao] Univ Warwick, Dept Psychol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Belin, Pascal] Univ Montreal, Int Labs Brain Mus & Sound, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Belin, Pascal] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Watson, R (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, Oxfordlaan 55, NL-6229 EV Maastricht, Netherlands.	rebecca.watson@maastrichtuniversity.nl	Latinus, Marianne/A-8173-2011; Belin, Pascal/C-6247-2009	Latinus, Marianne/0000-0002-4406-2962; Belin, Pascal/0000-0002-7578-6365				49	11	11	3	16	FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1662-5161			FRONT HUM NEUROSCI	Front.

To understand the full physiological impact of Caspase-6 in humans, we investigated Caspase-6 expression. We performed western blot analyses to detect the pro-Caspase-6 and its active p20 subunit in fetal and adult lung, kidney, brain, spleen, muscle, stomach, colon, heart, liver, skin, and adrenals tissues. The levels were semi-quantitated by densitometry. The results show a ubiquitous expression of Caspase-6 in most fetal tissues with the lowest levels in the brain and the highest levels in the gastrointestinal system. Caspase-6 active p20 subunits were only detected in fetal stomach. Immunohistochemical analysis of a human fetal embryo showed active Caspase-6 positive apoptotic cells in the dorsal root ganglion, liver, lung, kidney, ovary, skeletal muscle and the intestine. In the adult tissues, the levels of Caspase-6 were lower than in fetal tissues but remained high in the colon, stomach, lung, kidney and liver. Immunohistological analyses revealed that active Caspase-6 was abundant in goblet cells and epithelial cells sloughing off the intestinal lining of the adult colon. These results suggest that Caspase-6 is likely important in most tissues during early development but is less involved in adult tissues. The low levels of Caspase-6 in fetal and adult brain indicate that increased expression as observed in Alzheimer Disease is a pathological condition. Lastly, the high levels of Caspase-6 in the gastrointestinal system indicate a potential specific function of Caspase-6 in these tissues.

The aim of the present study was to examine how breathing frequency and phase affect pain perception, spinal nociceptive activity (RIII-reflex) and brain activity (scalp somatosensory-evoked potentials - SEP's). In 20 healthy volunteers, painful electric shocks individually adjusted to 120% of the RIII-reflex threshold were delivered to the sural nerve near the end of inspiration or expiration phases, during three cued-breathing conditions: (1) slow breathing (0.1 Hz) with slow (4 s) inspiration (0.1 Hz-SlowIns), (2) slow breathing (0.1 Hz) with fast (2 s) inspiration (0.1 Hz-FastIns), and (3) normal breathing (0.2 Hz) with fast (2 s) inspiration (0.2 Hz). Pain ratings were not affected by breathing patterns (p = 0.3), but were significantly lower during inspiration compared with expiration (p = 0.02). This phase effect was also observed on the N100 component of SEP's, but only in the 0.1-Hz-FastIns condition (p = 0.03). In contrast, RIII-reflex amplitude was greater during inspiration compared with expiration (p = 0.02). It was also decreased in the 0.1Hz-SlowIns compared with the 0.2-Hz condition (p = 0.01). Slow breathing also increased the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), although these changes were not significantly associated with changes in pain responses. In conclusion, this study shows that pain and pain-related brain activity may be reduced during inspiration but these changes are dissociated from spinal nociceptive transmission. The small amplitude of these effects suggests that factors other than respiration contribute to the analgesic effects of relaxation and meditation techniques. (C) 2013 IBRO.

Detecting self-produced speech errors before and after articulation: an ERP investigation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speecherrors; speechproduction; event-relatedpotentials; error-relatednegativity; conflictmonitoring	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MONITORING ACTIVITY; RESPONSE CONFLICT; WORD RECOGNITION; LEXICAL ACCESS; NEGATIVITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; TASK; SEMANTICS	It has been argued that speech production errors are monitored by the same neural system involved in monitoring other types of action errors. Behavioral evidence has shown that speech errors can be detected and corrected prior to articulation, yet the neural basis for such pre-articulatory speech error monitoring is poorly understood. The current study investigated speech error monitoring using a phoneme-substitution task known to elicit speech errors. Stimulus-locked event-related potential (ERP) analyses comparing correct and incorrect utterances were used to assess pre-articulatory error monitoring and response-locked ERP analyses were used to assess post-articulatory monitoring. Our novel finding in the stimulus-locked analysis revealed that words that ultimately led to a speech error were associated with a larger P2 component at midline sites (FCz, Cz, and CPz). This early positivity may reflect the detection of an error in speech formulation, or a predictive mechanism to signal the potential for an upcoming speech error. The data also revealed that general conflict monitoring mechanisms are involved during this task as both correct and incorrect responses elicited an anterior N2 component typically associated with conflict monitoring. The response-locked analyses corroborated previous observations that self-produced speech errors led to a fronto-central error-related negativity (ERN). These results demonstrate that speech errors can be detected prior to articulation, and that speech error monitoring relies on a central error monitoring mechanism.

Wnt signaling in triple negative breast cancer is associated with metastasis	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Breast cancer; Triple negative; Wnt; FFPE; Microarray	GENE-EXPRESSION SIGNATURE; T-CELL-FACTOR; BETA-CATENIN; MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; REGULATES EXPRESSION; COLORECTAL-CANCER; ANDROGEN RECEPTOR; BASAL; SUBTYPES; PATHWAY	Background: Triple Negative subset of (TN) Breast Cancers (BC), a close associate of the basal-like subtype (with limited discordance) is an aggressive form of the disease which convey unpredictable, and poor prognosis due to limited treatment options and lack of proven effective targeted therapies. Methods: We conducted an expression study of 240 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary biopsies from two cohorts, including 130 TN tumors, to identify molecular mechanisms of TN disease. Results: The annotation of differentially expressed genes in TN tumors contained an overrepresentation of canonical Wnt signaling components in our cohort and others. These observations were supported by upregulation of experimentally induced oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin genes in TN tumors, recapitulated using targets induced by Wnt3A. A functional blockade of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by either a pharmacological Wnt-antagonist, WntC59, sulidac sulfide, or beta-catenin (functional read out of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway) SiRNA mediated genetic manipulation demonstrated that a functional perturbation of the pathway is causal to the metastasis- associated phenotypes including fibronectin-directed migration, F-actin organization, and invasion in TNBC cells. A classifier, trained on microarray data from beta-catenin transfected mammary cells, identified a disproportionate number of TNBC breast tumors as compared to other breast cancer subtypes in a meta-analysis of 11 studies and 1,878 breast cancer patients, including the two cohorts published here. Patients identified by the Wnt/beta-catenin classifier had a greater risk of lung and brain, but not bone metastases. Conclusion: These data implicate transcriptional Wnt signaling as a hallmark of TNBC disease associated with specific metastatic pathways.

Evidence demonstrates its consistent efficacy in reducing pain for a single painful procedure. The purpose of this study is to examine the sustained efficacy of KMC, provided during all routine painful procedures for the duration of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) hospitalization, in diminishing behavioral pain response in preterm neonates. The efficacy of KMC alone will be compared to standard care of 24% oral sucrose, as well as the combination of KMC and 24% oral sucrose. Methods/design: Infants admitted to the NICU who are less than 36 6/7 weeks gestational age (according to early ultrasound), that are stable enough to be held in KMC, will be considered eligible (N = 258). Using a single-blinded randomized parallel group design, participants will be assigned to one of three possible interventions: 1) KMC, 2) combined KMC and sucrose, and 3) sucrose alone, when they undergo any routine painful procedure (heel lance, venipuncture, intravenous, oro/nasogastric insertion). The primary outcome is infant's pain intensity, which will be assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP). The secondary outcome will be maturity of neurobehavioral functioning, as measured by the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI). Gestational age, cumulative exposure to KMC provided during non-pain contexts, and maternal cortisol levels will be considered in the analysis. Clinical feasibility will be accounted for from nurse and maternal questionnaires. Discussion: This will be the first study to examine the repeated use of KMC for managing procedural pain in preterm neonates. It is also the first to compare KMC to sucrose, or the interventions in combination, across time. Based on the theoretical framework of the brain opioid theory of attachment, it is expected that KMC will be a preferred standard of care. However, current pain management guidelines are based on minimal data on repeated use of either intervention. Therefore, regardless of the outcomes of this study, results will have important implications for guidelines and practices related to management of procedural pain in preterm infants.

Familial ALS (PALS) comprises 5%-10% of ALS cases, and the identification of genes associated with FALS is indispensable to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis. We identified a Japanese family affected by late-onset, autosomal-dominant ALS in which mutations in genes known to be associated with FALS were excluded. A whole- genome sequencing and parametric linkage analysis under the assumption of an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance revealed the mutation c.2780G>A (p. Arg927Gln) in ERBB4. An extensive mutational analysis revealed the same mutation in a Canadian individual with familial ALS and a de novo mutation, c.3823C>T (p. Arg1275Trp), in a Japanese simplex case. These amino acid substitutions involve amino acids highly conserved among species, are predicted as probably damaging, and are located within a tyrosine kinase domain (p. Arg927Gln) or a C-terminal domain (p. Arg1275Trp), both of which mediate essential functions of ErbB4 as a receptor tyrosine kinase. Functional analysis revealed that these mutations led to a reduced autophosphorylation of ErbB4 upon neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) stimulation. Clinical presentations of the individuals with mutations were characterized by the involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons, a lack of obvious cognitive dysfunction, and relatively slow progression. This study indicates that disruption of the neuregulin-ErbB4 pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS and potentially paves the way for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies such using NRGs or their agonists to upregulate ErbB4 functions.

The permeability of [C-11]PiB in the blood-brain barrier is held to be high but the permeability-surface area product and extraction fractions in patients or healthy volunteers are not known. We used PET to determine the clearance associated with the unidrectional blood-brain transfer of [C-11]PiB and the corresponding cerebral blood flow rates in frontal lobe, whole cerebral cortex, and cerebellum of patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy volunteers. Regional cerebral blood flow rates differed significantly between the two groups. Thus, regional and whole-brain permeability-surface area products were identical, in agreement with the observation that numerically, but insignificantly, unidirectional blood-brain clearance are lower and extraction fractions higher in the patients. The evidence of unchanged permeability-surface area products in the patients implies that blood flow changes can be deduced from the unidirectional blood-brain clearances of [C-11]PiB in the patients.

Specifically, immune cell entry was largely considered to be pathological or to mark the beginning of pathology within the brain. Moreover, local inflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases such Alzheimer's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, were considered similar in their etiology to inflammatory diseases, such as remitting relapsing-multiple sclerosis. The ensuing confusion reflected a lack of awareness that the etiology of the disease as well as the origin of the immune cells determines the nature of the inflammatory response, and that inflammation resolution is an active cellular process. The last two decades have seen a revolution in these prevailing dogmas, with a significant contribution made by the authors. Microglia and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are now known to be functionally distinct and of separate origin. Innate and adaptive immune cells are now known to have protective/healing properties in the CNS, as long as their activity is regulated, and their recruitment is well controlled; their role is appreciated in maintenance of brain plasticity in health, aging, and chronic neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, it is now understood that the barriers of the brain are not uniform in their interactions with the circulating immune cells. The implications of these new findings to the basic understanding of CNS repair processes, brain aging, and a wide spectrum of CNS disorders, including acute injuries, Rett syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis, will be discussed.

The agent-enhanced e-negotiation system eAgora has been used in the experiments. The system features an agent that assists the user in generating candidate offers, evaluating and critiquing incoming offers, and critiquing counteroffers. The work investigates the effects of agent support and task complexity on negotiation performance and perceived measures of usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, and confidence. Overall, the results support the expectation that use of an agent leads to higher level of negotiation effectiveness, in particular for higher complexity tasks.

Comprehensive clinical information is collected with these instruments, including disease diagnoses. In Canada, interRAI data holdings represent some of the largest repositories of clinical information in the country for persons with neurological conditions. This study examined the accuracy of the diagnostic information captured by interRAI instruments designed for use in the home care, long-term care and mental health care settings as compared with national administrative databases. Methods: The interRAI assessments were matched with an inpatient hospital record and emergency department (ED) visit record in the preceding 90 days. Diagnoses captured on the interRAI instruments were compared to those recorded in either administrative record for each individual. Diagnostic validity was examined through sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value analysis for the following conditions: multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and reactive airway disease. Results: In the three large study samples (home care: n = 128,448; long-term care: n = 26,644; mental health: n = 13,812), interRAI diagnoses demonstrated high specificity when compared to administrative records, for both neurological conditions (range 0.80 - 1.00) and comparative chronic diseases (range 0.83 - 1.00). Sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) were more varied by specific diagnosis, with sensitivities and PPV for neurological conditions ranging from 0.23 to 0.94 and 0.14 to 0.77, respectively. The interRAI assessments routinely captured more cases of the diagnoses of interest than the administrative records. Conclusions: The interRAI assessment collected accurate information about disease diagnoses when compared to administrative records within three months. Such information is likely relevant to day-to-day care in these three environments and can be used to inform care planning and resource allocation decisions.

The APIC personalized community integration support programme encourages people with TBI to achieve significant daily living or leisure activities. Objectives: To explore the social participation needs and expectations of people with mTBI Methods: 1) Qualitative multiple-case study; 2) Questionnaires based on Assessment of Activities of Daily Living Profile, Leisure Profile and Life Habits in the form of semi-structured interviews. Results: Participants reported deterioration of their quality of life after the accident, especially affecting leisure activities and social role. They would like to have someone to help reduce their loneliness, reassure them and motivate them to start changing their lives. Discussion: Unlike the main interventions provided by the social welfare and healthcare system and relatives, people with mTBI express the need for reassuring activities in public places to help them regain their social role and accept their new identity.

Review of their MR imaging scans revealed a neoplastic lesion in 27% of patients, a malformation of cortical development in 21%, a vascular malformation in 19%, and atrophy/gliosis from an acquired insult in 17%. MR imaging results were normal in 4 patients. Other miscellaneous findings included a case of Rasmussen encephalitis, a nonspecific insular millimetric T2 signal abnormality, a neuroepithelial cyst, and hippocampal sclerosis without MR imaging evidence of dual insular pathologic features (despite depth electrode-proven insular seizures). Refractoriness to antiepileptic drug treatment was present in 56% of patients: 100% for patients with malformations of cortical development (1.0; 95% CI, 0.72-1.0), 50.0% (0.5; 95% CI, 0.21-0.78) in the presence of atrophy/gliosis from acquired insults, 39% (0.39; 95% CI, 0.14-0.68) for neoplastic lesions, and 22.2% (0.22; 95% CI, 0.06-0.55) for vascular malformations.

Some evidence implicates the catecholamines. In the present study, we measured the effects of transiently decreasing dopamine (DA) synthesis on mood and motivational states in healthy women with mild seasonal mood changes who were tested in either bright or dim light. Methods: On 2 test days, participants slept overnight in a light-controlled room. On the morning of each session, half of the participants awoke to gradual increases of bright light, up to 3000 lux, and half to dim light (10 lux). For all participants, DA was reduced on 1 of the test days using the acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion (APTD) method; on the other day, they ingested a nutritionally balanced control mixture (BAL). Beginning 4 hours postingestion, participants completed subjective mood questionnaires, psychological tests and a progressive ratio breakpoint task during which they worked for successive units of $5. Results: Thirty-two women participated in our study. The APTD lowered mood, agreeableness, energy and the willingness to work for monetary reward. The effects on energy and motivation were independent of light, while the effects on mood and agreeableness were seen in the dim condition only, being prevented by bright light. Limitations: Acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion might affect systems other than DA. The sample size was small. Conclusion: These results suggest that increased DA function may be responsible for some of the beneficial effects of light, while adding to the evidence that the neurobiology of mood and motivational states can be dissociated.

Elevated incidence of suicide in people living at altitude, smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma: possible role of hypoxia causing decreased serotonin synthesis	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material							COMPLETED SUICIDE; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; OXYGEN-TENSION; HUMAN BRAIN; BEHAVIOR; NEUROBIOLOGY; TRYPTOPHAN; HEALTH; TISSUE; RATES	Recent research indicates that suicide rates are elevated in those living at higher altitudes in both the United States and South Korea. A possible mechanism that was proposed is metabolic stress associated with hypoxia. This commentary discusses these results, and also the association between elevated suicide rates and other conditions associated with hypoxia (smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma). Tryptophan hydroxylase may not normally be saturated with oxygen, so mild hypoxia would decrease serotonin synthesis. Low brain serotonin is known to be associated with suicide. Thus, the commentary proposes and discusses the hypothesis that decreased brain serotonin synthesis associated with hypoxia is a mechanism that may contribute to suicide in conditions causing hypoxia. Finally the commentary proposes various studies that could test aspects of this hypothesis.

In order to understand how the human brain gives rise to the perception of figures, we here review experiments that explore the links between activity in visual cortex and performance of perceptual tasks related to figure perception. We organize our review according to a proposed model that attempts to contextualize figure processing within the more general framework of object processing in the brain. Overall, the current literature provides us with individual linking hypotheses as to cortical regions that are necessary for particular tasks related to figure perception. Attempts to reach a more complete understanding of how the brain instantiates figure and object perception, however, will have to consider the temporal interaction between the many regions involved, the details of which may vary widely across different tasks.

Nevertheless, the exact interrelationship between reduced HC volume and HC-vmPFC connectivity deficits in the context of stress has yet to be established. Furthermore, it is still not clear whether such neural abnormalities are stress induced or precursors for vulnerability. In this study, we combined measurements of MRI, functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to prospectively study 33 a priori healthy Israeli soldiers both pre- and post-exposure to stress during their military service. Thus, we were able to assess the contributions of structural and functional features of the HC and its connectivity to the onset and progression of maladaptive response to stress (i.e., increased PTSD symptoms post-exposure). We found that soldiers with decreased HC volume following military service (i.e., post-exposure) displayed more PTSD-related symptoms post-exposure as well as reduced HC-vmPFC functional and structural connectivity post-exposure, compared to soldiers with increased HC volume following military service. In contrast, initial smaller HC volume pre-exposure did not have an effect on any of these factors. Our results therefore suggest that reduction in HC volume and connectivity with the vmPFC together mark a maladaptive response to stressful military service. As stress-induced HC volume reductions were previously shown to be reversible, these localized biological markers may carry valuable therapeutic potential. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2808-2816, 2013.

BOLD responses were acquired in 10 young healthy subjects who were trained on an explicitly known 5-item sequence using their left nondominant hand, scanned at 9:00 pm while performing that same task and then were retested and scanned 12 h later after a night of sleep during which polysomnographic measures were recorded. An automatic algorithm was used to detect sleep spindles and to quantify their characteristics (i.e., density, amplitude, and duration). Analyses revealed significant positive correlations between gains in performance and the amplitude of spindles. Moreover, significant increases in BOLD signal were observed in several motor-related areas, most of which were localized in the right hemisphere, particularly in the right cortico-striatal system. Such increases in BOLD signal also correlated positively with the amplitude of spindles at several derivations. Taken together, our results show that sleep spindles predict neural and behavioral changes in overnight motor sequence consolidation. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2918-2928, 2013.

While many of these patients are nonverbal at some point during their stay, there are few valid tools available to assess pain in this group. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the validity and clinical utility of two pain assessment tools, the revised Adult Non-Verbal Pain Scale (NVPS-R) and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT), in a trauma and neurosurgical patient population. METHODS: Patients were assessed using the NVPS-R and CPOT by trained intensive care unit nurses (n=23) and research assistants before, during and after two procedures: turning of the patient (nociceptive procedure) and noninvasive blood pressure cuff inflation (non-nociceptive procedure). Communicative patients were also asked to report their level of pain during each assessment. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients (34 communicative, 32 noncommunicative) were included in the study. CPOT and NVPS-R scores increased significantly when participants were exposed to turning, but not during noninvasive blood pressure measurement (repeated measures ANOVA: CPOT, F=5.81, P=0.019; NVPS-R, F=5.32, P=0.025) supporting discriminant validity. CPOT and NVPS-R scores were significantly higher during the turning procedure for patients who had indicated that they were in pain versus those who were not, indicating criterion validity. Inter-rater reliability was generally higher for the CPOT than NVPS-R. Nurses rated the feasibility of the two tools as comparable but provided higher ratings of acceptability for the CPOT. CONCLUSIONS: While the present study supports the use of the CPOT and the NVPS-R with critically ill trauma and neurosurgical patients, further research should explore the role of vital signs in pain.

Aim: To compare total brain volumes and region-specific cortical measurements between young adults with mild-moderate perinatal HIE and a healthy control group of the same age. Methods: MR imaging was performed in a cohort of 14 young adults (9 males, 5 females) with a history of mild or moderate perinatal HIE. The control group consisted of healthy participants, matched with HIE group by age and gender. Volumetric analysis was done after the processing of MR images using a fully automated CIVET pipeline. We measured gyrification indexes, total brain volume, volume of grey and white matter, and of cerebrospinal fluid. We also measured volume, thickness and area of the cerebral cortex in the parietal, occipital, frontal, and temporal lobe, and of the isthmus cinguli, parahippocampal and cingulated gyrus, and insula. Results: The HIE patient group showed smaller absolute volumetric data. Statistically significant ( p <0.05) reductions of gyrification index in the right hemisphere, of cortical areas in the right temporal lobe and parahippocampal gyrus, of cortical volumes in the right temporal lobe and of cortical thickness in the right isthmus of the cingulate gyrus were found. Comparison between the healthy group and the HIE group of the same gender showed statistically significant changes in the male HIE patients, where a significant reduction was found in whole brain volume; left parietal, bilateral temporal, and right parahippocampal gyrus cortical areas; and bilateral temporal lobe cortical volume. Conclusions: Our analysis of total brain volumes and region-specific corticometric parameters suggests that mild-moderate forms of perinatal HIE lead to reductions in whole brain volumes. In the study reductions were most pronounced in temporal lobe and parahippocampal gyrus. (C) 2013 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Semantic violations elicited N400s in all three groups, whereas syntactic word-order violations elicited LAN/P600 responses in the Ll and 12 Advanced groups, but not the L2 Low group. Indeed, the LAN and P600 responses were statistically indistinguishable between the Ll and 12 Advanced groups. The results support and extend previous findings. Consistent with previous research, the results suggest that L2 semantic processing always depends on Ll-like neurocognitive mechanisms, whereas 12 syntactic processing initially differs from Ll, but can shift to native-like processes with sufficient proficiency or exposure, and perhaps with immersion experience in particular. The findings further demonstrate that substantial native-like brain processing of syntax can be achieved even by typical university foreign-language learners. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is suggested that somatosensory afferents inform the brain about the deviation (P) of body segments from the centrally set referent position. To perceive the actual position (Q) of body segments and form the position sense (PS), the central and afferent signals are combined: Q=R+P. In previous studies, the R has been shown to remain invariant during involuntary changes in the wrist position elicited by sudden unloading of muscles, suggesting that only the afferent component is responsible for the PS during this reflex. In contrast, the central PS component, R, is predominantly responsible for PS during intentional motion in isotonic conditions. We tested the hypothesis that the R and P are interchangeable PS components such that involuntary changes in wrist position elicited by the unloading reflex can easily be reproduced by making intentional changes in wrist position in isotonic conditions, in the absence of vision. The PS rule also suggests that PS is independent of sense of effort, which was tested by asking subjects to reproduce elbow joint angles under different constant loads. We also tested the hypothesis that tendon vibration may elicit motion that may not be perceived by subjects (no-motion illusion). These hypotheses were confirmed in three experiments. It is concluded that the R and P are additive components of PS and that, contrary to the conventional view, PS is independent of the sense of effort or efference copy. The PS rule also explains kinesthetic illusions and the phantom limb phenomenon. This study advances the understanding of action perception coupling in kinesthesia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We focused on even-trelated potentials (ERPs) during the retention interval and revealed a sustained fronto-central ERP component (most likely a sustained anterior negativity; SAN) that became more negative as memory load increased. Our results are consistent with recent ERP studies on the retention of pitch and suggest that the SAN reflects brain activity mediating the low-level retention of basic acoustic features in ASTM. The present work shows that the retention of timbre shares common features with the retention of pitch, hence supporting the notion that the retention of basic sensory features is an active process that recruits modality-specific brain areas.

The visual stimuli yielded a sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), suggesting that the maintenance of sequences of coloured stimuli engaged structures similar to those involved in the maintenance of simultaneous visual displays. On the other hand, maintenance of acoustic sequences produced a sustained negativity at fronto-central sites. This component is named the Sustained Anterior Negativity (SAN). The amplitude of the SAN increased with increasing load in ASTM and predicted individual differences in the performance. There was no SAN in a control condition with the same auditory stimuli but no memory task, nor one associated with visual memory. These results suggest that the SAN is an index of brain activity related to the maintenance of representations in ASTM that is distinct from the maintenance of representations in VSTM.

In this study, we investigated the accuracy and reproducibility of short-TE MRS measurements of GABA at 3T using both simulations and experiments. LCModel analysis was performed on a large number of simulated spectra with known metabolite input concentrations. Simulated spectra were generated using a range of spectral linewidths and signal-to-noise ratios to investigate the effect of varying experimental conditions, and analyses were performed using two different baseline models to investigate the effect of an inaccurate baseline model on GABA quantification. The results of these analyses indicated that, under experimental conditions corresponding to those typically observed in the occipital cortex, GABA concentration estimates are reproducible (mean reproducibility error, <20%), even when an incorrect baseline model is used. However, simulations indicate that the accuracy of GABA concentration estimates depends strongly on the experimental conditions (linewidth and signal-to-noise ratio). In addition to simulations, in vivo GABA measurements were performed using both spectral editing and short-TE MRS in the occipital cortex of 14 healthy volunteers. Short-TE MRS measurements of GABA exhibited a significant positive correlation with edited GABA measurements (R=0.58, p<0.05), suggesting that short-TE measurements of GABA correspond well with measurements made using spectral editing techniques. Finally, within-session reproducibility was assessed in the same 14 subjects using four consecutive short-TE GABA measurements in the occipital cortex. Across all subjects, the average coefficient of variation of these four GABA measurements was 8.7 +/- 4.9%. This study demonstrates that, under some experimental conditions, short-TE MRS can be employed for the reproducible detection of GABA at 3T, but that the technique should be used with caution, as the results are dependent on the experimental conditions.

MethodsmiR-155 expression levels were measured in CD14(+) monocytes from untreated relapsing-remitting MS patients and compared to healthy controls. Similar microRNA (miRNA) analyses were performed in laser-captured CD68(+) cells from perivascular (blood-derived macrophages) and parenchymal (microglia) brain regions in both active MS lesions and noninflammatory cases. Using human adult blood-derived macrophages and brain-derived microglia, in vitro experiments were performed to demonstrate how miR-155 influences the polarization state, phenotype, and functional properties of myeloid cells, in addition to their ability to subsequently impact adaptive T-cell responses. ResultsIn MS, miR-155 expression was significantly increased in both peripheral circulating CD14(+) monocytes and active lesions (CD68(+) cells) compared to control donor monocytes and parenchymal microglia, respectively. In vitro, miR-155 was significantly increased in both M1-polarized primary human macrophages and microglia. Transfection of an miR-155 mimic increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion and costimulatory surface marker expression in both cell types; an miR-155 inhibitor decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression. Coculture experiments demonstrated that allogeneic T-cell responses were significantly enhanced in the presence of miR-155-transfected myeloid cells compared to controls. InterpretationOur results demonstrate that miR-155 regulates proinflammatory responses in both blood-derived and central nervous system (CNS)-resident myeloid cells, in addition to impacting subsequent adaptive immune responses. Differential miRNA expression may therefore provide insight into mechanisms responsible for distinct phenotypic and functional properties of myeloid cells, thus impacting their ability to influence CNS injury and repair.

In this theoretical article, we review the allostatic load model representing the "wear and tear" that chronic stress exacts on the brain and body. We propose an innovative way of monitoring physical and psychiatric comorbidities by integrating the allostatic load model into clinical practice. By interpreting peripheral biomarkers differently, medical professionals can calculate a simple, count-based, allostatic load index known to predict diverse stress-related pathologies. In addition to screening for comorbidities, allostatic load indices can be used to monitor the effects of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. This framework can also be used to generate a dialogue between patient and practitioner to promote preventive and proactive approaches to health care.

Estradiol and striatal dopamine receptor antagonism influence memory system bias in the female rat	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Estrogen; Nucleus accumbens; SCH23390; Raclopride; Response memory; Place memory	CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; OVARIECTOMIZED RATS; LATENT INHIBITION; ESTROUS-CYCLE; HIPPOCAMPUS; PLACE; PROGESTERONE; 17-BETA-ESTRADIOL; MICRODIALYSIS; INACTIVATION	Estradiol (E2) has been shown to influence learning and memory systems used by female rats to find a reward. Rats with high levels of E2 tend to use allocentric, or place, memory while rats with low levels of E2 use egocentric, or response, memory. It has been shown that systemic dopamine receptor antagonism interacts with E2 to affect which memory system is used. Here, dopamine antagonists were administered directly into either the dorsal striatum or nucleus accumbens to determine where in the brain this interaction takes place. Seventy-four young adult, female, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained and tested in a modified plus-maze. All rats were ovariectomized, received a subcutaneous low E2 implant, and were implanted with bilateral cannulae into either the dorsal striatum or the nucleus accumbens. Additionally, high E2 rats received daily injections of E2 in a sesame oil solution while low E2 rats received daily injections of vehicle. After reaching criterion levels of performance in a plus-maze task, rats were administered microinjections of either a dopamine D1 receptor (SCH 23390; 0.1 mu g/ml and 0.01 mu g/ml) or D2 receptor (raclopride; 2 mu g/ml and 0.5 mu g/ml) antagonist or a vehicle control (saline) in a counterbalanced manner. High E2 rats exhibited a trend towards a place memory bias while low E2 rats showed a response memory bias. Dorsal striatal administration of a D1, but not D2, dopamine receptor antagonist caused a switch in the memory system used by both high and low E rats. There was no significant effect of dopamine receptor antagonism in the nucleus accumbens group. Thus, E2 determined which memory system controlled behavior in a plus-maze task. Moreover, this effect was modulated by dopamine D1R antagonism in the dorsal but not ventral striatum suggesting that memory systems are, in part, mediated by E2 and dopamine in this region.

More recently, continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) of the visual cortex has been found to improve contrast sensitivity in observers with normal vision. Objective/Hypothesis: The aims of this study were to assess whether cTBS of the visual cortex could improve contrast sensitivity in adults with amblyopia and whether repeated sessions of cTBS would lead to more pronounced and/or longer lasting effects. Methods: cTBS was delivered to the visual cortex while patients viewed a high contrast stimulus with their non-amblyopic eye. This manipulation was designed to bias the effects of cTBS toward inputs from the amblyopic eye. Contrast sensitivity was measured before and after stimulation. The effects of one cTBS session were measured in five patients and the effects of five consecutive daily sessions were measured in four patients. Three patients were available for follow-up at varying intervals after the final session. Results: cTBS improved amblyopic eye contrast sensitivity to high spatial frequencies (P < 0.05) and there was a cumulative improvement across sessions with asymptotic improvement occurring after 2 daily sessions of stimulation. The contrast sensitivity improvements were stable over a period of up to 78 days. Conclusions: These initial results in a small number of patients indicate the cTBS may allow for enduring visual function improvements in adults with amblyopia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Urinary Metabolites of Organophosphate and Pyrethroid Pesticides and Behavioral Problems in Canadian Children	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							MEXICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; UNITED-STATES; US CHILDREN; NEURODEVELOPMENT; DELTAMETHRIN; INSECTICIDE; STRENGTHS	BACKGROUND: Exposure to organophosphate pesticides has been associated with neurobehavioral deficits in children, although data on low levels of exposure experienced by the general population are sparse. Pyrethroids are insecticides rapidly gaining popularity, and epidemiological evidence on their potential effects is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between exposure to organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides, indicated by urinary metabolites, and parentally reported behavioral problems in children. METHODS: We used data on children 6-11 years of age from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2007-2009). We used logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for high scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which may indicate behavioral problems, in association with concentrations of pyrethroid and organophosphate metabolites in the urine of 779 children, adjusting for covariates (sex, age, race/ethnicity, income, parental education, blood lead levels, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and others). RESULTS: At least one urinary metabolite for organophosphates was detected in 91% of children, and for pyrethroids in 97% of children. Organophosphate metabolites were not significantly associated with high SDQ scores. The pyrethroid metabolite cis-DCCA [3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylycyclopropane carboxylic acid] was significantly associated with high scores for total difficulties on the SDQ (OR for a 10-fold increase = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.6), and there was a nonsignificant association with trans-DCCA (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 0.9, 3.0). CONCLUSION: In contrast with previous studies, we did not observe an association between exposure to organophosphate pesticides and behavioral scores in children. However, some pyrethroid urinary metabolites were associated with a high level of parent-reported behavioral problems. Longitudinal studies should be conducted on the potential risks of pyrethroids.

Yet, little is known about the landscape of this knowledge and how and where it is evolving. This paper provides a bibliometric assessment of mental health research (MHR) outputs from 1980 to 2011. MHR papers were retrieved using three strategies: from key mental health journals; using US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords; and from additional journals in which mental health topics accounted for over 75% of papers. The number of papers per year increased over time in absolute terms and as a proportion of total medical output. The US's proportion of world publication output dropped from 60% in 1980 to 42% in 2011, while the EU increased its share from 27% to 40%. Countries with greater research intensity in mental health generally had higher citation impact, such as the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands. MHR also became more collaborative: 3% of all MHR papers published in 1980 were the result of international collaboration compared to 22% in 2011. We conclude by noting that the rise in MHR appears to be due to funding and that bibliometrics can help highlight the potential drivers of variation in performance of MHR systems. The paper provides an analytical basis for benchmarking MHR trends in the future. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bergeron, S; Rompre, PP				Bergeron, Sabrina; Rompre, Pierre-Paul			Blockade of ventral midbrain NMDA receptors enhances brain stimulation reward: A preferential role for GluN2A subunits	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Glutamate; GluN2A; GluN2B; NMDA; Reward; Ventral midbrain	AMINO-ACID RECEPTORS; TEGMENTAL AREA; SELF-STIMULATION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINE NEURONS; POSTERIOR MESENCEPHALON; DIZOCILPINE MK-801; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PHENCYCLIDINE PCP; ANTAGONIST MK-801	Ventral midbrain (VM) neurons that project to limbic structures play a rote in reward and incentive motivation. It has been suggested that a reward-related signal is transmitted when the firing rate of VM dopamine neurons shifts from a tonic to a phasic mode. Since glutamate is necessary for this transduction process, it is likely to play a role in reward signaling. This study was aimed at determining the effect of VM N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade on reward induced by electrical brain stimulation. Experiments were performed on rats trained to self-administer an electrical stimulation in the medial posterior mesencephalon. Reward thresholds were measured with the curve-shift paradigm before and after bilateral VM injections of the following NMDA receptor antagonists: R-CPP, 3-(R-2-Carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1 phosphonic acid, (0, 20.6, 41.2 and 82.5 pmol/0.5 mu l/side), PPPA, (2R,4S)-4-(3-Phosphonopropyl)-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid, (0, 0.825 and 1.65 nmol/0.5 mu l/side) orRo04-5595, 1-[2-(4-Chlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrqahydro-6-methoxy2-methyl-7-isoquinolinol hydrochloride (0, 0.825, 1.65 nmol/0.5 mu l/side). R-CPP and PPPA produced a dose and time dependent decrease in reward threshold, an effect that was, at some doses and times after the injection, accompanied by an increase in maximum responses. These effects were not observed with Ro04-5595 over the range of doses tested. While previous studies suggest a role for glutamate in reward signaling, the present results show that VM glutamate exerts a tonic inhibition on the reward-relevant pathway. The selectivity of Ro04-5595 for NMDA receptors composed of GluN2B subunits and the higher affinity of R-CPP and PPPA for GluN2A suggest that the inhibition is mediated by receptors composed of GluN2A subunits.

PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Intranasal oxytocin; Tend-and-befriend; Social rejection; Yale Interpersonal Stressor; Negative mood; Trust, Self-perception	INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; HUMANS; CORTISOL; VASOPRESSIN; REJECTION; STUDENTS; BRAIN	Introduction: Recent evidence suggests that oxytocin, a nonapeptide posited to underlie the affiliation-related "tend-and-befriend" behavioral response to stress (Taylor et al., 2000), may improve interpersonal functioning by facilitating the acquisition of social support during times of distress. The assertion, however, has not been explicitly tested in humans. Thus, we examined whether the effect of oxytocin on self-perceived trust is magnified in individuals who experienced higher ratings of negative mood following social rejection. Method: In a double-blind experiment, 100 students (50 female) were subject to a live social rejection paradigm following random assignment to either a 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo administration. Mood and self-perceived trust were measured following social rejection. Results: Multiple regression and simple slope analysis revealed that oxytocin administration increased self-perceived trust relative to placebo in participants reporting a negative mood response following social rejection [b = 4.245, t(96) = 3.10, p= .003], but not in those whose mood state was euthymic. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that oxytocin may promote the acquisition of social support in times of distress by increasing self-perceived trust. The findings provide empirical support that oxytocin promotes an affiliation-related behavioral response to stress, consistent with the tend-and-befriend theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe a nanosensor for caspase-1 ratiometric measurements, consisting of a rhodamine-labeled, caspase-1 cleavable peptide linked to quantum dots (QDs). Microglia cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by hybrid nanoparticles LPS-QDs. These stimuli activated caspase-1 in microglia monolayers and in the mouse brain, while a selected caspase inhibitor markedly reduced it. LPS-QDs entered into the lysosomal compartment and led to an enlargement of these cellular organelles in the exposed microglia. Both lysosomal swelling and mitochondrial impairment contributed to caspase-1 activation and to the consequent interleukin-1 beta release. The results from these studies highlight how the unique properties of QDs can be used to create versatile biotools in the study of inflammation in real time in vivo.

J	Phan, P; Mezghani, N; Wai, EK; de Guise, J; Labelle, H				Phan, Philippe; Mezghani, Neila; Wai, Eugene K.; de Guise, Jacques; Labelle, Hubert			Artificial neural networks assessing adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: comparison with Lenke classification	SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Surgical treatment; Lenke classification; Neural networks; Kohonen self-organizing maps	RADIOGRAPHS	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Variability in classifying and selecting levels of fusion in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) has been repeatedly documented. Several computer algorithms have been used to classify AIS based on the geometrical features, but none have attempted to analyze its treatment patterns. PURPOSE: To use self-organizing maps (SOM), a kind of artificial neural networks, to reliably classify AIS cases from a large database. To analyze surgeon's treatment pattern in selecting curve regions to fuse in AIS using Lenke classification and SOM. STUDY DESIGN: This is a technical concept article on the possibility and benefits of using neural networks to classify AIS and a retrospective analysis of AIS curve regions selected for fusion. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 1,776 patients surgically treated for AIS were prospectively enrolled in a multicentric database. Cobb angles were measured on AIS patient spine radiographies, and patients were classified according to Lenke classification. OUTCOME MEASURES: For each patient in the database, surgical approach and levels of fusion selected by the treating surgeon were recorded. METHODS: A Kohonen SOM was generated using 1,776 surgically treated AIS cases. The quality of the SOM was tested using topological error. Percentages of prediction of fusion based on Lenke classification for each patient in the database and for each node in the SOM were calculated. Lenke curve types, treatment pattern, and kappa statistics for agreement between fusion realized and fusion recommended by Lenke classification were plotted on each node of the map. RESULTS: The topographic error for the SOM generated was 0.02, which demonstrates high accuracy. The SOM differentiates clear clusters of curve type nodes on the map. The SOM also shows epicenters for main thoracic, double thoracic, and thoracolumbar/lumbar curve types and transition zones between clusters. When cases are taken individually, Lenke classification predicted curve regions fused by the surgeon in 46% of cases. When those cases are reorganized by the SOM into nodes, Lenke classification predicted the curve regions to fuse in 82% of the nodes. Agreement with Lenke classification principles was high in epicenters for curve types 1, 2, and 5, moderate in cluster for curve types 3, 4, and 6, and low in transition zones between curve types. CONCLUSIONS: An AIS SOM with high accuracy was successfully generated. Lenke classification principles are followed in 46% of the cases but in 82% of the nodes on the SOM. The SOM highlights the tendency of surgeons to follow Lenke classification principles for similar curves on the SOM. Self-organizing map classification of AIS could be valuable to surgeons because it bypasses the limitations imposed by rigid classification such as cutoff values on Cobb angle to define curve types. It can extract similar cases from large databases to analyze and guide treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The cytosolic E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase PARK2 cooperates with the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 to maintain mitochondrial quality. A loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential () leads to the PINK1-dependent recruitment of PARK2 to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), followed by the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of OMM proteins, and by the autophagy-dependent clearance of mitochondrial remnants. We showed here that blockade of mitochondrial protein import triggers the recruitment of PARK2, by PINK1, to the TOMM machinery. PD-causing PARK2 mutations weakened or disrupted the molecular interaction between PARK2 and specific TOMM subunits: the surface receptor, TOMM70A, and the channel protein, TOMM40. The downregulation of TOMM40 or its associated core subunit, TOMM22, was sufficient to trigger OMM protein clearance in the absence of PINK1 or PARK2. However, PARK2 was required to promote the degradation of whole organelles by autophagy. Furthermore, the overproduction of TOMM22 or TOMM40 reversed mitochondrial clearance promoted by PINK1 and PARK2 after loss. These results indicated that the TOMM machinery is a key molecular switch in the mitochondrial clearance program controlled by the PINK1-PARK2 pathway. Loss of functional coupling between mitochondrial protein import and the neuroprotective degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria may therefore be a primary pathogenic mechanism in autosomal recessive PD.

Although the biology of Ps-n has been investigated intensely, the characterization of the genes and biochemical pathways leading to domoic acid biosynthesis has been limited. To identify transcripts whose levels correlate with domoic acid production, we analyzed Ps-n under conditions of high and low domoic acid production by cDNA microarray technology and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) methods. Our goals included identifying and validating robust reference genes for Ps-n RNA expression analysis under these conditions. Results: Through microarray analysis of exponential-and stationary-phase cultures with low and high domoic acid production, respectively, we identified candidate reference genes whose transcripts did not vary across conditions. We tested eleven potential reference genes for stability using RT-qPCR and GeNorm analyses. Our results indicated that transcripts encoding JmjC, dynein, and histone H3 proteins were the most suitable for normalization of expression data under conditions of silicon-limitation, in late-exponential through stationary phase. The microarray studies identified a number of genes that were up-and down-regulated under toxin-producing conditions. RT-qPCR analysis, using the validated controls, confirmed the up-regulation of transcripts predicted to encode a cycloisomerase, an SLC6 transporter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glutamate dehydrogenase, a small heat shock protein, and an aldo-keto reductase, as well as the down-regulation of a transcript encoding a fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-c binding protein, under these conditions. Conclusion: Our results provide a strong basis for further studies of RNA expression levels in Ps-n, which will contribute to our understanding of genes involved in the production and release of domoic acid, an important neurotoxin that affects human health as well as ecosystem function.

A.; Levental, Mark			The Usefulness of Gadolinium-Enhanced Images on a Follow-up Magnetic Resonance Image in Suspected Multiple Sclerosis	CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF RADIOLOGISTS JOURNAL-JOURNAL DE L ASSOCIATION CANADIENNE DES RADIOLOGISTES			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Gadolinium; Multiple sclerosis; Clinically isolated syndrome	CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; MCDONALD CRITERIA; CONVERSION; GUIDELINES; DEFINITE; MRI	Purpose: Multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria include the presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions when determining dissemination in space and time. Gadolinium is expensive, increases scan time and patient discomfort, and can, rarely, cause serious adverse effects. Our objective was to determine the usefulness of including gadolinium-enhanced images as part of a follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome. Methods: Consecutive patients seen between 2008 and 2010 with a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis were prospectively enrolled, had a non gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI, and consented to a follow-up gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI. The primary outcome was a comparison of the number of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis compared with the number who would have been diagnosed without the gadolinium-enhanced images. Results: Twenty-one patients enrolled, and 2 withdrew. Follow-up MRIs were performed a median of 241 days after the initial MRI. Eleven patients met the primary outcome and were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis: 6 as a result of a second clinical attack and 5 by using imaging criteria for dissemination in space and time. If the gadolinium-enhanced images had not been obtained, then there would have been no change in the primary outcome. Conclusions: In Canadian centers with similar MRI waiting times to those in our study, the routine use of gadolinium as part of a follow-up MRI in patients with suspected multiple sclerosis may not be clinically useful. Gadolinium-enhanced images could still be obtained on an as-needed basis for specific clinical indications.	[Moore, Fraser G.

We reviewed 9 synovial sarcomas affecting peripheral nerve diagnosed by neuropathologists and explored the morphologic and immunohistochemical differences between these and MPNST. Our goal was to make practical recommendations for neuropathologists regarding which spindle cell tumors affecting nerve should be sent for SYT-SSX testing. Methods: Clinical records and genetics were reviewed retrospectively and central pathology review of 9 synovial sarcomas and 6 MPNST included immunohistochemistry for SOX10, S100, BAF47, CK (lmw, pan, CK7, CK19), EMA, CD34, bcl2, CD99, and neurofilament. Results: Common synovial sarcoma sites were brachial plexus, spinal and femoral nerve, none were "intra-neural", all had the SYT-SSX1 translocation, and 6/9 were monophasic with myxoid stroma and distinct collagen. Half of the monophasic synovial sarcomas expressed CK7, CK19 or panCK in a "rare positive cells pattern", 8/9 (89%) expressed EMA, and all were SOX10 immunonegative with reduced but variable BAF47 expression. Conclusions: We recommend that upon encountering a cellular spindle cell tumor affecting nerve neuropathologists consider the following: 1) SYT-SSX testing should be performed on any case with morphology suspicious for monophasic synovial sarcoma including wiry or thick bands of collagen and relatively monomorphous nuclei; 2) neuropathologists should employ a screening immunohistochemical panel including one of CK7, panCK or CK19, plus EMA, S100 and SOX10, and 3) SYT-SSX testing should be performed on any spindle cell tumor with CK and/or EMA immunopositivity if SOX10 immunostaining is negative or only labels entrapped nerve elements.

Much of the ethics discussion arises in the tension between the principle of not doing harm (principle of non-maleficence) in this vulnerable population and the development of effective treatments (principle of beneficence).Autonomy and capacity issues are also numerous, wide-ranging, and concern (1) day to day affairs such as driving safely and spending money wisely, (2) life-time events such as designating a legal representative in case of incapacity, making a will, (3) consenting to treatment and diagnostic procedures, (4) participating in research. The latter issue is particularly thorny and illustrates well the complexity of tackling concerns related to capacity. The impetus to protect AD patients has partly led to ethics regulation and policies making research on inapt patients more difficult because of stringent requirements for signed informed consent or for showing the value of the research to this specific patient population. New issues are arising that relate to earlier diagnosis using biomarkers and (possibly soon) the use of drugs that modify disease progression. We here summarize and discuss the different ethical issues associated with AD from a historical perspective, with emphasis on diagnostic and treatments issues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Coutaud, B; Pilon, N				Coutaud, Baptiste; Pilon, Nicolas			Characterization of a Novel Transgenic Mouse Line Expressing Cre Recombinase Under the Control of the Cdx2 Neural Specific Enhancer	GENESIS			English	Article						Cre recombinase; Cdx2; neural specific enhancer; posterior neural plate; neural tube; neural crest cells	GENE-EXPRESSION; CAUDAL GENE; GASTRULATION; WNT; PROTEIN; HINDBRAIN; IDENTITY; PATTERN; EMBRYO; CELLS	Several genetically modified mouse models have been generated in order to drive expression of the Cre recombinase in the neuroectoderm. However, none of them specifically targets the posterior neural plate during neurulation. To fill this gap, we have generated a new transgenic mouse line in which Cre expression is controlled by a neural specific enhancer (NSE) from the Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) locus. Analyses of Cre activity via breeding with R26R-YFP reporter mice have indicated that the Cdx2NSE-Cre mouse line allows for recombination of LoxP sites in most cells of the posterior neural plate as soon as from the head fold stage. Detailed examination of double-transgenic embryos has revealed that this novel Cre-driver line allows targeting the entire posterior neural tube with an anterior limit in the caudal hindbrain. Of note, the Cdx2NSE regulatory sequences direct Cre expression along the whole dorso-ventral axis (including pre-migratory neural crest cells) and, accordingly, YFP fluorescence has been also observed in multiple non-cranial neural crest derivatives of double-transgenic embryos. Therefore, we believe that the Cdx2NSE-Cre mouse line represents an important novel genetic tool for the study of early events occurring in the caudal neuroectoderm during the formation of both the central and the peripheral nervous systems. genesis 51:777-784.

The role of dispositional empathy has been extensively studied in this research, but several other individual factors fundamental to communication processes have been largely ignored. We studied the effects of dispositional expressiveness in chronic back pain patients to determine if the decoding of communicative and noncommunicative information signaling pain in others would be enhanced in individuals displaying a spontaneous propensity to consistently express more pain during a behavioral-observational naturalistic standardized lifting task performed on 2 separate occasions. Blood oxygenation level dependent signal change was measured in response to pictures showing facial pain expressions and hands/feet in pain-evoking situations in chronic back pain patients and healthy controls. Vicarious brain responses to others' pain were comparable between groups. However, more expressive patients rated others' pain higher and showed stronger vicarious pain responses in the right ventral part of the inferior frontal gyrus, the right insula, and the midbrain. Activity in the right insula correlated positively with both the patients' expressiveness (encoding) and the intensity of the pain perceived in the images (decoding), suggesting that this structure linked the dispositional expressiveness with vicarious pain perception. Importantly, these effects were independent from dispositional empathy and were found with both communicative (facial expression) and noncommunicative (hand and foot) cues. These results suggest that dispositional expressiveness is a self-related factor that facilitates vicarious pain processing and might reflect individual tendencies to rely on social coping strategies. Perspective: This article shows that pain expressivity in chronic pain patients increased the vicarious brain responses and the sensibility to others' pain. These results may help provide empirical support for better defining models of pain communication in chronic pain patients.

We exposed healthy participants to specific parts of facial pain expressions in order to investigate which components are required to induce this modulation. We created 2 classes of stimuli: one containing the most useful information for identification of pain expressions (diagnostic) and one containing the least useful information (antidiagnostic). Twenty-eight normal volunteers received electrical stimulation of the sural nerve immediately after they viewed these stimuli. Subjective ratings (intensity and unpleasantness) as well as the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) evoked by the shock were recorded. Results show that diagnostic stimuli lead to higher subjective ratings of shock pain than the antidiagnostic stimuli, but the stimuli classes had no significant impact on the N FR. A control experiment showed that our facial stimuli were given very low valence and arousal ratings compared to stimuli previously used to demonstrate the effect of emotional pictures on pain. Thus, the results are unlikely to be explained by emotions felt by the observer and suggest a vicarious facilitation of supraspinal pain processing induced by key features underlying pain expressions recognition. Results provide further support to the perception-action model of empathy. Perspective: This study demonstrates that visual features that are efficiently used for the recognition of pain expressions are sufficient to induce a vicarious facilitation of self-pain. Supraspinal pain responses were modulated by the informativeness of the areas of the pain expressions that participants viewed prior to the painful stimulations.

Psychosocial stress in pregnancy and preterm birth: associations and mechanisms	JOURNAL OF PERINATAL MEDICINE			English	Review						Corticotropin-releasing hormone; gestation; inflammation; pregnancy; preterm birth; psychosocial stress; vagus nerve	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; PRENATAL MATERNAL STRESS; INTRAUTERINE GROWTH-RETARDATION; LIFE EVENTS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; GESTATIONAL-AGE; RISK-FACTORS; VAGUS NERVE; SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES	Aims: Psychosocial stress during pregnancy (PSP) is a risk factor of growing interest in the etiology of preterm birth (PTB). This literature review assesses the published evidence concerning the association between PSP and PTB, highlighting established and hypothesized physiological pathways mediating this association. Method: The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the keywords "psychosocial stress", "pregnancy", "pregnancy stress", "preterm", "preterm birth", "gestational age", "anxiety", and "social support". After applying the exclusion criteria, the search produced 107 articles. Results: The association of PSP with PTB varied according to the dimensions and timing of PSP. Stronger associations were generally found in early pregnancy, and most studies demonstrating positive results found moderate effect sizes, with risk ratios between 1.2 and 2.1. Subjective perception of stress and pregnancy-related anxiety appeared to be the stress measures most closely associated with PTB. Potential physiological pathways identified included behavioral, infectious, neuroinflammatory, and neuroendocrine mechanisms. Conclusions: Future research should examine the biological pathways of these different psychosocial stress dimensions and at multiple time points across pregnancy. Culture-independent characterization of the vaginal microbiome and noninvasive monitoring of cholinergic activity represent two exciting frontiers in this research.

Reduced White Matter Integrity in Sibling Pairs Discordant for Bipolar Disorder	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RATING-SCALE; GENETIC RISK; HUMAN BRAIN; I DISORDER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ABNORMALITIES; INDIVIDUALS; RELIABILITY	Objective: Several lines of evidence indicate that white matter integrity is compromised in bipolar disorder, but the nature, extent, and biological causes remain elusive. To determine the extent to which white matter deficits in bipolar disorder are familial, the authors investigated white matter integrity in a large sample of bipolar patients, unaffected siblings, and healthy comparison subjects. Method: The authors collected diffusion imaging data for 64 adult bipolar patients, 60 unaffected siblings (including 54 discordant sibling pairs), and 46 demographically matched comparison subjects. Fractional anisotropy was compared between the groups using voxel-wise tract-based spatial statistics and by extracting mean fractional anisotropy from 10 regions of interest. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated between the sibling pairs as an index of familiality. Results: Widespread fractional anisotropy reductions in bipolar patients (>40,000 voxels) and more subtle reductions in their siblings, mainly restricted to the corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiations, and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (>2,000 voxels) were observed. Similarly, region-of-interest analysis revealed significant reductions in most white matter regions in patients. In siblings, fractional anisotropy in the posterior thalamic radiation and the forceps was nominally reduced. Significant between-sibling correlations were found for mean fractional anisotropy across the tract-based spatial statistic skeleton, within significant clusters, and within nearly all regions of interest. Conclusions: These findings emphasize the relevance of white matter to neuropathology and familiality of bipolar disorder and encourage further use of white matter integrity markers as endophenotypes in genetic studies.

Using a novel animal model of induced arterial stiffness combined with optical intrinsic signals and laser speckle imaging, resting state functional networks derived from hemodynamic signals are investigated for their modulation by isolated changes in stiffness of the right common carotid artery. By means of seed-based analysis, results showed a decreasing trend of homologous correlation in the motor and cingulate cortices. Furthermore, a graph analysis indicated a randomization of the cortex functional networks, suggesting a loss of connectivity, more specifically in the motor cortex lateral to the treated carotid, which however did not translate in differentiated metabolic activity.

Preference weights for chemotherapy side effects from the perspective of women with breast cancer	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Article						Standard gamble; Utility; Breast cancer; Chemotherapy	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; HEALTH STATE UTILITIES; UNITED-KINGDOM; RECEIVING END; PERCEPTION; TAMOXIFEN	Perceptions among women with breast cancer about the relative importance of different potential chemotherapy side effects is not well understood. A survey was performed by women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. Grade I/II (mild to moderate) and III/IV (moderate to severe) descriptions of nine common chemotherapy side effects were assigned preference weights using the standard gamble technique. For each hypothetical side effect, patients could choose to stay in the respective side effect state or take a gamble between full health (probability p) or being dead (1 - p). For each side effect, p was varied until the patient was indifferent between these options. The survey also included questions about the importance of survival, slowing cancer growth, and quality of life. This analysis included 69 patients; mean age 54 years (range 35-84), representing all cancer stages. Standard gamble preferences were lowest (i.e., least preferred) for grade III/IV nausea/vomiting (0.621), indicating that patients would, on average, risk a 38 % chance of being dead to avoid having grade III/IV nausea/vomiting for the rest of their lives. The next least preferred side effects were grade III/IV diarrhea (0.677) and grade III/IV sensory neuropathy (0.694). Survival appeared more important than slowing cancer growth and maintaining quality of life across cancer stages. Nevertheless, patients with advanced disease placed less importance on survival (p = 0.09) and higher importance on quality of life (p = 0.05). These standard gamble utilities provide unique insights into chemotherapy toxicities from the patient perspective. Differences in the relative importance of overall survival and quality of life with treatment existed between patients with different stages of disease. These studies should be expanded as the data may also be used to calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy in cost-effectiveness evaluations of breast cancer chemotherapies.

Recent post-mortem studies have shown that spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1), the key regulator of cellular polyamine content, is under-expressed in brains from suicide victims compared to controls. In our study we tested the effect of in vitro lithium treatment on SAT1 gene and protein expression in B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from bipolar disorder (BD) patients who committed suicide (and for which BLCLs were collected prior to their death), BD patients with high and low risk of suicide and a sample of non-psychiatric controls. Baseline mRNA levels were similar in the four groups of subjects (p>0.05). Lithium had no effect in suicide completers (p>0.05) while it significantly increased SAT1 expression in the high risk (p<0.001) and low risk (p<0.01) groups as well as in controls (p<0.001). Protein and mRNA levels were not correlated; lithium significantly reduced protein levels only in the control sample (p<0.05). Our findings suggest that SAT1 transcription is influenced by lithium and that this effect is altered in BD patients who completed suicide, further supporting a role for polyamines in suicide.

Inhibition of the Aplysia sensory neuron calcium current with dopamine and serotonin	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aplysia; calcium current; dopamine; nocioceptor; voltage-dependent inhibition	READILY RELEASABLE POOL; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; G-PROTEIN; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; DEPENDENT INHIBITION; INNERVATING TAIL; CA2+ CHANNELS; APL II; MODULATION	The inhibition of Aplysia pleural mechanosensory neuron synapses by dopamine and serotonin through activation of endogenous dopaminergic and expressed 5-HT1Apl(a)/b receptors, respectively, involves a reduction in action potential-associated calcium influx. We show that the inhibition of synaptic efficacy is downstream of the readily releasable pool, suggesting that inhibition is at the level of calcium secretion coupling, likely a result of the changes in the calcium current. Indeed, the inhibitory responses directly reduce a Ca(V)2-like calcium current in isolated sensory neurons. The inhibition of the calcium current is voltage independent as it is not affected by a strong depolarizing prepulse, consistent with other invertebrate Ca(V)2 calcium currents. Similar to voltage-independent inhibition of vertebrate nociceptors, inhibition was blocked with Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The data suggest a conserved mechanism by which G protein-coupled receptor activation can inhibit the Ca(V)2 calcium current in nociceptive neurons.

The effects of emotion on memory for music and vocalisations	MEMORY			English	Article						Music; Fear; Emotion; Memory; Vocal expressions	EXPRESSION; BRAIN; NEUROSCIENCE; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; AMYGDALA; TIMBRE	Music is a powerful tool for communicating emotions which can elicit memories through associative mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown whether emotion can modulate memory for music without reference to a context or personal event. We conducted three experiments to investigate the effect of basic emotions (fear, happiness, and sadness) on recognition memory for music, using short, novel stimuli explicitly created for research purposes, and compared them with nonlinguistic vocalisations. Results showed better memory accuracy for musical clips expressing fear and, to some extent, happiness. In the case of nonlinguistic vocalisations we confirmed a memory advantage for all emotions tested. A correlation between memory accuracy for music and vocalisations was also found, particularly in the case of fearful expressions. These results confirm that emotional expressions, particularly fearful ones, conveyed by music can influence memory as has been previously shown for other forms of expressions, such as faces and vocalisations.

N-Cadherin Relocalizes from the Periphery to the Center of the Synapse after Transient Synaptic Stimulation in Hippocampal Neurons	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STRUCTURED ILLUMINATION MICROSCOPY; AMPA RECEPTOR TRAFFICKING; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY; BETA-CATENIN; IN-VIVO; ADHESION; CELL; ORGANIZATION; PLASTICITY	N-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule which is enriched at synapses. Binding of N-cadherin molecules to each other across the synaptic cleft has been postulated to stabilize adhesion between the presynaptic bouton and the postsynaptic terminal. N-cadherin is also required for activity-induced changes at synapses, including hippocampal long term potentiation and activity-induced spine expansion and stabilization. We hypothesized that these activity-dependent changes might involve changes in N-cadherin localization within synapses. To determine whether synaptic activity changes the localization of N-cadherin, we used structured illumination microscopy, a superresolution approach which overcomes the conventional resolution limits of light microscopy, to visualize the localization of N-cadherin within synapses of hippocampal neurons. We found that synaptic N-cadherin exhibits a spectrum of localization patterns, ranging from puncta at the periphery of the synapse adjacent to the active zone to an even distribution along the synaptic cleft. Furthermore, the N-cadherin localization pattern within synapses changes during KCl depolarization and after transient synaptic stimulation. During KCl depolarization, N-cadherin relocalizes away from the central region of the synaptic cleft to the periphery of the synapse. In contrast, after transient synaptic stimulation with KCl followed by a period of rest in normal media, fewer synapses have N-cadherin present as puncta at the periphery and more synapses have N-cadherin present more centrally and uniformly along the synapse compared to unstimulated cells. This indicates that transient synaptic stimulation modulates N-cadherin localization within the synapse. These results bring new information to the structural organization and activity-induced changes occurring at synapses, and suggest that N-cadherin relocalization may contribute to activity dependent changes at synapses.

Moreover, approximately 50% of iRBD patients have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The purpose of our study was to investigate waking electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities specific to iRBD patients with MCI. Methods: Forty-two polysomnographically confirmed iRBD patients, including 23 iRBD [+]MCI patients 19 patients without MCI (iRBD [-]MCI), and 37 healthy subjects participated in the study. All participants underwent a complete neuropsychologic assessment for MCI diagnosis and a waking quantitative EEG recording. Results: iRBD [+]MCI patients had a higher slow-to-fast frequency ratio than iRBD [-] MCI patients and controls in the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. iRBD [+]MCI patients also had higher relative theta power in the parietal, temporal, and occipital regions and lower relative alpha power in the occipital region compared to iRBD [+]MCI patients and controls. Moreover, iRBD [+]MCI patients had higher relative theta power in the frontal and central areas and lower relative beta power in the central, parietal, and temporal regions compared to controls. The dominant occipital frequency also was slower in iRBD [+] MCI patients compared to controls. No between-group differences were observed between iRBD [-]MCI patients and controls. Conclusion: In iRBD patients, only those with concomitant MCI showed waking EEG slowing in the posterior cortical regions, providing a potential marker for an increased risk for developing DLB or PD.

However, the results have not been consistent and the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been elucidated. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate verbal and nonverbal cognition (using visuospatial processing tests) in patients treated with clozapine (initially treatment resistant) and those treated with other second-generation antipsychotics, relative healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we examined neural correlates of visuospatial processing in the three groups.Methods.Twenty schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine (TR-C group), 23 patients stabilised with atypical antipsychotics other than clozapine (NTR group), and 21 healthy control participants completed a battery of verbal and visuospatial cognitive tests. In addition, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing one of the visuospatial tests (the mental rotation task). The fMRI data were analysed separately in each group using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM5).Results.Overall, schizophrenia patients exhibited deficit on verbal and nonverbal processing relative to the healthy controls, but we observed some interesting differences between the two groups of patients. Specifically, the NTR group performed better than the TR-C group on the Block Design and the Raven's Progressive Matrices. With respect to brain function during mental rotation, the NTR group showed significant activations in regions of the temporal and occipital cortex, whereas the TR-C patients did not. The relative deactivations associated with the task were also more robust in NTR compared to the other group of patients, despite a similar performance.Conclusion.Present results suggest better visuospatial processing in the NTR relative to the TR-C group. This difference could be attributed to the treatment resistance itself or a lack of beneficial effect of clozapine relative to other atypical antipsychotics in ameliorating nonverbal abilities. Future studies of the relationship between clozapine and cognition, as well as between treatment resistance and cognition, are warranted.

This paper presents a bilateral model for the horizontal angular VOR in the dark based on realistic physiological mechanisms. It is shown that by assigning proper nonlinear neural computations at the premotor level, the model is capable of replicating target-distance-dependent VOR responses that are in agreement with geometrical requirements. Central premotor responses in the model are also shown to be consistent with experimental observations. Moreover, the model performance after simulated unilateral canal plugging also reproduces experimental observations, an emerging property. Such local nonlinear computations could similarly generate context-dependent behaviors in other more complex motor systems.

Relationship between Diet Quality and Cognition Depends on Socioeconomic Position in Healthy Older Adults.	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article							OCCUPATIONAL PRESTIGE; ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MRI MEASURES; BRAIN; LIFE; PATTERNS; PERFORMANCE; DEMENTIA; SCALE	Both diet quality and socioeconomic position (SEP) have been linked to age-related cognitive changes, but there is little understanding of how the socioeconomic context of dietary intake may shape its cognitive impact. We examined whether equal adherence to "prudent" and "Western" dietary patterns, identified by principal components analysis, was associated with global cognitive function [Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS)] in independently living older adults with different SEPs (aged 68-84 y; n = 1099). The interaction of dietary pattern adherence with household income, educational attainment, occupational prestige, and a composite indicator of SEP combining all 3 was examined in multiple-adjusted mixed models over 3 y of follow-up in participants of the Nu Age study (Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging). Adherence to the prudent pattern (vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, and lower-fat dairy products) was related to higher 3MS scores at recruitment only in the upper categories of income [parameter estimate (B): 0.56; 95% Cl: 0.11, 1.011, education (B: 0.44; 95% Cl: 0.080, 0.80), or composite SEP (B: 0.37; 95% Cl. 0.045, 0.70). High prudent pattern adherence was associated with less cognitive decline only in those with low composite SEP (B: 0.25; 95% Cl: 0.0094, 0.50). Conversely, adherence to the Western pattern (meats, potatoes, processed foods, and higher-fat dairy products) was associated with more cognitive decline (B: -0.23; 95% CI: -0.43, -0.032) only in those with low educational attainment. In summary, among individuals with equivalent diet quality, the magnitude and characteristics of the diet-cognition relationship depended on their socioeconomic circumstances. These results suggest that interventions promoting retention of cognitive function through improved diet quality would provide maximum benefit to those with relatively low SEP.

Recurrence patterns across medulloblastoma subgroups: an integrated clinical and molecular analysis	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							INTRATUMOR HETEROGENEITY; CHILDREN; DISTINCT; CANCER; CHEMOTHERAPY; ADOLESCENTS; ABERRATIONS; PROGRESSION; MUTATIONS; PROGNOSIS	Background Recurrent medulloblastoma is a therapeutic challenge because it is almost always fatal. Studies have confirmed that medulloblastoma consists of at least four distinct subgroups. We sought to delineate subgroup-specific differences in medulloblastoma recurrence patterns. Methods We retrospectively identified a discovery cohort of all recurrent medulloblastomas at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, ON, Canada) from 1994 to 2012 (cohort 1), and established molecular subgroups using a nanoString-based assay on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues or frozen tissue. The anatomical site of recurrence (local tumour bed or leptomeningeal metastasis), time to recurrence, and survival after recurrence were assessed in a subgroup-specific manner. Two independent, non-overlapping cohorts (cohort 2:samples from patients with recurrent medulloblastomas from 13 centres worldwide, obtained between 1991 and 2012; cohort 3:samples from patients with recurrent medulloblastoma obtained at the NN Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute [Moscow, Russia] between 1994 and 2011) were analysed to confirm and validate observations. When possible, molecular subgrouping was done on tissue obtained from both the initial surgery and at recurrence. Results Cohort 1 consisted of 30 patients with recurrent medulloblastomas; nine with local recurrences, and 21 with metastatic recurrences. Cohort 2 consisted of 77 patients and cohort 3 of 96 patients with recurrent medulloblastoma. Subgroup affiliation remained stable at recurrence in all 34 cases with available matched primary and recurrent pairs (five pairs from cohort 1 and 29 pairs from cohort 2 [15 SHH, five group 3, 14 group 4]). This finding was validated in 17 pairs from cohort 3. When analysed in a subgroup-specific manner, local recurrences in cohort 1 were more frequent in SHH tumours (eight of nine [89%]) and metastatic recurrences were more common in group 3 and group 4 tumours (17 of 20 [85%] with one WNT, p=0.0014, local vs metastatic recurrence, SHH vs group 3 vs group 4). The subgroup-specific location of recurrence was confirmed in cohort 2 (p=0.0013 for local vs metastatic recurrence, SHH vs group 3 vs group 4,), and cohort 3 (p<0.0001). Treatment with craniospinal irradiation at diagnosis was not significantly associated with the anatomical pattern of recurrence. Survival after recurrence was significantly longer in patients with group 4 tumours in cohort 1 (p=0.013) than with other subgroups, which was confirmed in cohort 2 (p=0.0075), but not cohort 3 (p=0.70). Interpretation Medulloblastoma does not change subgroup at the time of recurrence, reinforcing the stability of the four main medulloblastoma subgroups. Significant differences in the location and timing of recurrence across medulloblastoma subgroups have potential treatment ramifications. Specifically, intensified local (posterior fossa) therapy should be tested in the initial treatment of patients with SHH tumours. Refinement of therapy for patients with group 3 or group 4 tumours should focus on metastases.

Mutations in genes encoding the cadherin receptor-ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4 disrupt cerebral cortical development	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							VAN MALDERGEM SYNDROME; PLANAR CELL POLARITY; NEURONAL MIGRATION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; HIPPO PATHWAY; BETA-CATENIN; RADIAL GLIA; FILAMIN-A; PERIVENTRICULAR HETEROTOPIA; DEVELOPING NEOCORTEX	The regulated proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells before the generation and migration of neurons in the cerebral cortex are central aspects of mammalian development. Periventricular neuronal heterotopia, a specific form of mislocalization of cortical neurons, can arise from neuronal progenitors that fail to negotiate aspects of these developmental processes. Here we show that mutations in genes encoding the receptor-ligand cadherin pair DCHS1 and FAT4 lead to a recessive syndrome in humans that includes periventricular neuronal heterotopia. Reducing the expression of Dchs1 or Fat4 within mouse embryonic neuroepithelium increased progenitor cell numbers and reduced their differentiation into neurons, resulting in the heterotopic accumulation of cells below the neuronal layers in the neocortex, reminiscent of the human phenotype. These effects were countered by concurrent knockdown of Yap, a transcriptional effector of the Hippo signaling pathway.

Optogenetic identification of a rapid eye movement sleep modulatory circuit in the hypothalamus	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MELANIN-CONCENTRATING HORMONE; PARADOXICAL REM SLEEP; STEM GABAERGIC NEURONS; LOCUS-COERULEUS; GLUTAMATERGIC TRANSMISSION; OREXIN NEURONS; WAKING CYCLE; RAT-BRAIN; IN-SITU; MICE	Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep correlates with neuronal activity in the brainstem, basal forebrain and lateral hypothalamus. Lateral hypothalamus melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons are active during sleep, but their effects on REM sleep remain unclear. Using optogenetic tools in newly generated Tg(Pmch-cre) mice, we found that acute activation of MCH neurons (ChETA, SSFO) at the onset of REM sleep extended the duration of REM, but not non-REM, sleep episodes. In contrast, their acute silencing (eNpHR3.0, archaerhodopsin) reduced the frequency and amplitude of hippocampal theta rhythm without affecting REM sleep duration. In vitro activation of MCH neuron terminals induced GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in wake-promoting histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), and in vivo activation of MCH neuron terminals in TMN or medial septum also prolonged REM sleep episodes. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of MCH neurons maintains REM sleep, possibly through inhibition of arousal circuits in the mammalian brain.

Antidepressants and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: Isolated Side Effect or Neurodegenerative Signal?	SLEEP			English	Article						REM sleep behavior disorder; antidepressants; Parkinson disease	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS; DELAYED EMERGENCE; COLOR-VISION; EARLY MARKER; LEWY BODIES; RISK; DEMENTIA; DYSFUNCTION	Objectives: Antidepressants, among the most commonly prescribed medications, trigger symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in up to 6% of users. Idiopathic RBD is a very strong prodromal marker of Parkinson disease and other synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative syndromes. It is therefore critically important to understand whether antidepressant-associated RBD is an independent pharmacologic syndrome or a sign of possible prodromal neurodegeneration. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary sleep disorders center. Participants: 100 patients with idiopathic RBD, all with diagnosis confirmed on polysomnography, stratified to baseline antidepressant use, with 45 matched controls. Measurements/Results: Of 100 patients, 27 were taking antidepressants. Compared to matched controls, RBD patients taking antidepressants demonstrated significant abnormalities of 12/14 neurodegenerative markers tested, including olfaction (P = 0.007), color vision (P = 0.004), Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale II and III (P < 0.001 and 0.007), timed up-and-go (P = 0.003), alternate tap test (P = 0.002), Purdue Pegboard (P = 0.007), systolic blood pressure drop (P = 0.029), erectile dysfunction (P = 0.002), constipation (P = 0.003), depression indices (P < 0.001), and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (13% vs. 60%, P < 0.001). All these abnormalities were indistinguishable in severity from RBD patients not taking antidepressants. However, on prospective follow-up, RBD patients taking antidepressants had a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative disease than those without antidepressant use (5-year risk = 22% vs. 59%, RR = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.74). Conclusions: Although patients with antidepressant-associated RBD have a lower risk of neurodegeneration than patients with "purely-idiopathic" RBD, markers of prodromal neurodegeneration are still clearly present. Development of RBD with antidepressants can be an early signal of an underlying neurodegenerative disease.

MethodsA disease inception cohort was assessed annually for headache (5 types) and 18 other neuropsychiatric (NP) events. Global disease activity scores (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K]), damage scores (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index [SDI]), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) mental and physical component summary scores were collected. Time to first headache and associations with SF-36 scores were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards and linear regression models with generalized estimating equations. ResultsAmong the 1,732 SLE patients enrolled, 89.3% were female and 48.3% were white. The mean SD age was 34.6 +/- 13.4 years, duration of disease was 5.6 +/- 5.2 months, and length of followup was 3.8 +/- 3.1 years. At enrollment, 17.8% of patients had headache (migraine [60.7%], tension [38.6%], intractable nonspecific [7.1%], cluster [2.6%], and intracranial hypertension [1.0%]). The prevalence of headache increased to 58% after 10 years. Only 1.5% of patients had lupus headache, as identified in the SLEDAI-2K. In addition, headache was associated with other NP events attributed to either SLE or non-SLE causes. There was no association of headache with SLEDAI-2K scores (without the lupus headache variable), SDI scores, use of corticosteroids, use of antimalarials, use of immunosuppressive medications, or specific autoantibodies. SF-36 mental component scores were lower in patients with headache compared with those without headache (mean +/- SD 42.5 +/- 12.2 versus 47.8 +/- 11.3; P < 0.001), and similar differences in physical component scores were seen (38.0 +/- 11.0 in those with headache versus 42.6 +/- 11.4 in those without headache; P < 0.001). In 56.1% of patients, the headaches resolved over followup. ConclusionHeadache is frequent in SLE, but overall, it is not associated with global disease activity or specific autoantibodies. Although headaches are associated with a lower HRQOL, the majority of headaches resolve over time, independent of lupus-specific therapies.

Here, we examined social interactions of patients with Parkinson's disease with and without deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus in competitive situations. We hypothesized altered self-estimation and risk-seeking behaviour in this patient group induced by deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus. To test the hypothesis, an experimental setting was used in which participants performed a calculation task and chose their preferred compensation. Based on their actual calculation performance, more patients with Parkinson's disease with deep brain stimulation chose a competitive tournament compensation. Assuming rational behaviour, this self-selection pattern reflects increased risk tolerance. Since patients who performed in the lowest quartile chose the tournament option, the data suggest that deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus results in a loss of the correct reference frame against which patients with Parkinson's disease evaluate their performance. The stimulation-induced combination of overestimation of their own performance, increased risk-taking, and preference for competitive environments despite poor performance is likely to impact considerably on the patients' social and work life.

Caenorhabditis elegans anillin (ani-1) regulates neuroblast cytokinesis and epidermal morphogenesis during embryonic development	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						C. elegans embryogenesis; Epidermal morphogenesis; Neuroblasts; RhoA; Myosin; Anillin	VAB-1 EPH RECEPTOR; MEL-11 MYOSIN PHOSPHATASE; RHO-BINDING KINASE; C-ELEGANS; VENTRAL ENCLOSURE; TYROSINE KINASE; EPITHELIAL MORPHOGENESIS; CELL MIGRATIONS; PATHWAY; ACTIN	The formation of tissues is essential for metazoan development. During Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis, ventral epidermal cells migrate to encase the ventral surface of the embryo in a layer of epidermis by a process known as ventral enclosure. This process is regulated by guidance cues secreted by the underlying neuroblasts. However, since the cues and their receptors are differentially expressed in multiple cell types, the role of the neuroblasts in ventral enclosure is not fully understood. Furthermore, although F-actin is required for epidermal cell migration, it is not known if nonmuscle myosin is also required. Anillin (ANI-1) is an actin and myosin-binding protein that coordinates actin-myosin contractility in the early embryo. Here, we show that ANI-1 localizes to the cleavage furrows of dividing neuroblasts during mid-embryogenesis and is required for their division. Embryos depleted of ani-1 display a range of ventral enclosure phenotypes, where ventral epidermal cells migrate with similar speeds to control embryos, but contralateral neighbors often fail to meet and are misaligned. The ventral enclosure phenotypes in ani-1 RNAi embryos suggest that the position or shape of neuroblasts is important for directing ventral epidermal cell migration, although does not rule out an autonomous requirement for ani-1 in the epidermal cells. Furthermore, we show that rho-1 and other regulators of nonmuscle myosin activity are required for ventral epidermal cell migration. Interestingly, altering nonmuscle myosin contractility alleviates or strengthens ani-l's ventral enclosure phenotypes. Our findings suggest that ventral enclosure is a complex process that likely relies on inputs from multiple tissues. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Characteristics of radiation-induced sensorineural hearing loss in head and neck cancer: A systematic review	HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK			English	Review						head and neck; cancer; radiotherapy; sensorineural hearing loss; cochlea	BRAIN-STEM RESPONSES; NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA; ONCOLOGY GROUP; RADIOTHERAPY; THERAPY; TOXICITY; TUMORS; OTOTOXICITY; CHEMOTHERAPY; IRRADIATION	BackgroundPatients receiving radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck tumors are at risk of developing sensorineural hearing loss. The objective of this study was to analyze the literature regarding sensorineural hearing loss after RT for head and neck cancer. MethodsSeven databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Eligible articles were independently assessed for quality by 2 authors. ResultsFourteen articles were evaluated. There was considerable heterogeneity among studies. The reported incidence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) varied from 0% to 85% for the speech frequencies and from 27% to 95% for high frequencies. As the follow-up increased, an increase in the incidence of SNHL was observed. The minimum cochlear dose reported to be a risk factor for SNHL was 45 Gy. ConclusionsHigh quality literature in the topic is lacking. Radiation-induced SNHL is progressive, permanent, and dose-dependent. Total dose and follow-up time are important factors affecting incidence rates. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J-Difference Editing of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA): Simulated and Experimental Multiplet Patterns	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						GABA; MEGA-PRESS; pseudo-doublet; J-difference editing	IN-VIVO; HUMAN BRAIN; SPECTROSCOPY; FREQUENCY; GLUTAMATE; CORTEX	Purpose: To investigate factors that influence the multiplet pattern observed in J-difference editing of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Methods: Density matrix simulations were applied to investigate the shape of the 3 ppm GABA multiplet as a function of the editing sequence's slice-selective refocusing pulse properties, in particular bandwidth, transition width, and flip angle. For comparison to the calculations, experimental measurements were also made at 3 T on a 10 mM GABA solution using the MEGA-PRESS sequence at various refocusing pulse flip angles. Results: Good agreement was found between experiments and simulations. The edited multiplet consists of two outer lines of slightly unequal intensity due to strong coupling, and a smaller central line, the result of the unequal J-couplings between the C4 and C3 protons. The size of the center peak increases with increasing slice-selective refocusing pulse transition width, and deviation of the flip angle from 180 degrees. Conclusion: The 3 ppm GABA multiplet pattern observed in the MEGA-PRESS experiment depends quite strongly on the properties of the slice-selective refocusing pulses used. Under some circumstance, the central peak can be quite large; this does not necessarily indicate inefficient editing, or a subtraction artifact, but should be recognized as a property of the pulse sequence itself.

Temporal Lobe Volume Abnormalities Precede the Prodrome: A Study of Children Presenting Antecedents of Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						psychosis; high risk; MRI; VBM; biomarkers; brain structure	PSYCHOTIC-LIKE EXPERIENCES; WHITE-MATTER ABNORMALITIES; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; AGED 9-12 YEARS; STRUCTURAL BRAIN ALTERATIONS; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; PUTATIVE ANTECEDENTS; HIGH-RISK; METAANALYSIS; ONSET	Distributed abnormalities of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume characterize individuals experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia. Regions of abnormality are present already, albeit less extensively, during the prodromal phase of illness. This study aimed to determine whether putatively at-risk children, aged 9-12 years, who present multiple antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz), display GM and WM volume abnormalities relative to typically developing (TD) children presenting no antecedents. Structural magnetic resonance images were acquired for 20 ASz children and 20 TD children matched on age, sex, and IQ. Whole-brain differences in GM and WM volume were determined using voxel-based morphometry. Relative to the TD group, ASz children showed significantly decreased GM volume in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and increased GM volume in the left superior-middle temporal gyri (P < 0.05, cluster correction). WM volume was significantly increased in ASz children relative to TD children in a cluster encompassing the left inferior parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and superior temporal gyrus. Post-hoc analyses indicated that these abnormalities were not limited to ASz children who self-reported auditory hallucinations on questionnaire. Our findings suggest that children aged 9-12 years who present multiple ASz are characterized by abnormalities of GM and WM volume in the temporal lobes, comprising a subset of the regions affected in first-episode schizophrenia and in the prodromal phase of illness. These preliminary findings indicate that structural brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia may be detected in putatively at-risk, preprodromal children. Prospective studies following the brain development of at-risk children are needed.

Cognitive neuroscience has focused on them to understand how brain function and structure are modified by learning. Recent evidence indicates that individual differences in anatomical and functional properties of the neural architecture also affect learning and performance in these domains. Here, neuroimaging findings are reviewed that reiterate evidence of experience-dependent brain plasticity, but also point to the predictive validity of such data in relation to new learning in speech and music domains. Indices of neural sensitivity to certain stimulus features have been shown to predict individual rates of learning; individual network properties of brain activity are especially relevant in this regard, as they may reflect anatomical connectivity. Similarly, numerous studies have shown that anatomical features of auditory cortex and other structures, and their anatomical connectivity, are predictive of new sensory-motor learning ability. Implications of this growing body of literature are discussed.

Although several vitamin K-dependent hemostatic proteins are particularly important for the brain, other vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs), not associated with blood coagulation, also contribute to the brain function. In addition to the VKDPs, vitamin K participates in the nervous system through its involvement in sphingolipid metabolism, a class of lipids widely present in brain cell membranes. Classically known for their structural role, sphingolipids are biologically potent molecules involved in a wide range of cellular actions. Also, there is growing evidence that the K vitamer, menaquinone-4, has anti-inflammatory activity and offers protection against oxidative stress. Finally, although limited in numbers, reports point to a modulatory role of vitamin K in cognition. This short review presents an overview of the known role of vitamin K in brain function to date.

These functions are subverted during the development of primary and metastatic brain tumors, resulting in vascular perturbations that are thought to contribute to progression and comorbidities of the underlying disease, including thrombosis and hemorrhage. Chronic activation of the coagulation system is particularly obvious in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where intratumoral vasoocclusive thrombosis may contribute to hypoxia, pseudopalisading necrosis, and angiogenesis. GBM is also associated with spontaneous or iatrogenic bleeding, and the emission of circulating procoagulants implicated in the unusually high risk of peripheral venous thromboembolism. Tissue factor (TF) expression is elevated in several types of brain tumors, including adult and pediatric GBM, as is the production of TF-containing microparticles (TF-MPs). Both TF expression and its vesicular emission are regulated by tumor microenvironment (e.g., hypoxia), in concert with activated oncogenic and growth factor pathways (RAS, EGFR, MET), as well as the loss of tumor suppressor gene activity (PTEN). Discovery of distinct oncogenic networks led to recognition of unique molecular subtypes within brain tumors, of which GBM (proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal), and medulloblastoma (SHH, WNT, group 3, and group 4) exhibit subtype-specific composition of the tumor coagulome. It remains to be established whether mechanisms of thrombosis and biological effects of coagulation in brain tumors are also subtype specific. In this regard, TF pathway represents a paradigm, and its impact on tumor dormancy, inflammation, angiogenesis, formation of cancer stem cell niches, and dissemination is a subject of considerable interest. However, establishing the extent to which TF and TF-MPs contribute to pathogenesis and thromboembolic disease in the context of primary and secondary brain tumors may require molecular stratification of patient populations. We suggest that a better understanding of these molecular linkages may pave the way to a more effective (targeted) therapy, prophylaxis, adjunctive use of anticoagulants, and other agents able to modulate interactions between brain tumors and the coagulation system.

Sociodemographic factors, mental states, and comorbidities are important modulators of the acute prothrombotic stress response. In patients with atherosclerosis, exaggerated and prolonged stress-hypercoagulability might accelerate coronary thrombus growth following plaque rupture. Against a background risk from acquired prothrombotic conditions and inherited thrombophilia, acute stress also might trigger venous thromboembolic events. Chronic stressors such as job strain, dementia caregiving, and posttraumatic stress disorder as well as psychological distress from depressive and anxiety symptoms elicit a chronic low-grade hypercoagulable state that is no longer viewed as physiological but might impair vascular health. Through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, higher order cognitive processes and corticolimbic brain areas shape the acute prothrombotic stress response. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic dysfunction, including vagal withdrawal, are important regulators of hemostatic activity with longer lasting stress. Randomized placebo-controlled trials suggest that several cardiovascular drugs attenuate the acute prothrombotic stress response. Behavioral interventions and psychotropic medications might mitigate chronic low-grade hypercoagulability in stressed individuals, but further studies are clearly needed. Restoring normal hemostatic function with biobehavioral interventions bears the potential to ultimately decrease the risk of thrombotic diseases.

We investigated the effects of MrgC receptor activation on inflammatory hyperalgesia and its mechanisms. Experimental ApproachA selective MrgC receptor agonist, bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8-22 (BAM8-22) or melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) or the -opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist CTAP was administered intrathecally (i.t.) in rats injected with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in one hindpaw. Thermal and mechanical nociceptive responses were assessed. Neurochemicals were measured by immunocytochemistry, Western blot, ELISA and RT-PCR. Key ResultsCFA injection increased mRNA for MrgC receptors in lumbar DRG. BAM8-22 or MSH, given i.t., generated instant short and delayed long-lasting attenuations of CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia, but not mechanical allodynia. These effects were associated with decreased up-regulation of neuronal NOS (nNOS), CGRP and c-Fos expression in the spinal dorsal horn and/or DRG. However, i.t. administration of CTAP blocked the induction by BAM8-22 of delayed anti-hyperalgesia and inhibition of nNOS and CGRP expression in DRG. BAM8-22 also increased mRNA for MORs and pro-opiomelanocortin, along with -endorphin content in the lumbar spinal cord and/or DRG. MrgC receptors and nNOS were co-localized in DRG neurons. Conclusions and ImplicationsActivation of MrgC receptors suppressed up-regulation of pronociceptive mediators and consequently inhibited inflammatory pain, because of the activation of up-regulated MrgC receptors and subsequent endogenous activity at MORs. The uniquely distributed MrgC receptors could be a novel target for relieving inflammatory pain.

Delineating age-related changes of attentional proficiencies and deficiencies is important for understanding atypical developmental trajectories, specifically in neurodevelopmental disorders that are characterized by attentional difficulties. The objective of the current study was to develop preschool-appropriate measures for assessing sustained attention and to chart developmental changes in attention in early childhood. Method: Using adapted computerized paradigms, the present study investigated age-related changes in visual and auditory sustained attention in seventy typically developing children aged 3 to 6 years. Results: The results indicated that similar age-related gains in performance emerged across both visual and auditory attention tasks. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the adapted measures developed in this study are sensitive enough to capture developmental variations in attention performance.

Effects of Antenatal Synthetic Glucocorticoid on Glucocorticoid Receptor Binding, DNA Methylation, and Genome-Wide mRNA Levels in the Fetal Male Hippocampus	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE REACTIVITY; PITUITARY-ADRENAL FUNCTION; GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; DEXAMETHASONE EXPOSURE; NONADRENERGIC STIMULI; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; DEHYDROGENASE TYPE-2; PREMATURE-INFANTS	The endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) surge in late gestation plays a vital role in maturation of several organ systems. For this reason, pregnant women at risk of preterm labor are administered synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) to promote fetal lung development. Animal studies have shown that fetal sGC exposure can cause life-long changes in endocrine and metabolic function. We have previously shown that antenatal sGC treatment is associated with alterations in global DNA methylation and modifications to the hippocampal methylome and acetylome. In this study, we hypothesized that: 1) there are changes in the transcriptional landscape of the fetal hippocampus in late gestation, associated with the endogenous cortisol surge; 2) fetal sGC exposure alters genome-wide transcription in the hippocampus; and 3) these changes in transcription are associated with modified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA binding and DNA methylation. sGC was administered as 2 courses on gestational days (GD) 40, 41, 50, and 51, and the hippocampi of fetal guinea pigs were examined before (GD52) and after (GD65) the endogenous cortisol surge (Term similar to GD67). We also analyzed fetal hippocampi 24 hours and 14 days following maternal sGC injections (n = 3-4/group). Genome-wide modification of transcription and GR DNA binding occurred in late gestation, in parallel with the normal GC surge. Further, sGC exposure had a substantial impact on the hippocampal transcriptome, GR-DNA binding, and DNA methylation at 24 hours and 14 days following the final sGC treatment. These data support the hypothesis that GC exposure in late gestation plays a significant role in modifying the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of the developing fetal hippocampus and that substantial effects are evident for at least 2 weeks after sGC exposure.

Navigational strategies were assessed with the 4-on-8 virtual maze (4/8VM), a task previously shown to dissociate between hippocampal-dependent spatial navigational strategies and caudate nucleus-dependent stimulus-response navigational strategies. Spatial strategies involve learning the spatial relationships between the landmarks in an environment, while response learning strategies involve learning a rigid set of stimulus-response type associations, e.g., see the tree, turn left. We have shown that spatial learners have increased gray matter and fMRI activity in the hippocampus compared with response learners, while response learners have increased gray matter and fMRI activity in the caudate nucleus. We were interested in the prevalence of use of substances of abuse in spatial and response learners because of the evidence that people who score high on traits such as novelty seeking, sensation seeking, reward seeking, and impulsivity, are more cue-responsive and more likely to use substances of abuse. Since response learners show increased activity and gray matter in the caudate nucleus of the striatum, which is a brain area involved in addiction, we hypothesized that response learners would have a greater use of abused substances than spatial learners. Fifty-five young adults were tested on the 4/8VM and completed a time-line follow-back assessment of drug and alcohol use. We found that response learners had smoked a significantly greater number of cigarettes in their lifetime than spatial learners, were more likely to have used cannabis, and had double the lifetime alcohol consumption. We discuss the possible relationship between substance abuse and response strategies as well as the implications for the hippocampus, risks of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and healthy cognition.

Here, we review recent human functional neuroimaging studies demonstrating that the hippocampus is involved in the acquisition and sleep-related consolidation of procedural memories, and motor sequence-based skills in particular. More specifically, we present evidence that hippocampal activity and its functional interactions with other brain structures, particularly competition with the striatum, contribute to initial learning of sequential motor behavior. Interestingly, these early cerebral representations in the hippocampus and striatum, which may interact through the prefrontal cortex, can even predict subsequent sleep-related memory consolidation processes. We propose that sleep can reorganize the activity within, as well as the functional interactions between, these structures, ultimately favoring overnight performance enhancement. Finally, we conclude by offering insights into the respective roles of these structures in procedural memory consolidation processes. We argue that, in the context of motor sequence memory consolidation, the hippocampal system triggers subsequent sleep-dependent performance enhancement whereas the striatal system is involved in the maintenance of the motor behavior over time.

Since the food-restricted rats eat while passively confined on the food-paired arm no responses are reinforced, so the discrimination is due to Pavlovian stimulus-reward (or outcome) learning. Consistent with other evidence that rats must move around in an environment to acquire a spatial map, we found that learning the adjacent arms CCP (ACCP) required a minimum amount of active exploration of the maze with no reinforcers present prior to passive pairing of the extra-maze cues with the food reinforcer, an instance of latent learning. Temporary inactivation of the hippocampus during the pre-exposure sessions had no effect on ACCP learning, confirming other evidence that the hippocampus is not involved in latent learning. A series of experiments indentified a circuit involving fimbria-fornix and dorsal entorhinal cortex as the neural basis of latent learning in this situation. In contrast, temporary inactivation of the entorhinal cortex or hippocampus during passive training or during testing blocked ACCP learning and expression, respectively, suggesting that these two structures co-operate in using spatial information to learn the location of food on the maze during passive pairing and to express this combined information during testing. In parallel with these processes we found that the amygdala processes information leading to an equal tendency to enter both adjacent arms (even though only one was paired with food) suggesting that the stimulus information available to this structure is not sufficiently precise to discriminate between the ambiguous cues visible from the adjacent arms. Expression of the ACCP in normal rats depends on hippocampus-based learning to avoid the unpaired arm which competes with the amygdala-based tendency to enter that arm. In contrast, there is cooperation between amygdala- and hippocampus-based tendencies to enter the food-paired arm. These independent forms of learning contribute to the rat's ability to discriminate among spatial locations using ambiguous extra-maze cues. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two NN identifiers are proposed for nonlinear systems identification via dynamic NNs with different timescales including both fast and slow phenomenon. The first NN identifier uses the output signals from the actual system for the system identification. In the second NN identifier, all the output signals from nonlinear system are replaced with the state variables of the NNs. The online identification algorithms for both NN identifier parameters are proposed using Lyapunov function and singularly perturbed techniques. With the identified NN models, two indirect adaptive NN controllers for the nonlinear systems containing slow and fast dynamic processes are developed. For both developed adaptive NN controllers, the trajectory errors are analyzed and the stability of the systems is proved. Simulation results show that the controller based on the second identifier has better performance than that of the first identifier.

Perfusion Imaging of Focal Cortical Dysplasia Using Arterial Spin Labeling: Correlation With Histopathological Vascular Density	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						arterial spin labeling; cerebral blood flow; focal cortical dysplasia; magnetic resonance imaging; brain perfusion	CLASSIFICATION	Focal cortical dysplasia is the most common malformation of cortical development, causing intractable epilepsy. This study investigated the relationship between brain perfusion and microvessel density in 7 children with focal cortical dysplasia. The authors analyzed brain perfusion measurements obtained by magnetic resonance imaging of 2 of the children and the microvessel density of brain tissue specimens obtained by epilepsy surgery on all of the children. Brain perfusion was approximately 2 times higher in the area of focal cortical dysplasia compared to the contralateral side. The microvessel density was nearly double in the area of focal cortical dysplasia compared to the surrounding cortex that did not have morphological abnormalities. These findings suggest that hyperperfusion can be related to increased microvessel density in focal cortical dysplasia rather than only to seizures. Further investigations are needed to determine the relationship between brain perfusion, microvessel density, and seizure activity.

MethodsWomen 60 years old and older with at least weekly episodes of SUI were recruited. Participants were evaluated before and after a 12-week group PFM rehabilitation intervention. The evaluations included 3-day bladder diaries, symptom, and quality of life questionnaires, PFM function testing with dynamometry (force) and electromyography (activation) during seven tasks: rest, PFM maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), straining, rapid-repeated PFM contractions, a 60sec sustained PFM contraction, a single cough and three repeated coughs, and sagittal MRI recorded at rest, during PFM MVCs and during straining to assess PFM morphology. ResultsSeventeen women (68.95.5 years) participated. Following the intervention the frequency of urine leakage decreased and disease-specific quality of life improved significantly. PFM function improved significantly: the participants were able to perform more rapid-repeated PFM contractions; they activated their PFMs sooner when coughing and they were better able to maintain a PFM contraction between repeated coughs. Pelvic organ support improved significantly: the anorectal angle was decreased and the urethrovescial junction was higher at rest, during contraction and while straining. ConclusionsThis study indicated that improvements in urine leakage were produced along with improvements in PFM co-ordination (demonstrated by the increased number of rapid PFM contractions and the earlier PFM activation when coughing), motor-control, pelvic organ support.

Animal models of chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) evoked by a variety of drug classes, including taxanes, vinca alkaloids, platinum-complexes, and proteasome-inhibitors, suggest that the common underlying mechanism in the development of these neuropathies is mitotoxicity in primary nerve sensory axons (PNSAs) arising from reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics [eg adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production deficits due to compromised respiratory complex I and II activity]. The causative mechanisms of this mitotoxicity remain poorly defined. However, peroxynitrite, an important pro-nociceptive agent, has been linked to mitotoxicity in several disease states and may also drive the mitotoxicity associated with CIPN. Our findings reveal that the development of mechano-hypersensitivity induced by paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, and bortezomib was prevented by administration of the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst Mn(III) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-n-hexylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP5+) without interfering with their anti-tumor effects. Peak CIPN was associated with the nitration and inactivation of superoxide dismutase in the mitochondria, but not in the cytosol, as well as a significant decrease in ATP production within the PNSAs; all of these events were attenuated by MnTE-2-PyP5+. Our results provide continued support for the role of mitotoxicity in the development of CIPN across chemotherapeutic drug classes, and identify peroxynitrite as a key mediator in these processes, thereby providing the rationale towards development of "peroxynitrite-targeted" therapeutics for CIPN.

We investigated the deregulation of the synaptogenic neuroligin (NL) molecules, whose NL1 and NL2 isoforms are primarily encountered at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. In the dorsal horn of SNL rats, NL2 was overexpressed whereas NL1 remained unchanged. In control animals, intrathecal injections of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NL2 increased mechanical sensitivity, which confirmed the association of NL2 with inhibition. By contrast, siRNA application produced antinociceptive effects in SNL rats. Regarding NL partners, expression of the excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95 unexpectedly covaried with NL2 overexpression, and NL2/PSD95 protein interaction and colocalization increased. Expression of the inhibitory scaffolding protein gephyrin remained unchanged, indicating a partial change in NL2 postsynaptic partners in SNL rats. This phenomenon appears to be specific to the NL2(-) isoform. Our data showed unexpected upregulation and pronociceptive effects of the "inhibitory" NL2 in neuropathic pain, suggesting a functional shift of NL2 from inhibition to excitation that changed the synaptic ratio toward higher excitation.

However, the C-11-radiolabeling of peptides for positron emission tomography (PET) has been poorly explored, owing to the relatively short half-life of carbon-11 (t (1/2) = 20.3 min) and time-consuming multi-step radiochemical reactions. Existing methods have found limited use and are not routinely encountered in the production of radiotracers. Herein, we propose a facile one-step direct C-11-methylation of cysteine residues in peptides using [C-11]methyl triflate under ambient temperatures (20 A degrees C) and short reaction times, on the order of seconds. Good regioselectivity of this method was demonstrated by HPLC in a simple peptide (glutathione, GSH) and a more complex test decapeptide (Trp-Tyr-Trp-Ser-Arg-Cys-Lys-Trp-Thr-Gly) bearing multiple nucleophilic sites. In addition, we extend this method towards the synthesis of [C-11]Cys(Me)-[Tyr(3)-octreotate] as a demonstration of applicability for peptides of biological interest. This octreotate derivative was obtained in non-decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 11 +/- A 2 % (n = 3) with a synthesis time of approx. 30 min.

Method: Twelve clinicians from various disciplines, working in TBI outpatient programmes from three rehabilitation institutions in Montreal, Quebec, were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. Data was collected through focus groups and individual interviews and thematic analysis was used to identify themes. Main outcomes and results: Participants identified complexity factors falling under the following themes: sequelae of TBI (cognitive/behavioural/psychological impacts), personal factors (personality traits, pre-medical state, lifestyle and age), patients' environment (architectural, social, language, cultural and financial) and therapeutic relationship (mismatch, misunderstanding and personality clashes). Clinicians also reported facilitators to optimal treatment delivery such as quality of services and working in an interdisciplinary team. Limited time, training and resources were identified as barriers to treatment. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of patients in outpatient TBI programmes seem to follow an atypical evolution and exhibit added complexity. In order to optimize quality of care, clinicians recommended increased community awareness about TBI, increased resources for rehabilitation clinicians and specialized services post-discharge. These findings are insightful for stakeholders; providing a basis for discussions on policy changes that can better meet this population's needs.

Research design: A retrospective study. Methods and procedures: The MoCA and the MMSE were administered to 214 patients with TBI during their acute care hospitalization in a Level I trauma centre. Outcome was measured with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS). Main outcomes and results: A linear regression determined that the MoCA, the MMSE, TBI severity, education level and presence of diffuse injuries predicted 57% of the total variability of the DRS scores. The model without the MMSE had a R-2 of 53.7% and the model without the MoCA had a R-2 of 55.0%. The models without the MMSE or the MoCA had a R-2 of 24.9%. Conclusions: These results indicated that the MoCA and the MMSE function as similar predictors of the DRS at discharge.

Neural activity was modulated by hand position, speed, and movement direction, and by pre- and/or postsaccadic signals. After bilateral muscimol injection, an increase in the hand reaction- and movement-time toward both the first and second targets was observed. This caused an increase in the time necessary for the trajectory correction, and therefore an elongation of the hand-path toward the first target location. Furthermore, hand trajectories were different in shape than control ones. An elongation of the eye reaction time to both first and second targets was also observed, which could partially explain the deficit of planning and correction of hand movement. These results identify the superior parietal lobule as a crucial node in the online control of hand and eye movement and highlight the role of the eye impairment in the emergence of the reaching disorder so far regarded as the hallmark of optic ataxia.

We describe the identification of a novel rearrangement in which a downstream pseudogene translocates into exon 9 of OCLN, resulting in band-like brain calcification and advanced chronic kidney disease in early childhood. SNP genotyping and read-depth variation from whole exome sequencing initially pointed to a mutation in the OCLN gene. The high degree of identity between OCLN and two pseudogenes required a combination of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, PCR, and Sanger sequencing to identify the genomic rearrangement that was the underlying genetic cause of the disease. Mutations in exon 3, or at the 5-6 intron splice site, of OCLN have been reported to cause brain calcification and polymicrogyria with no evidence of extra-cranial phenotypes. Of the OCLN splice variants described, all make use of exon 9, while OCLN variants that use exons 3, 5, and 6 are tissue specific. The genetic rearrangement we identified in exon 9 provides a plausible explanation for the expanded clinical phenotype observed in our individuals. Furthermore, the lack of polymicrogyria associated with the rearrangement of OCLN in our patients extends the range of cranial defects that can be observed due to OCLN mutations.

Animal models of the disease suggest that significant neuronal abnormalities exist during preclinical stages of the disease. Mutations in the gene fused in sarcoma (FUS) are associated with ALS and cause impairment in motor function in animal models. However, the mechanism of neuromuscular dysfunction underlying pathophysiological deficits causing impairment in locomotor function resulting from mutant FUS expression is unknown. To characterize the cellular pathophysiological defect, we expressed the wild-type human gene (wtFUS) or the ALS-associated mutation R521H (mutFUS) gene in zebrafish larvae and characterized their motor (swimming) activity and function of their neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Additionally, we tested knockdown of zebrafish fus with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (fus AMO). Expression of either mutFUS or knockdown of fus resulted in impaired motor activity and reduced NMJ synaptic fidelity with reduced quantal transmission. Primary motoneurons expressing mutFUS were found to be more excitable. These impairments in neuronal function could be partially restored in fus AMO larvae also expressing wtFUS (fus AMOwtFUS) but not mutFUS (fus AMOmutFUS). These results show that both a loss and gain of FUS function result in defective presynaptic function at the NMJ.	[Armstrong, Gary A.

We sought to determine the relapse patterns of specific embryonal CNS tumors. We conducted a historical cohort study of children diagnosed with CNS embryonal tumors from January 2000 to December 2011 in two pediatric neuro-oncology centers. Patients of 21 years of age or younger at time of presentation with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma, supratentorial PNET, pineoblastoma or atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) and at least one surveillance MRI were included. A total of 133 patients met inclusion criteria and 49 (37 %) patients relapsed during the observation period. The majority (79 %) of sPNET relapses were local, whereas all (100 %) PB relapses were associated with diffuse leptomeningeal disease. Relapse patterns for MB were more diverse with local recurrence in 27 %, distant recurrence in 35 % and diffuse leptomeningeal disease in 38 %. The frequency of relapses involving the spine differed (p < 0.001) between tumor types (MB 28/55 [51 %], sPNET 3/33 [9 %], ATRT 3/7 [43 %] and PB 12/12 [100 %]). No sPNET patients had isolated spinal relapse (0/14). Embryonal tumors were found to have divergent patterns of recurrence. While medulloblastoma has variable relapse presentations, sPNET relapses locally and pineoblastoma recurs with diffuse leptomeningeal disease involving the spine. These results point toward possibly new upfront treatment stratification among embryonal tumors in accordance with relapse pattern.

Analysis of Recruitment and Outcomes in the Phase I/IIa Cethrin Clinical Trial for Acute Spinal Cord Injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						American Spinal Injury Association; Cethrin; clinical trial; motor recovery; neurological recovery; outcomes; sensory recovery	PROMOTES FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; RHO-KINASE; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; SECONDARY DAMAGE; MOTOR FUNCTION; ICCP PANEL; MULTICENTER; ACTIVATION; INHIBITION; GROWTH	The Cethrin clinical trial was an open-label Phase I/IIa trial undertaken to assess the safety, tolerability, and neurological status of patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) who were treated with escalating doses of Cethrin, a therapeutic protein drug that inactivates Rho. Recruitment, motor scores, and data on adverse events of treated patients have been reported (Fehlings et al.).(24) While determining efficacy in a small open-label study is not possible, it is important to understand if the results warrant further clinical study, because clinical trial failures have wide ranging impacts. We have examined the clinical data to analyze time to recruitment and sensory outcomes, and compared the outcomes with available registry and placebo data. The average time to recruitment was 52h, and there was a trend to improved sensory scores in treated patients with thoracic injury. An analysis of patients who recovered two motor levels or more suggests that there may be a larger responder population in the Cethrin-treated participants than in historical controls. We examined time to recruitment and found that the extent of motor and sensory recovery could not be explained by early surgery, and the Cethrin-treated patients showed favorable trends compared with the Surgical Timing in Acute SCI data. The trends reported here indicate that further study of Cethrin is warranted and provide useful guidance to establish effective clinical protocols.

We assessed the incidence of emergency department visits in men with lower urinary tract symptoms who presented to emergency departments in the United States and factors associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization. Materials and Methods: Emergency department visits from 2006 to 2009 associated with a primary diagnosis of lower urinary tract symptoms using established criteria were abstracted from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Age adjusted incidence rates of emergency department visits and charges were calculated. We performed multivariable analysis to examine patient and hospital characteristics of those hospitalized and those with benign prostatic hyperplasia related adverse events. Results: A weighted estimate of 1,178,423 emergency department visits for lower urinary tract symptoms was recorded with a national incidence of 197.6/100,000 males per year. A total of 112,288 visits (9.5%) resulted in hospitalization. Adverse events were identified in 734,269 patients (62.3%). The most common adverse events were catheterization in 44.6% of cases, infection in 17.4%, hematuria in 9.6%, bladder stones in 1.7%, hydronephrosis in 1.2% and acute renal failure in 0.1%. On multivariable analysis independent predictors of hospital admission included comorbidities, socioeconomic status, hospital characteristics and adverse events such as sepsis, acute renal failure and hydronephrosis. Independent predictors of adverse events included patient age, year of visit, socioeconomic status, hospital characteristics and concomitant neurological disease. In 2009 total emergency department charges for lower urinary tract symptoms were $494,981,922. Conclusions: The number of men with lower urinary tract symptoms who visit the emergency department has remained stable, while emergency department charges have increased by 40%. The rate of adverse events increased during the study period. These findings might suggest over reliance on medical and conservative therapy in the contemporary era.

The current view is that LHb receives and processes cortical information in order to select proper strategies in a variety of behavior. Recent evidence indicates that LHb might also be implicated in hippocampus-dependent memory processes. However, if and how LHb functionally interacts with the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) is still unknown. We therefore performed simultaneous recordings within LHb and dHPC in both anesthetized and freely moving rats. We first showed that a subset of LHb cells were phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations. Furthermore, LHb generated spontaneous theta oscillatory activity, which was highly coherent with hippocampal theta oscillations. Using reversible LHb inactivation, we found that LHb might regulate dHPC theta oscillations. In addition, we showed that LHb silencing altered performance in a hippocampus-dependent spatial recognition task. Finally, increased coherence between LHb and dHPC was positively correlated to the memory performance in this test. Collectively, these results suggest that LHb functionally interacts with the hippocampus and is involved in hippocampus-dependent spatial information processing.

A systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and acceptability of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating major depression	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Review						Acceptability; bilateral rTMS; efficacy; major depression; meta-analysis; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ASTERISK-D REPORT; DOUBLE-BLIND; BRAIN-STIMULATION; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; LOW-FREQUENCY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; METABOLISM; SCALE	Background. Bilateral repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising novel therapeutic intervention for major depression (MD). However, clinical trials to date have reported conflicting evidence concerning its overall efficacy, which might have resulted from low statistical power. Thus, meta-analytical approaches could be useful in examining this issue by allowing the integration of findings from multiple studies and thus producing more accurate estimates of the treatment effect. Method. We searched the literature for randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on bilateral rTMS for treating MD from 1995 to July 2012 using EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and from October 2008 until May 2012 using Medline. The main outcome measures were response and remission rates. We used a random-effects model, odds ratios (ORs) and the number needed to treat. Results. Data were obtained from seven RCTs, totaling 279 subjects with MD. After an average of 12.9 (S.D.= 2.7) sessions, 24.7% (40/162) and 6.8% (8/117) of subjects receiving active bilateral rTMS and sham rTMS were classified as responders [OR 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95-9.52, p< 0.0001]. Also, 19% (23/121) and 2.6% (2/77) of subjects were remitters following active bilateral rTMS and sham rTMS, respectively (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.65-21.8, p= 0.006). No difference between baseline mean depression scores for the bilateral and sham rTMS groups was found, and the former was comparable with the latter in terms of drop-out rates at study end. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences efficacy-and acceptability-wise between active bilateral and unilateral rTMS at study end. Finally, heterogeneity between the included RCTs was not significant, and the risk of publication bias was found to be low. Conclusions. Bilateral rTMS is a promising treatment for MD as it provides clinically meaningful benefits that are comparable with those of standard antidepressants and unilateral rTMS. Furthermore, bilateral rTMS seems to be an acceptable treatment for depressed subjects.	[Berlim, M.

An interdisciplinary approach is taken, supplying readers with evidence from very structured laboratory studies and findings from more ecological research studies that target real-life divided-attention situations (i.e., walking and talking). The review goes beyond the reported age-related declines in divided-attention abilities and offers the reader an overview of current cognitive (dual-task) training findings which suggest that these declines can be diminished with training. The contents of this review and the future directions proposed demonstrate that divided-attention research and its recent application to aging and mobility has become a major and fast growing scientific field of investigation.

To assess relevance to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron disorders, clusterin expression was evaluated using long-term dissociated cultures of murine spinal cord and SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice, a model of familial ALS. Motor neurons and astrocytes constitutively expressed nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of clusterin, and secreted clusterin accumulated in culture media. Although clusterin can be stress inducible, heat shock failed to increase levels in these neural cell compartments despite robust upregulation of stress-inducible Hsp70 (HspA1) in non-neuronal cells. In common with HSPs, clusterin was upregulated by treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, and thus could contribute to the neuroprotection previously identified for such compounds in disease models. Clusterin expression was not altered in cultured motor neurons expressing SOD1(G93A) by gene transfer or in presymptomatic SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice; however, clusterin immunolabeling was weakly increased in lumbar spinal cord of overtly symptomatic mice. More striking, mutant SOD1 inclusions, a pathological hallmark, were strongly labeled by anti-clusterin. Since secreted, as well as intracellular, mutant SOD1 contributes to toxicity, the extracellular chaperoning property of clusterin could be important for folding and clearance of SOD1 and other misfolded proteins in the extracellular space. Evaluation of chaperone-based therapies should include evaluation of clusterin as well as HSPs, using experimental models that replicate the control mechanisms operant in the cells and tissue of interest.

Following activation by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), each Rab binds a specific set of effector proteins that mediate the various downstream functions of that Rab. Then, with the help of GTPase-activating proteins, the Rab converts GTP to GDP, terminating its function. There are over 60 Rabs in humans and only a subset has been analyzed in any detail. Recently, Rab35 has emerged as a key regulator of cargo recycling at endosomes, with an additional role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we will focus on the regulation of Rab35 activity by the connecdenn/DENND1 family of GEFs and the TBC1D10/EPI64 family of GTPase-activating proteins. We will describe how analysis of these proteins, as well as a plethora of Rab35 effectors has provided insights into Rab35 function. Finally, we will describe how Rab35 provides a novel link between the Rab and Arf family of GTPases with implications for tumor formation and invasiveness.

Neuropsychological Outcomes of a Randomized Trial of Prednisone Versus Dexamethasone in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Findings From Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						acute lymphoblastic leukemia; behavior; children; cognition; dexamethasone	CRANIAL RADIATION-THERAPY; CHILDREN; RISK; CORTICOSTEROIDS; NEUROTOXICITY; PERFORMANCE; EFFICACY	BackgroundDexamethasone is more efficacious than prednisone in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but has also been associated with greater toxicity. We compared neuropsychological outcomes for patients treated on DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01, which included a randomized comparison of the two steroid preparations during post-induction therapy in children and adolescents with ALL. ProcedureBetween 2000 and 2005, 408 children with standard-risk or high-risk ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 00-01 were randomly assigned to prednisone or dexamethasone administered as 5-day pulses every 3 weeks for 2 years, beginning at week 7 of treatment. Blinded neuropsychological testing was completed for 170 randomized patients (prednisone, N=76; dexamethasone, N=94), all of whom were in continuous complete remission after completion of therapy. ResultsOutcomes were comparable for most variables, although patients on the dexamethasone arm performed more poorly on a measure of fluid reasoning (P=0.02). They also tended to be more likely to be enrolled in special education (dexamethasone, 33% vs. prednisone, 20%, P=0.09). ConclusionsDexamethasone has well documented benefit in treatment of ALL. Although formal testing provided little indication of increased risk for neurotoxicity relative to prednisone, the somewhat greater utilization of special education services by patients treated with dexamethasone merits further investigation.

The adult recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is 60mg po three times per week (t.i.w.) for 3 weeks every 4 weeks. This study assessed the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of pracinostat and determined the RP2D in children with refractory solid tumors. MethodsPediatric patients with refractory solid tumors were treated with oral pracinostat t.i.w. for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week off dosing. Three dose levels25, 35, and 45mg/m(2) were evaluated using a standard 3+3 cohort design. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were optional. ResultsTwelve patients were enrolled. The most common diagnosis was Ewing sarcoma. Most adverse events (AEs) were hematological with five (40%) patients experiencing grade 3 neutropenia. Non-hematological AEs were generally grade 1. No dose limiting toxicities occurred. More hematological and non-hematological AEs occurred at 45mg/m(2): Two of five patients experienced Grade 3 neutropenia and one each Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and leucopenia, Grade 1 fatigue and anorexia occurred in three. The RP2D was declared to be 45mg/m(2) (comparable to an adult dose of 80mg). One patient had a best response of stable disease (duration of 2.9 months). Three patients on 25mg/m(2) and one each on 35 and 45mg/m(2) participated in the PK study. No dose related changes in C-max or AUC occurred. ConclusionsPracinostat is reasonably well tolerated in children with refractory solid tumors. The RP2D is 45mg/m(2). Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013;60:1868-1874. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The adverse effects of reduced cerebral perfusion on cognition and brain structure in older adults with cardiovascular disease	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Arterial spin labeling; cardiovascular disease; cerebral blood flow; cerebrovascular disease; cognitive function; magnetic resonance imaging; neuroimaging	WHITE-MATTER HYPERINTENSITIES; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BLOOD-FLOW; HEART-FAILURE; CORTICAL THICKNESS; CARDIAC-OUTPUT; QUIPSS II; DEMENTIA; MRI	Background: It is well established that aging and vascular processes interact to disrupt cerebral hemodynamics in older adults. However, the independent effects of cerebral perfusion on neurocognitive function among older adults remain poorly understood. We examined the associations among cerebral perfusion, cognitive function, and brain structure in older adults with varying degrees of vascular disease using perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) arterial spin labeling (ASL). Materials and methods: 52 older adults underwent neuroimaging and were administered the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and measures of attention/executive function. ASL and T1-weighted MRI were used to quantify total brain perfusion, total brain volume (TBV), and cortical thickness. Results: Regression analyses showed reduced total brain perfusion was associated with poorer performance on the MMSE, RBANS total index, immediate and delayed memory composites, and Trail Making Test B. Reduced frontal lobe perfusion was associated with worse executive and memory function. A similar pattern emerged between temporal lobe perfusion and immediate memory. Regression analyses revealed that decreased total brain perfusion was associated with smaller TBV and mean cortical thickness. Regional effects of reduced total cerebral perfusion were found on temporal and parietal lobe volumes and frontal and temporal cortical thickness. Discussion: Reduced cerebral perfusion is independently associated with poorer cognition, smaller TBV, and reduced cortical thickness in older adults. Conclusion: Prospective studies are needed to clarify patterns of cognitive decline and brain atrophy associated with cerebral hypoperfusion.

Netrin-1 Promotes Excitatory Synaptogenesis between Cortical Neurons by Initiating Synapse Assembly	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GROWTH CONE GUIDANCE; COLORECTAL-CANCER; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; ACTIN CYTOSKELETON; COMMISSURAL AXONS; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; SPINAL-CORD; DCC; PHOSPHORYLATION; TRANSLATION	Netrin-1 is a secreted protein that directs long-range axon guidance during early stages of neural circuit formation and continues to be expressed in the mammalian forebrain during the postnatal period of peak synapse formation. Here we demonstrate a synaptogenic function of netrin-1 in rat and mouse cortical neurons and investigate the underlying mechanism. Wereport that netrin-1 and its receptor DCC are widely expressed by neurons in the developing mammalian cortex during synapse formation and are enriched at synapses in vivo. We detect DCC protein distributed along the axons and dendrites of cultured cortical neurons and provide evidence that newly translated netrin-1 is selectively transported to dendrites. Using gain and loss of function manipulations, we demonstrate that netrin-1 increases the number and strength of excitatory synapsesmadebetween developing cortical neurons. Weshow that netrin-1 increases the complexity of axon and dendrite arbors, thereby increasing the probability of contact. At sites of contact, netrin-1 promotes adhesion, while locally enriching and reorganizing the underlying actin cytoskeleton through Src family kinase signaling and m-Tor-dependent protein translation to locally cluster presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. Finally, we demonstrate using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology that netrin-1 increases the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons. These findings identify netrin-1 as a synapse-enriched protein that promotes synaptogenesis between mammalian cortical neurons.

The molecular mechanisms underlying coordination of neurite-neurite interactions for circuit assembly are incompletely understood. In this report, we identify a novel Ig superfamily transmembrane protein that we named Borderless (Bdl), as a novel regulator of neurite-neurite interactions in Drosophila. Bdl induces homotypic cell-cell adhesion in vitro and mediates neurite-neurite interactions in the developing visual system. Bdl interacts physically and genetically with the Ig transmembrane protein Turtle, a key regulator of axonal tiling. Our results also show that the receptor tyrosine phosphatase leukocyte common antigen-related protein (LAR) negatively regulates Bdl to control synaptic-layer selection. We propose that precise regulation of Bdl action coordinates neurite-neurite interactions for circuit formation in Drosophila.

Evidence for NG2-glia Derived, Adult-Born Functional Neurons in the Hypothalamus	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURAL STEM-CELLS; DEVELOPING RAT-BRAIN; PROGENITOR CELLS; IN-VIVO; ENERGY-BALANCE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NG2 PROTEOGLYCAN; PIRIFORM CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SELF-RENEWAL	Accumulating evidence suggests that the adult murine hypothalamus, a control site of several fundamental homeostatic processes, has neurogenic capacity. Correspondingly, the adult hypothalamus exhibits considerable cell proliferation that is ongoing even in the absence of external stimuli, and some of the newborn cells have been shown to mature into cells that express neuronal fate markers. However, the identity and characteristics of proliferating cells within the hypothalamic parenchyma have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here we show that a subset of NG2-glia distributed throughout the mediobasal hypothalamus are proliferative and express the stem cell marker Sox2. We tracked the constitutive differentiation of hypothalamic NG2-glia by employing genetic fate mapping based on inducible Cre recombinase expression under the control of the NG2 promoter, demonstrating that adult hypothalamic NG2-glia give rise to substantial numbers of APC+ oligodendrocytes and a smaller population of HuC/D+ or NeuN+ neurons. Labelling with the cell proliferation marker BrdU confirmed that some NG2-derived neurons have proliferated shortly before differentiation. Furthermore, patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that some NG2-derived cells display an immature neuronal phenotype and appear to receive synaptic input indicative of their electrical integration in local hypothalamic circuits. Together, our studies show that hypothalamic NG2-glia are able to take on neuronal fates and mature into functional neurons, indicating that NG2-glia contribute to the neurogenic capacity of the adult hypothalamus.

At the diagnostic stage, the AD brain is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss. Despite the large variety of therapeutic approaches, this condition remains incurable, since at the time of clinical diagnosis, the brain has already suffered irreversible and extensive damage. In recent years, it has become evident that AD starts decades prior to its clinical presentation. In this regard, transgenic animal models can shed much light on the mechanisms underlying this "pre-clinical" stage, enabling the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets. This paper summarizes the formidable efforts to create models mimicking the various aspects of AD pathology in the rat. Transgenic rat models offer distinctive advantages over mice. Rats are physiologically, genetically and morphologically closer to humans. More importantly, the rat has a well-characterized, rich behavioral display. Consequently, rat models of AD should allow a more sophisticated and accurate assessment of the impact of pathology and novel therapeutics on cognitive outcomes.	[Do Carmo, Sonia; Cuello, A.

For example, sensory and motor cortices have been shown to be active when subjects listen to words denoting bodily actions. Kinematic analyses of subjects' motor actions during the processing of linguistic stimuli provide further insights into the nature and time-course of this relationship. However, such studies have largely focused on individual body parts, in particular the upper limbs, thus neglecting the effect of language processing on lower or whole body representations. The present study bridges this gap by evaluating the interaction between linguistic processing and whole-body postural control during quiet standing. The results reveal a systematic influence of passive listening to action verbs, but not mental-state verbs, on measures of postural control, pointing to a clear and specific neural link between words conveying action concepts and whole-body motor functions.

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the medial entorhinal cortex evoked by stimulation of the piriform cortex are suppressed during theta EEG activity in behaving animals, and cholinergic receptor activation suppresses synaptic responses both in vivo, and in layer II entorhinal neurons in vitro. Here, we have used in vitro field potential recordings to investigate the transmitter receptors that mediate the cholinergic suppression of synaptic responses in layer I inputs to layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex. Bath-application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol suppressed the amplitude of fEPSPs with an EC50 of 5.3 mu M, and enhanced paired-pulse ratio. The M-2/M-4 preferring receptor blocker methoctramine, or the M-4 receptor blocker PD102807, did not prevent the cholinergic suppression. However, the M-1/M-4 receptor blocker pirenzepine and the M-1 receptor blocker VU0255035 reduced the suppression, suggesting that the cholinergic suppression of synaptic responses in the entorhinal cortex is dependent in large part on activation of M-1 receptors.

We aimed to investigate the processing of odor mixtures using behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The odor mixture contained a target odor (ambroxan) in a concentration at which it could be perceived by half of the subjects (sensitive group); the other half could not perceive the odor (insensitive group). In line with previous findings on multi-component odor mixtures, both groups of subjects were not able to distinguish a complex odor mixture containing or not containing the target odor. However, sensitive subjects had stronger activations than insensitive subjects in chemosensory processing areas such as the insula when exposed to the mixture containing the target odor. Furthermore, the sensitive group exhibited larger brain activations when presented with the odor mixture containing the target odor compared to the odor mixture without the target odor; this difference was smaller, though present for the insensitive group. In conclusion, we show that a target odor presented within a mixture of odors can influence brain activations although on a psychophysical level subjects are not able to distinguish the mixture with and without the target. On the practical side these results suggest that the addition of a certain compound to a mixture of odors may not be detected on a cognitive level; however, this additional odor may significantly change the cerebral processing of this mixture. In this context, FMRI offers unique possibilities to look at the subliminal effects of odors.

Specifically, adults with ASD are less sensitive to texture-defined (or second-order) information, which necessitates the implication of several cortical visual areas. Conversely, the sensitivity to simple, luminance-defined (or first-order) information, which mainly relies on primary visual cortex (V1) activity, has been found to be either superior (static material) or intact (dynamic material) in ASD. It is currently unknown if these autistic perceptual alterations are present in childhood. In the present study, behavioural (threshold) and electrophysiological measures were obtained for static luminance-and texture-defined gratings presented to school-aged children with ASD and compared to those of typically developing children. Our behavioural and electrophysiological (P140) results indicate that luminance processing is likely unremarkable in autistic children. With respect to texture processing, there was no significant threshold difference between groups. However, unlike typical children, autistic children did not show reliable enhancements of brain activity (N230 and P340) in response to texture-defined gratings relative to luminance-defined gratings. This suggests reduced efficiency of neuro-integrative mechanisms operating at a perceptual level in autism. These results are in line with the idea that visual atypicalities mediated by intermediate-scale neural networks emerge before or during the school-age period in autism.

The paper was prepared by three simple steps. The first step involves preparation of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) microcapsules, the second step is to incubate positively charged microcapsules in negatively charged 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-a-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (BCIN) solution, a color enhancer nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), and in the third step, paper was fabricated by incorporating incubated microcapsules into paper pulp. This paper changes color from white to dark purple in the presence of sialidase in as little as 6 min, and color could be enhanced with increased length of reaction time. In this reaction system, BCIN was the substrate for sialidase, NBT was the color enhancer, and PEI microcapsules acted as catalyst. The loading efficiency of BCIN was about 22.2%, and filtered BCIN solution could be reused for the next fabrication. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Dynamic and Permissive Roles of TRPV1 and TRPV4 Channels for Thermosensation in Mouse Supraoptic Magnocellular Neurosecretory Neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RECEPTOR POTENTIAL VANILLOID-4; N-TERMINAL VARIANT; MICE LACKING; TEMPERATURE SENSATION; THERMAL HYPERALGESIA; LAMINA TERMINALIS; BODY-TEMPERATURE; PAIN SENSATION; ION CHANNELS; VR-OAC	The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and 4 genes (trpv1, trpv4) encode temperature-sensitive cation channels hypothesized to mediate thermoresponses in mammalian cells. Although such channels were shown to participate in the peripheral detection of ambient temperature, the specific roles of these channels in central thermosensory neurons remain unclear. Here we report that the membrane potential and excitability of mouse magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) maintained at physiological temperature were lowered in an additive manner upon pharmacological blockade, or genetic deletion, of trpv1 and trpv4. However extracellular recordings from spontaneously active MNCs in situ showed that blockade or genetic deletion of trpv4 does not interfere with thermally induced changes in action potential firing, whereas loss of trpv1 abolished this phenotype. These findings indicate that channels encoded by trpv4 play a permissive role that contributes to basal electrical activity, but that trpv1 plays a dynamic role that is required for physiological thermosensation by MNCs.

Disruption of the expression of the proprotein convertase PC7 reduces BDNF production and affects learning and memory in mice	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						gene knockout; fear conditioning; BDNF processing; PC7 substrates; brain phenotypes	NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PROHORMONE CONVERTASES; CONDITIONED FEAR; TRKB AGONIST; BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPUS; DEFICITS; AMYGDALA; KNOCK; 7,8-DIHYDROXYFLAVONE	PC7 belongs to the proprotein convertase family, whose members are implicated in the cleavage of secretory precursors. The in vivo function of PC7 is unknown. Herein, we find that the precursor proBDNF is processed into mature BDNF in COS-1 cells coexpressing proBDNF with either PC7 or Furin. Conversely, the processing of proBDNF into BDNF is markedly reduced in the absence of either Furin or PC7 in mouse primary hepatocytes. In vivo we observe that BDNF and PC7 mRNAs are colocalized in mouse hippocampus and amygdala and that mature BDNF protein levels are reduced in these brain areas in PC7 KO mice but not in the hippocampus of PC1/3 KO mice. Various behavioral tests reveal that in PC7 KO mice spatial memory is intact and plasticity of responding is mildly abnormal. Episodic and emotional memories are severely impaired, but both are rescued with the tyrosine receptor kinase B agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone. Altogether, these results support an in vivo role for PC7 in the regulation of certain types of cognitive performance, in part via proBDNF processing. Because polymorphic variants of human PC7 are being characterized, it will be important in future studies to determine their effects on additional physiological and behavioral processes.

Texture sparseness, but not local phase structure, impairs second-order segmentation	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Texture; Segmentation; Higher-order statistics; Natural images; Second order	V1 NEURONS; STATISTICS; MOTION; DISCRIMINATION; SENSITIVITY; MECHANISMS; 1ST-ORDER; SUMMATION; CHANNELS; FOURIER	Texture boundary segmentation is typically thought to reflect a comparison of differences in Fourier energy (i.e. low-order texture statistics) on either side of a boundary. However in a previous study (Arsenault, Yoonessi, & Baker, 2011) we showed that the distribution of energy within a natural texture (i.e. its higher-order statistical structure) also influences segmentation of contrast boundaries. Here we examine the influence of specific higher-order texture statistics on segmentation of contrast- and orientation-defined boundaries. Using naturalistic synthetic textures to manipulate the sparseness, global phase structure, and local phase alignments of carrier textures, we measure segmentation thresholds based on forced-choice judgments of boundary orientation. We find a similar pattern of results for both contrast and orientation boundaries: (1) randomizing all structure by globally phase scrambling the texture reduces segmentation thresholds substantially, (2) decreasing sparseness also reduces thresholds, and (3) removing local phase alignments has little or no effect on segmentation thresholds. We show that a two-stage filter model with an intermediate compressive nonlinearity and expansive output nonlinearity can account for these data using synthetic textures. Furthermore, the model parameter fits obtained using synthetic textures also predict the segmentation thresholds presented in Arsenault, Yoonessi, and Baker (2011) for natural and phase-scrambled natural texture carriers.

Head Movements Evoked in Alert Rhesus Monkey by Vestibular Prosthesis Stimulation: Implications for Postural and Gaze Stabilization	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-ACCELERATION ROTATIONS; WHOLE-BODY ROTATION; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; VESTIBULOCOLLIC REFLEX; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; QUADRUPEDAL LOCOMOTION; CERVICOCOLLIC REFLEX; SEMICIRCULAR CANALS; NERVE AFFERENTS	The vestibular system detects motion of the head in space and in turn generates reflexes that are vital for our daily activities. The eye movements produced by the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) play an essential role in stabilizing the visual axis (gaze), while vestibulo-spinal reflexes ensure the maintenance of head and body posture. The neuronal pathways from the vestibular periphery to the cervical spinal cord potentially serve a dual role, since they function to stabilize the head relative to inertial space and could thus contribute to gaze (eye-in-head + head-in-space) and posture stabilization. To date, however, the functional significance of vestibular-neck pathways in alert primates remains a matter of debate. Here we used a vestibular prosthesis to 1) quantify vestibularly-driven head movements in primates, and 2) assess whether these evoked head movements make a significant contribution to gaze as well as postural stabilization. We stimulated electrodes implanted in the horizontal semicircular canal of alert rhesus monkeys, and measured the head and eye movements evoked during a 100ms time period for which the contribution of longer latency voluntary inputs to the neck would be minimal. Our results show that prosthetic stimulation evoked significant head movements with latencies consistent with known vestibulo-spinal pathways. Furthermore, while the evoked head movements were substantially smaller than the coincidently evoked eye movements, they made a significant contribution to gaze stabilization, complementing the VOR to ensure that the appropriate gaze response is achieved. We speculate that analogous compensatory head movements will be evoked when implanted prosthetic devices are transitioned to human patients.

Deficiency of Asparagine Synthetase Causes Congenital Microcephaly and a Progressive Form of Encephalopathy	NEURON			English	Article							SEQUENCING DATA; EXPRESSION; MUTATIONS; GENE; ASPM; SIZE; CELL	We analyzed four families that presented with a similar condition characterized by congenital microcephaly, intellectual disability, progressive cerebral atrophy, and intractable seizures. We show that recessive mutations in the ASNS gene are responsible for this syndrome. Two of the identified missense mutations dramatically reduce ASNS protein abundance, suggesting that the mutations cause loss of function. Hypomorphic Asns mutant mice have structural brain abnormalities, including enlarged ventricles and reduced cortical thickness, and show deficits in learning and memory mimicking aspects of the patient phenotype. ASNS encodes asparagine synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine from glutamine and aspartate. The neurological impairment resulting from ASNS deficiency may be explained by asparagine depletion in the brain or by accumulation of aspartate/glutamate leading to enhanced excitability and neuronal damage. Our study thus indicates that asparagine synthesis is essential for the development and function of the brain but not for that of other organs.

Diverse Suppressive Influences in Area MT and Selectivity to Complex Motion Features	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MACAQUE VISUAL-CORTEX; CENTER-SURROUND ANTAGONISM; NEURAL ENCODING MODELS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD CENTER; TRANSPARENT MOTION; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; SURFACE ORIENTATION; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; OBJECT RECOGNITION; RHESUS-MONKEY	Neuronal selectivity results from both excitatory and suppressive inputs to a given neuron. Suppressive influences can often significantly modulate neuronal responses and impart novel selectivity in the context of behaviorally relevant stimuli. In this work, we use a naturalistic optic flow stimulus to explore the responses of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of the alert macaque monkey; these responses are interpreted using a hierarchical model that incorporates relevant nonlinear properties of upstream processing in the primary visual cortex (V1). In this stimulus context, MT neuron responses can be predicted from distinct excitatory and suppressive components. Excitation is spatially localized and matches the measured preferred direction of each neuron. Suppression is typically composed of two distinct components: (1) a directionally untuned component, which appears to play the role of surround suppression and normalization; and (2) a direction-selective component, with comparable tuning width as excitation and a distinct spatial footprint that is usually partially overlapping with excitation. The direction preference of this direction-tuned suppression varies widely acrossMT neurons: approximately one-third have overlapping suppression in the opposite direction as excitation, and many other neurons have suppression with similar direction preferences to excitation. There is also a population of MT neurons with orthogonally oriented suppression. We demonstrate that direction-selective suppression can impart selectivity of MT neurons to more complex velocity fields and that it can be used for improved estimation of the three-dimensional velocity of moving objects. Thus, considering MT neurons in a complex stimulus context reveals a diverse set of computations likely relevant for visual processing in natural visual contexts.

The unique connectivity patterns of these two areas have not been well established. In a resting-state functional connectivity study, we tested predictions about these areas from invasive tract-tracing studies of the connectivity of their homologs in the macaque monkey. We demonstrated their distinct connectivity profiles as well as their differences from the caudally adjacent ventral parts of the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortical region that represent the orofacial musculature. Area 45 is strongly connected with the superior temporal sulcus and the cortex on the adjacent superior and middle temporal gyri. In the parietal region, area 45 is connected with the angular gyrus, whereas area 44 is connected with the supramarginal gyrus. The primary motor cortical region in the caudal precentral gyrus is not connected with the posterior parietal region, which lies outside the confines of the postcentral gyrus, whereas the ventrorostral premotor cortical area 6VR, in the most anterior part of the precentral gyrus, has strong connections with the rostral supramarginal gyrus. Thus, area 44, which has stronger connections to the posterior supramarginal gyrus, can be distinguished from both the adjacent area 6VR and area 45. These findings provide a major improvement in understanding the connectivity of the areas in the ventrolateral frontal region that are involved in language production.

We used high-field strength (7-T) fMRI techniques to image the PAG at high resolution (0.75 mm isotropic), which was critical for dissociating the PAG from the greater signal variability in the aqueduct. Activation while participants were exposed to emotionally aversive images segregated into subregions of the PAG along both dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal axes. In the rostral PAG, activity was localized to lateral and dorsomedial subregions. In caudal PAG, activity was localized to the ventrolateral region. This shifting pattern of activity from dorsal to ventral PAG along the rostrocaudal axis mirrors structural and functional neurobiological observations in nonhuman animals. Activity in lateral and ventrolateral subregions also grouped with distinct emotional experiences (e. g., anger and sadness) in a factor analysis, suggesting that each subregion participates in distinct functional circuitry. This study establishes the use of high-field strength fMRI as a promising technique for revealing the functional architecture of the PAG. The techniques developed here also may be extended to investigate the functional roles of other brainstem nuclei.

This effort was motivated by the HCP's goal of mapping, as completely as possible, the macroscopic structural connections of the in vivo healthy, adult human brain using diffusion tractography. Yet, the 300 mT/m gradient system is well suited to many additional types of diffusion measurements. Here, we present three initial applications of the 300 mT/m gradients that fall outside the immediate scope of the HCP. These include: 1) diffusion tractography to study the anatomy of consciousness and the mechanisms of brain recovery following traumatic coma; 2) q-space measurements of axon diameter distributions in the in vivo human brain and 3) postmortem diffusion tractography as an adjunct to standard histopathological analysis. We show that the improved sensitivity and diffusion-resolution provided by the gradients are rapidly enabling human applications of techniques that were previously possible only for in vitro and animal models on small-bore scanners, thereby creating novel opportunities to map the microstructure of the human brain in health and disease.

It is also possible to extract information about brain connectivity from the covariance of morphological metrics derived from anatomical MRI. These covariance patterns may arise from genetic influences on normal development and aging, from mutual trophic reinforcement as well as from experience-related plasticity. This review describes the basic methodological strategies, the biological basis of the observed covariance as well as applications in normal brain and brain disease before a final review of future prospects for the technique.

It remains unknown how intrinsically asymmetric bundles arise and are concomitantly oriented in the tissue. We report here that mInsc, LGN, and G alpha i proteins, which classically regulate mitotic spindle orientation, are polarized in a lateral microvilli-free region, or "bare zone," at the apical hair cell surface. By creating and extending the bare zone, these proteins trigger a relocalization of the eccentric kinocilium midway toward the cell center. aPKC is restrained medially by mInsc/LGN/G alpha i, resulting in compartmentalization of the apical surface that imparts the V-shaped distribution of stereocilia and brings the asymmetric bundle in register with the relocalized kinocilium. G alpha i is additionally required for lateral orientation of cochlear hair cells, providing a possible mechanism to couple the emergence of asymmetric stereocilia bundles with planar cell polarity.

Interaction of Central and Peripheral Factors during Repeated Sprints at Different Levels of Arterial O-2 Saturation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SKELETAL-MUSCLE RECRUITMENT; EXERCISE PERFORMANCE; HEALTHY HUMANS; NEUROMUSCULAR ACTIVITY; CYCLING EXERCISE; SEVERE HYPOXIA; FATIGUE; OXYGENATION; ALTITUDE; METABOLISM	Purpose: To investigate the interaction between the development of peripheral locomotor muscle fatigue, muscle recruitment and performance during repeated-sprint exercise (RSE). Method: In a single-blind, randomised and cross-over design, ten male team-sport athletes performed two RSE (fifteen 5-s cycling sprints interspersed with 25 s of rest; power self-selected) in normoxia and in acute moderate hypoxia (FIO2 0.138). Mechanical work, total electromyographic intensity (summed quadriceps electromyograms, RMSsum) and muscle (vastus lateralis) and pre-fontal cortex near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) parameters were calculated for every sprint. Blood lactate concentration ([Lac(-)]) was measured throughout the protocol. Peripheral quadriceps fatigue was assessed via changes in potentiated quadriceps twitch force (Delta Q(tw,pot)) pre- versus post-exercise in response to supra-maximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation. The central activation ratio (Q(CAR)) was used to quantify completeness of quadriceps activation. Results: Compared with normoxia, hypoxia reduced arterial oxygen saturation (-13.7%, P=0.001), quadriceps RMSsum (-13.7%, P=0.022), Q(CAR) (-3.3%, P=0.041) and total mechanical work (-8.3%, P=0.019). However, the magnitude of quadriceps fatigue induced by RSE was similar in the two conditions (Delta Q(tw),(pot):-53.5% and -55.1%, P=0.71). The lower cycling performance in hypoxia occurred despite similar metabolic (muscle NIRS parameters and blood [Lac(-)]) and functional (twitch and M-wave) muscle states. Conclusion: Results suggest that the central nervous system regulates quadriceps muscle recruitment and, thereby, performance to limit the development of muscle fatigue during intermittent, short sprints. This finding highlights the complex interaction between muscular perturbations and neural adjustments during sprint exercise, and further supports the presence of pacing during intermittent sprint exercise.

Cellular response to micropatterned growth promoting and inhibitory substrates	BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Microcontact printing; Polylysine; Myelin; Adhesion; Oli-neu; COS7; Primary culture	PELIZAEUS-MERZBACHER DISEASE; MYELIN-ASSOCIATED INHIBITORS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; CNS; DIFFERENTIATION; PROTEIN; KINASE; CELLS; REGENERATION; NETWORKS	Background: Normal development and the response to injury both require cell growth, migration and morphological remodeling, guided by a complex local landscape of permissive and inhibitory cues. A standard approach for studying by such cues is to culture cells on uniform substrates containing known concentrations of these molecules, however this method fails to represent the molecular complexity of the natural growth environment. Results: To mimic the local complexity of environmental conditions in vitro, we used a contact micropatterning technique to examine cell growth and differentiation on patterned substrates printed with the commonly studied growth permissive and inhibitory substrates, poly-L-lysine (PLL) and myelin, respectively. We show that micropatterning of PLL can be used to direct adherence and axonal outgrowth of hippocampal and cortical neurons as well as other cells with diverse morphologies like Oli-neu oligodendrocyte progenitor cell lines and fibroblast-like COS7 cells in culture. Surprisingly, COS7 cells exhibited a preference for low concentration (1 pg/mL) PLL zones over adjacent zones printed with high concentrations (1 mg/mL). We demonstrate that micropatterning is also useful for studying factors that inhibit growth as it can direct cells to grow along straight lines that are easy to quantify. Furthermore, we provide the first demonstration of microcontact printing of myelin-associated proteins and show that they impair process outgrowth from Oli-neu oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Conclusion: We conclude that microcontact printing is an efficient and reproducible method for patterning proteins and brain-derived myelin on glass surfaces in order to study the effects of the microenvironment on cell growth and morphogenesis.

We sought to determine if genetic polymorphisms associated with MS susceptibility are associated with attack location. Methods: 17 genome-wide association study-identified MS susceptibility polymorphisms were genotyped in 503 white, non-Hispanic patients seen within a year of MS onset. Their association with the CNS location of the first two MS attacks was assessed in multivariate repeated measures analyses (generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors). Results: The IL12A polymorphism was independently associated with increased odds of attacks involving the spinal cord (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.11, 2.07, p = 0.009), as was the IRF8 polymorphism (OR = 2.40, 95% CI [1.04, 5.50], p = 0.040). The IL7R polymorphism was associated with reduced odds of attacks involving the brainstem/cerebellum (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.22, 0.97, p = 0.041), as were the TNFRSF1A and IL12A polymorphisms. The CD6 polymorphism conferred reduced odds of optic neuritis as an attack location (OR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.49, 0.97], p = 0.034). Several other genes showed trends for association with attack location. Conclusions: Some of the MS susceptibility genes may be associated with MS attack location. The IL12A polymorphism is of particular interest given that interferon beta therapy appears to influence IL12 levels. These findings may lead to improved understanding of MS pathogenesis and treatment.

REDUCED EXPRESSION OF PAIN MEDIATORS AND PAIN SENSITIVITY IN AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN OVER-EXPRESSING CRND8 TRANSGENIC MICE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta-amyloid; amyloid precursor protein; nociception; inflammatory pain; dorsal root ganglion; CRND8 transgenic mice	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RAT; AGE; NEURONS; MOUSE; APP; MECHANISMS; DEPOSITION	beta-Amyloid (A beta) peptides are derived from the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). They are enriched in plaques present in Alzheimer's brains and thus play important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. APP is also known to be expressed in the neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and contributes to neuronal survival and axonal growth during development. However, whether APP and A beta peptides are involved in nociception and pathological pain states is mostly unknown. In the present study, we have used behavioral, biochemical and morphological approaches to address this issue in both adult rats and APP over-expressing CRND8 transgenic mice. We observed that the A beta peptide (17-24) was predominantly expressed in small-sized DRG neurons of rats. Following intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA), the levels of APP and A beta peptides were significantly reduced in the ipsilateral lumbar 4-6 rat DRG. In 3-, 12- and 24-month-old CRND8 mice, pain sensitivity in response to heat and mechanical stimulation was significantly dampened compared to their age-matched wild-type littermates. In parallel with reduced pain sensitivity, the expression of pain mediators such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 was significantly reduced in L4-6 DRG of CRND8 mice. Although i.pl. injection of CFA induced a rather similar pattern of inflammatory pain in 3-month-old CRND8 mice and their wild-type littermates, recovery from inflammatory pain seemed faster in 12-month-old CRND8 mice than wild-type mice. These findings suggest that APP and A beta peptides suppress both nociception and inflammatory pain and are likely involved in blunt pain perception of Alzheimer's patients in clinical settings.

We sought to determine if polymorphisms in MS susceptibility genes are associated with these attack features or with the risk of a second attack. Methods: 503 white subjects evaluated within a year of MS onset were included in the study. The severity of and recovery from the first two attacks were determined based on published definitions. Seventeen MS susceptibility genes were genotyped at the UCSF MS Genetics laboratory. Each polymorphism was evaluated in multivariate ordinal models, adjusted for the other polymorphisms, for its association with attack severity and recovery. We also assessed if these polymorphisms were associated with increased risk of a second attack. Results: The MPHOSPH9 polymorphism was associated with greater attack severity (odds ratios [OR] = 1.47, 95% CI [1.11, 1.94], p = 0.008), while the RGS1 and TNFRSF1A polymorphisms tended to be associated with reduced attack severity. The CD6 polymorphism tended to be associated with increased odds of worse attack recovery (OR = 1.25, 95% CI [0.93, 1.68], p = 0.13). In those who were HLA-DRB1-negative, the EVI5 polymorphism was associated with attacks of less severity; in HLA-DRB1 positive patients, EVI5 was associated with attacks of greater severity and worse recovery. The IL7R, TNFRSF1A, and GPC5 polymorphisms tended to be associated with having a second event within a year. Conclusions: Some MS susceptibility polymorphisms may be associated with attack severity, recovery, or frequency. Further characterization of these genes may lead to a better understanding of MS pathogenesis and to a more individualized treatment approach.

Task decomposition: a framework for comparing diverse training models in human brain plasticity studies	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						expertise; plasticity; training; MRI; multisensory learning	CORTEX; NEUROPLASTICITY; ADAPTATION; SYSTEM; MEMORY; MUSIC; FMRI	Training studies, in which the structural of functional neurophysiology is compared before and after expertise is acquired, are increasingly being used as models for understanding the human brain's potential for reorganization. It is proving difficult to use these results to answer basic and important questions like how task training leads to both specific and general changes in behavior and how these changes correspond with modifications in the brain. The main culprit is the diversity of paradigms used as complex task models. An assortment of activities ranging from juggling to deciphering Morse code has been reported. Even when working in the same general domain, few researchers use similar training models. New ways to meaningfully compare complex tasks are needed. We propose a method for characterizing and deconstructing the task requirements of complex training paradigms, which is suitable for application to both structural and functional neuroimaging studies. We believe this approach will aid brain plasticity research by making it easier to compare training paradigms, identity "missing puzzle pieces," and encourage researchers to design training protocols to bridge these gaps.

Effects of acidification on olfactory-mediated behaviour in freshwater and marine ecosystems: a synthesis	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						climate change; ocean acidification; acid rain; fish behaviour; olfaction; chemoreception	SALMON SALMO-SALAR; JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON; ACID-BASE REGULATION; CHEMICAL ALARM CUES; ACQUIRED PREDATOR RECOGNITION; CORAL-REEF FISHES; EEL ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA; LOCKED SOCKEYE-SALMON; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; LOW-PH	For many aquatic organisms, olfactory-mediated behaviour is essential to the maintenance of numerous fitness-enhancing activities, including foraging, reproduction and predator avoidance. Studies in both freshwater and marine ecosystems have demonstrated significant impacts of anthropogenic acidification on olfactory abilities of fish and macroinvertebrates, leading to impaired behavioural responses, with potentially far-reaching consequences to population dynamics and community structure. Whereas the ecological impacts of impaired olfactory-mediated behaviour may be similar between freshwater and marine ecosystems, the underlying mechanisms are quite distinct. In acidified freshwater, molecular change to chemical cues along with reduced olfaction sensitivity appear to be the primary causes of olfactory-mediated behavioural impairment. By contrast, experiments simulating future ocean acidification suggest that interference of high CO2 with brain neurotransmitter function is the primary cause for olfactory-mediated behavioural impairment in fish. Different physico-chemical characteristics between marine and freshwater systems are probably responsible for these distinct mechanisms of impairment, which, under globally rising CO2 levels, may lead to strikingly different consequences to olfaction. While fluctuations in pH may occur in both freshwater and marine ecosystems, marine habitat will remain alkaline despite future ocean acidification caused by globally rising CO2 levels. In this synthesis, we argue that ecosystem-specific mechanisms affecting olfaction need to be considered for effective management and conservation practices.	[Leduc, Antoine O. H.

Notably, the nature of the relation between the SCN clock and subordinate oscillators in the rest of the brain is not well defined. We performed a high temporal resolution analysis of the expression of the circadian clock protein PERIOD2 (PER2) in the rat forebrain to characterize the distribution, amplitude and phase of PER2 rhythms across different regions. Eighty-four LEW/Crl male rats were entrained to a 12-h: 12-h light/dark cycle, and subsequently perfused every 30 min across the 24-h day for a total of 48 time-points. PER2 expression was assessed with immunohistochemistry and analyzed using automated cell counts. We report the presence of PER2 expression in 20 forebrain areas important for a wide range of motivated and appetitive behaviors including the SCN, bed nucleus, and several regions of the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, and cortex. Eighteen areas displayed significant PER2 rhythms, which peaked at different times of day. Our data demonstrate a previously uncharacterized regional distribution of rhythms of a clock protein expression in the brain that provides a sound basis for future studies of circadian clock function in animal models of disease.

Methods: The present study used in vivo synaptic field potential recording techniques to determine how exposure to cues associated with food reward modulates synaptic responses in the entorhinal cortex of the awake rat. Chronically implanted electrodes were used to monitor synaptic potentials in the entorhinal cortex evoked by stimulation of the piriform (olfactory) cortex, and to determine how synaptic responses are modulated by food-related cues. Results: The amplitudes of evoked synaptic responses were reduced during exposure to cues associated with delivery of chocolate, and during delivery of chocolate for consumption at unpredictable intervals. Reductions in synaptic responses were not well predicted by changes in behavioural mobility, and were not fully blocked by systemic injection of either the D-1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390, or the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine. However, the reduction in synaptic responses was blocked by injection of the D-2-like receptor antagonist eticlopride. Conclusions: Exposure to cues associated with palatable food results in a suppression of synaptic responses in olfactory inputs to the entorhinal cortex that is mediated in part by activation of dopamine D-2 receptors.

As such, the aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between visual status and an important brain structure with a well established role in spatial cognition and navigation, the caudate nucleus. We conducted a volumetric analysis of the caudate nucleus in congenitally and late blind individuals, as well as in matched sighted control subjects. Results: No differences in the volume of the structure were found either between congenitally blind (CB) and matched sighted controls or between late blind (LB) and matched sighted controls. Moreover, contrary to what was expected, no significant correlation was found between caudate volume and performance in a spatial navigation task. Finally, consistent with previously published reports, the volume of the caudate nucleus was found to be negatively correlated with age in the sighted; however such correlations were not significant in the blind groups. Conclusion: Although there were no group differences, the absence of an age-volume correlation in the blind suggests that visual deprivation may still have an effect on the developmental changes that occur in the caudate nucleus.

Infusions of ascorbic acid into the medial preoptic area facilitate appetitive sexual behavior in the female rat	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Ascorbic acid; Appetitive behaviors; Medial preoptic area; Female sexual behavior; Steroid hormones	NEOSTRIATAL MEMBRANE PREPARATIONS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; AMPHETAMINE; ANTAGONISTS; COPULATION; LORDOSIS; BRAIN	Ascorbic acid (AA), also known as Vitamin C, enhances dopamine (DA) transmission in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal terminals and augments DA-mediated behaviors. It is not yet known whether AA has a similar influence in other DA terminals, in particular terminals of the incertohypothalamic system that modulate the function of the medial preoptic area (mPOA). In female rats, DA in the mPOA plays a critical role in the generation of appetitive sexual responses, notably solicitations, hops, and darts, and we have shown previously that the role of DA in this region on female sexual behavior changes depending on the hormonal profile of the female. Since AA has often been used as a vehicle control in the examination of rat sexual behavior, the present study examined the effect of infusions of AA to the mPOA of sexual experienced ovariectomized rats under two hormonal conditions: partially-primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) alone or fully-primed with EB and progesterone. Relative to saline baselines, females under both hormonal conditions displayed a significant increase in appetitive sexual behaviors following infusions of AA. No difference in lordosis behavior was observed following AA infusions relative to saline baselines. We suggest that the mechanism by which AA infusions to the mPOA increase appetitive sexual behaviors in female rats may be through dose-dependent DA receptor interactions, possibly through both presynaptic release mechanisms and postsynaptic DA D1-related messenger systems.

Identification and function of long non-coding RNA	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						non-coding RNA; epigenetics; gene regulation; neurodevelopment	ENDOGENOUS RNA; DIFFERENTIATION; TRANSCRIPTION; EXPRESSION; CHROMATIN; DISEASE; GENOME; TISSUE; MOUSE; TRANSLATION	Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs are defined as non-protein coding RNAs distinct from housekeeping RNAs such as tRNAs, rRNAs, and snRNAs, and independent from small RNAs with specific molecular processing machinery such as micro- or piwi-RNAs. Recent studies of lncRNAs across different species have revealed a diverse population of RNA molecules of differing size and function. RNA sequencing studies suggest transcription throughout the genome, so there is a need to understand how sequence relates to functional and structural relationships amongst RNA molecules. Our synthesis of recent studies suggests that neither size, presence of a poly-A tail, splicing, direction of transcription, nor strand specificity are of importance to lncRNA function. Rather, relative genomic position in relation to a target is fundamentally important. In this review, we describe issues of key importance in functional assessment of lncRNA and how this might apply to lncRNAs important in neurodevelopment.

ERD is supposed to reflect M1 activation, sending information to recruited muscles, while the process underlying ERS is interpreted either as active cortical inhibition or as processing of sensory inputs. Investigation of the process behind ERD/ERS in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) would be particularly relevant since their M1 remains effective despite decreased sensorimotor abilities. In this study, we recorded net joint torque and EEG in 6 participants with cervical SCI and 8 healthy participants who performed isometric elbow flexion at 3 force levels. Multifaceted EEG analysis was introduced to assess ERD/ERS according to their amplitude, frequency range and duration. The results revealed that net joint torque increased with the required force level for all participants and time to contraction inhibition was longer in the SCI group. At the cortical level, ERD/ERS frequency ranges increased with the required force level in all participants, indicating that the modulation of cortical activity with force level is preserved after SCI. However, ERS amplitude decreased only in SCI participants, which may be linked to delayed contraction inhibition. All in all, cortical modulation of frequency range and amplitude could reflect two different kinds of neural communication. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mechanisms that link the transient neuronal insult to the lasting state of epilepsy are unknown. Here we tested the possible role of DNA methylation in mediating long-term induction of epileptiform activity by transient kainic acid exposure using in vitro and in vivo rodent models. We analyzed changes in the gria2 gene, which encodes for the GluA2 subunit of the ionotropic glutamate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid receptor and is well documented to play a role in epilepsy. We show that kainic acid exposure for two hours to mouse hippocampal slices triggers methylation of a 5' regulatory region of the gria2 gene. Increase in methylation persists one week after removal of the drug, with concurrent suppression of gria2 mRNA expression levels. The degree of kainic acid-induced hypermethylation of gria2 5' region varies between individual slices and correlates with the changes in excitability induced by kainic acid. In a rat in vivo model of post kainic acid-induced epilepsy, we show similar hypermethylation of the 5' region of gria2. Inter-individual variations in gria2 methylation, correlate with the frequency and intensity of seizures among epileptic rats. Luciferase reporter assays support a regulatory role for methylation of gria2 5' region. Inhibition of DNA methylation by RG108 blocked kainic acid-induced hypermethylation of gria2 5' region in hippocampal slice cultures and bursting activity. Our results suggest that DNA methylation of such genes as gria2 mediates persistent epileptiform activity and inter-individual differences in the epileptic response to neuronal insult and that pharmacological agents that block DNA methylation inhibit epileptiform activity raising the prospect of DNA methylation inhibitors in epilepsy therapeutics.

J	Pribiag, H; Stellwagen, D				Pribiag, Horia; Stellwagen, David			TNF-alpha Downregulates Inhibitory Neurotransmission through Protein Phosphatase 1-Dependent Trafficking of GABA(A) Receptors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; AP2 ADAPTER COMPLEX; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; GABAERGIC SYNAPSES; INACTIVE PROTEIN; GAMMA-2 SUBUNIT; DIRECT BINDING; MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING; DEPENDENT REGULATION	Inflammation has been implicated in the progression of neurological disease, yet precisely how inflammation affects neuronal function remains unclear. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine that regulates synapse function by controlling neurotransmitter receptor trafficking and homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Here we characterize the mechanisms through which TNF alpha regulates inhibitory synapse function in mature rat and mouse hippocampal neurons. Acute application of TNF alpha induces a rapid and persistent decrease of inhibitory synaptic strength and downregulation of cell-surface levels of GABA(A)Rs containing alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 2/3, and gamma 2 subunits. We show that trafficking of GABA(A)Rs in response to TNF alpha is mediated by neuronally expressed TNF receptor 1 and requires activation of p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and dynamin GTPase. Furthermore, TNF alpha enhances the association of PP1 with GABA(A)R beta 3 subunits and dephosphorylates a site on beta 3 known to regulate phospho-dependent interactions with the endocytic machinery. Conversely, we find that calcineurin and PP2A are not essential components of the signaling pathway and that clustering of the scaffolding protein gephyrin is only reduced after the initial receptor endocytosis. Together, these findings demonstrate a distinct mechanism of regulated GABAAR endocytosis that may contribute to the disruption of circuit homeostasis under neuroinflammatory conditions.

These test statistics have been proposed in the neuroscience literature for the analysis of fMRI data allowing for unknown delay in the hemodynamic response. However the null distribution of the maximum of this 3D random field of test statistics, and hence the threshold used to detect brain activation, was unsolved. To find a solution, we approximate the P-value by the expected Euler characteristic (EC) of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. Our main result is the required EC density, derived using the Gaussian Kinematic Formula.

We conducted a longitudinal study of 181 Chinese adolescents in Chengdu City, China. The participants were followed from 10th to 11th grade. When they were in the 10th grade (Time 1), we tested these adolescents' decision-making using the IGT and working memory capacity using the Self-ordered Pointing Test (SORT). Self-report questionnaires were used to assess school academic performance and smoking behaviors. The same questionnaires were completed again at the 1-year follow-up (Time 2). The Expectancy-Valence (EV) Model was applied to distill the IGT performance into three different underlying psychological components: (i) a motivational component which indicates the subjective weight the adolescents assign to gains vs. losses; (ii) a learning-rate component which indicates the sensitivity to recent outcomes vs. past experiences; and (iii) a response component which indicates how consistent the adolescents are between learning and responding. The subjective weight to gains vs. losses at Time 1 significantly predicted current smokers and current smoking levels at Time 2, controlling for demographic variables and baseline smoking behaviors. Therefore, by decomposing the IGT into three different psychological components, we found that the motivational process of weight gain vs. losses may serve as a neuropsychological marker to predict adolescent smoking behaviors in a general youth population.

MR Imaging Features of Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							ANGIOPATHY-RELATED INFLAMMATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; BETA; BAPINEUZUMAB; TRIALS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: AD is one of the few leading causes of death without a disease-modifying drug; however, hopeful agents are in various phases of development. MR imaging abnormalities, collectively referred to as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, have been reported for several agents that target cerebral A beta burden. ARIA includes ARIA-E, parenchymal or sulcal hyperintensities on FLAIR indicative of parenchymal edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H, hypointense regions on gradient recalled-echo/T2* indicative of hemosiderin deposition. This report describes imaging characteristics of ARIA-E and ARIA-H identified during studies of bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against A beta. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two neuroradiologists with knowledge of imaging changes reflective of ARIA reviewed MR imaging scans from 210 bapineuzumab-treated patients derived from 3 phase 2 studies. Each central reader interpreted the studies independently, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The inter-reader kappa was 0.76, with 94% agreement between neuroradiologists regarding the presence or absence of ARIA-E in individual patients. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were identified with incident ARIA-E (17.1%, 36/210) and 26 with incident ARIA-H (12.4%, 26/210); of those with incident ARIA-H, 24 had incident microhemorrhages and 2 had incident large superficial hemosiderin deposits. CONCLUSIONS: In 49% of cases of ARIA-E, there was the associated appearance of ARIA-H. In treated patients without ARIA-E, the risk for incident blood products was 4%. This association between ARIA-E and ARIA-H may suggest a common pathophysiologic mechanism. Familiarity with ARIA should permit radiologists and clinicians to recognize and communicate ARIA findings more reliably for optimal patient management.

Residency programs in North America are focused on achieving an adequate level of training to produce technically competent surgeons. The training requirements and educational environments needed to produce expert surgeons are incompletely understood. This review explores the theoretical implications of training technical skills to expertise rather than competency in a complex field such as neurosurgery. First, the terms technical expertise and technical competency are defined. Definitions of these qualities are lacking in all surgical specialties. Second, the assessment of technical skills of neurosurgeons are investigated using an expert performance approach. This approach entails the design of tasks that can capture the level of expertise in a reproducible manner. One method to accomplish this involves the use of novel simulators with validated performance metrics. Third, the training of technical skills using simulation is studied in the optic of developing training curricula that would target the development of expertise rather than simple competency. Such curricula should include objective assessments of technical skills, appropriate feedback, and a distributed schedule of deliberate practice. Implementing a focus on the development of expertise rather than simple competency in surgical performance will lead to innovative developments in the field of neurosurgical education. Novel technologies, such as simulation, will play important roles in the training of future expert surgeons, and focused technical skills curricula with a sound theoretical basis should guide the development of all such programs.

Currently there are 2 commercially available simulators: NeuroTouch (Cranio and Endo) developed by the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with surgeons at teaching hospitals in Canada, and the Immersive Touch. Work in progress on other simulators at additional institutions is currently unpublished. OBJECTIVE: This article describes a newly developed application of the NeuroTouch simulator that facilitates the performance and assessment of technical skills for endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgical procedures as well as plans for collecting metrics during its early use. METHODS: The main components of the NeuroTouch-Endo VR neurosurgical simulator are a stereovision system, bimanual haptic tool manipulators, and high-end computers. The software engine continues to evolve, allowing additional surgical tasks to be performed in the VR environment. Device utility for efficient practice and performance metrics continue to be developed by its originators in collaboration with neurosurgeons at several teaching hospitals in the United States. Training tasks are being developed for teaching 1- and 2-nostril endonasal transsphenoidal approaches. Practice sessions benefit from anatomic labeling of normal structures along the surgical approach and inclusion (for avoidance) of critical structures, such as the internal carotid arteries and optic nerves. CONCLUSION: The simulation software for NeuroTouch-Endo VR simulation of transsphenoidal surgery provides an opportunity for beta testing, validation, and evaluation of performance metrics for use in neurosurgical residency training.

Partitioning the Heritability of Tourette Syndrome and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Reveals Differences in Genetic Architecture	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							MISSING HERITABILITY; TIC DISORDERS; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; COMPLEX DISEASES; COMMON SNPS; GILLES; FAMILY; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; AUTISM	The direct estimation of heritability from genome-wide common variant data as implemented in the program Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) has provided a means to quantify heritability attributable to all interrogated variants. We have quantified the variance in liability to disease explained by all SNPs for two phenotypically-related neurobehavioral disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette Syndrome (TS), using GCTA. Our analysis yielded a heritability point estimate of 0.58 (se = 0.09, p = 5.64e-12) for TS, and 0.37 (se = 0.07, p = 1.5e-07) for OCD. In addition, we conducted multiple genomic partitioning analyses to identify genomic elements that concentrate this heritability. We examined genomic architectures of TS and OCD by chromosome, MAF bin, and functional annotations. In addition, we assessed heritability for early onset and adult onset OCD. Among other notable results, we found that SNPs with a minor allele frequency of less than 5% accounted for 21% of the TS heritability and 0% of the OCD heritability. Additionally, we identified a significant contribution to TS and OCD heritability by variants significantly associated with gene expression in two regions of the brain (parietal cortex and cerebellum) for which we had available expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Finally we analyzed the genetic correlation between TS and OCD, revealing a genetic correlation of 0.41 (se = 0.15, p = 0.002). These results are very close to previous heritability estimates for TS and OCD based on twin and family studies, suggesting that very little, if any, heritability is truly missing (i.e., unassayed) from TS and OCD GWAS studies of common variation. The results also indicate that there is some genetic overlap between these two phenotypically-related neuropsychiatric disorders, but suggest that the two disorders have distinct genetic architectures.

The attempts often fail when multiple habits must be changed in unison. Here we explore relations among food addiction, the neurobiology of habits, and caloric restriction, when people seek to return to normal eating behaviour, with particular emphasis on the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Severely obese individuals have specific neurobiological characteristics in common with drug abusers, including low availability of dopamine receptors in the striatum, impaired neuronal responses to dopamine, and reduced activity in prefrontal regions of the cerebral cortex. The neurobiological characteristics suggest that obese people also have a pathological dependence in common with addicts, in the form of food addiction. Malnutrition and dieting both relate to binge eating, possibly as a compensation for a reduced cognitive reward condition. The combination of caloric restriction and food addiction imparts a high risk of relapse as a result of further reduction of dopaminergic neurotransmission and the subsequent loss of reward. As with drugs of abuse, ingestion of large quantities of sugar in circumstances of uncontrolled eating increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. This and other evidence suggests that abuse of food is a habit learned by means of mechanisms centred in the basal ganglia, with an increased risk of relapse in the presence of associative amplifiers. This risk is predicted by the relationship between dopamine receptor availability in the striatum and sensation-seeking in the form of an inverted U, suggested by recent findings, consistent with two opposite states of hypodopaminergic and hyperdopaminergic neuromodulation.

SYNE1 Mutations in Autosomal Recessive Cerebellar Ataxia	JAMA NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NEWLY DISCOVERED FORM; LEAD; DNA	IMPORTANCE Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type I, also known as recessive ataxia of Beauce, is a slowly progressive ataxia that leads to moderate disability with gait ataxia, dysarthria, dysmetria, mild oculomotor abnormalities, and diffuse cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging. Mutations in the synaptic nuclear envelope protein 1 (SYNE1) gene, located on chromosome 6p25, were first reported in patients who originated from a region known as "Beauce" in the province of Quebec, Canada. OBJECTIVE To better evaluate the prevalence of SYNE1 mutations in individuals with mild pure cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar atrophy, we screened the gene in additional French-Canadian (FC) families and individuals from other populations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Study participants were referred by their treating physician on the basis of core features of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type I. After excluding individuals with known SYNE1 mutations, our cohort was composed mainly of 19 FCs and 21 individuals from other ethnic backgrounds. INTERVENTIONS Extraction of DNA from blood samples and complete resequencing of the SYNE1 gene. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The involvement of SYNE1 mutations in individuals with ataxia worldwide by resequencing the SYNE1 gene. RESULTS Two novel truncating mutations were found among the FC participants, and 2 other novel mutations were found in a patient from France and a patient from Brazil (1 mutation each). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This is the second report, to our knowledge, of SYNE1 gene mutations in a population other than FCs. These data suggest that mutations in SYNE1 should be investigated in families with cerebellar ataxia who live outside the FC region.

Time-dependence between upper arm muscles activity during rapid movements: Observation of the proportional effects predicted by the kinematic theory	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Rapid hand movements; Proportional effect; EMG; Delta-Lognormal model; Kinematic theory	VELOCITY PROFILES; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; GENERATION	Rapid human movements can be assimilated to the output of a neuromuscular system with an impulse response modeled by a Delta-Lognormal equation. In such a model, the main assumption concerns the cumulative time delays of the response as it propagates toward the effector following a command. To verify the validity of this assumption, delays between bursts in electromyographic (EMG) signals of agonist and antagonist muscles activated during a rapid hand movement were investigated. Delays were measured between the surface EMG signals of six muscles of the upper limb during single rapid handwriting strokes. From EMG envelopes, regressions were obtained between the timing of the burst of activity produced by each monitored muscle. High correlation coefficients were obtained supporting the proportionality of the cumulative time delays, the basic hypothesis of the Delta-Lognormal model. A paradigm governing the sequence of muscle activities in a rapid movement could, in the long run, be useful for applications dealing with the analysis and synthesis of human movements.

Our study was performed on a large (120 participants) and varied sample (both genders, wide age range, various health conditions). The delta-lognormal equation was used for data modeling to investigate the interaction between the output of the agonist and the antagonist neuromuscular systems. Empirical observations show that the subjects must correlate more tightly the impulse commands sent to both neuromuscular systems in order to achieve good performances as the difficulty of the task increases whereas the correlation in the timing of the neuromuscular action co-varies with the size of the geometrical properties of the task. These new phenomena are discussed under the paradigm provided by the Kinematic Theory and new research hypotheses are proposed for further investigation of the speed/accuracy tradeoffs.

Another goal was to examine whether gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) might be altered following NFT in frontal and parietal cortical areas connected by these WM fiber pathways. Healthy university students were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EXP), a sham group, or a control group. Participants in the EXP group were trained to enhance the amplitude of their beta 1 waves at F4 and P4. Measures of attentional performance and MRI data were acquired one week before (Time 1) and one week after (Time 2) NFT. Higher scores on visual and auditory sustained attention were noted in the EXP group at Time 2 (relative to Time 1). As for structural MRI data, increased fractional anisotropy was measured in WM pathways implicated in sustained attention, and GMV increases were detected in cerebral structures involved in this type of attention. After 50 years of research in the field of neurofeedback, our study constitutes the first empirical demonstration that NFT can lead to microstructural changes in white and gray matter.

J	Rivat, C; Bollag, L; Richebe, P				Rivat, Cyril; Bollag, Laurent; Richebe, Philippe			Mechanisms of regional anaesthesia protection against hyperalgesia and pain chronicization	CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Review						chronic pain after surgery; hyperalgesia; regional anaesthesia	PERSISTENT POSTSURGICAL PAIN; PREVENTING CHRONIC PAIN; HIND PAW INFLAMMATION; SCIATIC-NERVE BLOCK; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; BREAST SURGERY; SPINAL-CORD; ANALGESIA; RATS; REMIFENTANIL	Purpose of reviewThe aim of the present review is to describe how regional anaesthesia might oppose neuronal changes that surgery and opioids cause in the central nervous system to block both pain sensitization and chronicization following surgery. This might help anaesthesiologists to better understand the impact of their practice on the development of postoperative chronic pain.Recent findingsEven though there are more evidences from animals and clinical trials showing that regional anaesthesia might impact the acute pain/hyperalgesia and chronic postsurgical pain, the controversy on how and when to use regional anesthesia to avoid chronic pain persists. Animal studies brought only a very partial answer on what to do in our daily clinical practice. Clinical studies were performed in different types of surgery with various protocols so that a strong conclusion on whether or not using regional anesthesia might benefit the patient to decrease the risk of postoperative chronic pain remains unclear. Studies performed with neuraxial anaesthesia seem to bring better evidences than those with nerve blocks. Future studies will have to specifically evaluate acute hyperalgesia and postoperative chronic pain and not only the classical pain scores and analgesic consumption to bring us the answer we all need.SummaryRegional anaesthesia is able to reduce postoperative acute hyperalgesia and long-term chronic pain by decreasing pain sensitization induced by the surgery itself, and intraoperative use and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Nevertheless, clinical studies on neuraxial anaesthesia and nerve blocks did not bring so far a strong conclusion to this question, and further better designed studies are necessary.

Several familial forms of TLE have been described, including familial lateral TLE (FLTLE), familial mesial TLE (FMTLE) without hippocampal sclerosis, and FMTLE with hippocampal sclerosis. Mutations have been identified only in the leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene on chromosome 10q22-q24 in FLTLE. Several loci have been mapped in families with FMTLE, but responsible genes have not been found. We report clinical evaluation in a large family with FMTLE and a new genetic locus. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide scan using 10 cM-spaced microsatellite markers on a family with TLE. Seven individuals had TLE without antecedent FS; four other individuals had FS during childhood, but no subsequent epilepsy. Patients with TLE had infrequent simple partial, complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures that generally responded well to treatment. The proband had no hippocampal sclerosis. The mode of inheritance appeared to be autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Linkage analysis was performed using the Genehunter software. Regions with LOD score > 1 and those that were poorly informative in the first-pass scan were further genotyped. Results: Linkage was identified on chromosome 3q25-q26 in a 13 cM region flanked by markers D3S1584 and D3S3520, with a peak LOD score of 3.23. This interval does not correspond to any previously known locus for familial epilepsy or FS. KCNAB1, encoding a voltage-gated, shaker-related potassium channel, and NLGN1, encoding a member of a family of neuronal cell surface protein were excluded as disease causing mutations. Conclusion: We identified a novel locus for familial TLE with FS, providing additional evidence of the complexity and genetic heterogeneity of familial focal epilepsy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Thirty-two patients were studied, subdivided in four categories based on IED frequency: groups A, B and C respectively with high, intermediate and low IED rate, and group D with no IED. Thirty minutes of slow-wave sleep EEG, low-pass filtered at 300 Hz and sampled at 1000 Hz, were reviewed. IEDs and fast oscillations (gamma activity, 40-80 Hz; and ripples, >80 Hz) were marked. Each channel was classified as inside or outside the irritative zone and the SOZ. We calculated the number and rates of IEDs and fast oscillation, their co-occurrence, their frequency in the irritative zone and SOZ, and the specificity, sensitivity and accuracy to determine the SOZ in the overall population and separately for each group. Results: We analyzed 984 channels. Group A (high IED rate) showed the highest fast oscillation rate (gamma: 0.37 +/- 0.73; ripples: 0.17 +/- 0.26), followed by group B (gamma: 0.08 +/- 0.06; ripples: 0.07 +/- 0.05), group C (gamma: 0.06 +/- 0.06; ripples: 0.04 +/- 0.01), and finally group D, with very low values (gamma: 0.03 +/- 0; ripples: 0.03 +/- 0). IEDs co-occurred with gamma in 9.5% and with ripples in 3.2%; and gamma and ripples co-occurred with IEDs in 46.2% and 44.4%, respectively. The fast oscillations were more frequent inside than outside the irritative zone and the SOZ (p < 0.001). Compared to the IEDs, the fast oscillations were less sensitive (sensitivity: IEDs 78%, gamma 66% and ripples 48%) but more specific (specificity: IEDs 50%, gamma 76% and ripples 83%) and accurate (accuracy: IEDs 54%, gamma 74% and ripples 77%) in identifying the SOZ; the same results were reproduced for the different groups separately. Conclusions: This study confirms that fast oscillations can be recorded from the scalp EEG. Gamma activity and ripples are more frequent in patients with frequent IEDs and, in general, inside the irritative zone. However, compared to IEDs, gamma and ripples are less sensitive but more specific and accurate in identifying the SOZ, and this remains in patients with low fast oscillation rates. These findings suggest that IEDs and fast oscillations could share some common neuronal network, but gamma activity and ripples are a better biomarker of epileptogenicity (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed system has a low-power front-end bioamplifier and a seizure detector with intelligent mechanism to reduce power dissipation. This system eliminates the unnecessary clock gating during normal neural activity monitoring mode and reduces power dissipation in the seizure detector; as a result, this device is suitable for long-term implantable applications. The proposed system includes analog and digital building blocks with programmable parameters for extracting electrographic seizure onset information from real-time EEG recordings. Sensitivity of the detector is enhanced by optimizing the variable parameters based on specific electrographic seizure onset activities of each patient. The detection algorithm was validated using Matlab tools and implemented in standard 0.13 mu m CMOS process with total die area of 1.5 x 1.5 mm(2). The fabricated chip is validated offline using intracranial EEG recordings from two patients with refractory epilepsy. Total power consumption of the chip is 9 mu W and average detection delay is 13.7 s after seizure onset, well before the onset of clinical manifestation. The proposed system achieves an accurate detection performance with 100% sensitivity and no false alarms during the analyses of 15 seizures and 19 non-seizure datasets.

We provide evidence from both human and animal studies for the critical role of the classical neuronal guidance cue, semaphorin 3A, in instigating pathological vascular permeability in diabetic retinas via its cognate receptor neuropilin-1. We reveal that semaphorin 3A is induced in early hyperglycemic phases of diabetes within the neuronal retina and precipitates initial breakdown of endothelial barrier function. We demonstrate, by a series of orthogonal approaches, that neutralization of semaphorin 3A efficiently prevents diabetes-induced retinal vascular leakage in a stage of the disease when vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization is inefficient. These observations were corroborated in Tg(Cre-Esr1)/Nrp1(flox/flox) conditional knockout mice. Our findings identify a therapeutic target for macular edema and provide further evidence for neurovascular crosstalk in the pathogenesis of DR.

The accuracy of these techniques are limited due to atlas biases, misregistration, and resampling error. Multi-atlas-based approaches are used as a remedy and involve matching each subject to a number of manually labeled templates. This approach yields numerous independent segmentations that are fused using a voxel-by-voxel label-voting procedure. In this article, we demonstrate how the multi-atlas approach can be extended to work with input atlases that are unique and extremely time consuming to construct by generating a library of multiple automatically generated templates of different brains (MAGeT Brain). We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for the mouse and human using two different nonlinear registration algorithms (ANIMAL and ANTs). The input atlases consist a high-resolution mouse brain atlas and an atlas of the human basal ganglia and thalamus derived from serial histological data. MAGeT Brain segmentation improves the identification of the mouse anterior commissure (mean Dice Kappa values (kappa = 0.801), but may be encountering a ceiling effect for hippocampal segmentations. Applying MAGeT Brain to human subcortical structures improves segmentation accuracy for all structures compared to regular model-based techniques (kappa = 0.845, 0.752, and 0.861 for the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, respectively). Experiments performed with three manually derived input templates suggest that MAGeT Brain can approach or exceed the accuracy of multi-atlas label-fusion segmentation (kappa = 0.894, 0.815, and 0.895 for the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, respectively).

However, mTOR takes on an additional, more specialized role in the developed neuron, where it regulates the protein synthesis-dependent, plastic changes underlying learning and memory. mTOR is sequestered in two multiprotein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that have different substrate specificities, thus allowing for distinct functions at synapses. We will examine how learning activates the mTOR complexes, survey the critical effectors of this pathway in the context of synaptic plasticity, and assess whether mTOR plays an instructive or permissive role in generating molecular memory traces.

Recently, it has been shown that a novel dichoptic videogame-based treatment for amblyopia can improve visual function in adult patients, at least in part, by reducing inhibition of inputs from the amblyopic eye to the visual cortex. Non-invasive anodal transcranial direct current stimulation has been shown to reduce the activity of inhibitory cortical interneurons when applied to the primary motor or visual cortex. In this double-blind, sham-controlled cross-over study we tested the hypothesis that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the visual cortex would enhance the therapeutic effects of dichoptic videogame-based treatment. A homogeneous group of 16 young adults (mean age 22.1 +/- 1.1 years) with amblyopia were studied to compare the effect of dichoptic treatment alone and dichoptic treatment combined with visual cortex direct current stimulation on measures of binocular (stereopsis) and monocular (visual acuity) visual function. The combined treatment led to greater improvements in stereoacuity than dichoptic treatment alone, indicating that direct current stimulation of the visual cortex boosts the efficacy of dichoptic videogame-based treatment. This intervention warrants further evaluation as a novel therapeutic approach for adults with amblyopia.

Following weaning, half of the animals in each group were housed socially (Soc), and half were housed in isolation (Isol). At 120-150 days of age, all animals were sacrificed, and the following regions were dissected and frozen at -70 degrees C until the time of assay: frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, septum, and pituitary. [H-3]Dexamethasone (3H Dex) binding in each region was examined by an in vitro, cytosol, receptor assay. 3H Dex binding was significantly higher in the hippocampus of both H-Soc and H-Isol than in NH groups. In the frontal cortex, 3H Dex binding was higher in the H-Soc animals than in the H-Isol and NH-Isol animals. There were no significant handling or housing effects found in the amygdala, hypothalamus, septum, or pituitary. Thus, early postnatal handling appears to influence the development of the glucocorticoid receptor system in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. These results are discussed as providing a possible mechanism for some of the previously reported effects of early handling on the development of the pituitary-adrenal response to stress.

Here, we investigated the behavioral and cerebral impact of peripherally presented affective stimuli on the subsequent processing of foveal information. To this end, we recorded whole-head magnetoencephalograms from 12 participants while they made speeded responses to the direction of left- or right-oriented arrows that were presented foveally at fixation. Each arrow was preceded by a peripherally presented pair of pictures, one emotional (unpleasant or pleasant), and one neutral. Paired pictures were presented at 12(degrees) of eccentricity to the left and right of a central fixation cross. We observed that the participants responded more quickly when the orientation of the arrow was congruent with the location of the previously presented emotional scene. Results show that non-predictive emotional information in peripheral vision interferes with subsequent responses to foveally presented targets. Importantly, this behavioral effect was correlated with an early (similar to 135 msec) increase of left fronto-central activity for the emotionally congruent combination, whose cerebral sources were notably located in the left orbitofrontal cortex. We therefore suggest that the prior spatial distribution of emotional salience, like physical salience, grabs attentional resources and modifies the performance in the center of the visual field. Thus, these data shed light on the neurobehavioral correlates of the emotional coding of visual space. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These effects may be mediated in part by altered placental function, with increased fetal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) exposure being one possible mechanism. The current study aimed to determine whether maternal symptoms of depression or anxiety were associated with decreased placental expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAO A), the enzyme which metabolises 5-HT into 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The localisation of MAO A in the placenta was also investigated. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited one day prior to elective caesarean and assessed using psychometric tests for symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Depression Scale) and anxiety (Spielberger State/Trait Index). Villous trophoblast tissue was extracted from each placenta and used for subsequent gene expression analysis (N = 62). Localisation was studied using immunohistochemistry, with a specific polyclonal antibody. Results: Increasing symptoms of maternal depression were associated with a reduction in placental MAO A expression (r = 0.339, p = 0.007, N = 62). There was a trend for a similar correlation with symptoms of maternal trait anxiety, but not with state anxiety. MAO A was localised to the syncytiotrophoblast, the tissue between maternal and fetal blood. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that maternal mood is associated with altered placental function. A reduction in placental MAO A expression is consistent with a subsequent increase in fetal exposure to 5-HT. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We addressed this question by correlating voxel-based morphometry data from 90 healthy adults with olfactory performance measures. Supplementing this approach with region of interest (ROI) analyses of functionally defined olfactory cortical regions and olfactory bulb volume, we sought to disentangle the relative contribution of central and peripheral areas to behavioral variability. Whole-brain analyses revealed a significant positive correlation of gray matter volume and olfactory function scores in the right orbital sulcus. This effect was confirmed by the ROI analyses, which further indicated a significant association of the olfactory score with olfactory bulb volume. Moreover, a functional dissociation was observed, with central and peripheral mechanisms explaining different aspects of the observed behavioral variance in the olfactory subscores. In line with previous clinical studies, these data thus suggest an important role of regional gray matter volume in the right orbitofrontal cortex and olfactory bulb volume for olfactory performance in healthy individuals.

In this study, F1 offspring from three sites in the Mpanga River drainage of Western Uganda characterized by different dissolved oxygen (D.0.) regimes were reared under normoxic or hypoxic conditions: After 1 year, enzymes were measured to determine the tissue metabolic capacity of four different tissues: muscle, heart, brain and liver. The enzymes measured were pyruvate Idnase [PK], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], citrate synthase [CS], and cytochrome C oxidase [CCU], and an additional two, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), were examined in the liver only. Individuals reared under hypoxia exhibited elevated levels of LDH and CCO in the heart; and depressed activity levels of brain CS and liver CCO and MDH relative to normoxia-reared sibs. Results from this study demonstrate that long-term exposure to hypoxia during development can induce changes in the metabolic capacities of P. multicolor. This flexibility may be important in facilitating persistence in variable and/or novel environments, and in the face of increasing global hypoxia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent discovery of mirror neuron system (MNS)linking perception of others' actions and execution of our ownmakes the scarcity of studies on social aspects of motor learning even more peculiar. Here, we investigated motor learning during interaction with a partner. Participants engaged in 2 consecutive sessions executing the task alone or in pairs. We found that social interaction improved motor performance only when participants had prior individual experience with the task. This effect was amplified if subjects could first observe their partners' actions, suggesting that it may be mediated by prior MNS configuration.

This is the first comprehensive study to review the existing literature on LFH of the median nerve and to suggest a systematic approach to its diagnosis and treatment. An electronic and manual search was conducted on Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, Current Contents, and Science Citation Index for original and review articles in English or French, from 1946 to November 2012. After 2 levels of screening, 106 references containing case reports were retained. Data extraction included patient demographics, clinical information, diagnostic modalities, treatment, and follow-up. A total of 180 cases were reported in the literature. One third of patients had associated macrodactyly (32%). Gender distribution is equal in LFH with or without macrodactyly, with most patients (71%) presenting before age 30 years. The main presenting symptom is an enlargement (88%) over the volar forearm, wrist, or hand, with or without digital hypertrophy, followed by paresthesia (39%). A soft, mobile, nontender, nonfluctuant mass with variable degree of compressive median neuropathy is found on physical examination. Biopsy, which reveals abundant mature fat cells and fibrous connective tissue infiltrating between nerve fascicles and the space between the epineurium and the perineurium, is not necessary because the pathognomonic features of the mass on magnetic resonance imaging offer an accurate diagnosis. Treatment of nerve compression symptoms and macrodactyly should be addressed separately. Carpal tunnel release is the mainstay of treatment for neuropathy, and ray or digital amputation, wedge osteotomy, middle phalangectomy with arthroplasty, and epiphysiodesis are suggested options in the management of macrodactyly. Based on our review of the literature, we propose an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of LFH of the median nerve with or without macrodactyly.

MAGNIMS Study Grp	Recommendations to improve imaging and analysis of brain lesion load and atrophy in longitudinal studies of multiple sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Magnetic resonance imaging; Multiple sclerosis; Brain atrophy; White matter lesions; Image analysis	WHITE-MATTER LESIONS; GRADIENT NONLINEARITY CORRECTION; SENSITIVE INVERSION-RECOVERY; COMPUTER-ASSISTED TECHNIQUES; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; RANDOM-FIELD MODEL; MR-IMAGES; AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION	Focal lesions and brain atrophy are the most extensively studied aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the image acquisition and analysis techniques used can be further improved, especially those for studying within-patient changes of lesion load and atrophy longitudinally. Improved accuracy and sensitivity will reduce the numbers of patients required to detect a given treatment effect in a trial, and ultimately, will allow reliable characterization of individual patients for personalized treatment. Based on open issues in the field of MS research, and the current state of the art in magnetic resonance image analysis methods for assessing brain lesion load and atrophy, this paper makes recommendations to improve these measures for longitudinal studies of MS. Briefly, they are (1) images should be acquired using 3D pulse sequences, with near-isotropic spatial resolution and multiple image contrasts to allow more comprehensive analyses of lesion load and atrophy, across timepoints. Image artifacts need special attention given their effects on image analysis results. (2) Automated image segmentation methods integrating the assessment of lesion load and atrophy are desirable. (3) A standard dataset with benchmark results should be set up to facilitate development, calibration, and objective evaluation of image analysis methods for MS.

Moreover, they exhibit differences in brain morphology compared with healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to examine whether decreased pain inhibition is associated with altered brain morphology in IBS patients. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired in 14 female patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS and 14 controls. Pain and anxiety modulation were characterized using electrical stimulation of the sural nerve and heterotopic noxious counterstimulation. IBS patients reported decreased pain inhibition (P=.02) as well as increased shock anxiety, pain catastrophizing, depressive symptoms, and trait anxiety (P's <=.05). IBS patients also showed a thicker right posterior insula (pINS), associated with longer IBS duration (r =.67, P =.02). In addition, thicker right lateral orbitofrontal cortex was strongly associated with less pain inhibition in both IBS patients (r =.70, P =.02) and controls (r =.68, P =.01). Results are consistent with the role of the insula in interoception and pain and suggest that IBS may induce thickening of the pINS. Reduced pain inhibition may further involve a modification of the regulatory influence of the orbitofrontal cortex on pain-related processes. Perspective: This study investigated the brain morphology of IBS patients. IBS patients showed thicker right pINS, associated with longer disease duration but not with psychological symptoms. This suggests that IBS induces thickening of pINS, which may contribute to its pathophysiology, consistent with the role of the pINS in interoception and pain.

Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision that is associated with abnormal patterns of neural inhibition within the visual cortex. This disorder is often considered to be untreatable in adulthood because of insufficient visual cortex plasticity. There is increasing evidence that interventions that target inhibitory interactions within the visual cortex, including certain types of noninvasive brain stimulation, can improve visual function in adults with amblyopia. Objective. We tested the hypothesis that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) would improve visual function in adults with amblyopia by enhancing the neural response to inputs from the amblyopic eye. Methods. Thirteen adults with amblyopia participated and contrast sensitivity in the amblyopic and fellow fixing eye was assessed before, during and after a-tDCS or cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS). Five participants also completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study designed to investigate the effect of a-tDCS on the blood oxygen level-dependent response within the visual cortex to inputs from the amblyopic versus the fellow fixing eye. Results. A subgroup of 8/13 participants showed a transient improvement in amblyopic eye contrast sensitivity for at least 30 minutes after a-tDCS. fMRI measurements indicated that the characteristic cortical response asymmetry in amblyopes, which favors the fellow eye, was reduced by a-tDCS. Conclusions. These preliminary results suggest that a-tDCS deserves further investigation as a potential tool to enhance amblyopia treatment outcomes in adults.

Recent work has shown that the projection from layer III neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to hippocampal region 1, the temporoammonic (TA) pathway, might be specially important for these memory tasks. In addition, lesions to the entorhinal cortex disrupt persistent firing in CA1 which is believed to support active maintenance of memory. Injection of cholinergic antagonists and group I mGlu receptor antagonists to the MEC impairs spatial working memory and temporal association memory. Consistent with this, we have shown that group I mGlu receptor activation supports persistent firing in principal cells of the MEC layer III in vitro (Yoshida et al. [39]). However, it still remains unknown whether cholinergic receptor activation also supports persistent firing in MEC layer III neurons. In this paper, we tested this in MEC layer III cells using both ruptured and perforated whole-cell recordings in vitro. We report that the majority of cells we recorded from in MEC layer III show persistent firing during perfusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (2-10 mu M). In addition, repeated stimulation gradually suppressed persistent firing. We further discuss the possible role of persistent firing in memory function in general. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These locomotor skills are due to the complex interactions between the environment, the musculo-skeletal system and the central nervous system, in particular the spinal locomotor circuits. We are interested in decoding these interactions in the salamander, a key animal from an evolutionary point of view. It exhibits both swimming and stepping gaits and is faced with the problem of producing efficient propulsive forces using the same musculo-skeletal system in two environments with significant physical differences in density, viscosity and gravitational load. Yet its nervous system remains comparatively simple. Our approach is based on a combination of neurophysiological experiments, numerical modeling at different levels of abstraction, and robotic validation using an amphibious salamander-like robot. This article reviews the current state of our knowledge on salamander locomotion control, and presents how our approach has allowed us to obtain a first conceptual model of the salamander spinal locomotor networks. The model suggests that the salamander locomotor circuit can be seen as a lamprey-like circuit controlling axial movements of the trunk and tail, extended by specialized oscillatory centers controlling limb movements. The interplay between the two types of circuits determines the mode of locomotion under the influence of sensory feedback and descending drive, with stepping gaits at low drive, and swimming at high drive.

Salamanders resemble the first terrestrial tetrapods and represent a key animal for the study of these changes. Based on recent physiological data from salamanders, and previous work on the swimming, limbless lamprey, we present a model of the basic oscillatory network in the salamander spinal cord, the spinal segment. Model neurons are of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Spinal hemisegments contain sparsely connected excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, and are coupled to a contralateral hemisegment. The model yields a large range of experimental findings, especially the NMDA-induced oscillations observed in isolated axial hemisegments and segments of the salamander Pleurodeles waltlii. The model reproduces most of the effects of the blockade of AMPA synapses, glycinergic synapses, calcium-activated potassium current, persistent sodium current, and -current. Driving segments with a population of brainstem neurons yields fast oscillations in the in vivo swimming frequency range. A minimal modification to the conductances involved in burst-termination yields the slower stepping frequency range. Slow oscillators can impose their frequency on fast oscillators, as is likely the case during gait transitions from swimming to stepping. Our study shows that a lamprey-like network can potentially serve as a building block of axial and limb oscillators for swimming and stepping in salamanders.

Performance on the Frontal Assessment Battery has been shown to be sensitive to various neurodegenerative diseases, but it has never been shown to be sensitive to damage restricted to the frontal cortex. Thus, despite its wide use, it has never been validated on an appropriate population of patients with frontal lesions. The present study shows that, of the six subtests that comprise the Frontal Assessment Battery, only performance on the verbal fluency subtest (mental flexibility) was specifically sensitive to injury restricted to the frontal cortex. Performance of patients with damage to the dorsal part of the medial frontal region in the language-dominant left hemisphere was impaired. None of these patients was aphasic at the time of testing. The critical region in the dorsomedial frontal cortex includes the supplementary speech zone but is not restricted to it: it extends into the cingulate motor region and the paracingulate cortex as well as the medial prefrontal areas 8 and 9. The results indicate that the Frontal Assessment Battery is not a sensitive measure of prefrontal cortical dysfunction, except for the verbal fluency subtest.

Experimental ApproachWild-type (WT) mice and mice that overexpress a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP mice, model of increased amyloid ), a constitutively active form of TGF-1 (TGF mice, model of cerebrovascular fibrosis) or both (APP/TGF mice) were used. Dilations to the selective TRPV4 channel opener GSK1016790A (GSK) or to ACh were measured in posterior cerebral artery segments. Key ResultsBoth GSK- and ACh-induced dilations virtually disappeared following endothelium denudation in WT mice. These responses were impaired in vessels from APP, TGF and APP/TGF mice compared with WT. Pre-incubation of WT vessels with the selective TRPV4 channel blocker HC-067047, or with small-conductance (SK channel, apamin) and/or intermediate-conductance (IK channel, charybdotoxin, ChTx) Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel blocker abolished GSK-induced dilations and massively decreased those induced by ACh. These treatments had no or limited effects on ACh-induced dilation in vessels from APP, TGF or APP/TGF mice, and IK and SK channel function was preserved in transgenic mice. Antioxidant superoxide dismutase or catalase normalized GSK- and ACh-mediated dilations only in APP brain arteries. Conclusion and ImplicationsWe conclude that endothelial TRPV4 channels mediate ACh-induced dilation in cerebral arteries, that they are impaired in models of cerebrovascular pathology and that they are sensitive, albeit in the reversible manner, to amyloid -induced oxidative stress.

Impact of Hemochromatosis Gene Mutations on Cardiac Status in Doxorubicin-Treated Survivors of Childhood High-Risk Leukemia	CANCER			English	Article						cardiotoxicity; doxorubicin; hemochromatosis; leukemia; pediatrics	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; IDIOPATHIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS; ONCOLOGY-GROUP; IRON OVERLOAD; HFE MUTATIONS; UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN; CANCER	BACKGROUNDDoxorubicin is associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction, possibly through the formation of doxorubicin-iron complexes leading to free-radical injury. The authors determined the frequency of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis and their relationship with doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity in survivors of childhood high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODSPeripheral blood was tested for 2 common HFE allelic variants: C282Y and H63D. Serum cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which are biomarkers of cardiac injury and cardiomyopathy, respectively, were assayed during therapy. Left ventricular (LV) structure and function were assessed with echocardiography. RESULTSA total of 184 patients had DNA results for at least 1 variant, and 167 had DNA results for both: 24% carried H63D and 10% carried C282Y. Heterozygous C282Y genotype was associated with multiple elevations in cTnT concentrations (P=.039), but not NT-proBNP. At a median of 2.2 years (range, 1.0 years-3.6 years) after diagnosis, the mean Z-scores for LV fractional shortening (-0.71 [standard error (SE), 0.25]; P=.008), mass (-0.84 [SE, 0.17]; P<.001), and end-systolic (-4.36 [SE, 0.26], P<.001) and end-diastolic (-0.68 [SE, 0.25]; P=.01) posterior wall thickness were found to be abnormal in children with either allele (n=32). Noncarriers (n=63) also were found to have below-normal LV mass (-0.45 [SE, 0.15]; P=.006) and end-systolic posterior wall thickness (-4.06 [SE, 0.17]; P<.001). Later follow-up demonstrated similar results. CONCLUSIONSDoxorubicin-associated myocardial injury was associated with C282Y HFE carriers. Although LV mass and wall thickness were found to be abnormally low overall, they were even lower in HFE carriers, who also had reduced LV function. Screening newly diagnosed cancer patients for HFE mutations may identify those at risk for doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Cancer 2013;119:3555-3562.. (c) 2013 American Cancer Society. Doxorubicin is associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction, possibly by forming doxorubicin-iron complexes leading to free-radical injury. In the current study, doxorubicin-associated myocardial injury was associated with carriers of the C282Y allele, a common allelic variant of hemochromatosis, among long-term survivors of childhood high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Several medications that mitigate immune abnormalities reduce both the frequency of relapses and inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging, leading to improved outcomes for people with the relapsing-remitting form of MS. However, there are no treatments for the progressive forms of MS where neurons and axons continue to degenerate; here, neuroprotective therapies, or medications that rebuild myelin to confer axonal well-being, may be useful. Quetiapine fumarate is an atypical antipsychotic with reported remyelinating and neuroprotective properties in inflammatory and noninflammatory models of demyelination, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and both cuprizone- and global cerebral ischemia-induced demyelination. Preclinical studies suggest that quetiapine may exert these effects by stimulating proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, releasing neurotrophic factors, increasing antioxidant defences, scavenging for free radicals, and inhibiting activated microglia, astrocytes, and T lymphocytes. Additionally, quetiapine may be beneficial for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric symptoms of MS including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and possibly even pain. These data indicate that clinical trials are justified to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of quetiapine fumarate in MS.

The serotonergic system in motor and non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Parkinson's disease; Serotonin; Psychosis; Dyskinesia; Tremor; Depression	DOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIAS; DRUG-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS; 5-HT1A RECEPTOR STIMULATION; ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; DOUBLE-LABELING IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE; STRIATAL DOPAMINERGIC DENERVATION; PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; TREATED HEMIPARKINSONIAN RATS	The understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) classically revolves around dopamine depletion within the striatum. However, PD is a multi-systemic disease in which extra-dopaminergic systems are affected. The serotonergic (5-HT) system is one of these and has been extensively studied in PD. Although the 5-HT system uses one transporter (SERT) and 14 receptor sub-types, most of the studies in PD have focussed on SERT and serotonergic type 1A and 2A receptors (5-HT1A and 5-HT2A). Post-mortem autoradiographic binding studies and in vivo imaging studies have suggested an involvement of the 5-HT system in PD-related anxiety, depression, psychosis and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. Pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological studies have shown that SERT blockade might effectively alleviate depression and dyskinesia and, more recently, might exert disease-modifying effects. Enhancing the physiological activity of 5-HT1A receptors with 5-HT1A agonists might alleviate anxiety, dyskinesia and tremor, although a deleterious effect on the anti-parkinsonian efficacy of L-DOPA may ultimately limit the use of this class of compounds. Enhanced 5-HT2A-mediated neurotransmission has been associated with depression, dyskinesia, psychosis and tremor. The current article critically reviews studies assessing the SERT, as well as 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in idiopathic PD and animal models of PD, and discusses unmet challenges to effectively treat manifestations of PD using SERT antagonists, 5-HT1A agonists and 5-HT2A antagonists.

Nevertheless, a considerable subgroup of patients continues to suffer from post-operative seizures. Although the reasons for surgical failure are not fully understood, electrophysiological and imaging data suggest that anomalies extending beyond the temporal lobe may have negative impact on outcome. This hypothesis has revived the concept of human epilepsy as a disorder of distributed brain networks. Recent methodological advances in non-invasive neuroimaging have led to quantify structural and functional networks in vivo. While structural networks can be inferred from diffusion MRI tractography and inter-regional covariance patterns of structural measures such as cortical thickness, functional connectivity is generally computed based on statistical dependencies of neurophysiological time-series, measured through functional MRI or electroencephalographic techniques. This review considers the application of advanced analytical methods in structural and functional connectivity analyses in TLE. We will specifically highlight findings from graph-theoretical analysis that allow assessing the topological organization of brain networks. These studies have provided compelling evidence that TLE is a system disorder with profound alterations in local and distributed networks. In addition, there is emerging evidence for the utility of network properties as clinical diagnostic markers. Nowadays, a network perspective is considered to be essential to the understanding of the development, progression, and management of epilepsy.

These individual differences are related to a variety of demographic and individual maternal factors including maternal hormones, mood and early experiences. However, little is known about the role of genetic factors. We studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OXT peptide gene (rs2740210; rs4813627) and the OXT receptor gene (OXTR rs237885) in two samples of mothers from the Maternal adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment study (MAVAN), a multicenter (Hamilton and Montreal, Canada) study following mothers and their children from pregnancy until 7years of age. Data from the Hamilton site was the primary sample (n=201) and data from Montreal was the replication sample (n=151). Breastfeeding duration, maternal mood (measured by the CES-D scale) and early life adversity (measured by the CTQ scale) were established during 12months postpartum. In our primary sample, polymorphisms in OXT rs2740210, but not the other SNPs, interacted with early life adversity to predict variation in breastfeeding duration (overall F-8,F-125=2.361, P=0.021; interaction effect b=-8.12, t=-2.3, P=0.023) and depression (overall F-8,F-118=5.751, P0.001; interaction effect b=6.06, t=3.13, P=0.002). A moderated mediation model showed that higher levels of depression mediated the inverse relation of high levels of early life adversity to breastfeeding duration, but only in women possessing the CC genotype [effect a=-3.3401, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-7.9466 to -0.0015] of the OXT SNP and not in women with the AA/AC genotype (a=-1.2942, ns). The latter findings (moderated mediation model) were replicated in our Montreal sample (a=-0.277, 95% CI=-0.7987 to -0.0348 for CC; a=-0.1820, ns for AA/AC).	[Jonas, W.; Bisceglia, R.; Fleming, A.

A portion of mutant SOD1 exists in a non-native/misfolded conformation that is selectively recognized by conformational antibodies. Misfolded SOD1 is common to all mutant SOD1 models, is uniquely found in areas affected by the disease and is considered to mediate toxicity. We report that misfolded SOD1 recognized by the antibody B8H10 is present in greater abundance in mitochondrial fractions of SOD1 G93A rat spinal cords compared with oxidized SOD1, as recognized by the C4F6 antibody. Using a novel flow cytometric assay, we detect an age-dependent deposition of B8H10-reactive SOD1 on spinal cord mitochondria from both SOD1 G93A rats and SOD1 G37R mice. Mitochondrial damage, including increased mitochondrial volume, excess superoxide production and increased exposure of the toxic BH3 domain of Bcl-2, tracks positively with the presence of misfolded SOD1. Lastly, B8H10 reactive misfolded SOD1 is present in the lysates and mitochondrial fractions of lymphoblasts derived from ALS patients carrying SOD1 mutations, but not in controls. Together, these results highlight misfolded SOD1 as common to two ALS rodent animal models and familial ALS patient lymphoblasts with four different SOD1 mutations. Studies in the animal models point to a role for misfolded SOD1 in mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS pathogenesis.

Time Course of Neuromuscular Adaptations to Knee Extensor Eccentric Training	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article						resistance training; eccentric exercise; quadriceps femoris; isokinetic dynamometer; electromyography; ultrasonography	CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA; MUSCLE STRENGTH; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; HUMAN QUADRICEPS; ARCHITECTURAL ADAPTATION; OLDER-ADULTS; YOUNG MEN; EXERCISE; HUMANS; CONTRACTIONS	This study investigated the chronology of neural and morphological adaptations to knee extensor eccentric training and their contribution to strength gains in isometric, concentric and eccentric muscle actions. 20 male healthy subjects performed a 12-week eccentric training program on an isokinetic dynamometer, and neuromuscular evaluations of knee extensors were performed every 4 weeks. After 12 training weeks, significant increases were observed for: isometric (24%), concentric (15%) and eccentric (29%) torques; isometric (29%) and eccentric (33%) electromyographic activity; muscle thickness (10%) and anatomical cross-sectional area (19%). Eccentric and isometric torques increased progressively until the end of the program. Concentric torque and muscle mass parameters increased until the eighth training week, but did not change from this point to the twelfth training week. Eccentric and isometric activation increased at 4 and 8 training weeks, respectively, while no change was found in concentric activation. These results suggest that: 1) the relative increment in concentric strength was minor and does not relate to neural effects; 2) eccentric and isometric strength gains up to 8 training weeks are explained by the increased neural activation and muscle mass, whereas the increments in the last 4 training weeks seem to be associated with other mechanisms.

Method: A multidisciplinary group of experts in pediatric sleep medicine and ADHD convened in November 2010 to summarize the current literature, delineate knowledge gaps, and formulate recommendations regarding future research directions and priorities. Results: Six major research areas of interest were identified: (a) brain centers regulating sleep, arousal, and attention; (b) neurotransmitter systems involved in both sleep and attention regulation; (c) alterations of neural systems regulating sleep in ADHD; (d) phenotypic similarities between behavioral, mood, and cognitive manifestations of insufficient/disrupted sleep and ADHD; (e) hypoarousal and sleepiness in ADHD; and (f) external sleep-wake signals that affect sleep regulation in ADHD. Conclusion: An enhanced understanding of the complex mechanisms regulating sleep promotion, wakefulness, and attention may contribute to new insights regarding the core impairments in ADHD and lead to the development of new therapies.

Despite this, the brain extracts precise information about tactile speed, and humans can scale the tangential speed of moving surfaces as long as they have some surface texture. Speed estimates, however, vary with texture: lower estimates for rougher surfaces (increased spatial period, SP). We hypothesized that the discharge of cortical neurons playing a role in scaling tactile speed should covary with speed and SP in the same manner. Single-cell recordings (n = 119) were made in the hand region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake monkeys while raised-dot surfaces (longitudinal SPs, 2-8 mm; periodic or nonperiodic) were displaced under their fingertips at speeds of 40-105 mm/s. Speed sensitivity was widely distributed (area 3b, 13/25; area 1, 32/51; area 2, 31/43) and almost invariably combined with texture sensitivity (82% of cells). A subset of cells (27/64 fully tested speed-sensitive cells) showed a graded increase in discharge with increasing speed for testing with both sets of surfaces (periodic, nonperiodic), consistent with a role in tactile speed scaling. These cells were almost entirely confined to caudal S1 (areas 1 and 2). None of the speed-sensitive cells, however, showed a pattern of decreased discharge with increased SP, as found for subjective speed estimates in humans. Thus further processing of tactile motion signals, presumably in higher-order areas, is required to explain human tactile speed scaling.	[Depeault, Alexandra; Meftah, El-Mehdi; Chapman, C.

However, the association between the frequency of these thoughts experienced at encoding and retrieval accuracy in young and older adults remains poorly understood. In this study young and older adults encoded lists of words using one of two encoding tasks: judging whether words are man-made/natural (objective task), or whether they are pleasant/neutral (subjective task). We measured the frequency of TRI and MW at encoding, and related them to retrieval accuracy in both age groups. We found that encoding task influenced the type of internal thoughts experienced by young, but not older, adults: young exhibited greater MW in the subjective vs the objective task, and greater TRI in the objective vs subjective encoding task. Second, across both tasks we found marked age-related decreases in both MW and TRI at encoding, and frequency of these thoughts negatively impacted memory retrieval in young adults only. We discuss these findings in relation to current theories of ageing, attention and memory.	[Maillet, David] McGill Univ, Dept Neurosci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rajah, M.

A retrospective cohort study of all patients above the age of 18 years with bacterial meningitis and altered mental status admitted to the Montreal Neurological Hospital Intensive Care Unit from January 2000 to December 2010. Thirty-seven patients were identified using clinical and cerebrospinal fluid criteria. Patients were divided into lumbar drain (LD) (n = 11) and conventional therapy (no LD) (n = 26) groups. Outcomes were assessed using meningitis-related mortality and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 1 and 3 months. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, 84 % received steroids. There was no significant difference in mean age, type of bacteria, or time from arrival in ER to initiation of therapy. There was significantly less co-morbidity (24 % healthy vs. 18.1 %) and coma (GCS < 8 34.6 vs. 54.5 %) in the conventional therapy group, as well as a longer duration of symptoms prior to admission (mean 1.34 +/- A 1.24 vs. 2.19 +/- A 2.34 days). The mean opening pressure was high in all patients (20-55 cm H2O in the LD and 12-60 cm H2O in the no LD). Mean time from arrival in ER to insertion of the lumbar drain was 37 h. Lumbar drains were set for a maximum drainage of 10 cc/h and an ICP below 10 mmHg. Despite greater clinical severity, the LD group had 0 % mortality and 91 % of the patients achieved a GOS of 4-5. The non-LD group had 15.4 % mortality and only 60 % achieved a GOS of 4-5. No adverse events were associated with LD therapy. In this study, the use of lumbar drainage in adult patients with severe bacterial meningitis was safe, and likely contributed to the low mortality and morbidity.

Diagnosis and classification of disorders specifically associated with stress: proposals for ICD-11	WORLD PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Classification; mental disorders; ICD; nosology; PTSD; complex PTSD; prolonged grief disorder; cultural appropriateness; DSM	MENTAL-DISORDERS; ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS; COMPLICATED GRIEF; INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; GLOBAL SURVEY; COMPLEX PTSD; RESPONSES; ISSUES	The diagnostic concepts of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other disorders specifically associated with stress have been intensively discussed among neuro- and social scientists, clinicians, epidemiologists, public health planners and humanitarian aid workers around the world. PTSD and adjustment disorder are among the most widely used diagnoses in mental health care worldwide. This paper describes proposals that aim to maximize clinical utility for the classification and grouping of disorders specifically associated with stress in the forthcoming 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Proposals include a narrower concept for PTSD that does not allow the diagnosis to be made based entirely on non-specific symptoms; a new complex PTSD category that comprises three clusters of intra- and interpersonal symptoms in addition to core PTSD symptoms; a new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder, used to describe patients that undergo an intensely painful, disabling, and abnormally persistent response to bereavement; a major revision of adjustment disorder involving increased specification of symptoms; and a conceptualization of acute stress reaction as a normal phenomenon that still may require clinical intervention. These proposals were developed with specific considerations given to clinical utility and global applicability in both low- and high-income countries.

Application of this model provides information about the stage of processing at which manipulations such as drug administration, lesions, deprivation states, and optogenetic interventions act to alter reward seeking. The model has been updated by incorporation of new information about frequency following in the directly stimulated neurons responsible for brain stimulation reward and about the function that maps objective opportunity costs into subjective ones. The behavioral methods for applying the model have been updated and improved as well. To assess the impact of these changes, two related predictions of the model that were supported by earlier work have been retested: (1) altering the duration of rewarding brain stimulation should change the pulse frequency required to produce a reward of half-maximal intensity, and (2) this manipulation should not change the opportunity cost at which half-maximal performance is directed at earning a maximally intense reward. Prediction 1 was supported in all six subjects, but prediction 2 was supported in only three. The latter finding is interpreted to reflect recruitment, at some stimulation sites, of a heterogeneous reward substrate comprising dual, parallel circuits that integrate the stimulation-induced neural signals.

Data acquired from SPM methodology is enormous and complex. Several analysis methods based on comparison or classification of Surgical Process Models (SPMs) have previously been proposed. Such methods compare a set of SPMs to highlight specific parameters explaining differences between populations of patients, surgeons or systems. In this study, procedures performed at three different international University hospitals were compared using SPM methodology based on a similarity metric focusing on the sequence of activities occurring during surgery. The proposed approach is based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm combined with a clustering algorithm. SPMs of 41 Anterior Cervical Discectomy (ACD) surgeries were acquired at three Neurosurgical departments; in France, Germany, and Canada. The proposed approach distinguished the different surgical behaviors according to the location where surgery was performed as well as between the categorized surgical experience of individual surgeons. We also propose the use of Multidimensional Scaling to induce a new space of representation of the sequences of activities. The approach was compared to a time-based approach (e.g. duration of surgeries) and has been shown to be more precise. We also discuss the integration of other criteria in order to better understand what influences the way the surgeries are performed. This first multi-site study represents an important step towards the creation of robust analysis tools for processing SPMs. It opens new perspectives for the assessment of surgical approaches, tools or systems as well as objective assessment and comparison of surgeon's expertise.

We expressed mutants of MOG on human HeLa cells and analyzed sera from 111 patients (104 children, 7 adults) who recognized cell-bound human MOG, but had different diseases, including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), one episode of transverse myelitis or optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-negative neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis (CRION). We obtained insight into the recognition of epitopes in 98 patients. All epitopes identified were located at loops connecting the beta strands of MOG. The most frequently recognized MOG epitope was revealed by the P42S mutation positioned in the CC'-loop. Overall, we distinguished seven epitope patterns, including the one mainly recognized by mouse mAbs. In half of the patients, the anti-MOG response was directed to a single epitope. The epitope specificity was not linked to certain disease entities. Longitudinal analysis of 11 patients for up to 5 y indicated constant epitope recognition without evidence for intramolecular epitope spreading. Patients who rapidly lost their anti-MOG IgG still generated a long-lasting IgG response to vaccines, indicating that their loss of anti-MOG reactivity did not reflect a general lack of capacity for long-standing IgG responses. The majority of human anti-MOG Abs did not recognize rodent MOG, which has implications for animal studies. Our findings might assist in future detection of potential mimotopes and pave the way to Ag-specific depletion.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of AS in premature severely intrauterine growth restricted infants. The electronic data of 149 inborn, single infants born 24 to 31 6/7 weeks of GA and with a BW <= 3rd percentile were reviewed. Infants with congenital anomalies and syndromes were excluded. We compared the outcome of those who received 2 doses of AS (group A, 87 infants) with those who did not receive AS (group B, 62 infants). Sixty-eight infants in group A and 53 in group B were discharged home alive. AS did not improve the neonatal outcome, with the exception of a better cord pH and 5-min Apgar and we did not observe a significant difference in the Griffith's test at 2 years of corrected age, although there was a trend to a higher incidence of severe global delay in the steroid group. In view of the potential cerebral and CVS risks associated with high circulating steroids, the indications for AS in such a population need to be re-evaluated.

We found that SWCNTs-treatment inhibits the angiogenesis of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in the chicken embryo. Moreover, we showed that SWCNTs can harm the normal development of the embryo since all SWCNTs-exposed embryos are smaller in comparison with their matched controls. We also found that the majority of SWCNTs-exposed embryos die before 12 days of incubation. Macroscopic examination did not reveal any anomalies in these embryos. However, RT-PCR analysis of eleven genes, which are important regulators of cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival and angiogenesis, shows that these genes are deregulated in brain and liver tissues from SWCNTs-treated embryos in comparison with their matched controls. This study suggests that SWCNTs could have a very toxic effect on the normal development of the embryo. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To determine the protective effects of memantine on cognitive function in patients receiving whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Methods. Adult patients with brain metastases received WBRT and were randomized to receive placebo or memantine (20 mg/d), within 3 days of initiating radiotherapy for 24 weeks. Serial standardized tests of cognitive function were performed. Results. Of 554 patients who were accrued, 508 were eligible. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities and study compliance were similar in the 2 arms. There was less decline in delayed recall in the memantine arm at 24 weeks (P = .059), but the difference was not statistically significant, possibly because there were only 149 analyzable patients at 24 weeks, resulting in only 35% statistical power. The memantine arm had significantly longer time to cognitive decline (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.62-0.99, P = .01); the probability of cognitive function failure at 24 weeks was 53.8% in the memantine arm and 64.9% in the placebo arm. Superior results were seen in the memantine arm for executive function at 8 (P = .008) and 16 weeks (P = .0041) and for processing speed (P = .0137) and delayed recognition (P = .0149) at 24 weeks. Conclusions. Memantine was well tolerated and had a toxicity profile very similar to placebo. Although there was less decline in the primary endpoint of delayed recall at 24 weeks, this lacked statistical significance possibly due to significant patient loss. Overall, patients treated with memantine had better cognitive function over time; specifically, memantine delayed time to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function, and processing speed in patients receiving WBRT.

Reactivation of stalled polyribosomes in synaptic plasticity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						RNA granule; mGluR-LTD; translation elongation; microtubule-associated protein 1b	LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN; FRAGILE-X; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; RNA GRANULES; TRANSLATION INITIATION; DEPENDENT TRANSLATION; AUTISM; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; TRANSLOCATION	Some forms of synaptic plasticity require rapid, local activation of protein synthesis. Although this is thought to reflect recruitment of mRNAs to free ribosomes, this would limit the speed and magnitude of translational activation. Here we provide compelling in situ evidence supporting an alternative model in which synaptic mRNAs are transported as stably paused polyribosomes. Remarkably, we show that metabotropic glutamate receptor activation allows the synthesis of proteins that lead to a functional long-term depression phenotype even when translation initiation has been greatly reduced. Thus, neurons evolved a unique mechanism to swiftly translate synaptic mRNAs into functional protein upon synaptic signaling using stalled polyribosomes to bypass the rate-limiting step of translation initiation. Because dysregulated plasticity is implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders such as fragile X syndrome, this work uncovers a unique translational target for therapies.

Neuronal sirtuin1 mediates retinal vascular regeneration in oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy	ANGIOGENESIS			English	Article						Acetylation; Hypoxia-induced factor; Ischemic retinopathy; Neovascularization; Retinal ganglion cell; Revascularization; Sirtuin1	DEPENDENT REGULATION; SIRT1 DEACETYLASE; ANGIOGENESIS; PGC-1-ALPHA; DISEASE; MICE; NEOVASCULARIZATION; GROWTH; MOUSE; QUANTIFICATION	Regeneration of blood vessels in ischemic neuronal tissue is critical to reduce tissue damage in diseases. In proliferative retinopathy, initial vessel loss leads to retinal ischemia, which can induce either regrowth of vessels to restore normal metabolism and minimize damage, or progress to hypoxia-induced sight-threatening pathologic vaso-proliferation. It is not well understood how retinal neurons mediate regeneration of vascular growth in response to ischemic insults. In this study we aim to investigate the potential role of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a metabolically-regulated protein deacetylase, in mediating the response of ischemic neurons to regulate vascular regrowth in a mouse model of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR). We found that Sirt1 is highly induced in the avascular ischemic retina in OIR. Conditional depletion of neuronal Sirt1 leads to significantly decreased retinal vascular regeneration into the avascular zone and increased hypoxia-induced pathologic vascular growth. This effect is likely independent of PGC-1 alpha, a known Sirt1 target, as absence of PGC-1 alpha in knockout mice does not impact vascular growth in retinopathy. We found that neuronal Sirt1 controls vascular regrowth in part through modulating deacetylation and stability of hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha and 2 alpha, and thereby modulating expression of angiogenic factors. These results indicate that ischemic neurons induce Sirt1 to promote revascularization into ischemic neuronal areas, suggesting a novel role of neuronal Sirt1 in mediating vascular regeneration in ischemic conditions, with potential implications beyond retinopathy.

The significance of deactivation in the region of IED generation is uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine if BOLD deactivation was caused by specific IED characteristics. Among focal epilepsy patients who underwent 3T EEG-fMRI from 2006 to 2011, those with negative BOLD having a maximum t-value in the IED generating region were selected. As controls, subjects with maximum activation in the IED generating region were selected. We established the relationship between the type of response (activation/deactivation) and (1) presence of slow wave in the IEDs, (2) lobe of epileptic focus, (3) occurrence as isolated events or bursts, (4) spatial extent of the EEG discharge. Fifteen patients with deactivation and 15 with activation were included. The IEDs were accompanied by a slow wave in 87 % of patients whose primary BOLD was a deactivation and only in 33 % of patients with activation. In the deactivation group, the epileptic focus was more frequently in the posterior quadrant and involved larger cortical areas, whereas in the activation group it was more frequently temporal. IEDs were more frequently of long duration in the deactivation group. The main factor responsible for focal deactivations is the presence of a slow wave, which is the likely electrographic correlate of prolonged inhibition.

The present study aimed to establish normative data for this test in the elderly French-Quebec population. A total of 432 French-speaking elders from the province of Quebec (Canada), aged 50 to 85 years, were administered the Dementia Rating Scale-2. Age and education were found to be associated with the total score on the test, while gender was not. Percentile ranks were then calculated for age- and education-stratified groups. Previous studies have shown that cultural background can affect performance on the DRS and the development of culture-specific norms for French-speaking Quebecers could be very useful to clinicians and researchers working with this population.

These models attempt to describe both the homogeneity of instances of an emotional "kind" (why are fears similar?) and the heterogeneity of instances (why are different fears quite different?). In this article, we review the iterative reprocessing model of affect, and suggest that emotions, at least in part, arise from the processing of dynamical unfolding representations of valence across time. Critical to this model is the hypothesis that affective trajectories-over time-provide important information that helps build emotional states.

The "material-specific impairment" model was radicalized as postulating that left hemisphere (LH) lesions impair processing of verbal material and that right hemisphere (RH) lesions impair processing of visuospatial material, independently of response-bias distortions. The "response-bias distortion" model was radicalized as postulating that LH lesions distort response style toward omissiveness and that RH lesions distort response style toward commissiveness, regardless of material-specific impairments. Participants had comparable left (N = 27) or right (N = 24) hemisphere cortical lesions having occurred between birth and early adolescence. Four cognitive neuropsychological tests were adjusted to optimize applicability and comparability of the two theoretical models: Rey Complex Figure, Kimura's Recurring Figures, the Story Recall subtest of the Children's Memory Scale, and the California Verbal Learning Test. Both models significantly, independently, and equally distinguished the LH from the RH patients. Both these forms of hemispheric specialization seemed to be implemented very early in life and very rigidly. Intrahemispheric lesion sites, e.g., frontal vs nonfrontal, held no significant relation to the effects described above. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Guimond, Anik; Braun, Claude M.

Although anhedonia is a prominent feature of many psychiatric disorders, trait anhedonia is also observed dimensionally in healthy individuals. Currently, the neurobiological basis of anhedonia is poorly understood because it has been mainly investigated in patients with psychiatric disorders. Thus, previous studies have not been able to adequately disentangle the neural correlates of anhedonia from other clinical symptoms. In this study, trait anhedonia was assessed in well-characterized healthy participants with no history of Axis I psychiatric illness. Functional magnetic resonance imaging with musical stimuli was used to examine brain responses and effective connectivity in relation to individual differences in anhedonia. We found that trait anhedonia was negatively correlated with pleasantness ratings of music stimuli and with activation of key brain structures involved in reward processing, including nucleus accumbens (NAc), basal forebrain and hypothalamus which are linked by the medial forebrain bundle to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Brain regions important for processing salient emotional stimuli, including anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex were also negatively correlated with trait anhedonia. Furthermore, effective connectivity between NAc, VTA and paralimbic areas, that regulate emotional reactivity to hedonic stimuli, was negatively correlated with trait anhedonia. Our results indicate that trait anhedonia is associated with reduced reactivity and connectivity of mesolimbic and related limbic and paralimbic systems involved in reward processing. Critically, this association can be detected even in individuals without psychiatric illness. Our findings have important implications both for understanding the neurobiological basis of anhedonia and for the treatment of anhedonia in psychiatric disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

IMAGEN Consortium	Genetic Risk For Nicotine Dependence in the Cholinergic System and Activation of the Brain Reward System in Healthy Adolescents	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						reward; anterior cingulate cortex; genes; traits; functional imaging; adolescence	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; LUNG-CANCER; ADDICTION; BEHAVIOR; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY	Genetic variation in a genomic region on chromosome 15q25.1, which encodes the alpha5, alpha3, and beta4 subunits of the cholinergic nicotinic receptor genes, confers risk to smoking and nicotine dependence (ND). Neural reward-related responses have previously been identified as important factors in the development of drug dependence involving ND. Applying an imaging genetics approach in two cohorts (N = 487; N = 478) of healthy non-smoking adolescents, we aimed to elucidate the impact of genome-wide significant smoking-associated variants in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster on reward-related neural responses in central regions such as the striatum, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and personality traits related to addiction. In both samples, carriers of the rs578776 GG compared with AG/AA genotype showed a significantly lower neural response to reward outcomes in the right ventral and dorsal ACC but not the striatum or the orbitofrontal cortex. Rs578776 was unrelated to neural reward anticipation or reward magnitude. Significantly higher scores of anxiety sensitivity in GG compared with AG/AA carriers were found only in sample 1. Associations with other personality traits were not observed. Our findings suggest that the rs578776 risk variant influences susceptibility to ND by dampening the response of the ACC to reward feedback, without recruiting the striatum or orbitofrontal cortex during feedback or anticipation. Thus, it seems to have a major role in the processing of and behavioral adaptation to changing reward outcomes.

Incidence of difficult bag-mask ventilation in children: a prospective observational study	PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA			English	Article						difficult airway; airway obstruction; ventilation; pediatrics; intubation; complications	ARREST POCA REGISTRY; PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA; CARDIAC-ARREST; AIRWAY; COMPLICATIONS; INTUBATION; PREDICTORS; SURGERY	Background: Difficult airway (DA), including difficult bag-mask ventilation (DBMV), and difficult intubation (DI) is an important challenge for the pediatric anesthesiologist. While expected DBMV can be successfully managed with appropriate equipment and personnel, unexpected DBMV relies on the resources available and the experience of the anesthesiologist at the time of the emergency. The incidence and risk factors of unexpected DA in otherwise healthy children, including DBMV among pediatric patients are not known. The aim of this study was to expand the scientific knowledge of unexpected DBMV among pediatric patients. Methods: Patients between the ages of 0 and 8 years, undergoing elective surgery requiring bag-mask ventilation BMV and intubation at the Montreal Children's Hospital were recruited in this prospective observational study. Data on the incidence of DBMV and risk factors were collected over a 3-year period. Results: In a sample of 484 children, the incidence of unexpected difficult BMV was 6.6% (95% CI [4.6, 9.2]). The incidence of expected DA among the screened patients (N = 4865) was 0.5% (95% CI [0.3, 0.7]). In a logistic regression analysis, age (OR 0.98; 95% CI [0.97, 0.99]), undergoing otolaryngology (ENT) surgery (OR 2.92; 95% CI [1.08, 7.95]) and use of neuromuscular blocking agents (OR 3.49; 95% CI [1.50-8.11]) were independently associated with DBMV. The incidence of DI was 1.2%. No association between DBMV and DI was found (Fisher's exact test, P = 1.0). Conclusions: This is the first published report of the incidence of unexpected DBMV among healthy pediatric patients.

Sleep bruxism and oromandibular myoclonus in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder: a preliminary report	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						REM sleep behavior disorder; Sleep bruxism; Oromandibular myoclonus; Sleep; Tooth grinding	MUSCLE EMG AMPLITUDE; REM-SLEEP; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; PARASOMNIA; PAIN	Objective: We aimed to compare rhythmic masticatory muscle activity typical of sleep bruxism and oromandibular myoclonus (OMM) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and in Parkinson disease (PD) patients with RBD (PD-RBD). Methods: Sleep polygraphic data were collected from 9 age-matched controls and 28 patients (mean +/- standard error of the mean, 66.0 +/- 1.7 y) with a clinical and sleep laboratory diagnosis of RBD. Patients were divided into two groups: 13 patients with iRBD and 15 patients with PD-RBD. Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, a marker of sleep bruxism, and OMM were scored blind to subject's diagnosis from jaw electromyographic recordings during sleep. Results: The rhythmic masticatory muscle activity index was significantly higher during REM sleep in iRBD subjects compared to controls (P < .01) and was significantly higher during non-REM (NREM) sleep in both subject groups compared to controls (P <= .03). A positive sleep laboratory diagnosis of sleep bruxism was made in 25% of all patients. In iRBD, patients had more OMM during REM sleep than controls (2.4 times higher; P = .01).

The WISH technology facilitates the assessment of gene expression both in terms of tissue distribution and developmental stage. Protocols are described for the use of WISH of zebrafish embryos using antisense RNA probes labeled with digoxigenin. Probes are generated by incorporating digoxigenin-linked nucleotides through in vitro transcription of gene templates that have been cloned and linearized. The chorions of embryos harvested at defined developmental stages are removed before incubation with specific probes. Following a washing procedure to remove excess probe, embryos are incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. By employing a chromogenic substrate for alkaline phosphatase, specific gene expression can be assessed. Depending on the level of gene expression the entire procedure can be completed within 2-3 days.	[Chitramuthu, Babykumari P.; Bennett, Hugh P.

Modulation of p75(NTR) prevents diabetes- and proNGF-induced retinal inflammation and blood-retina barrier breakdown in mice and rats	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						BRB breakdown; Diabetic retinopathy; Ganglion loss; IL-1 beta; Inflammation; Muller cells; NF kappa B; p75KO; proNGF; TNF-alpha	P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; NF-KAPPA-B; GANGLION-CELLS; NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION; DEATH; RETINOPATHY; CLEAVAGE; ALPHA; DEGRADATION	Diabetic retinopathy is characterised by early blood-retina barrier (BRB) breakdown and neurodegeneration. Diabetes causes imbalance of nerve growth factor (NGF), leading to accumulation of the NGF precursor (proNGF), as well as the NGF receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)), suggesting a possible pathological role of the proNGF-p75(NTR) axis in the diabetic retina. To date, the role of this axis in diabetes-induced retinal inflammation and BRB breakdown has not been explored. We hypothesised that modulating p75(NTR) would prevent diabetes- and proNGF-induced retinal inflammation and BRB breakdown. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in wild-type and p75(NTR) knockout (p75KO) mice. After 5 weeks, the expression of inflammatory mediators, ganglion cell loss and BRB breakdown were determined. Cleavage-resistant proNGF was overexpressed in rodent retinas with and without p75(NTR) short hairpin RNA or with pharmacological inhibitors. In vitro, the effects of proNGF were investigated in retinal Muller glial cell line (rMC-1) and primary Muller cells. Deletion of p75(NTR) blunted the diabetes-induced decrease in retinal NGF expression and increases in proNGF, nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), p-NF kappa B and TNF-alpha. Deletion of p75(NTR) also abrogated diabetes-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, ganglion cell loss and vascular permeability. Inhibited expression or cleavage of p75(NTR) blunted proNGF-induced retinal inflammation and vascular permeability. In vitro, proNGF induced p75(NTR)-dependent production of inflammatory mediators in primary wild-type Muller and rMC-1 cultures, but not in p75KO Muller cells. The proNGF-p75(NTR) axis contributes to retinal inflammation and vascular dysfunction in the rodent diabetic retina. These findings underscore the importance of p75(NTR) as a novel regulator of inflammation and potential therapeutic target in diabetic retinopathy.	[Mysona, Barbara A.; Al-Gayyar, Mohammed M.

It is comprised of three distinct portions (anterior or clavicular, middle or acromial, and posterior or spinal) and acts mainly as an abductor of the shoulder and stabilizer of the humeral head. Deltoid tears are not infrequently associated with large or massive rotator cuff tears and may further jeopardize shoulder function. A variety of other pathologies may affect the deltoid muscle including enthesitis, calcific tendinitis, myositis, infection, tumors, and chronic avulsion injury. Contracture of the deltoid following repeated intramuscular injections could present with progressive abduction deformity and winging of the scapula. The deltoid muscle and its innervating axillary nerve may be injured during shoulder surgery, which may have disastrous functional consequences. Axillary neuropathies leading to deltoid muscle dysfunction include traumatic injuries, quadrilateral space and Parsonage-Turner syndromes, and cause denervation of the deltoid muscle. Finally, abnormalities of the deltoid may originate from nearby pathologies of subdeltoid bursa, acromion, and distal clavicle.

Here, we demonstrate that the BH3 only protein Puma, but not Noxa, is essential for oligodendroglial cell death in toxic demyelination induced by the copper chelator cuprizone. Primary oligodendrocytes derived from Noxa- or Puma-deficient mice showed comparable differentiation to wild-type cells, but Puma-deficient oligodendrocytes were less susceptible to spontaneous, staurosporine, or nitric oxide-induced cell death. Furthermore, Puma was expressed in oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and Puma mRNA levels were upregulated in primary human oligodendrocytes upon cell death induction by staurosporine. Our data demonstrate that Puma is pivotal for oligodendroglial cell death induced by different cell death stimuli and might play a role in oligodendroglial cell death in MS.

By employing a paradigm of mitotic blockade in conjunction with genetic fate tracing we demonstrate that intracerebroventricular mitotic blocker infusion leads to wide-spread and complete ablation of NG2-glial cells in the hypothalamus and other periventricular brain regions. However, despite the extensive glia loss, parenchymal NG2-glia coverage is fully restored to pretreatment levels within two weeks. We further reveal that in response to mitotic blocker treatment, NG2-glia bordering the ablated territories start to express the stem cell marker nestin, divide and migrate to replace the lost cells. Importantly, the migration front of repopulating NG2-glia invariably proceeds from the distal parenchyma towards the ventricles, ruling out contributions of the subventricular zone neurogenic niche or the corresponding area of the third ventricle as source of new NG2-glia. NG2-CreER-based fate tracing further substantiates that NG2-glia which have been spared from mitotic blockade are the sole source of regenerating NG2-glia. Collectively, our data reveals that all adult NG2-glia retain the ability to divide and that they are capable of fully restoring parenchymal NG2-glia coverage after wide-spread NG2 cell loss, indicating complete self-sufficiency in maintaining NG2-glia population levels in the adult brain.

A cooperative controller is proposed using a combination of backstepping technique, graph theory and neural network radial basis functions. We show, using the small gain theorem, that the states of each mobile robot in the group converge to and remain inside a tube centered around its assigned trajectory to form a desired geometric pattern whose centroid is assumed to move along a predefined trajectory. Experimental results on a group of three mobile robots forming a triangular shape are presented to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed cooperative controller.

Mapping interhemispheric connectivity using functional MRI after transcranial magnetic stimulation on the human auditory cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory processing; Functional connectivity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Interhemispheric interaction; Theta burst stimulation	THETA-BURST STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES; PARIETAL CORTEX; LANGUAGE AREAS; BRAIN; FMRI; PITCH; INHIBITION	Interhemispheric interactions can be important in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies investigating motor or cognitive brain functions, but their role in predicting the outcome of TMS is not clear. Previously, we showed that individual differences in interhemispheric functional connectivity of auditory cortices influenced the behavioral effect of repetitive TMS (rTMS) applied over auditory cortex in a melody discrimination task. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning with the same task was carried out before and after rTMS applied over auditory cortex to determine how rTMS affects both behavior and neural function. After rTMS applied over the right auditory cortex, we found mean increases in activation in the contralateral auditory cortex. The degree and direction of modulation of the fMRI response were correlated with behavior: the higher the contralateral increase after stimulation, the faster the response times, whereas individuals with reduced contralateral activity showed no behavioral facilitation. We also found that higher interhemispheric connectivity between auditory cortices before TMS was associated with faster response times. This study shows directly the role of functional connectivity in the auditory network on TMS-induced modulation, which could explain its often variable effects on behavior. Combined TMS and fMRI is particularly useful to promote plastic reorganization in the auditory network and has implications for research on auditory-related disorders. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Skull features; Facial features; Sex judgments; Body fat; Mediation	FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS; BONE; ADOLESCENCE; DIMORPHISM; ANDROGENS; DENSITY; BEAUTY; BRAIN; WOMEN	In our previous work, we described facial features associated with a successful recognition of the sex of the face (Mareckova et al., 2011). These features were based on landmarks placed on the surface of faces reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) images; their position was therefore influenced by both soft tissue (fat and muscle) and bone structure of the skull. Here, we ask whether bone structure has dissociable influences on observers' identification of the sex of the face. To answer this question, we used a novel method of studying skull morphology using MR images and explored the relationship between skull features, facial features, and sex recognition in a large sample of adolescents (n = 876; including 475 adolescents from our original report). To determine whether skull features mediate the relationship between facial features and identification accuracy, we performed mediation analysis using bootstrapping. In males, skull features mediated fully the relationship between facial features and sex judgments. In females, the skull mediated this relationship only after adjusting facial features for the amount of body fat (estimated with bioimpedance). While body fat had a very slight positive influence on correct sex judgments about male faces, there was a robust negative influence of body fat on the correct sex judgments about female faces. Overall, these results suggest that craniofacial bone structure is essential for correct sex judgments about a male face. In females, body fat influences negatively the accuracy of sex judgments, and craniofacial bone structure alone cannot explain the relationship between facial features and identification of a face as female.

Assessment of executive function in adolescence: A comparison of traditional and virtual reality tools	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Virtual reality; Executive function; Assessment; Adolescence; ClinicaVR: Classroom-Stroop	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ENVIRONMENT; CLASSROOM; BEHAVIOR; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; DEFICITS; REHABILITATION; INHIBITION; CHILDREN	Paper-pencil type tests are traditionally used in the assessment of executive functions (EF); however, concerns have been raised as to whether these represent actual functioning in everyday life. Virtual reality (VR) environments offer a novel alternative for the assessment of cognitive function and therefore have the potential to enhance the evaluation of EF by presenting individuals with stimuli that come closer to reproducing everyday situations. The aims of this study were to (1) establish which traditional paper-pencil EF tests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) are associated with performance on a VR-Stroop task and (2) compare D-KEFS tests and the VR-Stroop task in their ability to predict everyday EF and behavior, as measured by the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Thirty-eight typically developing adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years completed the ClinicaVR: Classroom-Stroop, and five D-KEFS subtests (Trail Making, Tower, Twenty Questions, Verbal Fluency and Color-Word Interference). Their parents completed the BRIEF and CBCL questionnaires. The results indicate that performance on the VR-Stroop task correlates with both traditional forms of EF assessment (D-KEFS, BRIEF). In particular, performance on the VR-Stroop task was closely associated with performance on a paper-pencil inhibition task. Furthermore, VR-Stroop performance more accurately reflected everyday behavioral EF than paper-pencil tasks. VR appears to offer an ecological perspective on everyday functioning and could be seen as complementary to traditional tests in the assessment of complex cognitive abilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The CSP has been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, but it also occurs as a result of head injury. The aims were to assess the presence and characterization of the CSP in youth with traumatic brain injury (TBI), to assess whether injury severity or IQ measures were related to CSP size, and to examine brain morphometry changes associated with the CSP size. Ninety-eight survivors of TBI and 34 control children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Numerous methods were used to define the presence and characterization of the CSP including length, classification of abnormally large CSP, rating of the CSP, and volume. There was no difference in presence of CSP between TBI patients and controls; however, there was larger and more severely graded CSP in the patient group. Size of the CSP correlated positively with injury severity, and regions that correlated most significantly with CSP size were the right entorhinal cortex and bilateral hippocampus. Characterizing the CSP and related brain changes may provide important information concerning disturbances seen after a TBI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We estimated white matter fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and hippocampal structural connectivity in two independent cohorts. The ADNI cohort included 108 subjects [25 cognitively normal, 21 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, 47 non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 15 Alzheimer's disease]. A second cohort included 34 subjects [15 cognitively normal and 19 amnestic mild cognitive impairment] recruited in Montreal. All subjects underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment in addition to diffusion and T1 MRI. Individual fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were generated using FSL-DTIfit. In addition, hippocampal structural connectivity maps expressing the probability of connectivity between the hippocampus and cortex were generated using a pipeline based on FSL-probtrackX. Voxel-based group comparison statistics of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and hippocampal structural connectivity were estimated using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. The proportion of abnormal to total white matter volume was estimated using the total volume of the white matter skeleton. We found that in both cohorts, amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients had 27-29% white matter volume showing higher mean diffusivity but no significant fractional anisotropy abnormalities. No fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity differences were observed between non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients and cognitively normal subjects. Alzheimer's disease patients had 66.3% of normalized white matter volume with increased mean diffusivity and 54.3% of the white matter had reduced fractional anisotropy. Reduced structural connectivity was found in the hippocampal connections to temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate and frontal regions only in the Alzheimer's group. The severity of white matter degeneration appears to be higher in advanced clinical stages, supporting the construct that these abnormalities are part of the pathophysiological processes of Alzheimer's disease.

No proper consensus has been reached despite the fact that a proper understanding of the developmental time course of these changes, and whether their occurrence is limited to or within specific time windows, is crucial to our understanding of the crossmodal phenomena. An extensive review of the literature reveals that while the majority of investigations to date have examined the crossmodal plasticity available to late blind individuals in quantitative terms, recent findings rather suggest that this reorganization also likely changes qualitatively compared to what is observed in early blindness. This obviously could have significant repercussions not only for the training and rehabilitation of blind individuals, but for the development of appropriate neuroprostheses designed to aid and potentially restore vision. Important parallels will also be drawn with the current state of research on deafness, which is particularly relevant given in the development of successful neuroprostheses (e.g., cochlear implants) for providing auditory input to the central nervous system otherwise aurally deafferented. Lastly, this paper will address important inconsistencies across the literature concerning the definition of distinct blind groups based on the age of blindness onset, and propose several alternatives to using such a categorization.

The assessment of differential incidence and prevalence across populations can reveal spatial, temporal and demographic patterns which are important for identifying genetic and environmental factors contributing to MS. However, study methodologies vary and the quality of the methods can influence the estimates. This study aimed to systematically review European studies of incidence and prevalence of MS and to provide a quantitative assessment of their methodological quality. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed to obtain all original population-based studies of MS incidence and prevalence in European populations conducted and published between January 1985 and January 2011. Only peer-reviewed full-text articles published in English or French were included. All abstracts were screened for eligibility and two trained reviewers abstracted the data and graded the quality of each study using a tool specifically designed for this study. Results: There were 123 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The study estimates were highly heterogeneous, even within regions or countries. Quality was generally higher in the more recent studies, which also tended to use current diagnostic criteria. Prevalence and incidence estimates tended to be higher in the more recent studies and were higher in the Nordic countries and in northern regions of the British Isles. With rare exceptions, prevalence and incidence estimates were higher in women with ratios as high as 3:1. Few studies examined ethnicity. Epidemiological data at the national level was uncommon and there were marked geographical disparities in available data, with large areas of Europe unrepresented and other regions well-represented in the literature. Only 37% of the studies provided standardized estimates. Conclusions: Despite the breadth of the literature on the epidemiology of MS in Europe, inter-study comparisons are hampered by the lack of standardization. Further research should focus on regions not yet studied and the evaluation of ethnic differences in MS prevalence and incidence. National-level studies using current diagnostic criteria, validated case definitions and similar age-and sex-standardization would allow better geographical comparisons.

Differential Effects of Parkinson's Disease and Dopamine Replacement on Memory Encoding and Retrieval	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VERBAL-LEARNING TEST; BASAL GANGLIA LESIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; EPISODIC MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CORTICAL FUNCTION; RECEPTOR AGONIST; DORSAL STRIATUM; NORMAL HUMANS	Increasingly memory deficits are recognized in Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, the dopamine-producing cells of the substantia nigra (SN) are significantly degenerated whereas those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are relatively spared. Dopamine-replacement medication improves cognitive processes that implicate the SN-innervated dorsal striatum but is thought to impair those that depend upon the VTA-supplied ventral striatum, limbic and prefrontal cortices. Our aim was to examine memory encoding and retrieval in PD and how they are affected by dopamine replacement. Twenty-nine PD patients performed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and a non-verbal analogue, the Aggie Figures Learning Test (AFLT), both on and off dopaminergic medications. Twenty-seven, age-matched controls also performed these memory tests twice and their data were analyzed to correspond to the ON-OFF order of the PD patients to whom they were matched. We contrasted measures that emphasized with those that accentuated retrieval and investigated the effect of PD and dopamine-replacement on these processes separately. For PD patients relative to controls, encoding performance was normal in the off state and was impaired on dopaminergic medication. Retrieval was impaired off medication and improved by dopamine repletion. This pattern of findings suggests that VTA-innervated brain regions such as ventral striatum, limbic and prefrontal cortices are implicated in encoding, whereas the SN-supplied dorsal striatum mediates retrieval. Understanding this pattern of spared functions and deficits in PD, and the effect of dopamine replacement on these distinct memory processes, should prompt closer scrutiny of patients' cognitive complaints to inform titration of dopamine replacement dosages along with motor symptoms.

During the first two weeks of life, rat pups exhibit significant CRH and ACTH responses to stress although the adrenal GC output remains reduced. At the same time, pups also display increased sensitivity to GC feedback, but it is unclear whether eCBs play a role in mediating fast GC feedback in neonatal life. In our studies, we examined the role of eCBs in the rapid suppression of anoxia-induced ACTH release and determined whether eCB action could be modulated by the levels of circulating GCs present at the time of stress. PND8 pups were subjected to 3-min anoxia with AM251, a CB1R blocker, injected 30 min prior to stress onset. The effects of either metyrapone (MET) (a steroidogenic 11beta-hydroxylase blocker) or methylprednisolone (PRED) (a synthetic GC) pretreatment on AM251 effect and the stress response were evaluated. Treatment with AM251 before stress onset tended to increase overall ACTH and CORT secretion, and also delayed the return to baseline ACTH. The AM251 effect on ACTH in PND8 pups was lost in MET-treated pups, who exhibited high basal and stimulated ACTH release and no CORT response to stress. Methylprednisolone suppressed ACTH stress responses although AM251 still delayed restoration of ACTH levels to the baseline. This suggests that the eCB effect on ACTH secretion in neonates is most evident when there is a dynamic fluctuation of corticosterone levels. Interestingly, AM251 increased basal and stimulated corticosterone secretion in all treatments including MET, suggestive of a direct action of CB1R blockade on adrenal steroidogenesis. (C) 2012 IBRO.

Here, we report the protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the effects of this training compared to conventional therapy in a sample of community-dwelling adults with acquired brain injury and/or stroke. Methods/design: We will recruit 100 community-dwelling survivors at least six months post-acquired brain injury or stroke who report executive dysfunction during a telephone interview, confirmed in pre-training testing. Following pre-training testing, participants will be randomized to the ecologically valid strategy training or conventional therapy and receive two one-hour sessions for eight weeks (maximum of 15 hours of therapy). Post-testing will occur immediately following the training and three months later. The primary outcome is self-reported change in performance on everyday life activities measured using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, a standardized, semi-structured interview. Secondary outcomes are objective measurement of performance change from videotapes of treatment session, Performance Quality Rating Scale; executive dysfunction symptoms, Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult; participation in everyday life, Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory Participation Index; and ability to solve novel problems, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile. Discussion: This study is of a novel approach to promoting improvements in attainment of everyday life goals through managing executive dysfunction using an ecologically valid strategy training approach, the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance. This study compares the efficacy of this approach with that of conventional therapy. The approach has the potential to be a valuable treatment for people with chronic acquired brain injury and/or stroke.

Although Dcx knockout (KO) mice exhibit normal isocortical development and architecture, they show lamination defects of the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer largely restricted to the CA3 region. Dcx-KO mice also exhibit interneuron abnormalities. As well as the interest of testing their general neurocognitive profile, Dcx-KO mice also provide a relatively unique model to assess the effects of a disorganized CA3 region on learning and memory. Based on its prominent anatomical and physiological features, the CA3 region is believed to contribute to rapid encoding of novel information, formation and storage of arbitrary associations, novelty detection, and short-term memory. We report here that Dcx-KO adult males exhibit remarkably preserved hippocampal-and CA3-dependant cognitive processes using a large battery of classical hippocampus related tests such as the Barnes maze, contextual fear conditioning, paired associate learning and object recognition. In addition, we show that hippocampal adult neurogenesis, in terms of proliferation, survival and differentiation of granule cells, is also remarkably preserved in Dcx-KO mice. In contrast, following social deprivation, Dcx-KO mice exhibit impaired social interaction and reduced aggressive behaviors. In addition, Dcx-KO mice show reduced behavioral lateralization. The Dcx-KO model thus reinforces the association of neuropsychiatric behavioral impairments with mouse models of intellectual disability.

Though clinical routine is using mainly diffusion weighted and tensor imaging approaches, Q-ball imaging and diffusion spectrum imaging techniques have become more widely available. They are frequently used in research-oriented investigations in particular those aiming at measuring brain network connectivity. In this work, we aim at assessing the dependency of connectivity measurements on various diffusion encoding schemes in combination with appropriate data modeling. We process and compare the structural connection matrices computed from several diffusion encoding schemes, including diffusion tensor imaging, q-ball imaging and high angular resolution schemes, such as diffusion spectrum imaging with a publically available processing pipeline for data reconstruction, tracking and visualization of diffusion MR imaging. The results indicate that the high angular resolution schemes maximize the number of obtained connections when applying identical processing strategies to the different diffusion schemes. Compared to the conventional diffusion tensor imaging, the added connectivity is mainly found for pathways in the 50-100mm range, corresponding to neighboring association fibers and long-range associative, striatal and commissural fiber pathways. The analysis of the major associative fiber tracts of the brain reveals striking differences between the applied diffusion schemes. More complex data modeling techniques (beyond tensor model) are recommended 1) if the tracts of interest run through large fiber crossings such as the centrum semi-ovale, or 2) if non-dominant fiber populations, e. g. the neighboring association fibers are the subject of investigation. An important finding of the study is that since the ground truth sensitivity and specificity is not known, the comparability between results arising from different strategies in data reconstruction and/or tracking becomes implausible to understand.

Constitutive mu-Opioid Receptor Activity Leads to Long-Term Endogenous Analgesia and Dependence	SCIENCE			English	Article							ADENYLYL-CYCLASE; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; MORPHINE-WITHDRAWAL; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; OPIATE DEPENDENCE; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; NERVE INJURY; IN-VIVO; MICE; POTENTIATION	Opioid receptor antagonists increase hyperalgesia in humans and animals, which indicates that endogenous activation of opioid receptors provides relief from acute pain; however, the mechanisms of long-term opioid inhibition of pathological pain have remained elusive. We found that tissue injury produced mu-opioid receptor (MOR) constitutive activity (MORCA) that repressed spinal nociceptive signaling for months. Pharmacological blockade during the posthyperalgesia state with MOR inverse agonists reinstated central pain sensitization and precipitated hallmarks of opioid withdrawal (including adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate overshoot and hyperalgesia) that required N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase type 1. Thus, MORCA initiates both analgesic signaling and a compensatory opponent process that generates endogenous opioid dependence. Tonic MORCA suppression of withdrawal hyperalgesia may prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain.	[Corder, G.; Doolen, S.; Donahue, R. R.; Taylor, B.

To delineate the dynamic morphological changes involved in this process, 52 healthy male and female adolescents (11-17 years old) were neuroimaged twice using magnetic resonance imaging, approximately 2 years apart. Using a novel morphometric analysis procedure combining the FreeSurfer and BrainVisa image software suites, we quantified global and lobar change in cortical thickness, outer surface area, the gyrification index, the average Euclidean distance between opposing sides of the white matter surface (gyral white matter thickness), the convex ("exposed") part of the outer cortical surface (hull surface area), sulcal length, depth, and width. We found that the cortical surface flattens during adolescence. Flattening was strongest in the frontal and occipital cortices, in which significant sulcal widening and decreased sulcal depth co-occurred. Globally, sulcal widening was associated with cortical thinning and, for the frontal cortex, with loss of surface area. For the other cortical lobes, thinning was related to gyral white matter expansion. The overall flattening of the macrostructural three-dimensional architecture of the human cortex during adolescence thus involves changes in gray matter and effects of the maturation of white matter.

Marked individual differences in these responses are seen in laboratory animals, related in part to input from the prefrontal cortex. Here we measured the relation between cortical morphology and drug-induced striatal dopamine release in healthy young people. Participants were 24 (17 male, 7 female; age 23.0 +/- 6.2 years) stimulant drug-naive subjects who underwent PET [C-11]raclopride scans with 0.3 mg/kg d-amphetamine orally and placebo, and an anatomical MRI scan for measuring cortical thickness. As expected, d-amphetamine produced significant reductions in [C-11]raclopride binding potential in the striatum as a percentage of the value in the placebo condition. There was substantial individual variability in this response, which was correlated with cortical thickness in the frontal lobe as a whole. The association was strongest in the anterior part of the right lateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral supplementary motor area. Athicker cortex was correlated with a smaller dopamine response. Together, this work demonstrates in humans an association between cortical thickness and the striatal dopamine response to drugs of abuse. Although prefrontal regulation of striatal function has been well studied, it was unclear whether the thickness of the prefrontal cortex was an acceptable proxy to the function of that region.

A flat (isoelectric) EEG, which is usually recorded during very deep coma, is considered to be a turning point between a living brain and a deceased brain. Therefore the isoelectric EEG constitutes, together with evidence of irreversible structural brain damage, one of the criteria for the assessment of brain death. In this study we use EEG recordings for humans on the one hand, and on the other hand double simultaneous intracellular recordings in the cortex and hippocampus, combined with EEG, in cats. They serve to demonstrate that a novel brain phenomenon is observable in both humans and animals during coma that is deeper than the one reflected by the isoelectric EEG, and that this state is characterized by brain activity generated within the hippocampal formation. This new state was induced either by medication applied to postanoxic coma (in human) or by application of high doses of anesthesia (isoflurane in animals) leading to an EEG activity of quasi-rhythmic sharp waves which henceforth we propose to call n-complexes (Nu-complexes). Using simultaneous intracellular recordings in vivo in the cortex and hippocampus (especially in the CA3 region) we demonstrate that n-complexes arise in the hippocampus and are subsequently transmitted to the cortex. The genesis of a hippocampal n-complex depends upon another hippocampal activity, known as ripple activity, which is not overtly detectable at the cortical level. Based on our observations, we propose a scenario of how self-oscillations in hippocampal neurons can lead to a whole brain phenomenon during coma.

Interaction of 14-3-3 zeta with Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau within Alzheimer's Disease Neurofibrillary Tangles	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; MEDIATES PHOSPHORYLATION; BRAIN; AGGREGATION; TAUOPATHIES; MUTATIONS; MECHANISM; MISSENSE; SUBUNIT	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of abnormal, straight filaments and paired helical filaments (PHFs) that are coated with amorphous aggregates. When PHFs are treated with alkali, they untwist and form filaments with a ribbonlike morphology. Tau protein is the major component of all of these ultrastructures. 14-3-3 zeta is present in NFTs and is significantly upregulated in AD brain. The molecular basis of the association of 14-3-3 zeta within NFTs and the pathological significance of its association are not known. In this study, we have found that 14-3-3 zeta is copurified and co-immunoprecipitates with tau from NFTs of AD brain extract. In vitro, tau binds to both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated tau. When incubated with 14-3-3 zeta, tau forms amorphous aggregates, single-stranded, straight filaments, ribbonlike filaments, and PHF-like filaments, all of which resemble the corresponding ultrastructures found in AD brain. Immuno-electron microscopy determined that both tau and 14-3-3 zeta are present in these ultrastructures and that they are formed in an incubation time-dependent manner. Amorphous aggregates are formed first. As the incubation time increases, the size of amorphous aggregates increases and they are incorporated into single-stranded filaments. Single-stranded filaments laterally associate to form double-stranded, ribbonlike, and PHF-like filaments. Both tau and phosphorylated tau aggregate in a similar manner when they are incubated with 14-3-3 zeta. Our data suggest that 14-3-3 zeta has a role in the fibrillization of tau in AD brain, and that tau phosphorylation does not affect 14-3-3 zeta-induced tau aggregation.

SPATIOTEMPORAL PROFILES OF NEURONS RECEPTIVE FIELDS IN THE CAT POSTEROMEDIAL LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reverse correlation; PMLS; electrophysiology; extrastriate cortex; visual pathways	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; ADJACENT THALAMIC NUCLEI; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; SIMULATED OPTIC FLOW; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; DIRECTIONAL SELECTIVITY	The cortical area located in the lateral portion of the posteromedial suprasylvian sulcus (PMLS) is considered a key area for motion processing. It receives major projections from areas 17 and 18 but also from the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex where neurons exhibit, for the most part, complex receptive fields (RF). Based on these inputs, complex-like RFs would be expected for PMLS neurons and results from hand-plot mapping support this idea. However, PMLS neurons' first-order spatiotemporal RF profiles and their role in shaping neuronal response characteristics is currently unknown. In this study, the first-order spatiotemporal characteristics of PMLS cells were revealed using reverse correlation analysis, based on responses elicited by coarse white noise stimuli. Experiments were carried out in adult anesthetized cats. Detailed RF profiles were obtained by analyzing bright and dark subfields separately. Results indicate that the average maximal spike probability is higher for dark subfields than for their paired bright subfields. Spatial RF analysis shows that neurons exhibit oval RF subfields and that their size is larger for dark subfields. The majority of cells have complex-like profiles, with spatially overlapping RF subfields. Temporal analysis showed that for the majority of cells, subfields are coincidentally activated; however, a subset of neurons exhibit time-dissociated subfield peak activity windows. Correlation analysis between spatial and temporal parameters of RF subfields and their neuron's response characteristics to gratings was also performed. The data show that the direction index is positively correlated with subfield size difference and negatively correlated with spatial subfield overlap. Modulation index is negatively correlated with the degree of temporal subfield activity overlap. We conclude that first-order structures are important functional factors that shape PMLS neurons response characteristics. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BRADYKININ B-2 RECEPTORS INCREASE HIPPOCAMPAL EXCITABILITY AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SEIZURES IN MICE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autoradiography; electrophysiology; epilepsy; kainate; kindling	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; KALLIKREIN-KININ SYSTEM; BRAIN-INJURY; PILOCARPINE MODEL; B2 RECEPTORS; B1 RECEPTORS; SPINAL-CORD; RAT MODEL; ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION	Bradykinin (BK) and its receptors (B1 and B2) may exert a role in the pathophysiology of certain CNS diseases, including epilepsy. In healthy tissues, B2 receptors are constitutively and widely expressed and B1 receptors are absent or expressed at very low levels, but both receptors, particularly B1, are up-regulated under many pathological conditions. Available data support the notion that up-regulation of B1 receptors in brain areas like the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex favors the development and maintenance of an epileptic condition. The role of B2 receptors, instead, is still unclear. In this study, we used two different models to investigate the susceptibility to seizures of B1 knockout (KO) and B2 KO mice. We found that B1 KO are more susceptible to seizures compared with wild-type (WT) mice, and that this may depend on B2 receptors, in that (i) B2 receptors are overexpressed in limbic areas of B1 KO mice, including the hippocampus and the piriform cortex; (ii) hippocampal slices prepared from B1 KO mice are more excitable than those prepared from WT controls, and this phenomenon is B2 receptor-dependent, being abolished by B2 antagonists; (iii) kainate seizure severity is attenuated by pretreatment with a non-peptide B2 antagonist in WT and (more effectively) in B1 KO mice. These data highlight the possibility that B2 receptors may have a role in the responsiveness to epileptogenic insults and/or in the early period of epileptogenesis, that is, in the onset of the molecular and cellular events that lead to the transformation of a normal brain into an epileptic one.

We wanted to compare the effects of early and late surgical timing on non-neurological outcomes in persons with traumatic complete SCI. All cases of traumatic complete SCI referred to a single institution between 2000 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The occurrence of pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), pressure ulcer (PU), and all other postoperative complications were recorded. Cost of acute hospitalization was calculated for each patient based on administrative data. Patients operated on within 24h of the trauma were compared with patients operated on later than 24h after the trauma. The effects of surgical timing on complication rate and cost of hospitalization were adjusted for potential confounding variables using multiple regression analyses. Fifty-five patients were operated on 24h from injury and 142 were operated on >24h from injury. Baseline demographic and clinical variables were comparable between the two groups. Pneumonia, UTI, and the presence of any complications were significantly higher in the group operated on >24h post-trauma. Cost of hospitalization was higher among patients operated >24h post-trauma (24h: 22,828$ vs. >24h: 29,714$). Surgical timing >24h was a predictor of pneumonia, UTI, total complications. and higher cost of hospitalization after controlling for other confounding variables. This study shows that surgical decompression and stabilization 24h following a complete SCI may be a cost-effective strategy to reduce the postoperative complication rate.

Network interactions within the canine intrinsic cardiac nervous system: implications for reflex control of regional cardiac function	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							ATRIAL GANGLIONATED PLEXUS; HEART-FAILURE; VENTRICULAR NEURONS; PARASYMPATHETIC CONTROL; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY; ISCHEMIC-HEART; CORD NEURONS; STIMULATION; DEATH	The aims of the study were to determine how aggregates of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons transduce the cardiovascular milieu versus responding to changes in central neuronal drive and to determine IC network interactions subsequent to induced neural imbalances in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Activity from multiple IC neurons in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was recorded in eight anaesthetized canines using a 16-channel linear microelectrode array. Induced changes in IC neuronal activity were evaluated in response to: (1) focal cardiac mechanical distortion; (2) electrical activation of cervical vagi or stellate ganglia; (3) occlusion of the inferior vena cava or thoracic aorta; (4) transient ventricular ischaemia, and (5) neurally induced AF. Low level activity (ranging from 0 to 2.7 Hz) generated by 92 neurons was identified in basal states, activities that displayed functional interconnectivity. The majority (56%) of IC neurons so identified received indirect central inputs (vagus alone: 25%; stellate ganglion alone: 27%; both: 48%). Fifty per cent transduced the cardiac milieu responding to multimodal stressors applied to the great vessels or heart. Fifty per cent of IC neurons exhibited cardiac cycle periodicity, with activity occurring primarily in late diastole into isovolumetric contraction. Cardiac-related activity in IC neurons was primarily related to direct cardiac mechano-sensory inputs and indirect autonomic efferent inputs. In response to mediastinal nerve stimulation, most IC neurons became excessively activated; such network behaviour preceded and persisted throughout AF. It was concluded that stochastic interactions occur among IC local circuit neuronal populations in the control of regional cardiac function. Modulation of IC local circuit neuronal recruitment may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cardiac disease, including atrial arrhythmias.	[Beaumont, Eric; Southerland, E.

Here, we examine the potential relationship between the BDNFMet allele, introversion and declarative memory in middle-age adults. Methods: A total of 132 middle-aged healthy adults took part in this study that included taking a blood sample for genetic profiling, a short battery of neuropsychological tests and the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), widely used to assess the Big Five personality. Results: Controlling for age, level of education and sex, a multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) computing the effect of BDNF polymorphism on extraversion and declarative memory revealed a significant association (D-1,D-128 = 4.79; p = 0.03; eta(2)(p) = 0.053). Using the Sobel Goodman Mediation Test, it was found that 25.61% of the relationship between genotype and declarative memory performance was mediated by introversion. Subsequent correlational analyses yielded a strong and significant correlation (beta = 0.53; p < 0.001) between introversion and declarative memory specific to BDNFMet individuals. Conclusion: this study highlights the pertinence of further investigating gene x personality x environment interactions to account for the significant variability that is observed in cognitive function in late life.

Unexpectedly, N-terminal amidination significantly altered the in vitro opioid activity profiles. Guan-analogues of TIPP-related delta opioid antagonists showed delta partial agonist or mixed delta partial agonist/mu partial agonist activity. Guanidinylation of the mixed mu agonist/delta antagonists H-Dmt-Tic-Phe-Phe-NH2 (DIPP-NH2) and H-Dmt-Tic Psi[CH2NH]Phe-Phe-NH2 (DIPP-NH2[Psi]) converted them to mixed mu agonist/delta agonists. A docking study revealed distinct positioning of DIPP-NH2 and Guan-DIPP-NH2 in the delta receptor binding site. Lys(3)-analogues of DIPP-NH2 and DIPP-NH2[Psi] (guanidinylated or non-guanidinylated) turned out to be mixed mu/kappa agonists with delta antagonist-, delta partial agonist- or delta full agonist activity. Compounds with some of the observed mixed opioid activity profiles have therapeutic potential as analgesics with reduced side effects or for treatment of cocaine addiction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel mouse model for genetic variation in 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase exhibits disturbed purine synthesis with impacts on pregnancy and embryonic development	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; ONE-CARBON METABOLISM; METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE DEHYDROGENASE-CYCLOHYDROLASE; TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CONOTRUNCAL HEART-DEFECTS; G-GREATER-THAN; REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY; TRIFUNCTIONAL ENZYME; PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE; FOLATE INTAKE	Genetic variants in one-carbon folate metabolism have been identified as risk factors for disease because they may impair the production or use of one-carbon folates required for nucleotide synthesis and methylation. p.R653Q (1958GA) is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formylTHF) synthetase domain of the trifunctional enzyme MTHFD1; this domain produces the formylTHF which is required for the de novo synthesis of purines. Approximately 20 of Caucasians are homozygous for the Q allele. MTHFD1 p.R653Q has been proposed as a risk factor for neural tube defects (NTDs), congenital heart defects (CHDs) and pregnancy losses. We have generated a novel mouse model in which the MTHFD1 synthetase activity is inactivated without affecting protein expression or the other activities of this enzyme. Complete loss of synthetase activity (Mthfd1S(-/-)) is incompatible with life; embryos die shortly after 10.5 days gestation, and are developmentally delayed or abnormal. The proportion of 10-formylTHF in the plasma and liver of Mthfd1S(/-) mice is reduced (P 0.05), and de novo purine synthesis is impaired in Mthfd1S(/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, P 0.005). Female Mthfd1S(/-) mice had decreased neutrophil counts (P 0.05) during pregnancy and increased incidence of developmental defects in embryos (P 0.052). These findings suggest that synthetase deficiency may lead to pregnancy complications through decreased purine synthesis and reduced cellular proliferation. Additional investigation of the impact of synthetase polymorphisms on human pregnancy is warranted.	[Christensen, K.

The notion of "controllable lifestyle (CL) specialties," defined by work hours and income, is gaining in popularity. As a result, many reports advocate providing a 'lifestyle-friendly' work environment to attract medical graduates. However, little has been documented about the priority in choosing specialties across the diverse career opportunities. This nationwide study was conducted in Japan with the aim of identifying factors that influence specialty choice. It looked for characteristic profiles among senior students and junior doctors who were choosing between different specialties. Methods: We conducted a survey of 4th and 6th (final)-year medical students and foundation year doctors, using a questionnaire enquiring about their specialty preference and to what extent their decision was influenced by a set of given criteria. The results were subjected to a factor analysis. After identifying factors, we analysed a subset of responses from 6th year students and junior doctors who identified a single specialty as their future career, to calculate a z-score (standard score) of each factor and then we plotted the scores on a cobweb chart to visualise characteristic profiles. Results: Factor analysis yielded 5 factors that influence career preference. Fifteen specialties were sorted into 4 groups based on the factor with the highest z-score: "fulfilling life with job security" (radiology, ophthalmology, anaesthesiology, dermatology and psychiatry), "bioscientific orientation" (internal medicine subspecialties, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, emergency medicine, urology, and neurosurgery), and "personal reasons" (paediatrics and orthopaedics). Two other factors were "advice from others" and "educational experience". General medicine / family medicine and otolaryngology were categorized as "intermediate" group because of similar degree of influence from 5 factors. Conclusion: What is valued in deciding a career varies between specialties. Emphasis on lifestyle issues, albeit important, might dissuade students and junior doctors who are more interested in bioscientific aspects of the specialty or have strong personal reasons to pursue the career choice. In order to secure balanced workforce across the specialties, enrolling students with varied background and beliefs should be considered in the student selection process.

A new form of rapid binocular plasticity in adult with amblyopia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; INTEROCULAR SUPPRESSION; ANISOMETROPIC AMBLYOPIA; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION; CRITICAL PERIOD; NEURAL BASIS; CONTRAST; OCCLUSION; SUMMATION	Amblyopia is a neurological disorder of binocular vision affecting up to 3% of the population resulting from a disrupted period of early visual development. Recently, it has been shown that vision can be partially restored by intensive monocular or dichoptic training (4-6 weeks). This can occur even in adults owing to a residual degree of brain plasticity initiated by repetitive and successive sensory stimulation. Here we show that the binocular imbalance that characterizes amblyopia can be reduced by occluding the amblyopic eye with a translucent patch for as little as 2.5 hours, suggesting a degree of rapid binocular plasticity in adults resulting from a lack of sensory stimulation. The integrated binocular benefit is larger in our amblyopic group than in our normal control group. We propose that this rapid improvement in function, as a result of reduced sensory stimulation, represents a new form of plasticity operating at a binocular site.

This trial (NSABP B-38; Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women Who Have Undergone Surgery for Node-Positive Breast Cancer) asked whether the incorporation of a fourth drug could improve outcomes relative to two standard regimens and provided a direct comparison of those two regimens. Patients and Methods We randomly assigned 4,894 women with node-positive early-stage breast cancer to six cycles of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC), four cycles of dose-dense (DD) doxorubicin Land cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of DD paclitaxel (P; DD AC -> P), or DD AC -> P with four cycles of gemcitabine (G) added to the DD paclitaxel (DD AC -> PG). Primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support was required; erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were used at the investigator's discretion. Results There were no significant differences in 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) between DD AC -> PG and DD AC -> P (80.6% v 82.2%; HR, 1.07; P = .41), between DD AC -> PG and TAC (80.6% v 80.1%; HR, 0.93; P = .39), in 5-year overall survival (OS) between DD AC -> PG and DD AC -> P (90.8% v 89.1%; HR, 0.85; P = .13), between DD AC -> PG and TAC (90.8% v 89.6%; HR, 0.86; P = .17), or between DD AC -> P versus TAC for DFS (HR, 0.87; P = .07) and OS (HR, 1.01; P = .96). Grade 3 to 4 toxicities for TAC, DD AC -> P, and DD AC -> PG, respectively, were febrile neutropenia (9%, 3%, 3%; P < .001), sensory neuropathy (< 1%, 7%, 6%; P < .001), and diarrhea (7%, 2%, 2%; P < .001). Exploratory analyses for ESAs showed no association with DFS events (HR, 1.02; P = .95). Conclusion Adding G to DD AC -> P did not improve outcomes. No significant differences in efficacy were identified between DD AC -> P and TAC, although toxicity profiles differed.

As a result, Rho GTPase activities are tightly spatiotemporally regulated in order to ensure homeostasis within the cell. Though the roles of Rho GTPases during neural development have been well documented, their participation during neurodegeneration has been far less characterized. Herein we discuss our current knowledge of the role and function of Rho GTPases and regulators during neurodegeneration, and highlight their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention in common neurodegenerative disorders.

Moderating variables of music training-induced neuroplasticity: a review and discussion	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						music training; neuroplasticity; imaging; training age; sex; absolute pitch; training type	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GRAY-MATTER DENSITY; ABSOLUTE PITCH; HUMAN BRAIN; PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES	A large body of literature now exists to substantiate the long-held idea that musicians' brains differ structurally and functionally from non-musicians' brains. These differences include changes in volume, morphology, density, connectivity, and function across many regions of the brain. In addition to the extensive literature that investigates these differences cross-sectionally by comparing musicians and non-musicians, longitudinal studies have demonstrated the causal influence of music training on the brain across the lifespan. However, there is a large degree of inconsistency in the findings, with discordance between studies, laboratories, and techniques. A review of this literature highlights a number of variables that appear to moderate the relationship between music training and brain structure and function. These include age at commencement of training, sex, absolute pitch (AP), type of training, and instrument of training. These moderating variables may account for previously unexplained discrepancies in the existing literature, and we propose that future studies carefully consider research designs and methodologies that control for these variables.

However, although the neuronal network processing infant cues has been studied for visual and auditory signals; to date, no such information exists for chemosensory signals. We contrasted the cerebral activity underlying the processing of infant odor properties in 15 women newly given birth for the first time and 15 women not given birth while smelling the body odor of unfamiliar 2 day-old newborn infants. Maternal status-dependent activity was demonstrated in the thalamus when exposed to the body odor of a newly born infant. Subsequent regions of interest analyses indicated that dopaminergic neostriatal areas are active in maternal-dependent responses. Taken together, these data suggests that body odors from 2 day-old newborns elicit activation in reward-related cerebral areas in women, regardless of their maternal status. These tentative data suggests that certain body odors might act as a catalyst for bonding mechanisms and highlights the need for future research on odor-dependent mother-infant bonding using parametric designs controlling for biological saliency and general odor perception effects.

An X-Linked Cobalamin Disorder Caused by Mutations in Transcriptional Coregulator HCFC1	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							VITAMIN-B-12 METABOLISM; METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA; CELL-FUNCTION; HCF-1; IDENTIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; PROTEIN; EXPRESSION; PROMOTERS; COMPLEX	Derivatives of vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) are essential cofactors for enzymes required in intermediary metabolism. Defects in cobalamin metabolism lead to disorders characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine in blood and urine. The most common inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, cblC type, is caused by mutations in MMACHC. However, several individuals with presumed cblC based on cellular and biochemical analysis do not have mutations in MMACHC. We used exome sequencing to identify the genetic basis of an X-linked form of combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, designated cblX. A missense mutation in a global transcriptional coregulator, HCFC1, was identified in the index case. Additional male subjects were ascertained through two international diagnostic laboratories, and 13/17 had one of five distinct missense mutations affecting three highly conserved amino acids within the HCFC1 kelch domain. A common phenotype of severe neurological symptoms including intractable epilepsy and profound neurocognitive impairment, along with variable biochemical manifestations, was observed in all affected subjects compared to individuals with early-onset cblC. The severe reduction in MMACHC mRNA and protein within subject fibroblast lines suggested a role for HCFC1 in transcriptional regulation of MMACHC, which was further supported by the identification of consensus HCFC1 binding sites in MMACHC. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HCFC1 expression resulted in the coordinate downregulation of MMACHC mRNA. This X-linked disorder demonstrates a distinct disease mechanism by which transcriptional dysregulation leads to an inborn error of metabolism with a complex clinical phenotype.

While multiple studies examined the neural correlates of encoding strategies, few studies have explicitly focused on the self-initiation of elaborative encoding. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a method which can transiently disrupt neural activity, was administered during an associative encoding task. rTMS was either applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or to the vertex (a control region not involved in memory encoding) during presentation of pairs of words. Pairs could be semantically related or not related. Two encoding instructions were given, either cueing participants to analyze semantic relationships (cued condition), or to memorize the pair without any specific strategy cues (the self-initiated condition). Participants filled out a questionnaire regarding their use of memory strategies and performed a cued-recall task. We hypothesized that if the DLPFC plays a role in the self-initiation of elaborative encoding we would observe a reduction in memory performance in the self-initiated condition, particularly for related. We found a significant correlation between the effects of rTMS and strategy use, only in the self-initiated condition with related pairs. High strategy users showed reduced performance following DLPFC stimulation, while low strategy users tended to show increased recall following DLPFC stimulation during encoding. These results suggest the left DLPFC may be involved in the self-initiation of memory strategy use, and individuals may utilize different neural networks depending on their use of encoding strategies.

Characterization of the Role of eIF4G in Stimulating Cap- and IRES-Dependent Translation in Aplysia Neurons	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INITIATION; PHOSPHORYLATION; EUKARYOTES; MECHANISMS; PLASTICITY; HELICASE; KINASE; CANCER; SITES; 4G	The rate-limiting step(s) of translation in the nervous system have not been clearly identified. We have been examining this question in the cell body of the Aplysia sensory neuron, where translational regulation is important for the regulation of synaptic strength. In the present study, we examined the role of the adaptor protein eIF4G. We cloned Aplysia eIF4G (Ap4G) and Ap4G contains all the standard metazoan eIF4G protein-protein interaction domains. Overexpressing Ap4G in Aplysia sensory neurons caused an increase in both cap-dependent and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation using a previously characterized bicistronic fluorescent reporter. Unexpectedly, measurement of overall translation using the methionine analog, L-azidohomoalanine, revealed that overexpression of Ap4G did not lead to an increase in overall translation rates. Indeed, the effect of Ap4G on the bicistronic reporter depended on the presence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5' UTR encoded by the vector. We have previously shown that Mnk strongly decreased cap-dependent translation and this depended on a putative 4G binding domain. Here we extend these results showing that even in the absence of the uORF, overexpression of Mnk strongly decreases cap-dependent translation and this depends on the Mnk binding site in eIF4G. Similarly, an increase in cap-dependent translation seen with overexpression of elongation factor 2 kinase did not depend on the uORF. Overall, we show that eIF4G is rate limiting for translation of an mRNA encoding an uORF, but is not generally a rate-limiting step for translation.

There is growing interest in the biological processes relevant to endothelial cells but limited tools exist to selectively evaluate subcellular functions of this cell type in vivo. Here, we report a novel transgenic animal model that expresses mitochondrially targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) via the Hb9 promoter, a homeobox transcription factor with limited known involvement in the vasculature. Random integration of the transgene, containing the entire mouse Hb9 promoter, was found to be expressed in a variety of vascularised tissues. Further inspection revealed that Mito-EGFP localizes to the endothelial cells (ECs) of a subset of microvascular blood vessels, especially in the central nervous system (CNS), heart, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and skin. We demonstrate the utility of this novel transgenic mouse, named Endo-MitoEGFP, in the detection, imaging, and isolation of microvascular ECs and evaluation of EC mitochondrial function isolated from adult animals. These transgenic mice will be useful to studies of ECs in development, physiology, and pathology.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-six patients with POAG and 40 matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination and a high resolution structural magnetic resonance scan. Cortical thickness analysis was used to assess the changes between patients and controls. Correlations between the thickness of the visual cortex and RNFL thickness were also analyzed. Finally, the relationship between the severity of changes in the visual cortex and RNFL thickness was evaluated by comparing patients with mild and severe groups. Results: POAG patients showed significant bilateral cortical thinning in the anterior half of the visual cortex around the calcarine sulci (left BA 17 and BA 18, right BA17) and in some smaller regions located in the left middle temporal gyrus (BA37) and fusiform gyrus (BA19). The thickness of the visual cortex correlated positively with RNFL thickness (left, r = 0.44, p = 0.01; right, r = 0.38, p = 0.03). Significant differences between mild and severe groups were observed with regard to both RNFL thickness and the thickness of bilateral visual cortex (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that cortical thickness analysis may be sufficiently sensitive to detect cortical alterations in POAG and that the measurement has great potential for clinical application.

The importance of trial-to-trial fluctuations of synaptic inputs has recently been investigated in neuroscience. Such fluctuations are ignored in the most conventional techniques because they are removed when trials are averaged during linear regression techniques. Here, we propose a novel recursive algorithm based on Gaussian mixture Kalman filtering (GMKF) for estimating time-varying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from single trials of noisy membrane potential in current clamp recordings. The KF is followed by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the statistical parameters (time-varying mean and variance) of the synaptic inputs in a non-parametric manner. As our proposed algorithm is repeated recursively, the inferred parameters of the mixtures are used to initiate the next iteration. Unlike other recent algorithms, our algorithm does not assume an a priori distribution from which the synaptic inputs are generated. Instead, the algorithm recursively estimates such a distribution by fitting a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The performance of the proposed algorithms is compared to a previously proposed PF-based algorithm (Paninski et al., 2012) with several illustrative examples, assuming that the distribution of synaptic input is unknown. If noise is small, the performance of our algorithms is similar to that of the previous one. However, if noise is large, they can significantly outperform the previous proposal. These promising results suggest that our algorithm is a robust and efficient technique for estimating time varying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from single trials of membrane potential recordings.

METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, cyclists were observed during 60-minute periods at 22 locations on the island of Montreal. There were 1-3 observation periods per location. Observations took place between August 16 and October 31, 2011. Standard statistical methods were used, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 4,789 cyclists were observed. The helmet-wearing proportion of all cyclists observed was 46% (95% CI 44-47). Women had a higher helmet-wearing proportion than men (50%, 95% CI 47-52 vs. 44%, 95% CI 42-45, respectively). Youth had the highest helmet-wearing proportion (73%, 95% CI 64-81), while young adults had the lowest (34%, 95% CI 30-37). Visible minorities were observed wearing a helmet 29% (95% CI 25-34) of the time compared to Caucasians, 47% (95% CI 46-49). BIXI (bike sharing program) riders were observed wearing a helmet 12% (95% CI 10-15) of the time compared to riders with their own bike, 51% (95% CI 49-52). CONCLUSIONS: Although above the national average, bicycle helmet use in Montreal is still considerably low given that the majority of cyclists do not wear a helmet. Injury Prevention Programs could target the entire cyclist population, but special attention may be warranted in specific groups such as young men, visible minorities, BIXI riders, and those riding in tourist areas. Additionally, a collaborative enterprise with the bicycle sharing system BIXI Montreal (TM) could prove to be fruitful in addressing the availability of bike helmets for BIXI riders.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome assessment and its treatment options are discussed. Description of nicotine withdrawal and related publications specific to the critically ill are also reviewed. A brief comment as to sedative and opiate withdrawal follows. Data and Summary: The role of currently published alcohol withdrawal syndrome pharmacologic strategies (benzodiazepines, ethanol, clomethiazole, antipsychotics, barbiturates, propofol, and dexmedetomidine) is detailed. Studies on nicotine withdrawal management in the ICU focus mainly on the safety (mortality) of nicotine replacement therapy. Study characteristics and methodological limitations are presented. Conclusion: We recommend a pharmacologic regimen titrated to withdrawal symptoms in ICU patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines are a reasonable option; phenobarbital appears to confer some advantages in combination with benzodiazepines. Propofol and dexmedetomidine have not been rigorously tested in comparative studies of drug withdrawal treatment; their use as additional or alternative strategies for managing withdrawal syndromes in ICU patients should therefore be individualized to each patient. Insufficient data preclude recommendations as to nicotine replacement therapy and management of iatrogenic drug withdrawal in ICU patients.

Acute tryptophan depletion in humans: a review of theoretical, practical and ethical aspects	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							AMINO-ACID MIXTURES; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; 5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID; PLASMA TRYPTOPHAN; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; DEPRESSED-PATIENTS; ACUTE SEROTONIN; NORMAL MALES; MELATONIN SECRETION	The acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) technique has been used extensively to study the effect of low serotonin in the human brain. This review assesses the validity of a number of published criticisms of the technique and a number of previously unpublished potential criticisms. The conclusion is that ATD can provide useful information when results are assessed in conjunction with results obtained using other techniques. The best-established conclusion is that low serotonin function after tryptophan depletion lowers mood in some people. However, this does not mean that other variables, altered after tryptophan depletion, are necessarily related to low serotonin. Each aspect of brain function has to be assessed separately. Furthermore, a negative tryptophan depletion study does not mean that low serotonin cannot influence the variable studied. This review suggests gaps in knowledge that need to be filled and guidelines for carrying out ATD studies.

Many management approaches are not appropriate for this population. Therapeutic Touch, an alternative approach based on the theory of energy medicine, has been shown to promote physiological stability in preterm neonates and reduce pain in some adult studies. The objective was to determine whether Therapeutic Touch is efficacious in decreasing pain in preterm neonates. Methods: Infants <30 weeks' gestational age participated in a randomized control trial in 2 level III neonatal intensive care units. All evaluations, analyses, and heel lance procedure were conducted with only the therapist knowing the group assignment. Immediately before and after the heel lance procedure, the therapist performed nontactile Therapeutic Touch (n = 27) with infant behind curtains, leaving the curtained area for the heel lance, performed by another. In the sham condition (n = 28), the therapist stood by the incubator with hands by her side. The Premature Infant Pain Profile was used for pain response and time for heart rate to return to baseline for recovery. Heart rate variability and stress response were secondary outcomes. Results: There were no group differences in any of the outcomes. Mean Premature Infant Pain Profile scores across 2 minutes of heel lance procedure in 30-second blocks ranged from 7.92 to 8.98 in the Therapeutic Touch group and 7.64 to 8.46 in the sham group. Interpretation: Therapeutic Touch given immediately before and after heel lance has no comforting effect in preterm neonates. Other effective strategies involving actual touch should be considered.

In view of the need for early AD diagnosis, brain Casp6 activity was investigated by measuring Tau cleaved by Casp6 (Tau Delta Casp6) protein in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 7 non-cognitively impaired; 5 mild cognitively impaired; and 12 mild, moderate, and severe AD patients. Levels of Tau Delta Casp6 in CSF accurately reflected the levels of active Casp6 and Tau Delta Casp6 detected using immunohistochemistry in hippocampal sections from the same individuals. Levels of CSF Tau Delta Casp6 significantly correlated with AD severity and with lower Global Cognitive Scores; Mini-Mental State Examination scores; and episodic, semantic, and working memory scores. Regression analyses suggested that the CSF Tau Delta Casp6 levels combined with Tau Delta Casp6 brain pathology predict cognitive performance. These results indicate that CSF Tau Delta Casp6 levels hold promise as a novel early biomarker of AD.

In recent years, the G-protein-coupled receptor neurotensin (NT) type 2 (NTS2) emerged as an attractive target for treating transitory pain states. To date, however, there is no evidence for its role in the regulation of chronic peripheral neuropathies. Here, we found that NTS2 receptors were largely localized to primary afferent fibers and superficial dorsal horns. Changes in the time course of the gene expression profile of NT, NTS1, and NTS2 were observed over a 28-d period following the sciatic nerve constriction [chronic constriction injury (CCI) model]. We next determined the effects of central delivery of selective-NTS2 agonists to CCI-treated rats on both mechanical allodynia (evoked withdrawal responses) and weight-bearing deficits (discomfort and quality-of-life proxies). The NTS2 analogs JMV431, levocabastine, and -lactotensin were all effective in reducing ongoing tactile allodynia in CCI-treated rats. Likewise, amitriptyline, pregabalin, and morphine significantly attenuated CCI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. NTS2 agonists were also efficient in reversing weight-bearing and postural deficits caused by nerve damage, unlike reference analgesics currently used in the clinic. Thus, NTS2 agonists may offer new treatment avenues for limiting pain associated with peripheral neuropathies and improve functional rehabilitation and well-being.Tetreault, P., Beaudet, N., Perron, A., Belleville, K., Rene, A., Cavelier, F., Martinez, J., Stroh, T., Jacobi, A.

It is an essential coenzyme in mammals for two reactions: the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase and the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Symptoms of Cbl deficiency are hematological, neurological and cognitive, including megaloblastic anaemia, tingling and numbness of the extremities, gait abnormalities, visual disturbances, memory loss and dementia. During pregnancy Cbl is essential, presumably because of its role in DNA synthesis and methionine synthesis; however, there are conflicting studies regarding an association between early pregnancy loss and Cbl deficiency. We here review the literature about the requirement for Cbl during pregnancy, and summarized what is known of the expression pattern and function of genes required for Cbl metabolism in embryonic mouse models.

Functional neuroimaging of the interference between working memory and the control of periodic ankle movement timing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						fMRI; Dual-tasking; Ankle dorsi-plantarflexion; Hastening	BRAIN ACTIVATION; BIMANUAL MOVEMENTS; DUAL-TASKING; FMRI; DORSIFLEXION; WALKING; GAIT; COORDINATION; VARIABILITY; AGE	Background: Limited information processing capacity in the brain necessitates task prioritisation and subsequent adaptive behavioural strategies for the dual-task coordination of locomotion with severe concurrent cognitive loading. Commonly observed strategies include prioritisation of gait at the cost of reduced performance in the cognitive task. Alternatively alterations of gait parameters such as gait velocity have been reported presumably to free processing capacity for the benefit of performance in the cognitive task. The aim of this study was to describe the neuroanatomical correlates of adaptive behavioural strategies in cognitive-motor dual-tasking when the competition for information processing capacity is severe and may exceed individuals' capacity limitations. Methods: During an fMRI experiment, 12 young adults performed slow continuous, auditorily paced bilateral anti-phase ankle dorsi-plantarflexion movements as an element of normal gait at .5 Hz in single and dual task modes. The secondary task involved a visual, alphabetic N-back task with presentation rate uttered around .7 Hz. The N-back task, which randomly occurred in 0-back or 2-back form, was modified into a silent counting task to avoid confounding motor responses at the cost of slightly increasing the task's general coordinative complexity. Participants' ankle movements were recorded using an optoelectronic motion capture system to derive kinematic parameters representing the stability of the movement timing and synchronization. Participants were instructed to perform both tasks as accurately as possible. Results: Increased processing complexity in the dual-task 2-back condition led to significant changes in movement parameters such as the average inter-response interval, the coefficient of variation of absolute asynchrony and the standard deviation of peak angular velocity. A regions-of-interest analysis indicated correlations between these parameters and local activations within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) such that lower IFG activations coincided with performance decrements. Conclusions: Dual-task interference effects show that the production of periodically timed ankle movements, taken as modelling elements of the normal gait cycle, draws on higher-level cognitive resources involved in working memory. The interference effect predominantly concerns the timing accuracy of the ankle movements. Reduced activations within regions of the left IFG, and in some respect also within the superior parietal lobule, were identified as one factor affecting the timing of periodic ankle movements resulting in involuntary 'hastening' during severe dual-task working memory load. This 'hastening' phenomenon may be an expression of re-automated locomotor control when higher-order cognitive processing capacity can no longer be allocated to the movements due to the demands of the cognitive task. The results of our study also propose the left IFG as a target region to improve performance during dual-task walking by techniques for non-invasive brain stimulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, because children's brains are commonly assessed years after birth, the timing of such maternal influences in humans is unclear. This study aimed to examine the consequences of antenatal and postnatal exposure to maternal anxiety upon early infant development of the hippocampus, a key structure for stress regulation. A total of 175 neonates underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at birth and among them 35 had repeated scans at 6 months of age. Maternal anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at week 26 of pregnancy and 3 months after delivery. Regression analyses showed that antenatal maternal anxiety did not influence bilateral hippocampal volume at birth. However, children of mothers reporting increased anxiety during pregnancy showed slower growth of both the left and right hippocampus over the first 6 months of life. This effect of antenatal maternal anxiety upon right hippocampal growth became statistically stronger when controlling for postnatal maternal anxiety. Furthermore, a strong positive association between postnatal maternal anxiety and right hippocampal growth was detected, whereas a strong negative association between postnatal maternal anxiety and the left hippocampal volume at 6 months of life was found. Hence, the postnatal growth of bilateral hippocampi shows distinct responses to postnatal maternal anxiety. The size of the left hippocampus during early development is likely to reflect the influence of the exposure to perinatal maternal anxiety, whereas right hippocampal growth is constrained by antenatal maternal anxiety, but enhanced in response to increased postnatal maternal anxiety.

Besides passive transport, only a few active carrier mechanisms, such as glucose transporters and amino acid transporters, have so far been exploited to mediate the accumulation of imaging probes in the brain. An important question for the future is whether some of the abundant active carrier systems located at the blood-brain barrier can be used to shuttle potential, but non-crossing, imaging agents into the brain.

The present study aimed to determine: 1) whether the effect of E on NOP performance is the result of enhanced preference for novelty, per se, or facilitated object-recognition memory, and 2) whether E affects NOP performance through actions it has within the perirhinal cortex/entorhinal cortex region (PRh/EC). Ovariectomized rats received either systemic chronic low 17-beta estradiol (E2; similar to 20 pg/ml serum) replacement alone or in combination with systemic acute high administration of estradiol benzoate (EB; 10 mu g), or in combination with intracranial infusions of E2 (244.8 pg/mu l) or vehicle into the PRh/EC For one of the intracranial experiments, E2 was infused either immediately before, immediately after, or 2 h following the familiarization (i.e., learning) phase of the NOP test. In light of recent evidence that raises questions about the internal validity of the NOP test as a method of indexing object-recognition memory, we also tested rats on a delayed nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task of object recognition following systemic and intra-PRh/EC infusions of E2. Both systemic acute and intra-PRh/EC infusions of E enhanced novelty preference, but only when administered either before or immediately following familiarization. In contrast, high E (both systemic acute and intra-PRh/EC) impaired performance on the DNMS task. The findings suggest that while E2 in the PRh/EC can enhance novelty preference, this effect is probably not due to an improvement in object-recognition abilities.

Data from 29 and 21 studies including acute and long-term cardiovascular interventions were retrieved. Meta-analyses revealed that acute exercise had moderate (SMD = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.03,0.49; p= 0.03; N= 22) whereas long-term had small (SMD = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.02,0.27; p=0.02; N=37) effects on short-term memory. In contrast, acute exercise showed moderate to large (SMD = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.28,0.75; p < 0.0001; N= 20) whereas long-term exercise had insignificant effects (SMD = 0.07; 95% CI = -0.13,0.26; p = 0.51; N=22) on long-term memory. We argue that acute and long-term cardiovascular exercise represent two distinct but complementary strategies to improve memory. Acute exercise improves memory in a time-dependent fashion by priming the molecular processes involved in the encoding and consolidation of newly acquired information. Long-term exercise, in contrast, has negligible effects on memory but provides the necessary stimuli to optimize the responses of the molecular machinery responsible for memory processing. Strategically combined, acute and long-term interventions could maximize the benefits of cardiovascular exercise on memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Indeed, a number of studies have shown that observing actors of one's own race facilitate motor, sensory and pain resonance, possibly mediated by the human mirror-neuron system (hMNS). However, most of these studies have used stimuli that included emotional or cultural components, hence obscuring the precise contribution of physical similarity to resonance phenomena per se. The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of physical similarity (skin color) on motor resonance using stimuli that have no emotional and cultural components. We used both behavioral (imitation) and electrophysiological measures (mu-rhythm) to assess the effects of skin color on the hMNS during the observation of simple finger movements. Our results show that, in line with previous results, observation of biological movements resulted in faster reaction times and greater mu-rhythm suppression compared to non-biological movements. However, physical similarity did not affect imitation speed or mu-rhythm desynchronization. These results suggest that physical similarity with an observed action in terms of skin color does not modulate hMNS activity, and that the enhanced resonance effects reported in the previous studies are likely attributable to cultural and emotional aspects.

Yet prenatal cigarette smoke exposure (PCSE) is seen as a major risk factor for childhood behavior problems. Recent data also suggest that co-exposure to neurotoxic environmental contaminants can exacerbate the effects of PCSE on behavior. This study examined the association between PCSE and behavior at school age in a sample of Inuit children from Nunavik, Quebec, where co-exposure to environmental contaminants is also an important issue. Interactions with lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg), two contaminants associated with behavioral problems, were also explored. Methods: Participants were 271 children (mean age = 11.3 years) involved in a prospective birth-cohort study. PCSE was assessed through maternal recall. Assessment of child behavior was obtained from the child's classroom teacher on the Teacher Report Form (TRF) and the Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBD). Exposure to contaminants was assessed from umbilical cord and child blood samples. Other confounders were documented by maternal interview. Results: After control for contaminants and confounders, PCSE was associated with increased externalizing behaviors and attention problems on the TRF and higher prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessed on the DBD. No interactions were found with contaminants. Interpretation: This study extends the existing empirical evidence linking PCSE to behavioral problems in schoolaged children by reporting these effects in a population where tobacco use is normative rather than marginal. Coexposure to Pb and Hg do not appear to exacerbate tobacco effects, suggesting that these substances act independently. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Initial clinical experience with the GORE septal occluder for the treatment of atrial septal defects and patent foramen ovale	EUROINTERVENTION			English	Article						ASD closure; GSO device; PFO closure	CONGENITAL HEART-DISEASE; PERCUTANEOUS CLOSURE; TRANSCATHETER CLOSURE; PARADOXICAL EMBOLISM; FOLLOW-UP; ANEURYSM; TERM; PFO; SYSTEMS	Aims: To describe the initial experience with the GORE (R) septal occluder (GSO), a new septal occluder for the treatment of atrial septal defects (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO). Methods and results: This was a prospective single-centre review of patients undergoing percutaneous closure for a PFO or ASD with the GSO. A clinical evaluation and follow-up echocardiography were performed at three months with transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in case of PFO and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in ASDs. Between July 2011 and February 2012, thirty-eight patients underwent PFO (n=29) or ASD (n=9) closure with the GSO using TEE (n=36, 94.7%) or intracardiac echocardiography (n=2, 5.3%) guidance. In PFOs, three-month TEE was available in 24 patients and showed no residual shunt in 18 (75%), bubble shunt in two (8.3%) and bubble shunt after Valsalva in four (16.7%). In ASDs, three-month TTE showed no shunt in eight patients (88.8%) and residual shunt in one patient (11.2%). There was no device embolisation, air embolism, procedure-related stroke or pericardial effusion. No neurological events occurred during the follow-up period. Conclusions: This initial experience with the new GSO device has demonstrated acceptable safety with no procedural complications and acceptable efficacy with low rates of residual shunting at three-month follow-up.

We propose that DEBs reflect brain activity underlying social cognition, in particular, motor-affective resonance generated by the mirror neuron system. We developed a Mirror Behavior Questionnaire (MBQ) to assess some dimensions of mirror behaviors and investigated relationships between MBQ scores and DEBs in a large of university undergraduate cohort. MBQ scores were normally distributed and described by a four-factor structure (Empathy/Emotional Contagion, Behavioral Imitation, Sleepiness/Anger Contagion, Motor Skill Imitation). DEB scores correlated positively with MBQ total and factor scores even with social desirability, somnambulism and somniloquy controlled. Emotion-specific DEB items correlated with corresponding emotion-specific MBQ items, especially crying and smiling. Results provide preliminary evidence for cross-state relationships between propensities for dream-enacting and mirror behaviors especially behaviors involving motor-affective resonance and our suggestion that motor-affective resonance mediates dream-enactment imagery during sleep and emotional empathy during waking.

Firstly, concise dynamics of teleoperation systems consisting of a single master robot, multiple coordinated slave robots, and the object are developed in the task space. To handle asymmetric time-varying delays in communication channels and unknown asymmetric input dead zones, the nonlinear dynamics of the teleoperation system are transformed into two subsystems through feedback linearization: local master or slave dynamics including the unknown input dead zones and delayed dynamics for the purpose of synchronization. Then, a model reference neural network control strategy based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and adaptive techniques is proposed. The developed control approach ensures that the defined tracking errors converge to zero whereas the coordination internal force errors remain bounded and can be made arbitrarily small. Throughout this paper, stability analysis is performed via explicit Lyapunov techniques under specific LMI conditions. The proposed adaptive neural network control scheme is robust against motion disturbances, parametric uncertainties, time-varying delays, and input dead zones, which is validated by simulation studies.

This potential form is the basis of the neural code. We suppose that the release of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft follows a Poisson process, and that they diffuse according to integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in 3-D with random initial positions and velocities. The diffusion occurs in an isotropic environment between two infinite parallel planes representing the pre-and postsynaptic membrane. We state that the presynaptic membrane is perfectly reflecting and that the other is perfectly absorbing. The activation of the receptors polarizes the postsynaptic membrane according to a parallel RC circuit scheme. We present the results obtained by simulations according to a Gillespie algorithm and we show that our model exhibits realistic postsynaptic behaviors from a simple quantal occurrence.

The model assumes that interneurons in A are heavily interconnected allowing synchronization. This invites modeling the dynamics by means of a discrete time map. The model takes into account the influence of excitatory and inhibitory cells and reflects the architecture of synapses along the axons. The acquisition of a sustained chaotic state is characterized by means of a natural invariant probability measure. The time to attain this probability measure can be estimated.

Symptoms of depression can be mimicked in animals after olfactory bulbectomy (OBX). Animal models of depression-like behavior produce similar neuronal rearrangements in various brain regions as seen in patients affected by depression. We have recently observed that OBX produces neuronal hypotrophy in the piriform cortex (PirC) and CA1 hippocampus as well as decreased adult cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus. Thus we further evaluated the effects of OBX in neuronal arborization and spine density in brain regions involved in the control of circadian circle, emotion and memory processing such as The prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), infralimbic cortex (ILC), orbitolateral cortex (OLC) and entorhinal cortex (EC). Our present results show that along with severe behavioral deficits observed in these animals, OBX considerably decreased dendritic branching and the total dendritic length in the EC, a major interface of the hippocampus and neocortical regions. The remaining cortices and NAcc were not affected by OBX. Thus, we propose that the lack of input from the olfactory bulbs resulted in serial neuronal rearrangements in the PirC, EC, and hippocampus leading, at least partially, to behavioral deficits in emotion and memory processes.

Semiautomated tremor detection using a combined cross-correlation and neural network approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						Self-Organized Map (SOM); automated event detection; tectonic tremor	NON-VOLCANIC TREMOR; SAN-ANDREAS FAULT; SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; NONVOLCANIC TREMOR; SOUTHWEST JAPAN; EPISODIC TREMOR; CALIFORNIA; BENEATH; EARTHQUAKES; SEISMOGRAMS	Despite observations of tectonic tremor in many locations around the globe, the emergent phase arrivals, low-amplitude waveforms, and variable event durations make automatic detection a nontrivial task. In this study, we employ a new method to identify tremor in large data sets using a semiautomated technique. The method first reduces the data volume with an envelope cross-correlation technique, followed by a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm to identify and classify event types. The method detects tremor in an automated fashion after calibrating for a specific data set, hence we refer to it as being semiautomated. We apply the semiautomated detection algorithm to a newly acquired data set of waveforms from a temporary deployment of 13 seismometers near Cholame, California, from May 2010 to July 2011. We manually identify tremor events in a 3 week long test data set and compare to the SOM output and find a detection accuracy of 79.5%. Detection accuracy improves with increasing signal-to-noise ratios and number of available stations. We find detection completeness of 96% for tremor events with signal-to-noise ratios above 3 and optimal results when data from at least 10 stations are available. We compare the SOM algorithm to the envelope correlation method of Wech and Creager and find the SOM performs significantly better, at least for the data set examined here. Using the SOM algorithm, we detect 2606 tremor events with a cumulative signal duration of nearly 55 h during the 13 month deployment. Overall, the SOM algorithm is shown to be a flexible new method that utilizes characteristics of the waveforms to identify tremor from noise or other seismic signals.

The three-hit concept of vulnerability and resilience: Toward understanding adaptation to early-life adversity outcome	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Vulnerability; Resilience; Stress adaptation; Three hit; HPA axis; Developmental programming; Epigenetics Genetic predisposition; Early life environment; Later life environment	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR GENE; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; INFANT SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; EARLY SOCIAL ENRICHMENT; MATERNAL-CARE; DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY; ADRENOCORTICAL-RESPONSE	Stressful experiences during early-life can modulate the genetic programming of specific brain circuits underlying emotional and cognitive aspects of behavioral adaptation to stressful experiences later in life. Although this programming effect exerted by experience-related factors is an important determinant of mental health, its outcome depends on cognitive inputs and hence the valence an individual assigns to a given environmental context. From this perspective we will highlight, with studies in rodents, non-human primates and humans, the three-hit concept of vulnerability and resilience to stress-related mental disorders, which is based on gene environment interactions during critical phases of perinatal and juvenile brain development. The three-hit (i.e., hit-1: genetic predisposition, hit-2: early-life environment, and hit-3: later-life environment) concept accommodates the cumulative stress hypothesis stating that in a given context vulnerability is enhanced when failure to cope with adversity accumulates. Alternatively, the concept also points to the individual's predictive adaptive capacity, which underlies the stress inoculation and match/mismatch hypotheses. The latter hypotheses propose that the experience of relatively mild early-life adversity prepares for the future and promotes resilience to similar challenges in later-life; when a mismatch occurs between early and later-life experience, coping is compromised and vulnerability is enhanced. The three-hit concept is fundamental for understanding how individuals can either be prepared for coping with life to come and remain resilient or are unable to do so and succumb to a stress-related mental disorder, under seemingly identical circumstances.

Modulatory mechanisms of cortisol effects on emotional learning and memory: Novel perspectives	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Cortisol; Stress; Memory; Encoding; Consolidation; Modulators; PTSD	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; POLYMORPHISMS; AMYGDALA; IMPAIRS; CONTEXT; BRAIN; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; RECONSOLIDATION; ENVIRONMENTS	It has long been known that cortisol affects learning and memory processes. Despite a wealth of research dedicated to cortisol effects on learning and memory, the strength or even directionality of the effects often vary. A number of the factors that alter cortisol's effects on learning and memory are well-known. For instance, effects of cortisol can be modulated by emotional arousal and the memory phase under study. Despite great advances in understanding factors that explain variability in cortisol's effects, additional modulators of cortisol effects on memory exist that are less widely acknowledged in current basic experimental research. The goal of the current review is to disseminate knowledge regarding less well-known modulators of cortisol effects on learning and memory. Since several models for the etiology of anxiety, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), incorporate stress and the concomitant release of cortisol as important vulnerability factors, enhanced understanding of mechanisms by which cortisol exerts beneficial as opposed to detrimental effects on memory is very important. Further elucidation of the factors that modulate (or alter) cortisol's effects on memory will allow reconciliation of seemingly inconsistent findings in the basic and clinical literatures. The present review is based on a symposium as part of the 42nd International Society of Psychoneuroendocrinology Conference, New York, USA, that highlighted some of those modulators and their underlying mechanisms.

Dopamine is likely to modulate the responsiveness of entorhinal cortex neurons to sensory inputs, and excitatory synaptic responses in layers I/II of the entorhinal cortex in vitro can be either facilitated or suppressed by dopamine depending upon the concentration applied. Rewarding stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus leads to activation of dopamine neurons, and the present study evaluated the effect of rewarding stimulation on synaptic responses in the lateral entorhinal cortex evoked by stimulation of the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex in behaving rats. Rewarding brain stimulation reduced the amplitude of synaptic responses in the entorhinal cortex evoked by single pulses delivered to the piriform cortex at intervals of 100-500 ms following the train. Synaptic responses were suppressed when stimulation trains were delivered at a fixed interval, or when trains were initiated by the animal pressing a bar. The suppression depended on the strength of stimulation trains; delivery of higher frequency trains that were sufficient to induce maximal, or 50% of-maximal, rates of bar-pressing resulted in significant suppression effects, but lower frequency trains did not. Systemic administration of the dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist eticlopride, but not the D-1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 or the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, blocked the suppression of synaptic responses. Results suggest that rewarding brain stimulation leads to a phasic increase in dopamine in the entorhinal cortex resulting in a D-2 receptor-dependent suppression of excitatory synaptic responses, and that a similar synaptic modulation may be induced by stimuli associated with appetitive motivation and reward.

Additionally, in a reverse genetic approach in adult healthy subjects, risk allele carriers showed a higher medial prefrontal cortex blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during a flanker task examining motor inhibition as an aspect of impulsivity. To test whether this finding can be expanded to further aspects of impulsivity, we analysed the effects of the rs11819869 genotype on impulsivity-related traits on a behavioral, temperament and neural level in a large sample of healthy adolescents. We consider this reverse genetic approach specifically suited for use in a healthy adolescent sample, as these individuals comprise those who will eventually develop mental disorders in which impulsivity is implicated. Healthy adolescents from the IMAGEN study were included in the neuropsychological analysis (n=848) and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task (n=512). Various aspects of impulsivity were assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised, the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale, the Cambridge Cognition Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, and the Stop Signal Task (SST) in the fMRI paradigm. On a behavioral level, increased delay aversion was observed in risk allele carriers. Furthermore, risk allele carriers showed a higher BOLD response in an orbito-frontal target region during the SST, which declined to trend status after Family Wise Error correction. Our findings support the hypothesis that the schizophrenia-related risk variant of rs11819869 is involved in various aspects of impulsivity, and that this involvement occurs on a behavioral as well as an imaging genetics level.

This review examines the complex anatomy of the PPN region and suggests a functional mapping of the surrounding nuclei and fiber tracts that may serve as a guide to a more accurate placement of electrodes while avoiding potentially adverse effects. The relationships of the PPN were examined in different human brain atlases. Schematic representations of those structures in the vicinity of the PPN were generated and correlated with their potential stimulation effects. By providing a functional map and representative schematics of the PPN region, we hope to optimize the placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes, thereby maximizing safety and clinical efficacy.

Determining the cortical changes associated with MCI in PD, thus, may be useful in predicting the future development of dementia. To address this objective, 37 patients with PD, divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence MCI (18 with and 19 without) and 16 matched controls, underwent anatomic magnetic resonance imaging. Corticometry analyses were performed to measure the changes in cortical thickness and surface area as well as their correlation with disease duration. Compared with healthy controls, the PD-MCI group exhibited increased atrophy and changes of local surface area in the bilateral occipital, left temporal, and frontal cortices; whereas the PD non-MCI group exhibited only unilateral thinning and decreased surface area in the occipital lobe and in the frontal cortex. In addition, a comparison between the PD-MCI and PD non-MCI groups revealed increased local surface area in the occipital lobe, temporal lobe, and postcentral gyrus for the cognitively impaired patients. It is noteworthy that, in the PD-MCI group, cortical thickness had a significant negative correlation with disease duration in the precentral, supramarginal, occipital, and superior temporal cortices; whereas, in the PD non-MCI group, such a correlation was absent. The findings from this study reveal that, at the same stage of PD evolution, the presence of MCI is associated with a higher level of cortical changes, suggesting that cortical degeneration is increased in patients with PD because of the presence of MCI.

L. [1991]. A process dissociation framework: Separating automatic from intentional uses of memory. Journal of Memory and Language, 30, 513-541.) process-dissociation procedure. We find a positive relationship between intelligence and conscious memory, and no relationship between intelligence and unconscious influences once the impact of conscious influences are removed (Experiment 1). We also find that when participants cannot engage in conscious strategies, such as when there is insufficient time for learning, the relationships observed in Experiment 1 are eliminated (Experiments 2A and 2B). Our results support the notion that individual differences in intelligence reflect differences in conscious strategic processes (Karis, D., Fabiani, M., & Donchin, E. [1984]. "P300" and memory: Individual differences in the von Restorff effect. Cognitive Psychology, 16, 177-216.) and not differences in mental speed (Eysenck, H. J. (1984). Intelligence versus behavior.

A voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of regional grey and white matter volume abnormalities within the speech production network of children who stutter	CORTEX			English	Article						Speech motor control; Persistent developmental stuttering; Voxel-based morphometry; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)	INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; MOTOR CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FLUENT SPEECH; GRAY-MATTER; BROCAS AREA	It is well documented that neuroanatomical differences exist between adults who stutter and their fluently speaking peers. Specifically, adults who stutter have been found to have more grey matter volume (GMV) in speech relevant regions including inferior frontal gyrus, insula and superior temporal gyrus (Beal et al., 2007; Song et al., 2007). Despite stuttering having its onset in childhood only one study has investigated the neuroanatomical differences between children who do and do not stutter. Chang et al. (2008) reported children who stutter had less GMV in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and middle temporal gyrus relative to fluently speaking children. Thus it appears that children who stutter present with unique neuroanatomical abnormalities as compared to those of adults who stutter. In order to better understand the neuroanatomical correlates of stuttering earlier in its development, near the time of onset, we used voxel-based morphometry to examine volumetric differences between 11 children who stutter and 11 fluent children. Children who stutter had less GMV in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left putamen but more GMV in right Rolandic operculum and superior temporal gyrus relative to fluent children. Children who stutter also had less white matter volume bilaterally in the forceps minor of the corpus callosum. We discuss our findings of widespread anatomic abnormalities throughout the cortical network for speech motor control within the context of the speech motor skill limitations identified in people who stutter (Namasivayam and van Lieshout, 2008; Smits-Bandstra et al., 2006).

The present functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment investigated how self-relevance influences anger processing in the brain by independently manipulating target (oriented to self or to other) and emotion (neutral and anger). The perception of body expression of anger elicits activity in a previously identified network that includes the amygdala, the fusiform gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus and the premotor cortex. Activity within this network is independent of body direction and is parametrically modulated by the intensity of the bodily emotional expression. Moreover, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortices responded preferentially to anger expressions oriented to self. We suggest that these brain areas may participate in the selection of specific behavioural strategies when one is the potential target of someone's anger. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This work explores the effects of clinical variables on self-reported quality of life (QoL) in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), correlating this information with results from the Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE-31) and selective memory tests of the Barcelona Battery and the Rey-Osterrieth figure. Methods. We retrospectively analysed the records of 60 TLE patients and correlated patient variables (e. g. gender, aetiology; mesial TLE with hippocampal sclerosis [HS] versus lesional TLE, side of ictal onset, age, age at onset, duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and use of AEDs) with selective memory test scores and self-reported QoL. Results. Right ictal onset was associated with lower emotional well-being scores. MTLE-HS patients had lower QOLIE31 scores for seizure worry, social function, overall QoL, energy/fatigue, cognitive function, and obtained a lower overall score, compared to those with lesional TLE. Older age at epilepsy onset was associated with worse emotionalwell-being, energy/fatigue, medication effects, and seizure worry outcomes. Higher seizure frequency and older age at time of evaluation were associated with lower cognitive function scores. Generalised seizures were associated with lower scores based on the variables: seizure worry, overall quality of life, emotionalwell-being, and cognitive function. Regarding memory tests, only visuospatial memory correlated positively with cognitive function score. Patients with MTLE-HS underwent evaluation for pharmacoresistant epilepsy, on average, 10 years later than those with lesional TLE. Conclusions. MTLE-HS, right-sided epileptogenic zone, late onset, and higher seizure frequency were associated with worse QoL. Objective testing revealed specific memory deficits that were not reflected in self-reported QoL scores.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major cause of vision loss in which choroidal vessels penetrate the RPE-an important source of growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF), whose activation via the p75NTR receptor promotes apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis. We demonstrated previously that human T-lymphocyte-derived microparticles (LMPs) significantly inhibit angiogenesis in several models of ocular neovascularization. We investigated how LMPs modulate pro-and antiangiogenic microenvironments during choroidal angiogenesis. METHODS. Antiangiogenic effects of LMPs were investigated using a rat model of choroidal angiogenesis. The impact of LMPs on expression of major angiogenic factors was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). To determine whether p75NTR signalling was implicated in LMPs-induced activities, we used a specific antibody and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting p75NTR. Cellular apoptosis was determined via evaluation of activated caspase-3 and annexin V binding. RESULTS. The LMPs time-dependently inhibited choroidal angiogenesis by more than 64% after 48 hours of treatment. Removal of the RPE from choroidal explants abolished the antiangiogenic effects of LMPs. The mRNA levels of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and NGF were increased significantly following LMPs treatment of intact, but not RPE-removed choroids. Downregulation of PEDF and p75NTR significantly blocked the antiangiogenic effects of LMPs. Finally, induction of choroidal endothelial cell apoptosis by LMPs was dependent on p75NTR. CONCLUSIONS. We demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that LMPs markedly inhibit choroidal angiogenesis via mechanisms that are dependent on the integrity of the RPE, and that are mediated largely by the PEDF and proapoptotic activities of p75NTR.

Genome-Wide Mouse Mutagenesis Reveals CD45-Mediated T Cell Function as Critical in Protective Immunity to HSV-1	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS; PHOSPHATASE-DEFICIENT MICE; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-3; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; INTERFERON-GAMMA; TYPE-1 INFECTION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; NEUROGLIAL CHANGES	Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a lethal neurological disease resulting from infection with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1). Loss-of-function mutations in the UNC93B1, TLR3, TRIF, TRAF3, and TBK1 genes have been associated with a human genetic predisposition to HSE, demonstrating the UNC93B-TLR3-type I IFN pathway as critical in protective immunity to HSV-1. However, the TLR3, UNC93B1, and TRIF mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance and represent only a minority of HSE cases, perhaps reflecting the effects of additional host genetic factors. In order to identify new host genes, proteins and signaling pathways involved in HSV-1 and HSE susceptibility, we have implemented the first genome-wide mutagenesis screen in an in vivo HSV-1 infectious model. One pedigree (named P43) segregated a susceptible trait with a fully penetrant phenotype. Genetic mapping and whole exome sequencing led to the identification of the causative nonsense mutation L3X in the Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C gene (Ptprc(L3X)), which encodes for the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. Expression of MCP1, IL-6, MMP3, MMP8, and the ICP4 viral gene were significantly increased in the brain stems of infected Ptprc(L3X) mice accounting for hyper-inflammation and pathological damages caused by viral replication. Ptprc(L3X) mutation drastically affects the early stages of thymocytes development but also the final stage of B cell maturation. Transfer of total splenocytes from heterozygous littermates into Ptprc(L3X) mice resulted in a complete HSV-1 protective effect. Furthermore, T cells were the only cell population to fully restore resistance to HSV-1 in the mutants, an effect that required both the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and could be attributed to function of CD4(+) T helper 1 (Th1) cells in CD8(+) T cell recruitment to the site of infection. Altogether, these results revealed the CD45-mediated T cell function as potentially critical for infection and viral spread to the brain, and also for subsequent HSE development.

The present study used structural magnetic imaging to examine gray matter (GM) volumes among 27 men with schizophrenia preceded by CD (SZCD), 23 men with schizophrenia but without CD (SZCD), 27 men with CD only (CD), and 25 healthy (H) men. The groups with schizophrenia were similar in terms of age of onset and duration of illness, levels of psychotic symptoms, and medication. The 2 groups with CD were similar as to number of CD symptoms, lifelong aggressive behavior, and number of criminal convictions. Men with SZCD, relative to those with SZCD, displayed (1) increased GM volumes in the hypothalamus, the left putamen, the right cuneus/precuneus, and the right inferior parietal cortex after controlling for age, alcohol, and drug misuse and (2) decreased GM volumes in the inferior frontal region. Men with SZCD (relative to the SZCD group) and CD (relative to the H group) displayed increased GM volumes of the hypothalamus and the inferior and superior parietal lobes, which were not associated with substance misuse. Aggressive behavior, both prior to age 15 and lifetime tendency, was positively correlated with the GM volume of the hypothalamus. Thus, among males, SZCD represents a distinct subtype of schizophrenia. Although differences in behavior emerge in childhood and remain stable through adulthood, further research is needed to determine whether the differences in GM volumes result from abnormal neural development distinct from that of other males developing schizophrenia.

In addition to the well-characterized neurexins, recent studies identified presynaptic type ha receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) as mediators of presynaptic differentiation and triggers of postsynaptic differentiation, thus extending the roles of RPTPs from axon outgrowth and guidance. Similarly to neurexins, RPTPs exist in multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing that interact in a splice-selective code with diverse postsynaptic partners. The parallel RPTP and neurexin hub design facilitates synapse self-assembly through cooperation, pairs presynaptic similarity with postsynaptic diversity, and balances excitation with inhibition. Upon mutation of individual genes in neuropsychiatric disorders, imbalance of this synaptic organizing network may contribute to impaired cognitive function.

The benefits on mental health of regular exercise, which slows the age-dependent decline in maximal aerobic exercise capacity, have been established for centuries. In addition, the maintenance of an optimal cerebrovascular endothelial function through regular exercise, part of a healthy lifestyle, emerges as one of the key and primary elements of successful brain aging. Physical exercise requires the activation of specific brain areas that trigger a local increase in cerebral blood flow to match neuronal metabolic needs. In this review, we propose three ways by which exercise could maintain the cerebrovascular endothelial function, a premise to a healthy cerebrovascular function and an optimal regulation of cerebral blood flow. First, exercise increases blood flow locally and increases shear stress temporarily, a known stimulus for endothelial cell maintenance of Akt-dependent expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide generation, and the expression of antioxidant defenses. Second, the rise in circulating catecholamines during exercise not only facilitates adequate blood and nutrient delivery by stimulating heart function and mobilizing energy supplies but also enhances endothelial repair mechanisms and angiogenesis. Third, in the long term, regular exercise sustains a low resting heart rate that reduces the mechanical stress imposed to the endothelium of cerebral arteries by the cardiac cycle. Any chronic variation from a healthy environment will perturb metabolism and thus hasten endothelial damage, favoring hypoperfusion and neuronal stress.

In this study, an intracranial EEG-based seizure prediction method using measures of similarity with a reference state is proposed. Methods: 1565 h of continuous intracranial EEG data from 17 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy were investigated. The recordings included 175 seizures. In each patient the data was split into a training set and a testing set. EEG segments were analyzed using continuous wavelet transform. During training, a reference state was defined in the immediate preictal data and used to derive three features quantifying the discrimination between preictal and interictal states. A classifier was then trained in the feature space. Its performance was assessed using testing set and compared with a random predictor for statistical validation. Results: Better than random prediction performance was achieved in 7 patients. The sensitivity was higher than 85%, the warning rate was less than 0.35/h and the proportion of time under warning was less than 30%. Conclusion: Seizures are predicted above chance in 41% of patients using measures of state similarity. Significance: Sensitivity and specificity levels are potentially interesting for closed-loop seizure control applications. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

A sensor capable of relaying feedback from bladder activity to the implanted neurostimulator is required to implement a closed-loop system to improve overall implant efficacy and minimize deleterious effects to neural tissue caused by continuous electrical stimulation. In this paper, we present a method that allows real-time estimation of bladder volume from the primary afferent activity of bladder mechanoreceptors. Our method was validated with data acquired from anesthetized rats in acute experiments. It was possible to qualitatively estimate three states of bladder fullness in 100% of trials when the recorded afferent activity exhibited a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.6 or better. Furthermore, we could quantitatively estimate bladder volume, and also its pressure, using timeframes of properly chosen duration. The mean volume estimation error was 5.8 +/- 3.1%. Our results also demonstrate that it is possible to quantify both phasic and tonic bladder responses during slow filling and isovolumetric measurements, respectively.

Adaptations in brain reward circuitry underlie palatable food cravings and anxiety induced by high-fat diet withdrawal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						high-fat food; reward; anxiety; stress; mesolimbic; dopamine	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; ANXIOGENIC DRUG YOHIMBINE; IMPAIRED STRESS-RESPONSE; RAT RELAPSE MODEL; PREFERRED FOOD; REINFORCING EFFICACY; COCAINE WITHDRAWAL; INDUCED ANHEDONIA; DOPAMINE SYSTEM; DELTA-FOSB	OBJECTIVE: To identify the emotional and motivational processes that reinstate palatable food intake following removal of high-fat diet (HFD) and associated neuroadaptations tied to neurochemical and behavioural changes underlying dopaminergic function. METHODS: Adult male C57Bl6 mice were placed on a HFD (58% kcal fat) or ingredient-matched, low-fat diet (LFD; 11% kcal fat) for 6 weeks. At the end of diet-regimen mice were either maintained on their respective diets, or HFD and LFD were replaced with normal chow (withdrawal). Effort-based operant responding for sucrose and high-fat food rewards was measured along with basal and stress-induced corticosterone levels and anxiety (elevated-plus maze). Protein levels for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), corticosterone releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF-R1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phospho-CREB (pCREB) and DFosB (truncated splice variant of FosB) were assessed in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) via western immunoblotting. RESULTS: Six weeks of HFD resulting in significant weight gain elicited sucrose anhedonia, anxiety-like behaviour and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) hypersensitivity to stress. Withdrawal from HFD but not LFD-potentiated anxiety and basal corticosterone levels and enhanced motivation for sucrose and high-fat food rewards. Chronic high-fat feeding reduced CRF-R1 and increased BDNF and pCREB protein levels in the amygdala and reduced TH and increased DFosB protein in NAc and VTA. Heightened palatable food reward in mice withdrawn from HFD coincided with increased BDNF protein levels in NAc and decreased TH and pCREB expression in the amygdala. CONCLUSION: Anhedonia, anxiety and sensitivity to stressors develops during the course of HFD and may have a key role in a vicious cycle that perpetuates high-fat feeding and the development of obesity. Removal of HFD enhances stress responses and heightens vulnerability for palatable foods by increasing food-motivated behaviour. Lasting changes in dopamine and plasticity-related signals in reward circuitry may promote negative emotional states, overeating and palatable food relapse.

A Lifespan Perspective on Dependency and Self-Criticism: Age-Related Differences from 18 to 59	JOURNAL OF ADULT DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Self-Criticism; Dependency; Self-Definition; Relatedness; Personality Development; Lifespan development	DEPRESSIVE EXPERIENCES QUESTIONNAIRE; PARENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTROL; PERSONALITY-DEVELOPMENT; ADULTHOOD; VULNERABILITY; ADOLESCENTS; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; NEUROTICISM; INTERNET; ORIGINS	A sizeable body of research suggests that self-definition and relatedness represent two fundamental developmental streams across the lifespan (Blatt in Psychoanal Study Child 29:107-157, 1974; Blatt and Luyten in Dev Psychopathol 21:793-814, 2009). Adverse developmental experiences have been found to affect personality development leading to high levels of self-criticism or dependency. No research to date has examined the developmental trends of these factors across the lifespan or the moderating impact of important life experiences. In a sample of 3,586 Canadians aged 18-59, age-related differences in self-criticism and dependency were examined. Analyses were replicated in a multicultural sample of 612 Canadians and 647 individuals born and currently living on the continent of Asia. Controlling for both neuroticism and depressive symptoms, results showed that self-criticism and dependency decreased linearly across the lifespan in both samples and across cultures; however, the decrease in self-criticism was steeper for men compared to women, while the decrease in dependency was steeper for those without children compared to those with children. Furthermore, participants who were in a romantic relationship showed lower levels of self-criticism and higher levels of dependency compared to those who were not in a romantic relationship. Results suggest that people may develop a healthier view of close relationships with others and acquire more positive self-views over the course of their lives.

IL-33 Signaling Regulates Innate and Adaptive Immunity to Cryptococcus neoformans	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							ALLERGIC BRONCHOPULMONARY MYCOSIS; INDUCED AIRWAY INFLAMMATION; LYMPHOID-CELLS; PULMONARY INFECTION; TYPE-2 IMMUNITY; T-CELLS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; HUMAN BASOPHILS; MICE; CYTOKINES	Susceptibility to progressive infection with the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is associated with an allergic pattern of lung inflammation, yet the factors that govern this host response are not clearly understood. Using a clinically relevant mouse model of inhalational infection with virulent C. neoformans H99, we demonstrate a role for IL-33-dependent signaling in host immune defense. Infection of BALB/c mice with 10(4) CFU of C. neoformans H99 caused a time-dependent induction of IL-33 with accumulation of type 2 pulmonary innate lymphoid cells and alternatively activated macrophages in the lungs as well as Th2-polarized CD4(+) T cells in draining lymph nodes. IL-33R subunit T1/ST2-deficient (T1/ST2(-/-)) mice infected with C. neoformans H99 had improved survival with a decreased fungal burden in the lungs, spleen, and brain, compared with wild-type mice. Signaling through T1/ST2 was required for the accumulation and early production of IL-5 and IL-13 by lung type 2 pulmonary innate lymphoid cells. Further analysis of T1/ST2(-/-) mice revealed increased fungicidal exudate macrophages in the lungs and decreased C. neoformans-specific Th2 cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes. T1/ST2 deficiency also diminished goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus hypersecretion, bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia, alternative activation of macrophages, and serum IgE. These observations demonstrate that IL-33-dependent signaling contributes to the expansion of innate type 2 immunity and subsequent Th2-biased lung immunopathology that facilitates C. neoformans growth and dissemination.

In a 120-min session participants completed a verbal serial reaction time task, naming aloud 4 syllables in response to 4 visual stimuli. Unbeknownst to participants, the syllables formed a repeating 8-item sequence. PWS and PPD demonstrated slower reaction times for early but not late learning trials relative to controls reflecting delays but not deficiencies in general learning. PPD also demonstrated less accuracy in general learning relative to controls. All groups demonstrated similar limited explicit sequence knowledge. Both PWS and PPD demonstrated significantly less implicit sequence learning relative to controls, suggesting that stuttering may be associated with compromised functional integrity of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop.

Fused empirical mode decomposition and wavelets for locating combined damage in a truss-type structure through vibration analysis	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE A			English	Article						Truss structure; Vibration; Spectral analysis; Wavelet packet transform; Empirical mode decomposition; Artificial neural network (ANN)	STATIC TEST DATA; CRACK DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; QUANTIFICATION; FREQUENCIES; CORROSION; SYSTEM; BEAM	Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a relevant topic for civil systems and involves the monitoring, data processing and interpretation to evaluate the condition of a structure, in order to detect damage. In real structures, two or more sites or types of damage can be present at the same time. It has been shown that one kind of damaged condition can interfere with the detection of another kind of damage, leading to an incorrect assessment about the structure condition. Identifying combined damage on structures still represents a challenge for condition monitoring, because the reliable identification of a combined damaged condition is a difficult task. Thus, this work presents a fusion of methodologies, where a single wavelet-packet and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method are combined with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the automated and online identification-location of single or multiple-combined damage in a scaled model of a five-bay truss-type structure. Results showed that the proposed methodology is very efficient and reliable for identifying and locating the three kinds of damage, as well as their combinations. Therefore, this methodology could be applied to detection-location of damage in real truss-type structures, which would help to improve the characteristics and life span of real structures.

The liver-brain axis in liver failure: neuroinflammation and encephalopathy	NATURE REVIEWS GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY			English	Review							FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; ORNITHINE-L-ASPARTATE; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; BARRIER PERMEABILITY; RAT-BRAIN; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; CEREBRAL COMPLICATIONS	Systemic inflammation is common in liver failure and its acquisition is a predictor of hepatic encephalopathy severity. New studies provide convincing evidence for a role of neuroinflammation (inflammation of the brain per se) in liver failure; this evidence includes activation of microglia, together with increased synthesis in situ of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1 beta and IL-6. Liver-brain signalling mechanisms in liver failure include: direct effects of systemic proinflammatory molecules, recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation, brain accumulation of ammonia, lactate and manganese, and altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Ammonia and cytokines might act synergistically. Existing strategies to reduce ammonia levels (including lactulose, rifaximin and probiotics) have the potential to dampen systemic inflammation, as does albumin dialysis, mild hypothermia and N-acetylcysteine, the latter two agents acting at both peripheral and central sites. Minocycline, an agent with potent central anti-inflammatory properties, reduces neuroinflammation, brain oedema and encephalopathy in liver failure, as does the anti-TNF agent etanercept.

Post-formal thought in gerontagogy or beyond Piaget	PSYCHOLOGIE FRANCAISE			French	Article						Gerontatogy; Elderly; Post-formal thought; Theory X; Theory Y; Qualitative intelligence; Quantitative intelligence; Piaget; Dialectical thought; Wisdom	OLDER ADULTS; AGE; INTELLIGENCE	Jean Piaget, one of the most influential theorists in developmental psychology, assumed that formal thought, characterized by the development of an individual's logical capacities, was the last stage of adult thinking. According to Piaget's theory, adults undergo an unavoidable decline in their intellectual functions after formal thought. However, here we review how the brain evolved, describing its main structures, and examining each cerebral hemisphere's specific functions. Evidence is also provided for the production of new neurons and new connections between them, forcing a revision of old theories about the decline of intellectual functions in the elderly. We then consider Jones' theories X and Y, and the different definitions of intelligence (fluid vs. crystallized, and qualitative vs. quantitative), and how these perspectives have influenced the way we see intelligence. Evidence supporting the addition of another stage, named post-formal thought, is examined in the context of gerontagogy. Dialectical thought characterizes this stage, and developing wisdom is its main goal. We examine the two basic principles of dialectical thought, namely the principle of contradiction and the principle of relativity of everything. It is suggested that the learning of wisdom should be the focus of future university programs to educate the elderly.

Method: This study used a naturalistic, quasi-experimental design, to examine the outcomes of a cohort of 189 long-stay patients at Riverview Hospital (RVH), some of whom moved into Tertiary Psychiatric Residential Facilities (TPRFs), some into the community in less structured facilities, and some remained at RVH. Data was collected from clinical files at RVH and at each participating site, semi-structured interviews and self-report measures were completed with patients. In addition, semi-structured interviews were also conducted with staff members. Results: There was very minimal evidence of transinstitutionalization to prisons or homelessness; one participant resided in a correctional facility, one resided in a forensic facility, and one participant spent some time homeless. In addition, the majority of participants remained in residences that provided 24 h care. Eighty percent of our population was diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Psychiatric symptoms remained fairly stable; some embarrassing social behaviors increased; however, aggressive behaviors showed no increase; neuropsychological deficits did not deteriorate, there were even some improvements. Participants demonstrated increases in several independent living skills including: money management, food preparation and storage, job skills, and transportation skills. In addition, participants experienced a significant increase in their perceived quality of life. Conclusions: This study builds on existing research demonstrating that well-planned and appropriately resourced hospital closures can lead to positive psycho-social outcomes for participants and can successfully avoid negative outcomes such as transinstitutionalization to the judiciary system and homelessness.

Full-Length and Fragmented Netrin-1 in Multiple Sclerosis Plaques Are Inhibitors of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Migration	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; EMBRYONIC SPINAL-CORD; ACUTE LUNG INJURY; AXON GUIDANCE; DCC; REMYELINATION; INFLAMMATION; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS; KIDNEY	Oligodendrocytes exhibit a Limited capacity to remyelinate in multiple sclerosis. Factors present in multiple sclerosis lesions are thought to inhibit oligodendrocyte precursor cell migration, Limiting their recruitment to axons requiring remyelination; however, few inhibitors have been identified. A candidate inhibitor is netrin-1, a secreted protein that repels migrating oligodendrocyte precursor cells during neural development and is expressed by myelinating oligodendrocytes in the mature rodent central nervous system. Herein, we examined the distribution of netrin-1 in adult human white matter and multiple sclerosis Lesions. We detected full-Length netrin-1 protein and shorter netrin-1 fragments in samples of normal white matter and of multiple sclerosis Lesions from adult human brain. We demonstrate that peptides corresponding to amino terminal domains VI and V of netrin-1 repel migrating oligodendrocyte precursor cells, but Lack the chemoattractant activity of full-length netrin-1. Furthermore, recombinant domains VI-V of netrin-1 disrupt the chemoattractant activity of full-length netrin-1, consistent with a competitive mechanism of action. These findings indicate that full-Length and fragmented forms of netrin-1, found in multiple sclerosis lesions, have the capacity to inhibit oligodendrocyte precursor migration, identifying netrin-1 as a potential target for therapies that promote remyelination.

Patients with untreated stage III/IV NSCLC received 100 mg/m(2) nab-P weekly and C (area under the curve, AUC = 6) every 3 weeks (q3w) or 200 mg/m(2) sb-P plus C (AUC = 6) q3w. Primary end point was objective overall response rate (ORR). nab-P/C versus sb-P/C produced a significantly higher ORR (41% versus 24%; response rate ratio [RRR] 1.680; P < 0.001) in patients with squamous cell (SCC) NSCLC. For nab-P/C versus sb-P/C, ORRs were 26% versus 27% (RRR 0.966; P = 0.814) in patients with adenocarcinoma, 33% versus 15% (RRR 2.167; P = 0.323) in patients with large cell carcinoma (LC), and 24% versus 15% (RRR 1.593; P = 0.372) in patients with not otherwise specified histology. Median overall survival for nab-P/C versus sb-P/C in patients with SCC was 10.7 versus 9.5 months (HR 0.890; P = 0.310), and 12.4 versus 10.6 months (HR 1.208; P = 0.721) for patients with LC. nab-P/C produced significantly (P < 0.05) less grade 3/4 neuropathy and arthralgia, whereas sb-P/C produced less thrombocytopenia and anemia. First-line nab-P/C demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit profile in patients with NSCLC regardless of histology.	[Socinski, M.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize brain activations of congenitally blind, late-onset blind and two groups of sighted control individuals while they processed either the pitch or the spatial attributes of sounds. Whereas both blind groups recruited occipital regions for sound processing, activity in bilateral cuneus was only apparent in the congenitally blind, highlighting the existence of region-specific critical periods for crossmodal plasticity. Most importantly, the preferential activation of the right dorsal stream (middle occipital gyrus and cuneus) for the spatial processing of sounds was only observed in the congenitally blind. This demonstrates that vision has to be lost during an early sensitive period in order to transfer its functional specialization for space processing toward a non-visual modality. We then used a combination of dynamic causal modelling with Bayesian model selection to demonstrate that auditory-driven activity in primary visual cortex is better explained by direct connections with primary auditory cortex in the congenitally blind whereas it relies more on feedback inputs from parietal regions in the late-onset blind group. Taken together, these results demonstrate the crucial role of the developmental period of visual deprivation in (re)shaping the functional architecture and the connectivity of the occipital cortex. Such findings are clinically important now that a growing number of medical interventions may restore vision after a period of visual deprivation.

Detecting biomarkers of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) in neonates may assist in the identification of children at risk of FASD enabling targeted early interventions. Despite these potential benefits, complicated ethical issues arise in screening for biomarkers of PAE and these must be addressed prior to the implementation of screening programs. Here, we identify and comment, based on a North American perspective, on concerns raised in the current ethical, social, and legal literature related to meconium screening for PAE. Major ethical concerns revolve around the targeting of populations for PAE screening, consent and respect for persons, stigma and participation rates, the costbenefit analysis of a screening program, consequences of false-positive and false-negative test results, confidentiality and appropriate follow-up to positive screen results, and the use of screen results for criminal prosecution. We identify gaps in the literature on screening for PAE, most notably related to a lack of stakeholder perspectives (e.g., parents, healthcare providers) about screening and the ethical challenges it presents.

Methodology of the 2009 Survey on Living with Chronic Diseases in Canada-hypertension component	CHRONIC DISEASES AND INJURIES IN CANADA			English	Article						epidemiological survey; hypertension; chronic disease; data collection; health surveys; questionnaires; Canadian Community Health Survey	EDUCATION-PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS; BLOOD-PRESSURE-MEASUREMENT; NATIONAL-SURVEY; MANAGEMENT; PREVALENCE; ADHERENCE; DIAGNOSIS; BEHAVIOR; VALIDITY; RISK	Introduction: The Survey on Living with Chronic Diseases in Canada-hypertension component (SLCDC-H) is a 20-minute cross-sectional telephone survey on hypertension diagnosis and management. Sampled from the 2008 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), the SLCDC-H includes Canadians (aged >= 20 years) with self-reported hypertension from the ten provinces. Methods: The questionnaire was developed by Delphi technique, externally reviewed and qualitatively tested. Statistics Canada performed sampling strategies, recruitment, data collection and processing. Proportions were weighted to represent the Canadian population, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived by bootstrap method. Results: Compared with the CCHS population reporting hypertension, the SLCDC-H sample (n = 6142) is slightly younger (SLCDC-H mean age: 61.2 years, 95% CI: 60.8-61.6; CCHS mean age: 62.2 years, 95% CI: 61.8-62.5), has more post-secondary school graduates (SLCDC-H: 52.0%, 95% CI: 49.7%-54.2%; CCHS: 47.5%, 95% CI: 46.1%-48.9%) and has fewer respondents on hypertension medication (SLCDC-H: 82.5%, 95% CI: 80.9%-84.1%; CCHS: 88.6%, 95% CI: 87.7%-89.6%). Conclusion: Overall, the 2009 SLCDC-H represents its source population and provides novel, comprehensive data on the diagnosis and management of hypertension. The survey has been adapted to other chronic conditions-diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neurological conditions. The questionnaire is available on the Statistics Canada website; descriptive results have been disseminated by the Public Health Agency of Canada.	[Bienek, A. S.; Gee, M.

PARADIGM-HF Comm Investigators	Dual angiotensin receptor and neprilysin inhibition as an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in patients with chronic systolic heart failure: rationale for and design of the Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure trial (PARADIGM-HF)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE			English	Article						Chronic heart failure; Reninangiotensin; ACE inhibitor; Angiotensin receptor blocker; Natriuretic peptides; Neprilysin; Neutral endopeptidase; Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor; LCZ696	ATRIAL-NATRIURETIC-PEPTIDE; VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTIONS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; VASOPEPTIDASE INHIBITOR; DOUBLE-BLIND; ENALAPRIL; OMAPATRILAT; VALSARTAN; SURVIVAL; LCZ696	Although the focus of therapeutic intervention has been on neurohormonal pathways thought to be harmful in heart failure (HF), such as the reninangiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS), potentially beneficial counter-regulatory systems are also active in HF. These promote vasodilatation and natriuresis, inhibit abnormal growth, suppress the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system, and augment parasympathetic activity. The best understood of these mediators are the natriuretic peptides which are metabolized by the enzyme neprilysin. LCZ696 belongs to a new class of drugs, the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), which both block the RAAS and augment natriuretic peptides. Patients with chronic HF, NYHA class IIIV symptoms, an elevated plasma BNP or NT-proBNP level, and an LVEF of 40 were enrolled in the Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortailty and morbidity in Heart Failure trial (PARADIGM-HF). Patients entered a single-blind enalapril run-in period (titrated to 10 mg b.i.d.), followed by an LCZ696 run-in period (100 mg titrated to 200 mg b.i.d.). A total of 8436 patients tolerating both periods were randomized 1:1 to either enalapril 10 mg b.i.d. or LCZ696 200 mg b.i.d. The primary outcome is the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, although the trial is powered to detect a 15 relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death. PARADIGM-HF will determine the place of the ARNI LCZ696 as an alternative to enalapril in patients with systolic HF. PARADIGM-HF may change our approach to neurohormonal modulation in HF.

Indeed, selective serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors, which increase 5-HT transmission, enhance adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. However, the consequences of 5-HT depletion are still unclear as studies using neurotoxins that target serotonergic neurons reached contradictory conclusions on the role of 5-HT on DG cell proliferation. Here, we analysed two genetic models of 5-HT depletion, the Pet1(-/-) and the VMAT2(f/f); SERTcre/+ mice, which have, respectively, 80 and 95% reductions in hippocampal 5-HT. In both models, we found unchanged cell proliferation of the neural precursors in the DG subgranular zone, whereas a significant increase in the survival of newborn neurons was noted 1 and 4weeks after BrdU injections. This pro-survival trait was phenocopied pharmacologically with 5-HT synthesis inhibitor PCPA treatment in adults, indicating that this effect was not developmental. Furthermore, a 1-week administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT in Pet1(-/-) and PCPA-treated mice normalised hippocampal cell survival. Overall, our results indicate that constitutive 5-HT depletion does not alter the proliferation of neural precursors in the DG but promotes the survival of newborn cells, an effect which involves activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The role of 5-HT in selective neuronal elimination points to a new facet in its multiple effects in controlling neural circuit maturation.

However, unambiguous demonstration of angular gyrus involvement from lesion and functional neuroimaging studies is lacking, partly because of the absence of detailed morphological descriptions of this region. On the basis of our recent anatomical examination of this region and a tightly controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm, the present investigation demonstrated reading-related activity in the region of the angular gyrus that lies between the central and posterior branches of the caudal superior temporal sulcus, namely cytoarchitectonic area PG. Analysis of functional connectivity showed increased functional coupling during reading of area PG with the language areas of Broca and Wernicke, and a region previously identified as the visual word form area. Thus, the parietal reading area has been precisely localized, and its interactions with other cortical areas during reading have been demonstrated.

Cooling in the real world: Therapeutic hypothermia in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Hypothermia; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Neonatal; Neurological outcome	WHOLE-BODY HYPOTHERMIA; NEONATAL ENCEPHALOPATHY; SYSTEMIC HYPOTHERMIA; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; TERM NEWBORNS; OUTCOMES; TRIAL; INFANTS; CLASSIFICATION	Background and aim: The benefits of therapeutic hypothermia have not been assessed from the perspective of the neurology clinic. We aimed to report the impact of the implementation of a local regional therapeutic hypothermia program on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of surviving hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) infants who were followed in the neonatal neurology clinic. Methods: Retrospective analysis of term infants referred to the neonatal neurology clinic after having been diagnosed with HIE and meeting eligibility criteria for therapeutic hypothermia between March 1999 and June 2010. Therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in September 2008. Outcome measures were dichotomously defined as: normal or adverse, which included cerebral palsy, global developmental delay, and epilepsy. Results: Thirty infants were included in the pre-therapeutic hypothermia group. Thirty-one infants received therapeutic hypothermia and 27 were adequately followed and included in the post-therapeutic hypothermia group. The frequency of an adverse outcome was significantly higher in the pre-therapeutic hypothermia infants (19/30 [63%] versus 4/27 [15%]; OR = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.37; P < 0.001). Neonatal clinical seizures were more frequent in the pre-therapeutic hypothermia group (P = 0.012). There were no differences regarding frequency of fetal distress, rate of caesarean sections, Apgar scores, need of resuscitation, cord/initial blood gases, and degrees of encephalopathy between the two groups. Conclusions: The implementation of a regional therapeutic hypothermia program in our institution has vastly reduced the observed neurological morbidity of surviving HIS infants followed in our neonatal neurology clinic.

SELF-CRITICISM, NEEDINESS, AND CONNECTEDNESS AS PREDICTORS OF INTERPERSONAL BEHAVIORAL VARIABILITY	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							DEPRESSIVE EXPERIENCES QUESTIONNAIRE; BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; 5-FACTOR MODEL; MAJOR DEPRESSION; YOUNG-ADULTS; DEPENDENCY; SCALES; RELATEDNESS; STABILITY; DISTRESS	Higher levels of the personality traits of self-criticism and neediness and lower levels of connectedness predict symptoms of psychopathology as well as interpersonal behaviors and outcomes. These personality characteristics may relate not only to mean levels of interpersonal behavior, but also to within-person variability in behavior. This study prospectively examined individual differences in the variability about the mean of individuals' interpersonal behaviors (Flux), as well as individuals' dispersion in the display of interpersonal behaviors (Spin) across events (Moskowitz & Zuroff, 2004). One hundred and thirteen adult community members completed a 20-day event-contingent recording procedure in which they recorded their interpersonal behaviors in the domains of dominance, submissiveness, agreeableness, and quarrelsomeness after interactions of over five minutes. Self-criticism, Neediness, and Connectedness were measured at baseline. Models adjusted for individuals' mean levels of behavior as well as Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness. Self-Criticism predicted more flux in agreeableness, dominance, and submissiveness and greater spin, whereas connectedness predicted lower levels of spin. Results clarify the maladaptive interpersonal behaviors of self-critical individuals and suggest that connectedness may be related to positive interpersonal outcomes because of more stable behavior in their interactions with others.

Contrast and stability of the axon diameter index from microstructure imaging with diffusion MRI	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						brain; magnetic resonance imaging; model; ActiveAx; AxCaliber; DTI; monkey	CORPUS-CALLOSUM; FIXATION; TISSUE; BRAIN; MODEL	The ActiveAx technique fits the minimal model of white matter diffusion to diffusion MRI data acquired using optimized protocols that provide orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density. We investigated how limitations of the available maximal gradient strength (G(max)) on a scanner influence the sensitivity to a range of axon diameters. Multishell high-angular-diffusion-imaging (HARDI) protocols for G(max) of 60, 140, 200, and 300 mT/m were optimized for the pulsed-gradient-spin-echo (PGSE) sequence. Data were acquired on a fixed monkey brain and Monte-Carlo simulations supported the results. Increasing G(max) reduces within-voxel variation of the axon diameter index and improves contrast beyond what is achievable with higher signal-to-noise ratio. Simulations reveal an upper bound on the axon diameter (approximate to 10 m) that pulsed-gradient-spin-echo measurements are sensitive to, due to a trade-off between short T-2 and the long diffusion time needed to probe larger axon diameters. A lower bound (approximate to 2.5 m) slightly dependent on G(max) was evident, below which axon diameters are identifiable as small, but impossible to differentiate. These results emphasize the key-role of G(max) for enhancing contrast between axon diameter distributions and are, therefore, relevant in general for microstructure imaging methods and highlight the need for increased G(max) on future commercial systems.

Although QST shares similarities with the quantitative assessment of hearing or vision, which is extensively used in clinical practice and research, it has not gained a large acceptance among clinicians for many reasons, and in significant part because of the lack of information about standards for performing QST, its potential utility, and interpretation of results. consensus meeting was convened by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain (NeuPSIG) to formulate recommendations for conducting QST in clinical practice and research. Research studies have confirmed the utility of QST for the assessment and monitoring of somatosensory deficits, particularly in diabetic and small fiber neuropathies; the assessment of evoked pains (mechanical and thermal allodynia or hyperalgesia); and the diagnosis of sensory neuropathies. Promising applications include the assessment of evoked pains in large-scale clinical trials and the study of conditioned pain modulation. In clinical practice, we recommend the use QST for screening for small and large fiber neuropathies; monitoring of somatosensory deficits; and monitoring of evoked pains, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. QST is not recommended as a stand-alone test for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. For the conduct of QST in healthy subjects and in patients, we recommend use of predefined standardized stimuli and instructions, validated algorithms of testing, and reference values corrected for anatomical site, age, and gender. Interpretation of results should always take into account the clinical context, and patients with language and cognitive difficulties, anxiety, or litigation should not be considered eligible for QST. When appropriate standards, as discussed here, are applied, QST can provide important and unique information about the functional status of somatosensory system, which would be complementary to already existing clinical methods.

Glycemia-dependent Nuclear Factor B Activation Contributes to Mechanical Allodynia in Rats with Chronic Postischemia Pain	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							FACTOR-KAPPA-B; AORTIC ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SPINAL-CORD; LOCALIZATION SEQUENCE; THERMAL HYPERALGESIA; NITRIC-OXIDE; ANIMAL-MODEL	Background: Ischemia-reperfusion injury causes chronic postischemia pain (CPIP), and rats with higher glycemia during ischemia-reperfusion injury exhibit increased allodynia. Glycemia-induced elevation of nuclear factor B (NFB) may contribute to increased allodynia. Methods: Glycemia during a 3-h ischemia-reperfusion injury was manipulated by: normal feeding; or normal feeding with administration of insulin; dextrose; or insulin/dextrose. In these groups, NFB was measured in ipsilateral hind paw muscle and spinal dorsal horn by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and SN50, an NFB inhibitor, was administered to determine its differential antiallodynic effects depending on glycemia. Results: CPIP fed/insulin rats (12.03 +/- 4.9 g, N = 6) had less allodynia than fed, fed/insulin/dextrose, and fed/dextrose rats (6.29 +/- 3.37 g, N = 7; 4.57 +/- 3.03g, N = 6; 2.95 +/- 1.10 g, N = 9), respectively. Compared with fed rats (0.209 +/- 0.022 AU, N = 7), NFB in ipsilateral plantar muscles was significantly lower for fed/insulin rats, and significantly higher for fed/dextrose rats (0.152 +/- 0.053 AU, N = 6; 0.240 +/- 0.057 AU, N = 7, respectively). Furthermore, NFB in the dorsal horn of fed, fed/insulin/dextrose, and fed/dextrose rats (0.293 +/- 0.049 AU; 0.267 +/- 0.037 AU; 0.315 +/- 0.015 AU, respectively, N = 6 for each) was significantly higher than in fed/insulin animals (0.267 +/- 0.037 AU, N = 6). The antiallodynic SN50 dose-response curves of CPIP rats in the fed/insulin/dextrose, fed/dextrose, and fed conditions exhibited a rightward shift compared with the fed/insulin group. The threshold SN50 dose of CPIP fed/dextrose, fed/insulin/dextrose, and fed rats (328.94 +/- 92.4 ng, 77.80 +/- 44.50 ng, and 24.89 +/- 17.20 ng, respectively) was higher than that for fed/insulin rats (4.06 +/- 7.04 ng). Conclusions: NFB was activated in a glycemia-dependent manner in CPIP rats. Hypoglycemic rats were more sensitive to SN50 than rats with higher glycemia. The finding that SN50 reduces mechanical allodynia suggests that NFB inhibitors might be useful for treating postischemia pain.

Photoperiod-dependent regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 messenger ribonucleic acid levels in the songbird brain	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						LHRH; Plasticity; Preoptic area; Photoperiod	METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; STARLINGS STURNUS-VULGARIS; SPARROW MELOSPIZA-MELODIA; GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; SEASONAL DIFFERENCES; REPRODUCTIVE STATE; EUROPEAN STARLINGS; RESPONSE SYSTEMS; GNRH CHALLENGE	Annual changes in day length induce marked changes in reproductive function in temperate zone vertebrates. In many avian species, in contrast to other seasonally breeding animals, plasticity in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone - 1 (GnRH1) expression rather than (or in addition to) release governs changes in pituitary-gonadal activity. Investigations of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern GnRH1 plasticity were previously hindered by a collective inability of scientists in the field to characterize the gnrh1 cDNA in songbirds. We finally overcame this roadblock after data from the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome project enabled us to rapidly clone the gnrh1 cDNA from hypothalamic RNA of zebra finches and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Here, we review the original data that identified GnRH1 protein plasticity in the songbird brain and discuss earlier failed attempts to clone gnrh1 in these animals. Then, we present recent efforts, including our own, that successfully characterized gnrh1 in zebra finch and starling, and demonstrated dynamic regulation of gnrh1 mRNA expression, particularly in sub-populations of preoptic area neurons, in the latter. Overall, this paper highlights GnRH1 plasticity in the avian brain, and weaves into the narrative the previously untold story of the challenges to sequencing gnrh1 in songbirds.
