Forecasting electric demand of supply fan using data mining techniques	ENERGY			English	Article						Electric demand; Forecast; Data mining; Building Automation System; Clustering analysis	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; LOAD; OPTIMIZATION; PREDICTION; DATABASES; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; MODELS	This paper presents the application of the process of KDD (knowledge discovery in databases) for the forecasting of the electrical power demand of a supply fan of an AHU (air handling unit). The case study uses trend data from the BAS (Building Automation System), which is recorded every 15 min in an office building. Data mining techniques are used as a preprocessing step in the development of the forecasting model. A clustering analysis detects atypical operations and then partitions the whole dataset into three subsets of typical daily profiles of the supply fan modulation. A hybrid model, combining a closed-loop nonlinear ANN (autoregressive neural network) model and a physical model, forecasts the electric power demand over a horizon of up to 6 h. The optimum architecture of ANN, found by using a Simple Genetic Algorithm, is composed of 13 input neurons, I hidden neuron and 23-day training set size, for the cluster corresponding to working days except Mondays. The results show good agreement between the forecasts and measurements of fan modulation, and electric demand, respectively. The fan modulation was forecasted over the testing period with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 5.5% and CV(RMSE) of 17.6%. The fan electric demand was forecasted with a RMSE of 1.4 kW, CV(RMSE) of 30% over a 6-h time horizon. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the reduction of training data set size from 23 days to 4 or 8 days does not have a negative impact of the value of RMSE. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Innervation and neuromuscular control in ageing skeletal muscle	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Review							AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; WHOLE VASTUS LATERALIS; UNIT FIRING RATES; MOTOR-UNIT; OLD MEN; IN-VIVO; CONTRACTILE PROPERTIES; TIBIALIS ANTERIOR; MOUSE MODEL; VOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS	Changes in the neuromuscular system affecting the ageing motor unit manifest structurally as a reduction in motor unit number secondary to motor neuron loss; fibre type grouping due to repeating cycles of denervation-reinnervation; and instability of the neuromuscular junction that may be due to either or both of a gradual perturbation in postsynaptic signalling mechanisms necessary for maintenance of the endplate acetylcholine receptor clusters or a sudden process involving motor neuron death or traumatic injury to the muscle fibre. Functionally, these changes manifest as a reduction in strength and coordination that precedes a loss in muscle mass and contributes to impairments in fatigue. Regular muscle activation in postural muscles or through habitual physical activity can attenuate some of these structural and functional changes up to a point along the ageing continuum. On the other hand, regular muscle activation in advanced age (>75years) loses its efficacy, and at least in rodents may exacerbate age-related motor neuron death. Transgenic mouse studies aimed at identifying potential mechanisms of motor unit disruptions in ageing muscle are not conclusive due to many different mechanisms converging on similar motor unit alterations, many of which phenocopy ageing muscle. Longitudinal studies of ageing models and humans will help clarify the cause and effect relationships and thus, identify relevant therapeutic targets to better preserve muscle function across the lifespan.

However, few studies have investigated the simultaneous morphogenesis of multiple tissues in vivo. We found that during Caenorhabditis elegans ventral enclosure, when epidermal cells collectively migrate to cover the ventral surface of the embryo, the underlying neuroblasts (neuronal precursor cells) also undergo morphogenesis. We found that myosin accumulates as foci along the junction-free edges of the ventral epidermal cells to form a ring, whose closure is myosin-dependent. We also observed the accumulation of myosin foci and the adhesion junction proteins E-cadherin and a-catenin in the underlying neuroblasts. Myosin may help to reorganize a subset of neuroblasts into a rosette-like pattern, and decrease their surface area as the overlying epidermal cells constrict. Since myosin is required in the neuroblasts for ventral enclosure, we propose that mechanical forces in the neuroblasts influence constriction of the overlying epidermal cells. In support of this model, disrupting neuroblast cell division or altering their fate influences myosin localization in the overlying epidermal cells. The coordination of myosin-dependent events and forces between cells in different tissues could be a common theme for coordinating morphogenetic events during metazoan development.

MerTK Is a Functional Regulator of Myelin Phagocytosis by Human Myeloid Cells	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; APOPTOTIC CELLS; CNS REMYELINATION; TAM RECEPTORS; IN-VITRO; MICROGLIA; MACROPHAGES; CLEARANCE	Multifocal inflammatory lesions featuring destruction of lipid-rich myelin are pathologic hallmarks of multiple sclerosis. Lesion activity is assessed by the extent and composition of myelin uptake by myeloid cells present in such lesions. In the inflamed CNS, myeloid cells are comprised of brain-resident microglia, an endogenous cell population, and monocyte-derived macrophages, which infiltrate from the systemic compartment. Using microglia isolated from the adult human brain, we demonstrate that myelin phagocytosis is dependent on the polarization state of the cells. Myelin ingestion is significantly enhanced in cells exposed to TGF-beta compared with resting basal conditions and markedly reduced in classically activated polarized cells. Transcriptional analysis indicated that TGF-beta-treated microglia closely resembled M0 cells. The tyrosine kinase phagocytic receptor MerTK was one of the most upregulated among a select number of differentially expressed genes in TGF-beta-treated microglia. In contrast, MerTK and its known ligands, growth arrest-specific 6 and Protein S, were downregulated in classically activated cells. MerTK expression and myelin phagocytosis were higher in CNS-derived microglia than observed in monocyte-derived macrophages, both basally and under all tested polarization conditions. Specific MerTK inhibitors reduced myelin phagocytosis and the resultant anti-inflammatory biased cytokine responses for both cell types. Defining and modulating the mechanisms that regulate myelin phagocytosis has the potential to impact lesion and disease evolution in multiple sclerosis. Relevant effects would include enhancing myelin clearance, increasing anti-inflammatory molecule production by myeloid cells, and thereby permitting subsequent tissue repair.

Neither prenatal nor postnatal maternal depressive symptoms independently predicted neither the frontal EEG activity nor functional connectivity in 6-and 18-month infants. However, increasing maternal depressive symptoms from the prenatal to postnatal period predicted greater right frontal activity and relative right frontal asymmetry amongst 6-month infants but these finding were not observed amongst 18-month infants after adjusted for post-conceptual age on the EEG visit day. Subsequently increasing maternal depressive symptoms from the prenatal to postnatal period predicted lower right frontal connectivity within 18-month infants but not among 6-month infants after controlling for post-conceptual age on the EEG visit day. These findings were observed in the full sample and the female sample but not in the male sample. Moreover, both prenatal and early postnatal maternal depressive symptoms independently predicted children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors at 24 months of age. This suggests that the altered frontal functional connectivity in infants born to mothers whose depressive symptomatology increases in the early postnatal period compared to that during pregnancy may reflect a neural basis for the familial transmission of phenotypes associated with mood disorders, particularly in girls.

In addition to mediating vesicular loading of glutamate, it has been proposed that VGLUT3 enhances serotonin (5-HT) vesicular loading by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) in 5-HT neurons. In dopamine (DA) neurons, glutamate appears to be released from specialized subsets of terminals and it may play a developmental role, promoting neuronal growth and survival. The hypothesis of a similar developmental role and axonal localization of glutamate co-release in 5-HT neurons has not been directly examined. Using postnatal mouse raphe neurons in culture, we first observed that in contrast to 5-HT itself, other phenotypic markers of 5-HT axon terminals such as the 5-HT reuptake transporter (SERT) show a more restricted localization in the axonal arborization. Interestingly, only a subset of SERT- and 5-HT-positive axonal varicosities expressed VGLUT3, with SERT and VGLUT3 being mostly segregated. Using VGLUT3 knockout mice, we found that deletion of this transporter leads to reduced survival of 5-HT neurons in vitro and also decreased the density of 5-HT-immunoreactivity in terminals in the dorsal striatum and dorsal part of the hippocampus in the intact brain. Our results demonstrate that raphe 5-HT neurons express SERT and VGLUT3 mainly in segregated axon terminals and that VGLUT3 regulates the vulnerability of these neurons and the neurochemical identity of their axonal domain, offering new perspectives on the functional connectivity of a cell population involved in anxiety disorders and depression.

Promising data support the role of prefrontal tDCS in augmenting cognitive performance and ameliorating several neuropsychiatric symptoms, namely pain, fatigue, mood disturbances, and attentional impairment. Such symptoms are commonly encountered in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: The main objective of the current work was to evaluate the tDCS effects over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on pain in MS patients.Our secondary outcomes were to study its influence on attention, fatigue, and mood. Materials and Methods: Sixteen MS patients with chronic neuropathic pain were enrolled in a randomized, sham-controlled, and cross over study Patients randomly received two anodal tDCS blocks (active or sham), each consisting of three consecutive daily tDCS sessions, and held apart by 3 weeks. Evaluations took place before and after each block. To evaluate pain, we used the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Attention was assessed using neurophysiological parameters and the Attention Network Test (ANT). Changes in mood and fatigue were measured using various scales. Results: Compared to sham, active tDCS yielded significant analgesic effects according to VAS and BPI global scales.There were no effects of any block on mood, fatigue, or attention. Conclusion: Based on our results, anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC appears to act in a selective manner and would ameliorate specific symptoms, particularly neuropathic pain. Analgesia might have occurred through the modulation of the emotional pain network. Attention, mood, and fatigue were not improved in this work. This could be partly attributed to the short protocol duration, the small sample size, and the heterogeneity of our MS cohort. Future large-scale studies can benefit from comparing the tDCS effects over different cortical sites, changing the stimulation montage, prolonging the duration of protocol, and coupling tDCS with neuroimaging techniques for a better understanding of its possible mechanism of action.

The main obstacle for researchers in the field is the high dimensionality of the data in both the imaging phenotypes and the genetic variants commonly typed. In this article, we develop a novel method that utilizes Gene Ontology, an online database, to select and prioritize certain genes, employing a stratified false discovery rate (sFDR) approach to investigate their associations with imaging phenotypes. sFDR has the potential to increase power in genome wide association studies (GWAS), and is quickly gaining traction as a method for multiple testing correction. Our novel approach addresses both the pressing need in genetic research to move beyond candidate gene studies, while not being overburdened with a loss of power due to multiple testing. As an example of our methodology, we perform a GWAS of hippocampal volume using both the Enhancing Neurolmaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA2) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative datasets. The analysis of ENIGMA2 data yielded a set of SNPs with sFDR values between 10 and 20%. Our approach demonstrates a potential method to prioritize genes based on biological systems impaired in a disease.

Early results of this trial showed that treatment with procarbazine, lomustine (also called CCNU), and vincristine after radiation therapy at the time of initial diagnosis resulted in longer progression-free survival, but not overall survival, than radiation therapy alone. We now report the long-term results. METHODS We included patients with grade 2 astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, or oligodendroglioma who were younger than 40 years of age and had undergone subtotal resection or biopsy or who were 40 years of age or older and had undergone biopsy or resection of any of the tumor. Patients were stratified according to age, histologic findings, Karnofsky performance-status score, and presence or absence of contrast enhancement on pre-operative images. Patients were randomly assigned to radiation therapy alone or to radiation therapy followed by six cycles of combination chemotherapy. RESULTS A total of 251 eligible patients were enrolled from 1998 through 2002. The median follow-up was 11.9 years; 55% of the patients died. Patients who received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy had longer median overall survival than did those who received radiation therapy alone (13.3 vs. 7.8 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; P = 0.003). The rate of progression-free survival at 10 years was 51% in the group that received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy versus 21% in the group that received radiation therapy alone; the corresponding rates of overall survival at 10 years were 60% and 40%. A Cox model identified receipt of radiation therapy plus chemotherapy and histologic findings of oligodendroglioma as favorable prognostic variables for both progression-free and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS In a cohort of patients with grade 2 glioma who were younger than 40 years of age and had undergone subtotal tumor resection or who were 40 years of age or older, progression-free survival and overall survival were longer among those who received combination chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy than among those who received radiation therapy alone.

Herein, we report that deletion of the Quaking (QKI) RNA binding proteins in oligodendrocytes (OLs) using Olig2-Cre results in mice displaying rapid tremors at postnatal day 10, followed by death at postnatal week 3. Extensive CNS hypomyelination was observed as a result of OL differentiation defects during development. The QKI proteins were also required for adult myelin maintenance, because their ablation using PLP-CreERT resulted in hindlimb paralysis with immobility at similar to 30 d after 4-hydroxytamoxifen injection. Moreover, deterioration of axoglial junctions of the spinal cord was observed and is consistent with a loss of Neurofascin 155 (Nfasc155) isoform that we confirmed as an alternative splice target of the QKI proteins. Our findings define roles for the QKI RNA binding proteins in myelin development and maintenance, as well as in the generation of Nfasc155 to maintain healthy axoglial junctions.

Inferring Cortical Variability from Local Field Potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						correlations; LFP; model; population; prediction; variability	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA MT; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; PSYCHOPHYSICAL PERFORMANCE; RESPONSE VARIABILITY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; COMPLEX MOTION; ATTENTION; STATE; POPULATION	The responses of sensory neurons can be quite different to repeated presentations of the same stimulus. Here, we demonstrate a direct link between the trial-to-trial variability of cortical neuron responses and network activity that is reflected in local field potentials (LFPs). Spikes and LFPs were recorded with a multielectrode array from the middle temporal (MT) area of the visual cortex of macaques during the presentation of continuous optic flow stimuli. A maximum likelihood-based modeling framework was used to predict single-neuron spiking responses using the stimulus, the LFPs, and the activity of other recorded neurons. MT neuron responses were strongly linked to gamma oscillations (maximum at 40 Hz) as well as to lower-frequency delta oscillations (1-4 Hz), with consistent phase preferences across neurons. The predicted modulation associated with the LFP was largely complementary to that driven by visual stimulation, as well as the activity of other neurons, and accounted for nearly half of the trial-to-trial variability in the spiking responses. Moreover, the LFP model predictions accurately captured the temporal structure of noise correlations between pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, and explained the variation in correlation magnitudes observed across the population. These results therefore identify signatures of network activity related to the variability of cortical neuron responses, and suggest their central role in sensory cortical function.

FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						Chinese modernization; rapid sociocultural change; individualism; depression; urban and rural	LEFT-BEHIND CHILDREN; MIGRANT WORKERS; SOCIAL-CHANGE; RURAL CHINA; RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; METROPOLITAN CHINA; NORTH-AMERICA; MENTAL-HEALTH; OLDER-PEOPLE	Mainland China has undergone profound changes dating back to the nineteenth century, including a contemporary period of rapid modernization that began in the 1980s. The result has been dramatic social, cultural, and economic shifts impacting the daily lives of Chinese people. In this paper, we explore the psychological implications of sociocultural transformation in China, emphasizing two central themes. First, rising individualism: findings from social and developmental psychology suggest that China's rapid development has been accompanied by ever-increasing adherence to individualistic values. Second, rising rates of depression: findings from psychiatric epidemiology point to increasing prevalence of depression over this same time period, particularly in rural settings. We argue that links between sociocultural and psychological shifts in China can be usefully studied through a cultural psychology lens, emphasizing the mutual constitution of culture, mind, and brain. In particular, we note that the link between social change, individualism, and rising mental illness deserves careful attention. Our review suggests that shifting values and socialization practices shape emotion norms of concealment and display, with implications for depressive symptom presentation. The challenge comes with interpretation. Increasing prevalence rates of depression may indeed be a general response to the rapidity of sociocultural change, or a specific consequence of rising individualism but may also result from increasingly 'Western' patterns of symptom presentation, or improvements in diagnostic practice. We conclude by considering the challenges posed to standard universal models of psychological phenomena.

Such impairments might involve different components of the reward process, including brain activity during reward anticipation. We examined brain nodes engaged by reward anticipation in 1,544 adolescents and identified a network containing a core striatal node and cortical nodes facilitating outcome prediction and response preparation. Distinct nodes and functional connections were preferentially associated with either adolescent hyperactivity or alcohol consumption, thus conveying specificity of reward processing to clinically relevant behavior. We observed associations between the striatal node, hyperactivity, and the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4A (VPS4A) gene in humans, and the causal role of Vps4 for hyperactivity was validated in Drosophila. Our data provide a neurobehavioral model explaining the heterogeneity of reward-related behaviors and generate a hypothesis accounting for their enduring nature.

Loss of IRF8 or IRF1 function causes severe susceptibility to infections in mice and in humans. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing in wild type and in IRF8 and IRF1 mutant primary macrophages to systematically catalog all of the genes bound by (cistromes) and transcriptionally activated by (regulomes) IRF8, IRF1, PU. 1, and STAT1, including modulation of epigenetic histone marks. Of the seven binding combinations identified, two (cluster 1 [IRF8/IRF1/STAT1/PU.1] and cluster 5 [IRF1/STAT1/PU.1]) were found to have a major role in controlling macrophage transcriptional programs both at the basal level and after IFN-gamma activation. They direct the expression of a set of genes, the IRF8/IRF1 regulome, that play critical roles in host inflammatory and antimicrobial defenses in mouse models of neuroinflammation and of pulmonary tuberculosis, respectively. In addition, this IRF8/IRF1 regulome is enriched for genes mutated in human primary immunodeficiencies and with loci associated with several inflammatory diseases in humans.

An exploratory analysis	CLINICAL KIDNEY JOURNAL			English	Article						hypernatremia; nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; older adults; renal disease; urine specific gravity	LONG-TERM LITHIUM; NEUROLEPTICS; THERAPY; DRUGS; RISK	Background: Exposure to psychotropic agents, including lithium, antipsychotics and antidepressants, has been associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). This is especially concerning in older adults already at risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypernatremia with advanced aging. This study investigates whether commonly performed random urine-specific gravity (USG) tests can predict adverse NDI outcomes (CKD and hypernatremia) in psychotropic-exposed older adults. Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study of 173 geriatric psychiatry patients (age >= 65 years) exposed to psychotropic medications. Our main continuous outcome was 'decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2)' over 5-year follow-up. Hypernatremia and acute kidney injury (AKI) were secondary outcomes. Whether baseline USG <1.010 predicted outcomes was assessed in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: USG <1.010 predicted hypernatremia episodes (sodium concentration = 150 mmol/L-28.1 versus 12%, chi(2) = 4.7, P = 0.03). USG < 1.010 [ odds ratio 2.36 (95% confidence interval 0.93-6.0), P = 0.07], baseline eGFR and typical antipsychotic use independently predicted decrease in eGFR > 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Patients with a single baseline sodium concentration of >= 140 mmol/L and USG < 1.010 have a 26.3% incidence of AKI and a 57.9% incidence of hypernatremia over the ensuing 5 years. Conclusions: In psychotropic-exposed older adults, there appears to be a clinically important association between lowUSG and developing both hypernatremia and CKD. USG may be a useful surrogate measure for NDI-related outcomes in large administrative database studies, where ideal measures such as 24-h urine volume may not be available.

Drosophila astrocytes cover specific territories of the CNS neuropil and are instructed to differentiate by Prospero, a key effector of Notch	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Astrocyte development; Astroglial map; Notch; Pointed; Prospero	AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTERS; HIGH-AFFINITY TRANSPORT; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GLIAL-CELLS; NEURONAL PRECURSORS; LONGITUDINAL GLIA; GENE-EXPRESSION; EMBRYONIC CNS; BRAIN; PROJECTIONS	Astrocytes are crucial in the formation, fine-tuning, function and plasticity of neural circuits in the central nervous system. However, important questions remain about the mechanisms instructing astrocyte cell fate. We have studied astrogenesis in the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila larvae, where astrocytes exhibit remarkable morphological and molecular similarities to those in mammals. We reveal the births of larval astrocytes from a multipotent glial lineage, their allocation to reproducible positions, and their deployment of ramified arbors to cover specific neuropil territories to form a stereotyped astroglial map. Finally, we unraveled a molecular pathway for astrocyte differentiation in which the Ets protein Pointed and the Notch signaling pathway are required for astrogenesis; however, only Notch is sufficient to direct non-astrocytic progenitors toward astrocytic fate. We found that Prospero is a key effector of Notch in this process. Our data identify an instructive astrogenic program that acts as a binary switch to distinguish astrocytes from other glial cells.

To determine whether children born to women who had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) had more adverse birth outcomes than children born to mothers who never had JIA. Methods. Our cohort study used data from physician billing and hospitalizations covering the province of Quebec, Canada. We identified all women with JIA with a first-time birth between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 2010, and assembled a control cohort of first-time mothers without JIA from the same administrative data, matching 4: 1 for date of first birth, maternal age, and area of residence. We compared outcomes (stillbirth, prematurity, small for gestational age, and major congenital anomalies) in the JIA versus non-JIA groups using logistic regression. Results. Mean age at delivery was 24.7 years in the JIA group (n = 1681) and 25.0 years for the non-JIA group (n = 6724). Women who had JIA were at higher risk for a premature baby [adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.42], a baby small for gestational age (adjusted RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.37), and a child with a congenital malformation (adjusted RR 6.51, 95% CI 5.05-8.39). Neural tube defects were higher in the JIA offspring: 1.61% (95% CI 1.11-2.33) versus 0.03% (95% CI 0.01-0.11) in the non-JIA group, as were congenital heart defects: 1.07% (95% CI 0.68-1.69) versus 0.58% (95% CI 0.42-0.79). Conclusion. Most women with JIA will deliver a normal baby, even though they are at higher risk for having a child with adverse birth outcomes. Research is needed to understand pathophysiologic mechanisms and to investigate the effects of medications during childhood and youth on future birth outcomes.

Increased vascular sympathetic modulation in mice with Mas receptor deficiency	JOURNAL OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM			English	Article						Renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin-(1-7); Mas receptor; autonomic modulation; blood pressure variability; heart rate variability	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; ANGIOTENSIN-(1-7); BAROREFLEX; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; BALANCE; STRESS	Introduction: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)/Mas axis could modulate the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure variabilities (BPV) which are important predictors of cardiovascular risk and provide information about the autonomic modulation of the cardiovascular system. Therefore we investigated the effect of Mas deficiency on autonomic modulation in wild type and Mas-knockout (KO) mice. Methods: Blood pressure was recorded at high sample rate (4000 Hz). Stationary sequences of 200-250 beats were randomly chosen. Frequency domain analysis of HR and BPV was performed with an autoregressive algorithm on the pulse interval sequences and on respective systolic sequences. Results: The KO group presented an increase of systolic arterial pressure (SAP; 127.26 +/- 11.20 vs 135.07 +/- 6.98 mmHg), BPV (3.54 +/- 1.54 vs 5.87 +/- 2.12 mmHg(2)), and low-frequency component of systolic BPV (0.12 +/- 0.11 vs 0.47 +/- 0.34 mmHg(2)). Conclusions: The deletion of Mas receptor is associated with an increase of SAP and with an increased BPV, indicating alterations in autonomic control. Increase of sympathetic vascular modulation in absence of Mas evidences the important role of Ang-(1-7)/Mas on cardiovascular regulation. Moreover, the absence of significant changes in HR and HRV can indicate an adaptation of autonomic cardiac balance. Our results suggest that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis seems more important in autonomic modulation of arterial pressure than HR.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP to generate the activated form, whereas the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) catalyze GTP hydrolysis, leading to the inactivated form. Modulation of Rho GTPase activity following altered expression of Rho-GEFs and/or Rho-GAPs has already been reported in various human tumors. However, nothing is known about the Rho GTPase activity or the expression of their regulators in human pheochromocytomas, a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. In this study, we demonstrate, through an ELISA-based activity assay, that Rac1 and Cdc42 activities decrease in human pheochromocytomas (PCCs) compared with the matched adjacent non-tumor tissue. Furthermore, through quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) approaches, we show that the expression of two Rho-GEF proteins, namely ARHGEF1 and FARP1, is significantly reduced in tumors compared with matched non-tumor tissue, whereas ARHGAP36 expression is increased. Moreover, siRNA-based knockdown of ARHGEF1 and FARP1 in PC12 cells leads to a significant inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, respectively. Finally, a principal component analysis (PCA) of our dataset was able to discriminate PCC from non-tumor tissue and indicates a close correlation between Cdc42/Rac1 activity and FARP1/ARHGEF1 expression. Altogether, our findings reveal for the first time the importance of modulation of Rho GTPase activities and expression of their regulators in human PCCs.

Here, two parallel approaches (in vivo and in vitro) were used to assess WWTP exposure-related changes to neurochemistry. First, fathead minnows (FHM, Pimephales promelas) were caged for four days along a WWTP discharge zone into the Maumee River (Ohio, USA). Grab water samples were collected and extracts obtained for the detection of alkylphenols, bisphenol A (BPA) and steroid hormones. Second, the extracts were then used as a source of in vitro exposure to brain tissues from FHM and four additional species relevant to the Great Lakes ecosystem (rainbow trout (RT), river otter (RO), bald eagle (BE) and human (HU)). The ability of the wastewater (in vivo) or extracts (in vitro) to interact with enzymes (monoamine oxidase (MAO) and glutamine synthetase (GS)) and receptors (dopamine (D2) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)) involved in dopamine and glutamate-dependent neurotransmission were examined on brain homogenates. In vivo exposure of FHM led to significant decreases of NMDA receptor binding in females (24 -42%), and increases of MAO activity in males (2.8- to 3.2-fold). In vitro, alkylphenol-targeted extracts significantly inhibited D2 (66% in FHM) and NMDA (24-54% in HU and RT) receptor binding, and induced MAO activity in RT, RO, and BE brains. Steroid hormone-targeted extracts inhibited GS activity in all species except FHM. BPA-targeted extracts caused a MAO inhibition in FHM, RT and BE brains. Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, this study shows that WWTP effluents contain agents that can interact with neurochemicals important in reproduction and other neurological functions. Additional work is needed to better resolve in vitro to in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE) as well as cross-species differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the past 2 decades, advances in cancer therapeutics allowed for a remarkable improvement in terms of survival for patients with metastatic CRC. The advent of targeted therapy, coupled with more efficient chemotherapy regimens, was the pillar achievement that contributed to the success of CRC therapy. Cetuximab and panitumumab, monoclonal antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, are the focus of this review since their mechanism of action and efficiency are closely related to the mutational status of a predictive biomarker, the Kristen rat Sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS). More recently, another biomarker, the neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene (NRAS), was found to be as valuable for the refinement of this targeted therapy. The arguments for the use of extended analysis of the RAS gene are thoroughly reviewed because they directly affect the choice of targeted agents and potentially the choice of backbone chemotherapy.

Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane receptor that is critical for vascular development within the central nervous system (CNS). It binds and influences signaling of several key angiogenic factors, such as VEGF-165, semaphorin 3A, platelet derived growth factor, and more. Neuropilin-1 is expressed by neurons and endothelial cells as well as a subpopulation of proangiogenic macrophages/microglia that are thought to interact with endothelial tip cells to promote vascular anastomosis during brain vascularization. We previously demonstrated a significant role for NRP-1 in macrophage chemotaxis and showed that NRP-1-expressing microglia are major contributors to pathologic retinal angiogenesis. Given this influence on CNS angiogenesis, we now investigated the involvement of microglia-resident NRP-1 in developmental retinal vascularization. METHODS. We followed NRP-1 expressing microglia during retinal development. We used LysM-cre myeloid lineage-driver cre mice to reduce expression of NRP-1 in retinal myeloid-derived cells and performed a comprehensive morphometric analysis of retinal vasculature during development. RESULTS. We provide evidence that NRP-1_ microglia are present throughout the retina during vascular development with a preference for the non-vascularized retina. Using LysM-Cre/Nrp1(fl/fl) mice, we reduced NRP-1 expression by similar to 65% in retinal microglia and demonstrate that deficiency in NRP-1 in these microglia does not impair retinal angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS. Our data draw a dichotomous role for NRP-1 in cells of myeloid lineage where it is dispensable for adequate retinal developmental vascularization yet obligate for pathologic retinal angiogenesis.

Deficient Binocular Combination of Second-Order Stimuli in Amblyopia	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						amblyopia; suppression; second-order; contrast-gain control; sensory imbalance	STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; ANISOMETROPIC AMBLYOPIA; CONTRAST MODULATION; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL-CORTEX; GAIN-CONTROL; ORIENTATION; VISION; MOTION	PURPOSE. Sensory imbalances in humans with amblyopia have been well documented using luminance-modulated (first-order) stimuli. However, little is known regarding whether there is a deficient binocular combination in amblyopes for stimuli defined by modulations in contrast (second-order stimuli). To address this, we asked two questions: Does a sensory imbalance also exist in the binocular combination of second-order stimuli, and if so, is it more severe than that expected on the basis of the imbalance for first-order stimuli? METHODS. The sensory imbalances of 14 adult amblyopes (mean age: 30.5 +/- 11.5 years; 5 with strabismus and 9 without) were measured using a dichoptic phase combination task. Three types of second-order dichoptic stimulus pairs were used in the study, where the carriers in the two eyes were either correlated, anticorrelated, or uncorrelated. Results were compared with those obtained using first-order stimuli in all observers. RESULTS. We found that second-order binocular combination in amblyopes was not affected by the interocular carrier correlations. The amblyopic eye's contribution to the binocularly fused percept was much less than that of the nonamblyopic eye. The resulting sensory imbalance in binocular combination for second-order images was comparable to that for first-order images in 8 of the observers but was more severe in the other 6 amblyopes. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that amblyopia does not disrupt the normal architecture of binocular combination for second-order signals; however, there is an additional deficit in binocular combination of second-order image in some amblyopes that cannot be fully accounted for by the known first-order sensory imbalance.

We examined vibrotactile perception on the distal phalanx of the middle finger before, during, and after contralateral S1 tDCS [a-, cathodal (c)-, and sham (s)-tDCS]. The experiments tested our shift-gain hypothesis, which predicted that a-tDCS would decrease vibrotactile detection and discrimination thresholds (leftward shift of the stimulus-response function with increased gain/slope) relative to s-tDCS, whereas c-tDCS would have the opposite effects (relative to s-tDCS). The results showed that weak a-tDCS (1 mA, 20 min) led to a reduction in both vibrotactile detection and discrimination thresholds to 73-76% of baseline during the application of the stimulation in subjects categorized as responders. These effects persisted after the end of a-tDCS but were absent 30 min later. Most, but not all, subjects showed a decrease in threshold (8/12 for detection; 9/12 for discrimination). Intersubject variability was explained by a ceiling effect in the discrimination task. c-tDCS had no significant effect on either detection or discrimination threshold. Taken together, our results supported our shift-gain hypothesis for a-tDCS but not c-tDCS.	[Labbe, Sara; Meftah, El-Mehdi; Chapman, C.

The Cerebrovascular Response to Ketamine: A Systematic Review of the Animal and Human Literature	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Review						ketamine; cerebrovascular response; cerebral blood flow	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; LOW-DOSE KETAMINE; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; ISOFLURANE ANESTHESIA; METABOLISM; NMDA; VELOCITY; ARTERIES; GRADE	Background: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the cerebrovascular/cerebral blood flow (CBF) effects of ketamine in both animal and human subjects. Materials and Methods: We searched MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library from inception to December 2014. Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts pertaining to the administration of ketamine in both human and animal subjects in which the impact on CBF/cerebral vasculature was recorded by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, xenon computed tomography, transcranial Doppler velocities, arteriovenous difference in N2O method of CBF measurement, cerebral digital subtraction angiography, or any other objective means of CBF determination. Results: We identified 38 animal studies with various animal models studied. Overall there was a trend to a direct vasodilatory effect of ketamine on the cerebral vasculature, with a trend in most studies to an increase or regional CBF (rCBF) or global CBF. Twenty human studies were identified. The majority displayed an increase in rCBF and global CBF on imaging in patients without neurological illness. Conclusions: Animal models indicate an increase in global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration, with a trend to vasodilation of medium-sized intracranial vessels through a calcium-dependent mechanism. Human studies display an Oxford 2b, Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education C, level of evidence to support a trend to increased global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration in both healthy volunteers and elective surgical patients without neurological illness.

Hippocampus and amygdala volumes from magnetic resonance images in children: Assessing accuracy of FreeSurfer and FSL against manual segmentation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Segmentation techniques; Pediatric population; Hippocampus; Amygdala; FSL-FIRST; FreeSurfer	BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION; CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT; HUMAN BRAIN; LONGITUDINAL MRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; RELIABILITY; CONSEQUENCES	The volumetric quantification of brain structures is of great interest in pediatric populations because it allows the investigation of different factors influencing neurodevelopment. FreeSurfer and FSL both provide frequently used packages for automatic segmentation of brain structures. In this study, we examined the accuracy and consistency of those two automated protocols relative to manual segmentation, commonly considered as the "gold standard" technique, for estimating hippocampus and amygdala volumes in a sample of preadolescent children aged between 6 to 11 years. The volumes obtained with FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST were evaluated and compared with manual segmentations with respect to volume difference, spatial agreement and between-and within-method correlations. Results highlighted a tendency for both automated techniques to overestimate hippocampus and amygdala volumes, in comparison to manual segmentation. This was more pronounced when using FreeSurfer than FSL-FIRST and, for both techniques, the over estimation was more marked for the amygdala than the hippocampus. Pearson correlations support moderate associations between manual tracing and FreeSurfer for hippocampus (right r = 0.69, p < 0.001; left r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and amygdala (right r = 0.61, p < 0.001; left r = 0.67, p < 0.001) volumes. Correlation coefficients between manual segmentation and FSL-FIRST were statistically significant (right hippocampus r = 0.59, p < 0.001; left hippocampus r = 0.51, p < 0.001; right amygdala r = 0.35, p < 0.001; left amygdala r = 0.31, p < 0.001) but were significantly weaker, for all investigated structures. When computing intraclass correlation coefficients between manual tracing and automatic segmentation, all comparisons, except for left hippocampus volume estimated with FreeSurfer, failed to reach 0.70. When looking at each method separately, correlations between left and right hemispheric volumes showed strong associations between bilateral hippocampus and bilateral amygdala volumes when assessed using manual segmentation or FreeSurfer. These correlations were significantly weaker when volumes were assessed with FSL-FIRST. Finally, Bland-Altman plots suggest that the difference between manual and automatic segmentation might be influenced by the volume of the structure, because smaller volumes were associated with larger volume differences between techniques. These results demonstrate that, at least in a pediatric population, the agreement between amygdala and hippocampus volumes obtained with automated FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer protocols and those obtained with manual segmentation is not strong. Visual inspection by an informed individual and, if necessary, manual correction of automated segmentation outputs are important to ensure validity of volumetric results and interpretation of related findings.

The purpose of this systematic review is to address the defining elements and outcomes (quality survival and organ donation) of currently active protocols for ECPR in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of cardiac origin in adult patients. The results may inform policy and practices for ECPR and help clarify the corrresponding intersection with deceased organ donation. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane and seven other electronic databases from 2005 to 2015, with no language restrictions. Internal validity and the quality of the studies reporting outcomes and guidelines were assessed. The review was included in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (Prospero, CRD42014015259). Results: One guideline and 20 outcome studies were analyzed. Half of the studies were prospective observational studies assessed to be of fair to good methodological quality. The remainder were retrospective cohorts, case series, and case studies. Ages ranged from 16 to 75 years and initial shockable cardiac rhythms, witnessed events, and a reversible primary cause of cardiac arrest were considered favorable prognostic factors. CPR duration and time to hospital cannulation varied considerably. Coronary revascularization, hemodynamic interventions and targeted temperature management neuroprotection were variable. A total of 833 patients receiving this ECPR approach had an overall reported survival rate of 22%, including 13% with good neurological recovery. Additionally, 88 potential and 17 actual deceased organ donors were identified among the non-survivor population in 8 out of 20 included studies. Study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis preventing any meaningful comparison between protocols, interventions and outcomes. Conclusions: ECPR is feasible for refractory OHCA of cardiac origin in adult patients.

Developing human brain: age-related changes in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar anatomy	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Basal ganglia volume; cerebellar anatomy; cortical anatomy; hippocampal anatomy; magnetic resonance imaging; pediatric neuroanatomical development; typically developing children	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; SURFACE-AREA; MRI DATA; 3 T; ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; SEGMENTATION; MATURATION	IntroductionThis study is the first to characterize normal development and sex differences across neuroanatomical structures in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar brain regions in a single large cohort. MethodsOne hundred and ninety-two magnetic resonance images were examined from 96 typically developing females and 96 age-matched typically developing males from 4 to 18years of age. Image segmentation of the cortex was conducted with CIVET, while that of the cerebellum, hippocampi, thalamus, and basal ganglia were conducted using the MAGeT algorithm. ResultsCortical thickness analysis revealed that most cortical regions decrease linearly, while surface area increases linearly with age. Volume relative to total cerebrum followed a quadratic trend with age, with only the left supramarginal gyrus showing sexual dimorphism. Hippocampal relative volume increased linearly, while the thalamus, caudate, and putamen decreased linearly, and the cerebellum did not change with age. The relative volumes of several subcortical subregions followed inverted U-shaped trends that peaked at similar to 12years of age. Many subcortical structures were found to be larger in females than in males, independently of age, while others showed a sex-by-age interaction. ConclusionThis study provides a comprehensive assessment of cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar growth patterns during normal development, and draws attention to the role of sex on neuroanatomical maturation throughout childhood and adolescence.

This paper presents an automated robotic micromanipulation system capable of force-controlled mechanical stimulation and quantitative fluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae, which significantly improves the force regulation accuracy and operation consistency over conventional manual operations. An elastomeric microdevice is developed for efficient immobilization of an array of larvae for subsequent force-controlled touching. A microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based force sensor is integrated into the robotic system for closed-loop force control of larva touching at a resolution of 50 mu N. Two micromanipulators are coordinately servoed using orchestrated position and force control laws for automatic operations. The system performs simultaneous force-controlled larva touching and fluorescence imaging at a speed of four larvae per minute, with a success rate of 92.5%. This robotic system will greatly facilitate the dissection of mechanotransduction mechanisms of Drosophila larvae at both molecular and cellular levels. Note to Practitioners-Biological studies of mechanosensitive neural circuits in small organisms (e.g., Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans) require the application of touch stimuli at quantitative force levels and the observation of resultant behavioral and neural responses. Manually touching a living organism and visually observing its behavior-level response under an optical microscope are commonly performed in biological laboratories, which are tedious and timing-consuming and can introduce unnecessary errors in the biological results due to the inaccuracy and inconsistency of human operations. The presented proof-of-concept system addresses this challenge using microdevice and automation technologies, and is capable of simultaneous mechanical stimulation and neural circuit imaging of Drosophila larvae with a high success rate, high accuracy, and high consistency. The system could also be extended to mechanotransduction research of other organisms such as C. elegans.

To improve our capability to investigate complex mechanisms of synaptic signaling and remodeling, we designed a fluorescence hyperspectral imaging platform to simultaneously track different subtypes of individual neurotransmitter receptors trafficking in and out of synapses. This imaging platform allows simultaneous image acquisition of at least five fluorescent markers in living neurons with a high-spatial resolution. We used quantum dots emitting at different wavelengths and functionalized to specifically bind to single receptors on the membrane of living neurons. The hyperspectral imaging platform enabled the simultaneous optical tracking of five different synaptic proteins, including subtypes of glutamate receptors (mGluR and AMPAR) and postsynaptic signaling proteins. It also permitted the quantification of their mobility after treatments with various pharmacological agents. This technique provides an efficient method to monitor several synaptic proteins at the same time, which could accelerate the screening of effective compounds for treatment of CNS disorders.

Twenty-seven one-day-old full-term infants underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recording during linguistic and non-linguistic stimulation. Fourteen newborns listened to linguistic stimuli (native and non-native language stories) and 13 newborns were exposed to non-linguistic conditions (native and non-native stimuli played in reverse). Comparisons between left and right hemisphere oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)) concentration changes over the temporal areas revealed clear left hemisphere dominance for native language, whereas non-native stimuli were associated with right hemisphere lateralization. In addition, bilateral cerebral activation was found for non-linguistic stimulus processing. Overall, our findings indicate that from the first day after birth, native language and prosodic features are processed in parallel by distinct neural networks. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Using multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data collected longitudinally from a sample of 38 adolescents (17 males) when they were 10, 11.5, 13 and 15 years old, we tested the possibility that there exists parallel variations in the structural and functional development of neural systems supporting face processing. By combining measures of task-related functional connectivity and brain morphology, we reveal that both the structural covariance and functional connectivity among 'distal' nodes of the face-processing network engaged by ambiguous faces increase during this age range. Furthermore, we show that the trajectory of increasing functional connectivity between the distal nodes occurs in tandem with the development of their structural covariance. This demonstrates a tight coupling between functional and structural maturation within the face-processing network. Finally, we demonstrate that increased functional connectivity is associated with age-related improvements of face-processing performance, particularly in females. We suggest that our findings reflect greater integration among distal elements of the neural systems supporting the processing of facial expressions. This, in turn, might facilitate an enhanced extraction of social information from faces during a time when greater importance is placed on social interactions.

Theory of mind mediates the prospective relationship between abnormal social brain network morphology and chronic behavior problems after pediatric traumatic brain injury	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						childhood; brain injuries; social cognition; theory of mind; magnetic resonance imaging	SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; YOUNG-ADULT SURVIVORS; NEURAL BASIS; EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; AXONAL INJURY; BIRTH COHORT; CHILDREN; MODERATE; PREDICTORS	Childhood and adolescence coincide with rapid maturation and synaptic reorganization of distributed neural networks that underlie complex cognitive-affective behaviors. These regions, referred to collectively as the 'social brain network' (SBN) are commonly vulnerable to disruption from pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the mechanisms that link morphological changes in the SBN to behavior problems in this population remain unclear. In 98 children and adolescents with mild to severe TBI, we acquired 3D T1-weighted MRIs at 2-8 weeks post-injury. For comparison, 33 typically developing controls of similar age, sex and education were scanned. All participants were assessed on measures of Theory of Mind (ToM) at 6 months post-injury and parents provided ratings of behavior problems at 24-months post-injury. Severe TBI was associated with volumetric reductions in the overall SBN package, as well as regional gray matter structural change in multiple component regions of the SBN. When compared with TD controls and children with milder injuries, the severe TBI group had significantly poorer ToM, which was associated with more frequent behavior problems and abnormal SBN morphology. Mediation analysis indicated that impaired theory of mind mediated the prospective relationship between abnormal SBN morphology and more frequent chronic behavior problems. Our findings suggest that sub-acute alterations in SBN morphology indirectly contribute to long-term behavior problems via their influence on ToM. Volumetric change in the SBN and its putative hub regions may represent useful imaging biomarkers for prediction of post-acute social cognitive impairment, which may in turn elevate risk for chronic behavior problems.

Eiger-induced cell death relies on Rac1-dependent endocytosis	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article							N-TERMINAL KINASE; NOX1 NADPH OXIDASE; JUN KINASE; DROSOPHILA HOMOLOG; INDUCED ACTIVATION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; RAC1 ACTIVATION; TNF SUPERFAMILY; LRRK2; JNK	Signaling via tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily members regulates cellular life and death decisions. A subset of mammalian TNFR proteins, most notably the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), induces cell death through a pathway that requires activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). However the receptor-proximal signaling events that mediate this remain unclear. Drosophila express a single tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand termed Eiger (Egr) that activates JNK-dependent cell death. We have exploited this model to identify phylogenetically conserved signaling events that allow Egr to induce JNK activation and cell death in vivo. Here we report that Rac1, a small GTPase, is specifically required in Egr-mediated cell death. rac1 loss of function blocks Egr-induced cell death, whereas Rac1 overexpression enhances Egr-induced killing. We identify Vav as a GEF for Rac1 in this pathway and demonstrate that dLRRK functions as a negative regulator of Rac1 that normally acts to constrain Egr-induced death. Thus dLRRK loss of function increases Egr-induced cell death in the fly. We further show that Rac1-dependent entry of Egr into early endosomes is a crucial prerequisite for JNK activation and for cell death and show that this entry requires the activity of Rab21 and Rab7. These findings reveal novel regulatory mechanisms that allow Rac1 to contribute to Egr-induced JNK activation and cell death.	[Ruan, W.; Srinivasan, A.; Lin, S.; Kara, K-I; Barker, P.

While the emerging diversity of malignant disease entities affecting brain tissues is often described in reference to their signature alterations within the cellular genome and epigenome, arguably these cell-intrinsic changes can be regarded as hardwired adaptations to a variety of cell-extrinsic microenvironmental circumstances. Conversely, oncogenic events influence the microenvironment through their impact on the cellular secretome, including emission of membranous structures known as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs serve as unique carriers of bioactive lipids, secretable and non-secretable proteins, mRNA, non-coding RNA, and DNA and constitute pathway(s) of extracellular exit of molecules into the intercellular space, biofluids, and blood. EVs are also highly heterogeneous as reflected in their nomenclature (exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles) attempting to capture their diverse origin, as well as structural, molecular, and functional properties. While EVs may act as a mechanism of molecular expulsion, their non-random uptake by heterologous cellular recipients defines their unique roles in the intercellular communication, horizontal molecular transfer, and biological activity. In the central nervous system, EVs have been implicated as mediators of homeostasis and repair, while in cancer they may act as regulators of cell growth, clonogenicity, angiogenesis, thrombosis, and reciprocal tumor-stromal interactions. EVs produced by specific brain tumor cell types may contain the corresponding oncogenic drivers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) in glioblastoma (and hence are often referred to as 'oncosomes'). Through this mechanism, mutant oncoproteins and nucleic acids may be transferred horizontally between cellular populations altering their individual and collective phenotypes. Oncogenic pathways also impact the emission rates, types, cargo, and biogenesis of EVs, as reflected by preliminary analyses pointing to differences in profiles of EV-regulating genes (vesiculome) between molecular subtypes of glioblastoma, and in other brain tumors. Molecular regulators of vesiculation can also act as oncogenes. These intimate connections suggest the context-specific roles of different EV subsets in the progression of specific brain tumors. Advanced efforts are underway to capture these events through the use of EVs circulating in biofluids as biomarker reservoirs and to guide diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.

Mthfr as a modifier of the retinal phenotype of Crb1(rd8/rd8) mice	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						CRB1; Homocysteine; Retina; rd8; MTHFR; Mouse; LCA RP	SYNTHASE MUTANT MICE; METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE; CLINICAL-IMPLICATIONS; RD8 MUTATION; CRUMBS; HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA; MODEL; HOMOCYSTEINE; CELLS; DEGENERATION	Mutations in crumb homologue 1 (CRB1) in humans are associated with Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). There is no clear genotype phenotype correlation for human CRB1 mutations in RP and LCA. The high variability in clinical features observed in CRB1 mutations suggests that environmental factors or genetic modifiers influence severity of CRB1 related retinopathies. Retinal degeneration 8 (rd8) is a spontaneous mutation in the Crbl gene (Crbl (rdr/rd8)) Crb1(rdr/rd8) mice present with focal disruption in the outer retina manifesting as white spots on fundus examination. Mild retinal dysfunction with decreased b-wave amplitude has been reported in Crbl rdr/rd8 mice at 18 months. Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a crucial enzyme of homocysteine metabolism. MTHFR mutations are prevalent in humans and are linked to a broad spectrum of disorders including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. We recently reported the retinal phenotype in Mthfr-deficient (Mthfr(+/-)) heterozygous mice. At 24 weeks the mice showed decreased RGC function, thinner nerve fiber layer, focal areas of vascular leakage and 20% fewer cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Considering the variability in CRB1-related retinopathies and the high occurrence of human MTHFR mutations we evaluated whether Mthfr deficiency influences rd8 retinal phenotype. Mthfr heterozygous mice with rd8 mutations (Mthfr(+/- rd8/rd8).) and Crb(rd8/rd8) mice (Mthfr(+/-rd8/rd8),) mice were subjected to comprehensive retinal evaluation using ERG, fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA), morphometric and retinal flat mount immunostaining analyses of isolectin-B4 at 8-54 wks. Assessment of retinal function revealed a significant decrease in the a-, b- and c-wave amplitudes in Mthfr(+/- rd8/rd8) mice at 52 wks. Fundoscopic evaluation demonstrated the presence of signature rd8 spots in Mthfr(+/+rd8/rd8) mice and an increase in the extent of these rd8 spots in Mthfr+/- rd8/rd8 mice at 24 weeks and beyond. FA revealed marked vascular leakage, ischemia and vascular tortuosity in Mthfr+/- rd8/rd8 mice at 24 and 52 weeks. Retinal dysplasia was observed in similar to 14-33% Mthfr(+/- rd8/rd8) mice by morphometric analysis. This was accompanied by a -20% reduction in cells of the GCL of Mthfr(+/- rd8/rd8) mice at 24 and 52 weeks. Retinal flat mount immunostaining with isolectin-B4 showed neovascularization and loss of blood vessel integrity in Mthfr(+/- rd8/rd8) mice in contrast to mild vasculopathy in Mthfr(+/+rd8/rd8) mice. Taken together, our data support an earlier onset and worsened retinal phenotype when Mthfr and rd8 mutations coexist. Our study sets the stage for future studies to investigate the role of MTHFR deficiency in human CRB1 retinopathies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of Salt Loading on the Regulation of Rat Hypothalamic Magnocellular Neurosecretory Cells by Ionotropic GABA and Glycine Receptors	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						supraoptic nucleus; vasopressin; oxytocin; GABA; glycine; osmolality; inhibition; salt loading; baroreceptor; arterial pressure; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; TrkB receptor; KCC2; chloride	SUPRAOPTIC VASOPRESSIN NEURONS; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; CL-COTRANSPORTER KCC2; FACTOR MESSENGER-RNA; CATION-CHLORIDE-COTRANSPORTERS; VASCULOSUM LAMINA TERMINALIS; HIPPOCAMPAL NETWORK ACTIVITY; MEDIATED DOWN-REGULATION; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; IN-VITRO	Synaptic and extrasynaptic transmission mediated by ionotropic GABA and glycine receptors plays a critical role in shaping the action potential firing (spiking) activity of hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory cells and therefore determines the rate at which vasopressin and oxytocin are released from the neurohypophysis. The inhibitory effect of these transmitters relies on the maintenance of a low concentration of intracellular chloride ions such that, when activated by GABA or glycine, a hyperpolarisation of the neuronal membrane potential results. In this review, we highlight the various ways by which the two types of inhibitory receptors contribute to homeostasis by fine-tuning the spiking rate of vasopressin-releasing magnocellular neurosecretory cells in a manner dependent on the hydration state of the animal. In addition, we review the currently available evidence on how the strength of these inhibitory pathways can be regulated during chronic hypernatraemia via a form of activity-dependent depolarisation of the chloride reversal potential, leading to an abolition of these inhibitory pathways potentially causing sodium-dependent elevations in blood pressure.

Effects of Salt Loading on the Morphology of Astrocytes in the Ventral Glia Limitans of the Rat Supraoptic Nucleus	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						supraoptic nucleus; salt loading; glia limitans; plasticity	STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RADIAL GLIA; DEHYDRATION; NEURONS; REHYDRATION; HYPOTHALAMUS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY; LACTATION	In the ventral glial limitans (VGL) of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the rat, a unique astrocyte type is found with an ability to undergo striking morphological plasticity in response to a wide range of physiological stimulations such as chronic hypernatraemia. This includes a thinning of the VGL, which contains the somata and proximal processes of these astrocytes, as well as an almost complete withdrawal of their vertically-oriented distal processes. Currently, there is little information available on the types of astrocytes that reside in the SON-VGL and which of these exhibit state-dependent structural plasticity. To address this, we enabled the visualisation of single SON-VGL glia using two novel cell labelling techniques with fluorescence microscopy. First, we used an inducible genetic reporter mouse line that allowed the specific labelling of a low density of astrocytes expressing glutamate and aspartate transporter (GLAST)/excitatory amino acid transporter 1. This approach revealed a high degree of variability in the morphology of mouse SON-VGL astrocytes, in contrast to what has been reported for cortical astrocytes. Next, we used the DiOlistlic labelling approach to label single glial cells with DiI in the SON-VGL of rats. Astrocytes observed using this approach shared the morphological features of GLAST-expressing astrocytes in the mouse SON-VGL. Specific structural aspects of these cells were modified by chronic hypernatraemia achieved by 7-day salt loading. Notably, the average area of cells exhibiting protoplasmic features was significantly reduced in the horizontal plane, and the size of varicosities present on fibrous projections was significantly enlarged. These observations indicate that novel cell labelling methods can significantly advance our understanding of SON-VGL cells and reveal specific forms of morphological plasticity that can be driven by chronic hypernatraemia.

As many patients with spinal cord dysraphism already have symptoms, it might be difficult to diagnose secondary TSC. Regular clinical/urodynamic (UDS) evaluation is therefore advised to pick-up changes early before they progress. This study aimed at presenting clinical/UDS outcomes for patients with secondary TSC who underwent spinal cord untethering (SCU). Study design Charts of patients with secondary TSC between 1998 and 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who underwent pre/post SCU clinical/UDS evaluation were included. All patients were followed-up for a minimum of 5 years for proper clinical outcomes assessment. Urologic, neuro-orthopedic, and UDS outcomes were collected and studied. Continence status was assessed in children aged >= 5 years. Patients were considered continent if they were dry for >= 4 h or socially continent if they stayed dry most of the day using maximum 1-2 pads/day. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher-Exact test and continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results Twenty-three patients met our inclusion criteria. The median age at time of SCU was 8.8 (range 2.3-16.2) years. The median age at time of UDS follow-up after SCU was 8.8 (range 2.9-17) years. The median follow-up time was 5 (range 5-13.4) years. Urological symptoms were reported in 56.5% of patients before SCU and improved in 61.5% post SCU. Neuro-orthopedic symptoms were reported in 87% of patients before SCU and improved in 65% post SCU. Continence was achieved in 73.9% of the entire cohort on long-term follow-up, while 26.1% had socially acceptable continence. UDS outcomes are summarized in the Table. Conclusions Patients with secondary TSC are expected to have progression of their symptoms over time if not untethered. From here comes the importance of closely performing clinical/UDS evaluation to pick-up changes early before they progress. Surprisingly, clinical outcomes after SCU with detailed description of the auxiliary management are sparse in the literature. Most studies focus on UDS outcomes. We provided in the current study a detailed discussion of the clinical outcomes, auxiliary-managements used to achieve continence, and the UDS outcomes. Careful periodic clinical/UDS evaluation is recommended for early pick-up of changes suggestive of TSC. SCU could improve existing symptoms, and prevent worsening or development of new symptoms. UDS parameters that showed most improvement were intravesical pressure at TCBC and bladder compliance.

Currently, this disease represents one of the uppermost human issues, both from the medical and economic point of view. Interest in the discovery of a drug for AD is enormous. However, despite the long-term and worldwide effort for a more effective therapy, the only available treatment is a symptomatic use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine. New therapeutic approaches as well as those based on cholinergic or amyloid theory have not brought the desired benefits yet. Thus, the question is whether an effective drug for this progressive disease will ever be developed or whether people will have to rely only on prevention and minimize risk factors of AD.

Latest findings indicate that BMS could result from neuropathic trigeminal conditions. While many investigations have focused on the periphery, very few have examined possible central dysfunctions. To highlight changes of the central system of subjects with BMS, we analysed the grey matter concentration in 12 subjects using voxel-based morphometry. Data were compared with a control group (Ct). To better understand the brain mechanisms underlying BMS, the grey matter concentration of patients was also compared with those of dysgeusic patients (Dys). Dysgeusia is another oral dysfunction condition, characterized by a distorted sense of taste and accompanied by a reduced taste function. We found that a major part of the pain matrix' presented modifications of the grey matter concentration in subjects with BMS. Six regions out of eight were affected [anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, lobules of the cerebellum, insula/frontal operculum, inferior temporal area, primary motor cortex, dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC)]. In the anterior cingulate gyrus, the lobules of the cerebellum, the inferior temporal lobe and the DLPFC, pain intensity correlated with grey matter concentration. Dys also presented changes in grey matter concentration but in different areas of the brain. Our results suggest that a deficiency in the control of pain could in part be a cause of BMS and that BMS and dysgeusia conditions are not linked to similar structural changes in the brain.

J	De Leener, B; Taso, M; Cohen-Adad, J; Callot, V				De Leener, Benjamin; Taso, Manuel; Cohen-Adad, Julien; Callot, Virginie			Segmentation of the human spinal cord	MAGNETIC RESONANCE MATERIALS IN PHYSICS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Review						Spinal cord; Segmentation; White matter; Gray matter; MRI	PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; OF-THE-ART; IN-VIVO; AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION; NEUROMYELITIS-OPTICA; GRAY-MATTER; MR-IMAGES; 3 TESLA	Segmenting the spinal cord contour is a necessary step for quantifying spinal cord atrophy in various diseases. Delineating gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) is also useful for quantifying GM atrophy or for extracting multiparametric MRI metrics into specific WM tracts. Spinal cord segmentation in clinical research is not as developed as brain segmentation, however with the substantial improvement of MR sequences adapted to spinal cord MR investigations, the field of spinal cord MR segmentation has advanced greatly within the last decade. Segmentation techniques with variable accuracy and degree of complexity have been developed and reported in the literature. In this paper, we review some of the existing methods for cord and WM/GM segmentation, including intensity-based, surface-based, and image-based methods. We also provide recommendations for validating spinal cord segmentation techniques, as it is important to understand the intrinsic characteristics of the methods and to evaluate their performance and limitations. Lastly, we illustrate some applications in the healthy and pathological spinal cord. One conclusion of this review is that robust and automatic segmentation is clinically relevant, as it would allow for longitudinal and group studies free from user bias as well as reproducible multicentric studies in large populations, thereby helping to further our understanding of the spinal cord pathophysiology and to develop new criteria for early detection of subclinical evolution for prognosis prediction and for patient management. Another conclusion is that at the present time, no single method adequately segments the cord and its substructure in all the cases encountered (abnormal intensities, loss of contrast, deformation of the cord, etc.). A combination of different approaches is thus advised for future developments, along with the introduction of probabilistic shape models. Maturation of standardized frameworks, multiplatform availability, inclusion in large suite and data sharing would also ultimately benefit to the community.

Temporal decorrelation by SK channels enables efficient neural coding and perception of natural stimuli	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; POWER-LAW ADAPTATION; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEM; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; REDUNDANCY REDUCTION; GYMNOTOID FISH; IN-VIVO; NEURONS	It is commonly assumed that neural systems efficiently process natural sensory input. However, the mechanisms by which such efficient processing is achieved, and the consequences for perception and behaviour remain poorly understood. Here we show that small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels enable efficient neural processing and perception of natural stimuli. Specifically, these channels allow for the high-pass filtering of sensory input, thereby removing temporal correlations or, equivalently, whitening frequency response power. Varying the degree of adaptation through pharmacological manipulation of SK channels reduced efficiency of coding of natural stimuli, which in turn gave rise to predictable changes in behavioural responses that were no longer matched to natural stimulus statistics. Our results thus demonstrate a novel mechanism by which the nervous system can implement efficient processing and perception of natural sensory input that is likely to be shared across systems and species.

Despite 40 years of experience, it is still a specialized procedure with a number of challenges. Here, we present the recommendations issued from the AUS Consensus Group, regarding indications, management and follow-up AMS800 implantation or revision. Materials and MethodsUnder ICS auspices, an expert panel met on July 10, 2015 in Chicago, IL, USA in an attempt to reach a consensus on diverse issues related to the AMS800 device. Participants were selected by the two co-chairs on the basis of their practice in a University hospital and their experience: number of implanted AUSs according to AMS (American Medical System Holdings Inc., Minnetonka, MN) records and/or major published articles. Topics listed were the result of a pre-meeting email brainstorming by all participants. The co-chairs distributed topics randomly to all participants, who then had to propose a statement on each topic for approval by the conference after a short evidence-based presentation, when possible. ResultsThe present recommendations, based on the most recent and relevant data available in literature as well as expert opinions, successively address multiple specific and problematic issues associated with the AMS800 trough a 6-chapter structure: pre-operative assessment, pre operative challenges, implantation technique, post-operative care, trouble-shooting, and special populations. ConclusionThese guidelines undoubtedly constitute a reference document, which will help urologists to carefully select patients and apply the most adapted management to implantation, follow-up and trouble-shooting of the AMS800.

MethodsThis 2008-2012 exploratory observational cohort study was conducted with community-dwelling women aged 60 and over. Sixty six women (22 per group), mean age of 67.75.2 years, participated in the study. A 3T MRI examination was conducted under three conditions: rest, PFM MVC, and straining. ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests (data not normally distributed) were conducted, with Bonferroni correction, to compare anatomical measurements between groups. ResultsWomen with MUI symptoms had a lower PFM resting position (M-Line P=0.010 and PC/H-line angle P=0.026) and lower pelvic organ support (urethrovesical junction height P=0.013) than both continent and SUI women. Women with SUI symptoms were more likely to exhibit bladder neck funneling and a larger posterior urethrovesical angle at rest than both continent and MUI women (P=0.026 and P=0.008, respectively). There were no significant differences between groups on PFM MVC or straining. ConclusionsWomen with SUI and MUI symptoms present different morphological defects at rest. These observations emphasize the need to tailor UI interventions to specific pelvic floor defects and UI type in older women. Patient summaryOlder women with UI demonstrate different problems with their pelvic organ support structures depending on the type of UI. These new findings should be taken into consideration for future research into developing new treatment strategies for UI in older women. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35:515-521, 2016.

Because rapid eye movement sleep is regulated by the cholinergic system, which shows early degeneration in Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment, anomalies during this sleep stage might mirror dementia development. In this prospective study, we examined baseline electroencephalographic absolute spectral power across three states of consciousness (non-rapid eye movement sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, and wakefulness) in 68 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and 44 healthy controls. All participants underwent baseline polysomnographic recordings and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Power spectral analyses were performed on standard frequency bands. Dominant occipital frequency during wakefulness and ratios of slow-to-fast frequencies during rapid eye movement sleep and wakefulness were also computed. At follow-up (an average 4.5 years after baseline), 18 patients with Parkinson's disease had developed dementia and 50 patients remained dementia-free. In rapid eye movement sleep, patients with Parkinson's disease who later developed dementia showed, at baseline, higher absolute power in delta and theta bands and a higher slowing ratio, especially in temporal, parietal, and occipital regions, compared to patients who remained dementia-free and controls. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, lower baseline sigma power in parietal cortical regions also predicted development of dementia. During wakefulness, patients with Parkinson's disease who later developed dementia showed lower dominant occipital frequency as well as higher delta and slowing ratio compared to patients who remained dementia-free and controls. At baseline, higher slowing ratios in temporo-occipital regions during rapid eye movement sleep were associated with poor performance on visuospatial tests in patients with Parkinson's disease. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we found that best predictors of dementia in Parkinson's disease were rapid eye movement sleep slowing ratios in posterior regions, wakefulness slowing ratios in temporal areas, and lower dominant occipital frequency. These results suggest that electroencephalographic slowing during sleep is a new promising predictive biomarker for Parkinson's disease dementia, perhaps as a marker of cholinergic denervation.

Since PD is a neurodegenerative disorder and its progression may be correlated with olfactory loss (Ansari & Johnson, 1975; but see also Doty, Deems, & Stellar, 1988), it is possible that these patients would be subject to metacognitive errors of over-estimation of olfactory ability (White & Kurtz, 2003). Nineteen non demented PD patients and 19 age-matched controls were each given an objective measure of olfactory identification (the UPSIT, Doty, Shaman, Kimmelman, & Dann, 1984) and a subjective measure involving a questionnaire that asked them to self-rate both their olfactory function generally and their ability to smell each of 20 odors, 12 of which were assessed on the UPSIT. All of the PD patients showed impaired olfactory ability, as did 7 of the controls, according to the UPSIT norms. Self-rated and performance-based olfactory ability scores were significantly correlated in controls (r = .49, p = .03) but not in patients with PD (r = .20, p = .39). When the 12 odors common to both the self-rated questionnaire and UPSIT were compared, PD patients were less accurate than controls (436) = 4.96, p < .01) at estimating their own ability and the number of over-estimation errors was significantly higher (t(one-tailed)(29) = 1.80, p = .04) in PD patients than in the control group, showing less metacognitive awareness of their ability than controls. These results support the idea that olfactory metacognition is often impaired in PD, as well as in controls recruited for normosmic ability (Wehling, Nordin, Espeseth, Reinvang, & Lundervold, 2011), and indicate that people with PD generally exhibit over-estimation of their olfactory ability at a rate that is higher than controls. These findings imply that PD patients, unaware of their olfactory deficit, are at greater risk of harm normally detected through olfaction, such as smoke or spoiled foods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In a previous study in squirrel monkeys, we found that the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) projected mainly to 3 regions within the M1 forearm representation [rostro-medial (RM), rostro-lateral (RL), and caudo-lateral (CL)] with very few caudo-medial (CM) projections. These results suggest that projections from premotor areas to M1 are not uniform, but rather segregated into subregions. The goal of the present work was to study how inputs from diverse areas of the ipsilateral cortical network are organized within the M1 hand representation. In Cebus apella, different retrograde neuroanatomical tracers were injected in 4 subregions of the hand area of M1 (RM, RL, CM, and CL). We found a different pattern of input to each subregion of M1. RM receives inputs predominantly from dorsal premotor cortex, RL from PMv, CM from area 5, and CL from area 2. These results support that the M1 hand representation is composed of several subregions, each part of a unique cortical network.

Methods: We recruited a retrospective cohort of 15 consecutive newborns with moderate (9) and severe (6) HIE monitored with a continuous EEG during TH and at least 12 h after its end. EEG background was analyzed using conventional visual and quantitative EEG analysis methods including EEG discontinuity, absolute and relative spectral magnitudes. One patient with seizures on rewarming was excluded from analyses. Results: Visual and quantitative analyses demonstrated significant changes in EEG background from preto post-rewarming, characterized by an increased EEG discontinuity, more pronounced in newborns with severe compared to moderate HIE. Neonates with moderate HIE also had an increase in the relative magnitude of slower delta and a decrease in higher frequency theta and alpha waves with rewarming. Conclusions: Rewarming affects EEG background in HIE newborns undergoing TH, which may represent a transient adaptive response or reflect an evolving brain injury. Significance: EEG background impairment induced by rewarming may represent a biomarker of evolving encephalopathy in HIE newborns undergoing TH and underscores the importance of continuously monitoring the brain health in critically ill neonates.

Methods: We developed a fully automatic algorithm to detect HFOs and classify them based on their morphology, with types defined according to regularity in amplitude and frequency: type 1 with regular amplitude and frequency; type 2 with irregular amplitude, which could result from filtering of sharp spikes; type 3 with irregular frequency; and type 4 with irregular amplitude and frequency. We investigated the association of different HFO types with the seizure onset zone (SOZ), resected area and surgical outcome. Results: HFO rates of all types were significantly higher inside the SOZ than outside. HFO types 1 and 2 were strongly correlated to each other and showed the highest rates among all HFOs. Their occurrence was highly associated with the SOZ, resected area and surgical outcome. The automatic detection emulated visual markings with 93% true positives and 57% false detections. Conclusions: HFO types 1 and 2 similarly reflect epileptogenicity. Significance: For clinical application, it may not be necessary to separate real HFOs from "false oscillations" produced by the filter effect of sharp spikes. Also for automatically detected HFOs, surgical outcome is better when locations with higher HFO rates are included in the resection. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Objectives: To investigate the relationship between cerebellar pathology and cognitive function in youth with pediatric-onset MS. Methods: Twenty-eight pediatric-onset relapsing remitting MS patients (21 girls; mean age 16.2 years; mean disease duration 4.3 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 1.25) were compared to 33 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological evaluation to assess intelligence, attention, processing speed, language, visuo-motor integration, and fine-motor dexterity. Associations between cognitive outcomes and cerebellar volume independent of cerebral volume were examined. Results: Cognitive and motor performance of the MS group was reduced relative to controls (all p<0.003). While cerebellar volumes did not differ between groups, cerebellar posterior lobe volume and infratentorial lesion volume accounted for extra variance on measures of information processing (R-2=0.43; p=0.02) and vocabulary (R-2=0.56; p=0.04) in patients (controlling for cerebral volume and sex), but not in controls. Conclusion: Smaller cerebellar posterior lobe volume, a known region for cognitive processing, and increased lesion burden in the posterior fossa adversely impact cognitive function, an important functional consequence of MS onset during childhood.

Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging in very early onset pediatric multiple sclerosis	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; demyelination; diffusion tensor; pediatric	HUMAN BRAIN; DAMAGE; MRI; MATURATION; ADULTHOOD; CHILDHOOD; ASYMMETRY	Objectives: Active myelination during childhood may influence the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) on brain structural integrity. We studied normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in children with MS onset before age 12 years using diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: DT MRI scans were obtained from 22 MS children with their first attack before age 12 years, and 31 healthy controls from two referral centers. Using probabilistic tractography, brain tissue integrity within interhemispheric, intrahemispheric, and projection tracts was compared between patients and site matched controls. The impact of disease and age at MRI on tract NAWM fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values was evaluated using linear models. Results: Compared to controls, pediatric MS patients had reduced FA and increased MD of the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum (CC), without center-by-group interaction. CC NAWM average FA was correlated with brain T2 lesion volume. In controls, the majority of the tracts analyzed showed a significant increase of FA and decrease of MD with age. Such a linear correlation was lost in patients. Conclusions: In very young pediatric MS patients, DT MM abnormalities affect brain WM tracts differentially, and are only partially correlated with focal WM lesions. Impaired maturation of WM tracts with age may be an additional factor contributing to these findings.	[Rocca, M.

Midazolam dose correlates with abnormal hippocampal growth and neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TERM-EQUIVALENT AGE; PREMATURE NEWBORNS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; VENTILATORY SUPPORT; IMAGE REGISTRATION; PROCEDURAL PAIN; NEONATAL PAIN; EXPOSURE; DEPRESSION; MORPHINE	ObjectiveVery preterm-born neonates (24-32 weeks of gestation) are exposed to stressful and painful procedures during neonatal intensive care. Analgesic and sedation therapies are essential, and opiates and benzodiazepines are commonly used. These medications may negatively impact brain development. The hippocampus may be especially vulnerable to the effects of pain and analgesic and/or sedative therapies and contribute to adverse outcomes. The effect of invasive procedures and analgesic-sedative exposure on hippocampal growth was assessed, as was that of hippocampal growth on neurodevelopmental outcome. MethodsA total of 138 neonates (51% male, median gestational age=27.7 weeks) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, early in life (postmenstrual age [PMA]=32.3 weeks) and at term-equivalent age (PMA=40.2 weeks). Volumes and DTI measures of axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity (MD) were obtained from the hippocampus. Cognitive, language, and motor abilities were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III at 18.7 months median corrected age. Models testing the association of invasive procedures with hippocampal volumes and DTI measures accounted for birth gestational age, sex, PMA, dose of analgesics/sedatives (fentanyl, morphine, midazolam), mechanical ventilation, hypotension, and surgeries. ResultsTotal midazolam dose predicted decreased hippocampal volumes (=-1.8, p<0.001) and increased MD (=0.002, p=0.02), whereas invasive procedures did not (=0, p>0.5 each). Lower cognitive scores were associated with hippocampal growth (=-0.31, p=0.003), midazolam dose (=-0.27, p=0.03), and surgery (=-8.32, p=0.04). InterpretationMidazolam exposure was associated with macro- and microstructural alterations in hippocampal development and poorer outcomes consistent with hippocampal dysmaturation. Use of midazolam in preterm neonates, particularly those not undergoing surgery, is cautioned.

The aim of the present study was to determine the availability of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) using a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical with high selectivity for mGluR5 ([C-11]ABP688) in a sample of bvFTD patients. In addition, we sought to determine the overlap between availability of mGluR5 and neurodegeneration, as measured using [F-18]FDG-PET and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Availability of mGluR5 and glucose metabolism ([F-18]FDG) were measured in bvFTD (n = 5) and cognitively normal (CN) subjects (n = 10). [C-11]ABP688 binding potential maps (BPND) were calculated using the cerebellum as a reference region, with [F-18]FDG standardized uptake ratio maps (SUVR) normalized to the pons. Grey matter (GM) concentrations were determined using VBM. Voxel-based group differences were obtained using RMINC. BvFTD patients showed widespread decrements in [C-11]ABP688 BPND throughout frontal, temporal and subcortical areas. These areas were likewise characterized by significant hypometabolism and GM loss, with overlap between reduced [C-11]ABP688 BPND and hypometabolism superior to that for GM atrophy. Several regions were characterized only by decreased binding of [C-11]ABP688. The present findings represent the first in vivo report of decreased availability of mGluR5 in bvFTD. This study suggests that glutamate excitotoxicity may play a role in the pathogenesis of bvFTD and that [C-11]ABP688 may prove a suitable marker of glutamatergic neurotransmission in vivo.

Therefore, in the present multicenter study, we used MRI to measure volume of the superior and inferior colliculi, as well as of the thalamic nuclei relaying sensory and motor information to the neocortex, parcellated according to atlas-based thalamo-cortical connections, in 29 individuals with congenital blindness of peripheral origin (17 M, age 35.7 +/- A 14.3 years) and 29 sighted subjects (17 M, age 31.9 +/- A 9.0). Blind participants showed an overall volume reduction in the left (p = 0.008) and right (p = 0.007) thalami, as compared to the sighted individuals. Specifically, the lateral geniculate (i.e., primary visual thalamic relay nucleus) was 40 % reduced (left: p = 4 x 10(-6), right: p < 1 x 10(-6)), consistent with findings from animal studies. In addition, associated thalamic nuclei that project to temporal (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.005), prefrontal (left: p = 0.010, right: p = 0.014), occipital (left: p = 0.005, right: p = 0.023), and right premotor (p = 0.024) cortical regions were also significantly reduced in the congenitally blind group. Conversely, volumes of the relay nuclei directly involved in auditory, motor, and somatosensory processing were not affected by visual deprivation. In contrast, no difference in volume was observed in either the superior or the inferior colliculus between the two groups. Our findings indicate that visual loss since birth leads to selective volumetric changes within diencephalic, but not mesencephalic, structures. Both changes in reciprocal cortico-thalamic connections or modifications in the intrinsic connectivity between relay and association nuclei of the thalamus may contribute to explain these alterations in thalamic volumes. Sparing of the superior colliculi is in line with their composite, multisensory projections, and with their not exclusive visual nature.

Oxytocin and the Pharmacological Dissection of Affiliation	CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						oxytocin; attachment; social; motivation; individual differences; intranasal; Syntocinon	BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; HUMANS; VASOPRESSIN; MODULATION; ATTACHMENT; NEUROPEPTIDES; RECEPTORS; SYSTEM; AGENCY	Popularly hailed as the love hormone, oxytocin has emerged as a key variable in the regulation of human social cognition and behavior. In particular, research using intranasal oxytocin to pharmacologically manipulate the availability of oxytocin shows that oxytocin augmentation can promote a wide range of affiliative processes; however, evidence also shows null and even antisocial effects. Rather than random error to be eliminated, such variability may offer clues about the mechanisms by which oxytocin modulates human sociality. Three potential mechanismsanxiety reduction, social salience, and affiliative motivationare discussed, along with recent work showing how the affiliative-motivation hypothesis can simultaneously account for oxytocin's pro- and antisocial effects. Appreciating oxytocin's nuanced social effects is important for advancing our understanding of the neuroscience and psychology of affiliation.

Synchronous metastatic skull base chordoma to the breast: case report and literature review	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Review						Chordoma; synchronous metastasis; radiotherapy; surgery	FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION; PHOTON IRRADIATION; SPINE	Clinical Scenario During routine staging work-up for a left breast mass, a 68-year-old woman complained of dysphagia and dysphonia. During further investigations, a left-sided lesion at the foramen magnum was observed on brain imaging. Both lesions were biopsied and showed a classical chordoma. Management The skull-base lesion and the breast lesion were surgically resected, and adjuvant radiotherapy was given. Summary Chordoma is a rare primary central nervous system tumour that seldom metastasizes. The lung is the most common site of metastasis. Synchronous breast metastasis from a skull-base chordoma is very rare, and a safe management option includes a maximum resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy.	[Shakir, S. I.; Muanza, T.

Exome sequencing identifies recessive CDK5RAP2 variants in patients with isolated agenesis of corpus callosum	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							MUTATIONS; PROTEIN; CHILD	Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a common brain malformation which can be observed either as an isolated condition or as part of numerous congenital syndromes. Therefore, cognitive and neurological involvements in patients with ACC are variable, from mild linguistic and behavioral impairments to more severe neurological deficits. To date, the underlying genetic causes of isolated ACC remains elusive and causative genes have yet to be identified. We performed exome sequencing on three acallosal siblings from the same non-consanguineous family and identified compound heterozygous variants, p.[Gly94Arg]; [Asn1232Ser], in the protein encoded by the CDK5RAP2 gene, also known as MCPH3, a gene previously reported to cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Our findings suggest a novel role for this gene in the pathogenesis of isolated ACC.

Impaired RASGRF1/ERK-mediated GM-CSF response characterizes CARD9 deficiency in French-Canadians	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9; spontaneous central nervous system candidiasis; candidiasis; Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1; extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GM-CSF; CSF2	COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR; CANDIDA-ALBICANS; COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY; DEEP DERMATOPHYTOSIS; ANTIFUNGAL IMMUNITY; FUNGAL-INFECTIONS; MALT1 MUTATIONS; RAS; ACTIVATION; GRANULOMA	Background: Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency conferring human susceptibility to invasive fungal disease, including spontaneous central nervous system candidiasis (sCNSc). However, clinical characterization of sCNSc is variable, hindering its recognition. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of the bases for this susceptibility has remained elusive. Objectives: We sought to comprehensively characterize sCNSc and to dissect the mechanisms by which a hypomorphic CARD9 mutation causes susceptibility to Candida species. Methods: We describe the clinical and radiologic findings of sCNSc caused by CARD9 deficiency in a French-Canadian cohort. We performed genetic, cellular, and molecular analyses to further decipher its pathophysiology. Results: In our French-Canadian series (n 5 4) sCNSc had onset in adulthood (median, 38 years) and was often misinterpreted radiologically as brain malignancies; 1 patient had additional novel features (eg, endophthalmitis and osteomyelitis). CARD9 deficiency resulted from a hypomorphic p.Y91H mutation and allelic imbalance established in this population through founder effects. We demonstrate a consistent cellular phenotype of impaired GM-CSF responses. The ability of CARD9 to complex with B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is intact in our series, arguing against its involvement in susceptibility to fungi. Instead, we show that the p.Y91H mutation impairs the ability of CARD9 to complex with Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1), leading to impaired activation of nuclear factor kappa B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in monocytes and subsequent GM-CSF responses. Successful treatment of a second patient with adjunctive GM-CSF bolsters the clinical relevance of these findings. Conclusions: Hypomorphic CARD9 deficiency caused by p.Y91H results in adult-onset disease with variable penetrance and expressivity. Our findings establish the CARD9/RASGRF1/ERK/GM-CSF axis as critical to the pathophysiology of sCNSc.

Here, we studied the effect of zinc on membrane localization, adhesion, and secretase cleavage of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 in cell culture and rat neurons. For this, we employed live-cell microscopy techniques, a microcontact printing adhesion assay and ELISA for protein detection in cell culture supernatants. We report that zinc induces the multimerization of proteins of the amyloid precursor protein family and enriches them at cellular adhesion sites. Thus, zinc facilitates the formation of de novo APP and APLP1 containing adhesion complexes, whereas it does not have such influence on APLP2. Furthermore, zinc-binding prevented cleavage of APP and APLPs by extracellular secretases. In conclusion, the complexation of zinc modulates neuronal functions of APP and APLPs by (i) regulating formation of adhesion complexes, most prominently for APLP1, and (ii) by reducing the concentrations of neurotrophic soluble APP/APLP ectodomains.

To address spatial heterogeneity, here we analyse 134 specimens from various neuroanatomical structures of whole autopsy brains from nine DIPG patients. Evolutionary reconstruction indicates histone 3 (H3) K27M-including H3.2K27M-mutations potentially arise first and are invariably associated with specific, high-fidelity obligate partners throughout the tumour and its spread, from diagnosis to end-stage disease, suggesting mutual need for tumorigenesis. These H3K27M ubiquitously-associated mutations involve alterations in TP53 cell-cycle (TP53/PPM1D) or specific growth factor pathways (ACVR1/PIK3R1). Later oncogenic alterations arise in sub-clones and often affect the PI3K pathway. Our findings are consistent with early tumour spread outside the brainstem including the cerebrum. The spatial and temporal homogeneity of main driver mutations in DIPG implies they will be captured by limited biopsies and emphasizes the need to develop therapies specifically targeting obligate oncohistone partnerships.

CCNF mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME SYSTEM; DNA-SEQUENCING DATA; LOBAR DEGENERATION; FAMILIAL ALS; PROTEIN; GENE; PATHOGENESIS; HOMEOSTASIS; PROTEOLYSIS; FRAMEWORK	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are overlapping, fatal neurodegenerative disorders in which the molecular and pathogenic basis remains poorly understood. Ubiquitinated protein aggregates, of which TDP-43 is a major component, are a characteristic pathological feature of most ALS and FTD patients. Here we use genome-wide linkage analysis in a large ALS/FTD kindred to identify a novel disease locus on chromosome 16p13.3. Whole-exome sequencing identified a CCNF missense mutation at this locus. Interrogation of international cohorts identified additional novel CCNF variants in familial and sporadic ALS and FTD. Enrichment of rare protein-altering CCNF variants was evident in a large sporadic ALS replication cohort. CCNF encodes cyclin F, a component of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (SCFCyclin F). Expression of mutant CCNF in neuronal cells caused abnormal ubiquitination and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including TDP-43 and a SCFCyclin F substrate. This implicates common mechanisms, linked to protein homeostasis, underlying neuronal degeneration.

Despite 40 years of experience, it is still a specialized procedure with a number of challenges. Here, we present the recommendations issued from the AUS Consensus Group, regarding indications, management, and follow-up AMS800 implantation or revision. Materials and MethodsUnder ICS auspices, an expert panel met on July 10, 2015 in Chicago, IL, USA in an attempt to reach a consensus on diverse issues related to the AMS800 device. Participants were selected by the two co-chairs on the basis of their practice in a University hospital and their experience: number of implanted AUSs according to AMS (American Medical System Holdings Inc., Minnetonka, MN) records and/or major published articles. Topics listed were the result of a pre-meeting email brainstorming by all participants. The co-chairs distributed topics randomly to all participants, who then had to propose a statement on each topic for approval by the conference after a short evidence-based presentation, when possible. ResultsA total of 25 urologists were invited to participate, 19 able to attend the conference. The present recommendations, based on the most recent and relevant data available in literature as well as expert opinions, successively address multiple specific and problematic issues associated with the AMS800 trough a eight-chapter structure: pre-operative assessment, pre operative challenges, implantation technique, post-operative care, trouble-shooting, outcomes, special populations, and the future of AUSs. ConclusionThese guidelines undoubtedly constitute a reference document, which will help urologists to carefully select patients and apply the most adapted management to implantation, follow-up and trouble-shooting of the AMS800.

Rather than reflecting passive and unspecific responses to anatomical abnormalities, the coagulation system is a target of oncogenic deregulation, impacting the role of clotting and fibrinolytic proteins, and integrating hemostasis, inflammation, angiogenesis and cellular growth effects in cancer. These processes signify, but do not depend on, the clinically manifest coagulopathy and thrombosis. In this regard, the role of driver mutations affecting oncoprotein coding genes such as RAS, EGFR or MET and tumour suppressors (PTEN, TP53) are well described as regulators of tissue factor (TF), protease activated receptors (PAR-1/2) and ectopic coagulation factors (FVII). Indeed, in both adult and pediatric brain tumours the expression patterns of coagulation and angiogenesis regulators (coagulome and angiome, respectively) reflect the molecular subtypes of the underlying diseases (glioblastoma or medulloblastoma) as defined by their oncogenic classifiers and clinical course. This emerging understanding is still poorly established in relation to the transforming effects of non-coding genes, including those responsible for the expression of microRNA (miR). Indeed, several miRs have been recently found to regulate TF and other effectors. We recently documented that in the context of the aggressive embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) the oncogenic driver miR (miR-520g) suppresses the expression of TF and correlates with hypocoagulant tumour characteristics. Unlike in adult cancers, the growth of pediatric embryonal brain tumour cells as spheres (to maintain stem cell properties) results in upregulation of miR-520g and downregulation of TF expression and activity. We postulate that oncogenic protein and miR coding genes form alternative pathways of coagulation system regulation in different tumour settings, a property necessitating more personalised and biologically-based approaches to anticoagulation.

ResultsWe report the characterisation of two novel mouse TERT (mTERT) splice variants, Ins-i1[1-102] (Insi1 for short) and Del-e12[1-40] (Dele12 for short) that have not been previously described. Insi1 represents an in-frame insertion of nucleotides 1-102 from intron 1, encoding a 34 amino acid insertion at amino acid 73. Based on known functions of this region in human and Tetrahymena TERTs, the insertion interrupts the RNA interaction domain 1 implicated in low-affinity RNA binding and the telomerase essential N-terminal domain implicated in DNA substrate interactions. Dele12 contains a 40 nucleotide deletion of exon 12 which generates a premature stop codon, and possible protein lacking the C-terminus. We found Insi1 expressed in adult mouse brain and kidney and Dele12 expressed in adult mouse ovary. Dele12 was inactive in vitro and in mTERT(-/-) ES cells and Insi1 retained 26-48% of telomerase activity reconstituted by wild-type mTERT in vitro and in mTERT(-/-) ES cells. The Insi1 variant exhibited reduced DNA substrate binding in vitro and both variants exhibited a reduction in binding the telomerase RNA, mTR, when expressed in mTERT(-/-) ES cells. Stable expression of Dele12 in the mouse fibroblast CB17 cell line inhibited telomerase activity and slowed cell growth, suggesting a potential dominant-negative effect. Levels of signal-free ends, representing short telomeres, and end-to-end fusions were higher in mTERT(-/-) ES cells expressing mTERT-Insi1 and mTERT-Dele12, compared with levels observed in mTERT(-/-) ES cells expressing wild-type mTERT. In addition, in mTERT(-/-) cells expressing mTERT-Insi1, we observed chromosomes that were products of repeated breakage-bridge-fusion cycles and other telomere dysfunction-related aberrations. Conclusion and SignificanceAn intact mTERT N-terminus which contributes to mTR binding, DNA binding and telomerase activity is necessary for elongation of short telomeres and the maintenance of functional telomeres. It is reasonable to speculate that relative levels of mTERT-Insi1 may regulate telomere function in specific tissues.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether children carrying the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene living under adverse economic conditions have worse-than-average fat intake compared with those living in a healthy environment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from an established prospective birth cohort (Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and Neurodevelopment) were used to study 4-year-old children from Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A total of 190 children (94 girls and 96 boys) had height and weight measured and complete food diaries and were therefore eligible for the study. The study is derived from a birth cohort started in June 2003 and still ongoing. The last age of follow-up was at 6 years. EXPOSURES Social environment was characterized based on the gross family income, and DNA was genotyped for the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fat intake. RESULTS The 5 steps to distinguish the differential susceptibility from other types of interaction were followed, and the study confirms that differential susceptibility is a relevant model to address the association between the 7-repeat allele of DRD4 and food choices in girls. Of the 190 children, 112 did not have the DRD4 7-repeat allele and 78 did. Baseline characteristics did not differ in these 2 groups. Although not different in several confounders, such as maternal educational level, maternal smoking during gestation, birth weight, and breastfeeding duration, girls carrying the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene and living in adverse socioeconomic conditions have increased fat intake compared with girls who are noncarriers (DRD4 7+ mean, 33.95% of calories derived from fat; 95% CI, 28.76%-39.13%; DRD4 7-mean, 28.76%; 95% CI, 26.77%-30.83%). However, girls carrying the 7-repeat allele of the same gene and living in better socioeconomic conditions have decreased fat intake compared with noncarriers (DRD4 7+ mean, 29.03% of calories derived from fat; 95% CI, 26.69%-31.51%; DRD4 7-mean, 31.88%; 95% CI, 30.28%-33.58%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alleles previously considered to be obesity risk alleles might in fact function as plasticity alleles, determining openness to environmental modification and/or intervention, as seen in the girls in this study. This finding has important implications for obesity prevention and social pediatrics.

Three different ANN model algorithms were tested [gradient descent, conjugate gradient and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)], along with four different SVR model kernels [linear, polynomial, sigmoid and Radial Basis Function (RBF)]. The reliability of the applied models was evaluated based on the statistical performance criteria of root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE). Based on RMSE values, and averaged across the three hydrometric stations, the ANN and SVR models showed, respectively, 23% and 18% improvements in forecasting and 18% and 15% improvements in estimation over traditional models. The use of the BFGS training algorithm for ANN, and the RBF kernel function for SVR models are recommended as useful options for simulating hydrological phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although the channel block mechanism has been studied extensively, polyamine permeation has been considered less significant as it occurs at extreme positive membrane potentials. Here, we show that kainate receptor (KAR) heteromerization and association with auxiliary proteins, Neto1 and Neto2, attenuate polyamine block by enhancing blocker permeation. Consequently, polyamine permeation and unblock occur at more negative and physiologically relevant membrane potentials. In GluK2/GluK5 heteromers, enhanced permeation is due to a single proline residue in GluK5 that alters the dynamics of the -helical region of the selectivity filter. The effect of auxiliary proteins is additive, and therefore the structural basis of polyamine permeation and unblock is through a different mechanism. As native receptors are thought to assemble as heteromers in complex with auxiliary proteins, our data identify an unappreciated impact of polyamine permeation in shaping the signalling properties of neuronal KARs and point to a structural mechanism that may be shared amongst other cation-selective ion channels.

Preoperative Planning in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEONS			English	Review						knee reconstruction; preoperative planning; knee templating; total knee arthroplasty; complex knee arthroplasty	FOLLOW-UP; NATURAL-HISTORY; BONY DEFECTS; DEFORMITY; FLEXION; TIBIA; HIP; COMPLICATIONS; AUGMENTATION; PATELLECTOMY	Preoperative planning is of paramount importance in primary total knee arthroplasty. A thorough preoperative analysis helps the surgeon envision the operation, anticipate any potential issues, and minimize the risk of premature implant failure. Obtaining a thorough history is critical for appropriate patient selection. The physical examination should evaluate the integrity of the soft tissues, the neurovascular status, range of motion, limb deformity, and the status of the collateral ligaments to help determine the soft-tissue balancing and constraint strategy required. Standard radiographs, with a known magnification, should be obtained for preoperative total knee arthroplasty templating. Routine standing AP, lateral, and skyline radiographs of the knee can help the surgeon plan the bone cuts and tibial slope as well as the implant size and position at the time of surgery. In certain circumstances, such as severe coronal deformities, bone deficiencies, and/or extra-articular deformities, additional measures are frequently necessary to successfully reconstruct the knee. Constrained implants, metal augments, and bone graft must be part of the surgeon's armamentarium.

Prognostic value of medulloblastoma extent of resection after accounting for molecular subgroup: a retrospective integrated clinical and molecular analysis	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							POSTERIOR-FOSSA TUMORS; CHILDRENS CANCER GROUP; RISK MEDULLOBLASTOMA; RADIATION-THERAPY; ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; PHASE-III; ONCOLOGY; CHILDHOOD; PATTERNS	Background Patients with incomplete surgical resection of medulloblastoma are controversially regarded as having a marker of high-risk disease, which leads to patients undergoing aggressive surgical resections, so-called second-look surgeries, and intensified chemoradiotherapy. All previous studies assessing the clinical importance of extent of resection have not accounted for molecular subgroup. We analysed the prognostic value of extent of resection in a subgroup-specific manner. Methods We retrospectively identified patients who had a histological diagnosis of medulloblastoma and complete data about extent of resection and survival from centres participating in the Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics International Consortium. We collected from resections done between April, 1997, and February, 2013, at 35 international institutions. We established medulloblastoma subgroup affiliation by gene expression profiling on frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. We classified extent of resection on the basis of postoperative imaging as gross total resection (no residual tumour), near-total resection (< 1.5 cm(2) tumour remaining), or sub-total resection (>= 1.5 cm(2) tumour remaining). We did multivariable analyses of overall survival and progression-free survival using the variables molecular subgroup (WNT, SHH, group 4, and group 3), age (< 3 vs >= 3 years old), metastatic status (metastases vs no metastases), geographical location of therapy (North America/Australia vs rest of the world), receipt of chemotherapy (yes vs no) and receipt of craniospinal irradiation (< 30 Gy or > 30 Gy vs no craniospinal irradiation). The primary analysis outcome was the effect of extent of resection by molecular subgroup and the effects of other clinical variables on overall and progression-free survival. Findings We included 787 patients with medulloblastoma (86 with WNT tumours, 242 with SHH tumours, 163 with group 3 tumours, and 296 with group 4 tumours) in our multivariable Cox models of progression-free and overall survival. We found that the prognostic benefit of increased extent of resection for patients with medulloblastoma is attenuated after molecular subgroup affiliation is taken into account. We identified a progression-free survival benefit for gross total resection over sub-total resection (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96, p=0.16) but no overall survival benefit (HR 1.23, 0.87-1.72, p=0.24). We saw no progression-free survival or overall survival benefit for gross total resection compared with near-total resection (HR 1.05, 0.71-1.53, p=0.8158 for progression-free survival and HR 1.14, 0.75-1.72, p=0.55 for overall survival). No significant survival benefit existed for greater extent of resection for patients with WNT, SHH, or group 3 tumours (HR 1.03, 0.67-1.58, p=0.89 for sub-total resection vs gross total resection). For patients with group 4 tumours, gross total resection conferred a benefit to progression-free survival compared with sub-total resection (HR 1.97, 1.22-3.17, p= 0.0056), especially for those with metastatic disease (HR 2.22, 1.00-4.93, p= 0.050). However, gross total resection had no effect on overall survival compared with sub-total resection in patients with group 4 tumours (HR 1.67, 0.93-2.99, p= 0.084). Interpretation The prognostic benefit of increased extent of resection for patients with medulloblastoma is attenuated after molecular subgroup affiliation is taken into account. Although maximum safe surgical resection should remain the standard of care, surgical removal of small residual portions of medulloblastoma is not recommended when the likelihood of neurological morbidity is high because there is no definitive benefit to gross total resection compared with near-total resection.

The developmental history of vocal motoneuron populations in each of these lineages remains largely unknown. The highly conserved transcription factor Paired-like Homeobox 2b (Phox2b) is presumed to be expressed in all vertebrate hindbrain branchial motoneurons, including laryngeal motoneurons essential for vocalization in humans. We used immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to examine Phox2b protein and mRNA expression in caudal hindbrain and rostral spinal cord motoneuron populations in seven species across five chordate classes. Phox2b was present in motoneurons dedicated to sound production in mice and frogs (bullfrog, African clawed frog), but not those in bird (zebra finch) or bony fish (midshipman, channel catfish). Overall, the pattern of caudal medullary motoneuron Phox2b expression was conserved across vertebrates and similar to expression in sea lamprey. These observations suggest that motoneurons dedicated to sound production in vertebrates are not derived from a single developmentally or evolutionarily conserved progenitor pool.

This study investigated the possible involvement of AM in morphine-evoked alteration in -opioid receptor-coupled G proteins. Experimental ApproachAgents were administered intrathecally (i.t.) in rats. Nociceptive behaviours and cumulative dose-response of morphine analgesia were assessed. Neurochemicals in the spinal dorsal horn were assayed by immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis and ELISA. Key ResultsIntrathecal injection of AM (8g) for 9days decreased and increased the levels of receptor-coupled Gi and Gs proteins respectively. Morphine stimulation (5g) after chronic treatment with AM also induced an increase in cAMP production in the spinal dorsal horn. Co-administration of the selective AM receptor antagonist AM(22-52) inhibited chronic morphine-evoked switch of G protein-coupled receptor from Gi to Gs. Chronic exposure to AM increased the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and ERK. Co-administration of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (5g) or MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (1g) reversed the AM-induced thermal/mechanical hypersensitivity, decline in morphine analgesic potency, switch of G protein-coupled receptor and increase in cAMP. Conclusions and ImplicationsThe present study supports the hypothesis that an increase in AM activity in the spinal dorsal horn contributes to the switch of the receptor-coupled G protein from Gi to Gs protein via the activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB and ERK signalling pathways in chronic morphine use.

New technologies have led to a rapid increase in the identification of disease-related genes with an enhanced appreciation of the key roles played by genetics in the etiology of these disorders. Importantly, pinpointing the normal function of disease gene proteins leads to new understanding of the cellular machineries and pathways that are altered in the disease process. One such emerging pathway is membrane trafficking in the endosomal system. This key cellular process controls the localization and levels of a myriad of proteins and is thus critical for normal cell function. In this review we will focus on three neurodegenerative diseases; Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and hereditary spastic paraplegias, for which a large number of newly discovered disease genes encode proteins that function in endosomal membrane trafficking. We will describe how alterations in these proteins affect endosomal function and speculate on the contributions of these disruptions to disease pathophysiology.	[Schreij, Andrea M.

Quantitative EEG from REM sleep might thus provide an earlier and more accurate marker of the development of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects than that from wakefulness. To assess the superiority of the REM sleep EEG as a screening tool for preclinical Alzheimer's disease, 22 subjects with amnestic MCI (a-MCI; 63.9 +/- 7.7 years), 10 subjects with nonamnestic MCI (na-MCI; 64.1 +/- 4.5 years) and 32 controls (63.7 +/- 6.6 years) participated in the study. Spectral analyses of the waking EEG and REM sleep EEG were performed and the [(delta + theta)/(alpha + beta)] ratio was used to assess between-group differences in EEG slowing. The a-MCI subgroup showed EEG slowing in frontal lateral regions compared to both na-MCI and control groups. This EEG slowing was present in wakefulness (compared to controls) but was much more prominent in REM sleep. Moreover, the comparison between amnestic and nonamnestic subjects was found significant only for the REM sleep EEG. There was no difference in EEG power ratio between na-MCI and controls for any of the 7 cortical regions studied. These findings demonstrate the superiority of the REM sleep EEG in the discrimination between a-MCI and both na-MCI and control subjects.

We examined a consecutive sample of 72 individuals who had undergone 32-channel paEEG immediately after an rEEG, creating perfectly matched EEG samples. Each recording was prospectively assessed for epileptiform discharges (ED) and nonepileptiform abnormalities. The median paEEG duration was 22.5 hours (interquartile range: 22.0-23.0). The sensitivity of paEEG was 2.23 times greater than that of rEEG [sensitivity ratio: 2.23 (95% CI = 1.49-3.34)] if a positive test was limited to the presence of epileptiform discharges. This benefit of paEEG versus rEEG was no longer evident if the definition of a positive test included nonepileptiform abnormalities (sensitivity ratio 1.26; 95% CI = 1.02-1.55). The specificity of the 2 tests was not evidently different (specificity ratio 0.67; 95% CI = 0.17-2.67). Twenty-six percent of paEEG recorded epileptic seizures while none of the rEEG did (absolute difference 26.0% (95% CI = 11.8-40.2). Our findings quantify the benefit of 32-channel paEEG, relative to rEEG, and support its role in the diagnosis and characterization of epilepsy.

Automatic Classification of the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex Nystagmus: Integration of Data Clustering and System Identification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification algorithm; data clustering; nystagmus; system identification; vestibulo-ocular reflex	EYE-MOVEMENTS; ALGORITHM; SACCADES; NEURONS	The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) plays an important role in our daily activities by enabling us to fixate on objects during head movements. Modeling and identification of the VOR improves our insight into the system behavior and improves diagnosis of various disorders. However, the switching nature of eye movements (nystagmus), including the VOR, makes dynamic analysis challenging. The first step in such analysis is to segment data into its subsystem responses (here slow and fast segment intervals). Misclassification of segments results in biased analysis of the system of interest. Here, we develop a novel three-step algorithm to classify the VOR data into slow and fast intervals automatically. The proposed algorithm is initialized using a K-means clustering method. The initial classification is then refined using system identification approaches and prediction error statistics. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on simulated and experimental data. It is shown that the new algorithm performance is much improved over the previous methods, in terms of higher specificity.	[Ranjbaran, Mina; Smith, Heather L.

Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck: poorer prognosis than non-head and neck sites	JOURNAL OF LARYNGOLOGY AND OTOLOGY			English	Article						Merkel Cell Carcinoma; Head And Neck Neoplasms; Survival Analysis; Skin Neoplasms; Radiotherapy	SINGLE INSTITUTION; NODE BIOPSY; POLYOMAVIRUS; SURVIVAL; MELANOMA; SKIN; P53	Background: Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neurocutaneous malignancy. This study investigated whether patients with Merkel cell carcinoma in the head and neck had poorer outcomes than patients with Merkel cell carcinoma located elsewhere. Methods: A retrospective study was performed of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma treated at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Canada, from 1993 to 2013. Associations between clinicopathological characteristics and disease-free and disease-specific survival rates were examined according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Twenty-seven patients were identified. Although basic clinicopathological characteristics and treatments were similar between head and neck and non-head and neck Merkel cell carcinoma groups, disease-free and disease-specific survival rates were significantly lower in the head and neck Merkel cell carcinoma group (log-rank test; p = 0.043 and p = 0.001, respectively). Mortality was mainly due to distant metastasis. Conclusion: Patients with head and neck Merkel cell carcinoma had poorer survival rates than patients with non-head and neck Merkel cell carcinoma in our study. The tendency to obtain close margins, a less predictable metastatic pattern, and/or intrinsic tumour factors related to the head and neck may explain this discrepancy.	[Morand, G.

We examined the sensitivity of neurons in the cutaneous, finger representation of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to a wide range of textures [1 mm high, raised-dot surfaces; spatial periods (SPs), 1.5-8.5 mm], scanned under the digit tips at different speeds (40-115 mm/s). Since subjective roughness estimates show a monotonic increase over this range and are independent of speed, we predicted that the mean firing rate of a subgroup of S1 neurons would share these properties. Single-unit recordings were made in four alert macaques (areas 3b, 1 and 2). Cells whose discharge rate showed a monotonic increase with SP, independent of speed, were particularly concentrated in area 3b. Area 2 was characterized by a high proportion of cells sensitive to speed, with or without texture sensitivity. Area 1 had intermediate properties. We suggest that area 3b and most likely area 1 play a key role in signaling roughness intensity, and that a mean rate code, signaled by both slowly and rapidly adapting neurons, is present at the level of area 3b. Finally, the substantial proportion of neurons that showed a monotonic change in discharge limited to a small range of SPs (often independent of response saturation) could play a role in discriminating smaller changes in SP.

However, epigenetic regulation has not been thoroughly studied. Our goal was to generate DNA methylation profiles of murine/human MTHFR gene regions and examine methylation in brain and liver tumors. Pyrosequencing in four murine tissues revealed minimal DNA methylation in the CpG island. Higher methylation was seen in liver or intestine in the CpG island shore 5' to the upstream translational start site or in another region 3' to the downstream start site. In the latter region, there was negative correlation between expression and methylation. Three orthologous regions were investigated in human MTHFR, as well as a fourth region between the two translation start sites. We found significantly increased methylation in three regions (not the CpG island) in pediatric astrocytomas compared with control brain, with decreased expression in tumors. Methylation in hepatic carcinomas was also increased in the three regions compared with normal liver, but the difference was significant for only one CpG. This work, the first overview of the Mthfr/MTHFR epigenetic landscape, suggests regulation through methylation in some regions, demonstrates increased methylation/decreased expression in pediatric astrocytomas, and should serve as a resource for future epigenetic studies.

However, upstream mechanisms controlling these neurons remain unknown. Noradrenergic (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus, implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, have direct connections within the VTA.

PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						necrotizing enterocolitis; neuroimmunology; sepsis; neural-immune interactions; perinatal gut; nervous control of intestinal functions; brain	PRETERM BIRTH; CHORIOAMNIONITIS; INFANTS; INJURY; OUTCOMES; SEPSIS; DEATH; MODEL; RISK	Objective: Necrotizing enterocolitis of the neonate is an acute inflammatory intestinal disease that can cause necrosis and sepsis. Chorioamnionitis is a risk factor of necrotizing enterocolitis. The gut represents the biggest vagus-innervated organ. Vagal activity can be measured via fetal heart rate variability. We hypothesized that fetal heart rate variability can detect fetuses with incipient gut inflammation. Design: Prospective animal study. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects: Chronically instrumented near-term fetal sheep (n = 21). Measurements and Main Results: Animals were surgically instrumented with vascular catheters and electrocardiogram to allow manipulation and recording from nonanesthetized animals. In 14 fetal sheep, inflammation was induced with lipopolysaccharide (IV) to mimic chorioamnionitis. Fetal arterial blood samples were drawn at selected time points over 54 hours post lipopolysaccharide for blood gas and cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha enzymelinked immunosorbent assay). Fetal heart rateV was quantified throughout the experiment. The time-matched fetal heart rate variability measures were correlated to the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Upon necropsy, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1+ (Iba1+), CD11c+ (M1), CD206+ (M2 macrophages), and occludin (leakiness marker) immunofluorescence in the terminal ileum was quantified along with regional Iba1+ signal in the brain (microglia). Interleukin-6 peaked at 3 hours post lipopolysaccharide accompanied by mild cardiovascular signs of sepsis. At 54 hours, we identified an increase in Iba1+ and, specifically, M1 macrophages in the ileum accompanied by increased leakiness, with no change in Iba1 signal in the brain. Preceding this change on tissue level, at 24 hours, a subset of nine fetal heart rate variability measures correlated exclusively to the Iba+ markers of ileal, but not brain, inflammation. An additional fetal heart rate variability measure, mean of the differences of R-R intervals, correlated uniquely to M1 ileum macrophages increasing due to lipopolysaccharide. Conclusions: We identified a unique subset of fetal heart rate variability measures reflecting 1.5 days ahead of time the levels of macrophage activation and increased leakiness in terminal ileum. We propose that such subset of fetal heart rate variability measures reflects brain-gut communication via the vagus nerve. Detecting such noninvasively obtainable organ-specific fetal heart rate variability signature of inflammation would alarm neonatologists about neonates at risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis. Clinical validation studies are required.

Canadian Neonatal Network; Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up	Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Following Bevacizumab Injections for Retinopathy of Prematurity	PEDIATRICS			English	Article							ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; INTRAVITREAL BEVACIZUMAB; MACULAR DEGENERATION; REFRACTIVE OUTCOMES; LASER TREATMENT; PLASMA-LEVELS; AGE; RANIBIZUMAB; THERAPY; MONOTHERAPY	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bevacizumab intravitreal injection, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, is used to treat retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, concerns have been raised regarding its systemic absorption and effect on developing tissues including brain. This study compared neurodevelopment at 18 months' corrected age in preterm infants of <29 weeks' gestation treated with bevacizumab versus laser ablation. METHODS: Data from the Canadian Neonatal Network and the Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up Network databases were retrospectively reviewed. Infants born at <29 weeks' in 2010-2011 with treated ROP were studied. Neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months was assessed by using neurologic examination and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition. Regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 125 treated infants, 27 received bevacizumab and 98 laser. The bevacizumab group, compared with laser, obtained a median Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition motor composite score of 81 (interquartile range, 70-91) versus 88 (79-97), a language composite score of 79 (65-97) versus 89 (74-97), and a cognitive score of 90 (80-100) versus 90 (85-100). Difference was detected on the motor score only (P=.02). Odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities (Bayley scores <70, severe cerebral palsy, hearing aids, or bilateral blindness) was 3.1 times higher (95% confidence interval: 1.2-8.4) in infants treated with bevacizumab versus laser after adjusting for gestational age, gender, maternal education, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology-II score, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, and severe brain injury. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants treated with bevacizumab versus laser had higher odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities. Further investigation on the long-term safety of antivascular endothelial growth factor treatment of ROP is needed.

Prevalence of autoimmune disease in patients with prolactinomas and non-functioning pituitary adenomas	PITUITARY			English	Article						Autoimmune disease; Autoimmunity; Prolactinoma; Hyperprolactinemia; Prolactin	SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; SERUM PROLACTIN; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ADDISONS-DISEASE; HASHIMOTOS-THYROIDITIS; PSORIATIC-ARTHRITIS; ELEVATED PROLACTIN; PRL LEVELS; IN-VIVO	Prolactin can affect autoimmune response and evidence suggests that hyperprolactinemia can primarily precipitate autoimmunity. We postulate that patients with prolactinomas are more prone to autoimmune disease (AID). We conducted a retrospective case-control study comparing prevalence of AID in 100 prolactinoma patients (PRL-P, cases) and 100 age- and gender-matched non-functioning pituitary adenoma patients (NFPA-P, controls) assessed at the Neuroendocrine Clinics of the McGill University Health Centre between January 2005 and December 2014. Comparisons were done using a conditional logistic regression (CLR) analysis. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data values. Sixty-eight women and 32 men were in each group. Median age was 37 years for PRL-P and 46 years for NFPA-P. AID was diagnosed in 28/100 cases and 16/100 controls. Autoimmune thyroid disease was the most common AID reported in both groups, representing 70 and 61 % of the AID diagnoses respectively. CLR analysis revealed a multiplicative interaction effect between AID prevalence and age (p 0.004). Odds ratios for AID in PRL-P compared to NFPA-P increase with age and become significant at age 43, reaching 4.17 (95 % CI 1.26, 13.82) at age 45 and 8.09 (95 % CI 1.96, 33.43) at age 50 (p 0.05). Our data showed a higher prevalence of AID in both PRL-P and NFPA-P than in a reference population. In both groups, prevalence of AID increased with age, given a multiplicative interaction effect. A significant higher prevalence of autoimmunity in PRL-P compared with NFPA-P occurs after age 43. These associations may have significant implications for the management of prolactinoma patients.

Streamlined Hyperacute Magnetic Resonance Imaging Protocol Identifies Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator-Eligible Stroke Patients When Clinical Impression Is Stroke Mimic	STROKE			English	Article						magnetic resonance imaging; stroke; thrombolytic; therapy; tissue-type plasminogen activator	DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MR; THROMBOLYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; EMERGENCY; ACCURACY; TRIALS; TIMES	Background and Purpose Stroke mimics (SM) challenge the initial assessment of patients presenting with possible acute ischemic stroke (AIS). When SM is considered likely, intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) may be withheld, risking an opportunity to treat AIS. Although computed tomography is routinely used for tPA decision making, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may diagnose AIS when SM is favored but not certain. We hypothesized that a hyperacute MRI (hMRI) protocol would identify tPA-eligible AIS patients among those initially favored to have SM. Methods A streamlined hMRI protocol was designed based on barriers to rapid patient transport, MRI acquisition, and post-MRI tPA delivery. Neurologists were trained to order hMRI when SM was favored and tPA was being withheld. The use of hMRI for tPA decision making, door-to-needle times, and outcomes were compared before hMRI implementation (pre-hMRI: August 1, 2011 to July 31, 2013) and after (post-hMRI, August 1, 2013, to January 15, 2015). Results Post hMRI, 57 patients with suspected SM underwent hMRI (median MRI-order-to-start time, 29 minutes), of whom, 11 (19%) were diagnosed with AIS and 7 (12%) received tPA. Pre-hMRI, no tPA-treated patients were screened with hMRI. Post hMRI, 7 of 106 (6.6%) tPA-treated patients underwent hMRI to aid in decision making because of suspected SM (0% versus 6.6%; P=0.001). To ensure standard care was maintained after implementing the hMRI protocol, pre- versus post-hMRI tPA-treated cohorts were compared and did not differ: door-to-needle time (39 versus 37 minutes; P=0.63), symptomatic hemorrhage rate (4.5% versus 1.9%; P=0.32), and favorable discharge location (85% versus 89%; P=0.37). Conclusions A streamlined hMRI protocol permitted tPA administration to a small, but significant, subset of AIS patients initially considered to have SM.

J	Raikhel, E; Bemme, D				Raikhel, Eugene; Bemme, Doerte			Postsocialism, the psy-ences and mental health	TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Eastern Europe; Eurasia; mental health; postsocialism; psychiatry; psychology	PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE; COLD-WAR; RUSSIA; POLITICS; SELF; CARE; GOVERNMENTALITY; PSYCHOTHERAPY; TECHNOLOGIES; TRANSITION	Over the past decades, the formerly socialist countries of East Central Europe and Eurasia have experienced a range of transformations which bear directly upon the domains of mental health, psychiatry, and psychology. In particular, the disciplines and professions concerned with the human mind, brain, and behavior (the psy-ences) were strongly affected by sociopolitical changes spanning the state-socialist and postsocialist periods. These disciplines' relationship to the state, their modes of knowledge production, and the epistemic order and subjectivities they contributed to have all undergone dramatic ruptures. In this essay, we trace the literature on these issues across three thematic domains: (a) history and memory; (b) the reform of psychiatry in an era of global mental health; and (c) therapy and self-fashioning. We argue for a closer articulation between the social science and historical literature on socialism and its posts and the literature among anthropologists, sociologists, and historians on the sciences of the mind and brain, and we suggest that each of these literatures helps to critically open up and enrich the other.

In this study, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to manipulate right cerebellar function, while subjects adapt to a visuomotor task. We investigated the effect of this manipulation on the internal forward and inverse models by measuring two kinds of behavior: generalization of training in one direction to neighboring directions (as a proxy for inverse models) and localization of the hand position after movement without visual feedback (as a proxy for forward model). The experimental results showed no effect of cerebellar tDCS on generalization, but significant effect on localization. These observations support the idea that the cerebellum is a possible brain region for internal forward, but not inverse model formation. We also used a realistic human head model to calculate current density distribution in the brain. The result of this model confirmed the passage of current through the cerebellum. Moreover, to further explain some observed experimental results, we modeled the visuomotor adaptation process with the help of a biologically inspired method known as population coding. The effect of tDCS was also incorporated in the model. The results of this modeling study closely match our experimental data and provide further evidence in line with the idea that tDCS manipulates FM's function in the cerebellum.

Precisely, functional changes of the lumbar multifidus muscles (MF) involved in spine stability may be of special interest in rehabilitation. Therefore, we tested MF corticomotor control using double transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms for the first time in this muscle and examined its link with MF volitional activation. Eleven individuals with lateralized CLBP and 13 pain-free participants were recruited. Ultrasound imaging enabled measurement of MF volitional isometric contraction in prone lying. TMS of MF M1 area was used to test hemispheric excitability and mechanisms in relation to motor programming, i.e., active motor threshold (AMT), amplitude of motor-evoked potentials and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (SICF). In CLBP, SICI level was lower in the left hemisphere and MF volitional contraction was not related to AMT (M1 excitability), conversely to what was observed in the pain-free group. No other between-group difference was detected. These original findings support a plasticity of cortical maps controlling paravertebral muscles and likely including a different motor strategy for the control of MF. Changes of M1 function may thus underlie impaired motor control of lumbopelvic spine and pain persistence in CLBP.

Here, we investigated this phenomenon in the thermal modality using multi-seconds (19 s) innocuous cool stimuli that were either constant (continuous interval) or fluctuating to create three discrete sensory events (segmented interval). Moreover, we introduced a delay following stimulus offset, before the reproduction phase, to allow for a direct comparison with our recent study showing an underestimation of duration in a delayed reproduction task of heat pain sensations (Khoshnejad et al. in Pain 155:581-590, 2014. doi: 10.1016/j.pain.2013.12.015). The event-filling effect was tested by comparing the delayed reproduction of the segmented and the continuous stimuli in experimental conditions asking participants to (1) reproduce the dynamics of the sensation (i.e., changes in sensory intensity over time) or (2) reproduce only the interval duration (i.e., sensation onset-to-offset). A perceptual (control) condition required participants to report changes in sensation concurrently with the stimulus. Results of the dynamic task confirmed the underestimation of duration in the delayed reproduction task, but this effect was only found with the continuous and not with the segmented stimulus. This implies that the dilation of duration produced by segmentation might compensate for the underestimation of duration in this delayed reproduction task. However, this temporal dilation effect was only observed when participants were required to attend and reproduce the dynamics of sensation. These results suggest that the event-filling effect can be observed in the thermal sensory modality and that attention directed toward changes in sensory intensity might contribute to this effect.

Assessment of Cognitive Outcome Measures in Teenagers with 15q13.3 Microdeletion Syndrome	JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Neuropsychiatric disease; Autism; Intellectual disability; Cognitive tests; Cognitive function	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; CHILDREN; INTELLIGENCE; PERFORMANCE; VALIDITY; ADHD	15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome causes a spectrum of cognitive disorders, including intellectual disability and autism. We aimed to determine if any or all of three cognitive testing systems (the KiTAP, CogState, and Stanford-Binet) are suitable for assessment of cognitive function in affected individuals. These three tests were administered to ten individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (14-18 years of age), and the results were analyzed to determine feasibility of use, potential for improvement, and internal consistency. It was determined that the KiTAP, CogState, and Stanford-Binet are valid tests of cognitive function in 15q13.3 microdeletion patients. Therefore, these tests may be considered for use as objective outcome measures in future clinical trials, assessing change in cognitive function over a period of pharmacological treatment.

Studies analyzing the influence of expressive timing on listeners' affective responses have been constrained by the fact that, in most pieces, the notated durations limit performers' interpretive freedom. To circumvent this issue, we focused on the unmeasured prelude, a semi-improvisatory genre without notated durations. In Experiment 1, 12 professional harpsichordists recorded an unmeasured prelude on a harpsichord equipped with a MIDI console. Melodic expectation was assessed using a probabilistic model (IDyOM [Information Dynamics of Music]) whose expectations have been previously shown to match closely those of human listeners. Performance timing information was extracted from the MIDI data using a score-performance matching algorithm. Time-series analyses showed that, in a piece with unspecified note durations, the predictability of melodic structure measurably influenced tempo fluctuations in performance. In Experiment 2, another 10 harpsichordists, 20 nonharpsichordist musicians, and 20 nonmusicians listened to the recordings from Experiment 1 and rated the perceived tension continuously. Granger causality analyses were conducted to investigate predictive relations among melodic expectation, expressive timing, and perceived tension. Although melodic expectation, as modeled by IDyOM, modestly predicted perceived tension for all participant groups, neither of its components, information content or entropy, was Granger causal. In contrast, expressive timing was a strong predictor and was Granger causal. However, because melodic expectation was also predictive of expressive timing, our results outline a complete chain of influence from predictability of melodic structure via expressive performance timing to perceived musical tension.

GABA(B) receptor cell-surface export is controlled by an endoplasmic reticulum gatekeeper	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; SECRETORY PATHWAY; DOPAMINE NEURONS; SUBCELLULAR-DISTRIBUTION; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; EXPRESSION PROFILE; TURNING BEHAVIOR; BACLOFEN BLOCKS; DOMAIN FAMILY	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) release and cell-surface export of many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are tightly regulated. For gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(B) receptors of GABA, the major mammalian inhibitory neurotransmitter, the ligand-binding GB1 subunit is maintained in the ER by unknown mechanisms in the absence of hetero-dimerization with the GB2 subunit. We report that GB1 retention is regulated by a specific gatekeeper, PRAF2. This ER resident transmembrane protein binds to GB1, preventing its progression in the biosynthetic pathway. GB1 release occurs upon competitive displacement from PRAF2 by GB2. PRAF2 concentration, relative to that of GB1 and GB2, tightly controls cell-surface receptor density and controls GABA(B) function in neurons. Experimental perturbation of PRAF2 levels in vivo caused marked hyperactivity disorders in mice. These data reveal an unanticipated major impact of specific ER gatekeepers on GPCR function and identify PRAF2 as a new molecular target with therapeutic potential for psychiatric and neurological diseases involving GABAB function.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein is differentially expressed across cortical and subcortical regions in healthy brains and downregulated in the thalamus and caudate nucleus of depressed suicides	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MAJOR DEPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; HETEROGENEITY; ASTROCYTES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISTINGUISHES; MEN	There is mounting evidence to suggest aberrant astrocytic function in depression and suicide. Independent studies have reported astrocytic abnormalities in certain brain regions, but it remains unclear whether this is a brain-wide phenomenon. The present study examined this question by measuring glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in postmortem brain samples from suicide completers and matched non-psychiatric controls. Suicide completers were selected based on their recent characterization as low GFAP expressors in the prefrontal cortex, (Brodmann areas 8/9 and 10). Real-time PCR and immunoblotting were used to measure GFAP gene expression and protein levels in BA4 (primary motor cortex), BA17 (primary visual cortex), cerebellar cortex, mediodorsal thalamus and caudate nucleus. We found downregulation of GFAP mRNA and protein in the mediodorsal thalamus and caudate nucleus of depressed suicides compared with controls, whereas GFAP expression in other brain regions was similar between groups. Furthermore, a regional comparison including all samples revealed that GFAP expression in both subcortical regions was, on average, between 11- and 15-fold greater than in cerebellum and neocortex. Examining astrocyte morphology by immunohistochemistry showed that astrocytes in both thalamus and caudate displayed larger cell bodies and extended more ramified processes across larger domains than the previously described cortical astrocytes. This study reveals that astrocytic abnormalities are not brain wide and suggests that they are restricted to cortical and subcortical networks known to be affected in mood disorders. Additionally, our results show a greater diversity in human astrocytic phenotypes than previously thought.	[Torres-Platas, S.

Their roles extend into adulthood, when ephrin-Eph signalling regulates neuronal plasticity, homeostatic events and disease processes. Recently, new insights have been gained into the mechanisms of ephrin-Eph signalling in different cell types, and into the physiological importance of ephrin-Eph in different organs and in disease, raising questions for future research directions.

We recruited a family with five affected individuals presenting with adult-onset predominant cerebellar ataxia with mild spasticity. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed one novel and one previously reported compound heterozygous variants in GALC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of typical Krabbe features. Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of adult-onset Krabbe disease and demonstrate the usefulness of combining WES and pattern-specific MRI for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

When LUTS are suggestive of BOO secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia, a surgical treatment can sometimes be consider. Even if multichannel urodynamic study (UDS) is currently the gold standard to properly assess LUTS, its use in non-neurogenic men is still a matter of controversy. Here, we aim to explore the evidence supporting or not the use of systematic multichannel UDS before considering an invasive treatment in men LUTS. The debate was presented with a "pro and con" structure. The "pro" side supported the systematic use of a multichannel UDS before considering a surgical treatment in men LUTS. The "con" side successively refuted the "pro" side arguments. The "pro" side mainly based their argumentation on the poor correlation of LUTS and office-based tests with BOO or DUA. Furthermore, since a multichannel UDS could allow selecting men that will most benefit of a surgical procedure, they hypothesized that such an approach could reduce the overall morbidity rate and cost associated with. The "con" side considered that, in most cases, medical history and symptoms were reliable enough to consider surgery. Finally, they underlined the UDS limitations and the frequent lack of alternative to surgery in this context. Randomized clinical trials are being conducted to compare these two approaches. Their results would help the urological community to override this debate.

Using a longitudinal prospective design, this study aimed to evaluate the contribution of injury and non-injury related risk and resilience factors to longitudinal outcome and recovery of social problems from 12- to 24-months post-TBI. 78 children with TBI (injury age: 5.0-15.0 years) and 40 age and gender-matched typically developing (TD) children underwent magnetic resonance imaging including a susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence 2-8 weeks post-injury (M = 39.25, SD = 27.64 days). At 12 and 24-months post-injury, parents completed questionnaires rating their child's social functioning, and environmental factors including socioeconomic status, caregiver mental health and family functioning. Results revealed that longitudinal recovery profiles differed as a function of injury severity, such that among children with severe TBI, social problems significantly increased from 12- to 24-months post injury, and were found to be significantly worse than TD controls and children with mild and moderate TBI. In contrast, children with mild and moderate injuries showed few problems at 12-months post-injury and little change over time. Pre-injury environment and SWI did not significantly contribute to outcome at 24-months, however concurrent caregiver mental health and family functioning explained a large and significant proportion of variance in these outcomes. Overall, this study shows that longitudinal recovery profiles differ as a function of injury severity, with evidence for late-emerging social problems among children with severe TBI. Poorer long-term social outcomes were associated with family dysfunction and poorer caregiver mental health at 24-months post injury, suggesting that efforts to optimize the child's environment and bolster family coping resources may enhance recovery of social problems following pediatric TBI.

This study investigated whether blocking angiogenesis prevents the development of seizures and hippocampal atrophy in the pilocarpine rat model of MTLE. To block angiogenesis, a subset of animals were given sunitinib orally. Continuous video recordings were performed to identify seizures. Brains were then extracted and sectioned, and hippocampal surfaces and angiogenesis were assessed. After a latent period of 6.6 +/- 2.6 days, the sham-treated pilocarpine rats presented convulsive seizures, while the pilocarpine rats treated with sunitinib did not develop seizures. Sham-treated pilocarpine rats but not sunitinib-treated pilocarpine rats had significantly smaller hippocampi. Endothelial cell counts in sham-treated pilocarpine rats were significantly greater than in controls and sunitinib-treated pilocarpine rats. Blocking angiogenesis immediately following the initial insult in this animal model prevented thus angiogenesis and hippocampal atrophy and averted the development of clinical seizures.

Following migration, people must navigate and adapt to a new sociocultural environment. Whether RSA affects this psychological acculturation process is unknown. This longitudinal study investigated whether resting RSA on arrival in the receiving country was related to changes in cultural orientations toward both mainstream and heritage cultural groups during the first 5 months following migration. Sixty new international students provided information on their cultural orientations toward the mainstream and heritage cultural groups shortly after arrival in the new country and 2 and 5 months after the first assessment. Results indicated that both heritage and mainstream orientations increased linearly over time. Furthermore, greater resting RSA at baseline was prospectively associated with larger increases in positive orientation toward the mainstream culture but not the heritage culture, over and above individual differences in extraversion, depression, and anxiety. These data provide longitudinal evidence that higher RSA promotes an approach-oriented stance toward a novel cultural environment.

Cognitive functioning and deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) in major psychiatric disorders: A systematic review	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Review						Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS); H-coil; Cognition; Major depressive disorder; Schizophrenia; Systematic review	TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; SHAM-CONTROLLED TRIALS; DOUBLE-BLIND; H-COIL; ADD-ON; BIPOLAR DEPRESSION; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; BRAIN-REGIONS; RTMS; METAANALYSIS	Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method mostly utilised in the treatment of major depression. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the literature on the cognitive effects of DTMS applied with the H-coil system in major psychiatric disorders. Following a literature search in Psyclnfo and PubMed (any time to December 2015), 13 out of 32 studies on DTMS and cognitive functioning were included in the current review. Three studies included 38 healthy participants, eight studies included 158 unipolar or bipolar depression patients and two studies included 45 schizophrenia patients. Low-frequency DTMS (1-3 sessions) had little effect on cognitive functioning in healthy participants. The most consistent cognitive and clinical improvements were reported in the short-term (after 20 daily sessions of high-frequency DTMS with H1-coil) in studies with major depression patients. There was also a trend towards a short-term cognitive and clinical improvement in studies with schizophrenia patients. High-frequency DTMS might improve cognitive functioning and alleviate clinical symptoms in the short-term, particularly in major depression. However, this conclusion is based on data from mostly uncontrolled, open-label studies with patients receiving concurrent antidepressants or antipsychotics. Randomised, sham-controlled trials are needed to investigate the magnitude of the cognitive outcomes of DIMS in the short-term and beyond the daily stimulation phase in major psychiatric disorders.

RADIANCE Study Grp	Safety and efficacy of the selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RADIANCE): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial	LANCET NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ORAL FINGOLIMOD; PONESIMOD; AGONISTS; MS	Background Modulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors in a non-selective manner decreases disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis but has potential safety concerns. We assessed the safety and efficacy of the oral selective S1P receptor modulator ozanimod in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Methods RADIANCE is a combined phase 2/3 trial. Patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis were recruited from 55 academic and private multiple sclerosis clinics in 13 countries across Europe and the USA. Eligible participants were aged 18-55 years, had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-5.0, and had either one or more relapses in the previous 12 months, or one or more relapses in the past 24 months and one or more gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI in the previous 12 months before screening. Participants were assigned by a computer-generated randomisation sequence in a 1:1:1 ratio to ozanimod (0.5 mg or 1 mg) or matching placebo once daily for 24 weeks by an independent, unmasked, statistical team. Trial participants, study site personnel, MRI assessors, steering committee members, and the study statistician were masked to treatment assignment. To attenuate first-dose cardiac effects, ozanimod was up-titrated from 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg or 1 mg over 8 days. The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of total gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions measured by an independent MRI analysis centre at weeks 12-24 after treatment initiation. Analysis was by intention to treat. Here, we report results from the 24-week phase 2 trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01628393. The 2-year phase 3 trial is ongoing. Findings The first patient was randomised on Oct 18, 2012, and the final visit of the last randomised patient was on May 11, 2014. The intention-to-treat and safety population consisted of 258 participants, 88 were assigned placebo, 87 ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 83 ozanimod 1 mg; 252 (98%) patients completed the assigned treatment. The mean cumulative number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12-24 was 11.1 (SD 29.9) with placebo compared with 1.5 (3.7) with ozanimod 0.5 mg (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.08-0.30; p<0.0001) and 1.5 (3.4) with ozanimod 1 mg (odds ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.06-0.21; p<0.0001). Three serious adverse events unrelated to treatment were reported in patients assigned ozanimod 0.5 mg: optic neuritis, somatoform autonomic dysfunction, and cervical squamous metaplasia (HPV-related). No serious infectious or cardiac adverse events were reported, and no cases of macular oedema arose. The most common adverse events in the ozanimod 0.5 mg and 1 mg groups compared with placebo were nasopharyngitis (11 and five vs 12), headache (five and three vs eight), and urinary-tract infections (six and two vs two). The maximum reduction in mean heart rate by Holter monitoring during the first 6 h in ozanimod-treated participants was less than 2 beats per min (bpm) compared with baseline, with no patient having a minimum hourly heart rate less than 45 bpm. Electrocardiograms and 24-h Holter monitoring showed no increased incidence of atrioventricular block or sinus pause with ozanimod. Interpretation Ozanimod significantly reduced MRI lesion activity in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis, with a favourable safety profile over a period of 24 weeks. These findings warrant phase 3 trials, which are ongoing.

Cortical and subcortical gray matter regional volumes were calculated from 331 healthy adults (range: 19-79 years). Multivariate analyses identified a covariance pattern of brain volumes best predicting CA (R-2 = 47%). Individual expression of this brain pattern served as a physiologic measure of brain age (BA). The difference between CA and BA was predicted by education and self-report measures of physical activity. Education and the daily number of flights of stairs climbed (FOSC) were the only 2 significant predictors of decreased BA. Effect sizes demonstrated that BA decreased by 0.95 years for each year of education and by 0.58 years for 1 additional FOSC daily. Effects of education and FOSC on regional brain volume were largely driven by temporal and subcortical volumes. These results demonstrate that higher levels of education and daily FOSC are related to larger brain volume than predicted by CA which supports the utility of regional gray matter volume as a biomarker of healthy brain aging.

Use of hippocampal volume in prior studies was based on the notion that limbic circuit degeneration is an early manifestation of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathophysiology. To clarify these interactions early in the AD process, we tested the effects of amyloid and baseline normalized hippocampal volume on longitudinal brain atrophy rates in a group of cognitively normal individuals. Results showed that the combination of elevated beta-amyloid and baseline hippocampal atrophy is associated with increased rates specific to the limbic circuit and splenium. Importantly, this atrophy pattern emerged from a voxelwise analysis, corroborated by regression models over region of interests in native space. The results are broadly consistent with previous studies of the effects of amyloid and baseline hippocampal atrophy in normals, while pointing to accelerated atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions detectable at the preclinical stage.

An ensemble of dynamic neural network identifiers for fault detection and isolation of gas turbine engines	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Ensemble learning; Fault detection and isolation; System identification; Dynamic neural networks; Gas turbine engines	NONLINEAR-SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; FUSION	In this paper, a new approach for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) of gas turbine engines is proposed by developing an ensemble of dynamic neural network identifiers. For health monitoring of the gas turbine engine, its dynamics is first identified by constructing three separate or individual dynamic neural network architectures. Specifically, a dynamic multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a dynamic radial-basis function (RBF) neural network, and a dynamic support vector machine (SVM) are trained to individually identify and represent the gas turbine engine dynamics. Next, three ensemble-based techniques are developed to represent the gas turbine engine dynamics, namely, two heterogeneous ensemble models and one homogeneous ensemble model. It is first shown that all ensemble approaches do significantly improve the overall performance and accuracy of the developed system identification scheme when compared to each of the stand-alone solutions. The best selected stand-alone model (i.e., the dynamic RBF network) and the best selected ensemble architecture (i.e., the heterogeneous ensemble) in terms of their performances in achieving an accurate system identification are then selected for solving the FDI task. The required residual signals are generated by using both a single model-based solution and an ensemble-based solution under various gas turbine engine health conditions. Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the fault detection and isolation task achieved by using the residuals that are obtained from the dynamic ensemble scheme results in a significantly more accurate and reliable performance as illustrated through detailed quantitative confusion matrix analysis and comparative studies.

Cognitive inhibition in depression and suicidal behavior: a neuroimaging study	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Cognitive inhibition; depression; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Go; No-Go test; suicide	GO/NO-GO TASKS; IMPAIRED DECISION-MAKING; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERROR-DETECTION; ATTEMPTERS; FMRI; METAANALYSIS; DYSFUNCTION; ATTENTION	Background Cognitive inhibition deficits have previously been found in suicide attempters. This study examined the neural basis for these deficits in depressed patients with and without a history of suicidal behavior. Method Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure brain activation during the Go/No-Go response inhibition task in 25 unmedicated and depressed middle-aged suicide attempters, 22 unmedicated depressed patient controls with no personal or family history of suicidal behavior, and 27 healthy controls. Whole-brain analyses were conducted with SPM12. Results Suicide attempters exhibited an elevated number of commission errors relative to both control groups. However, suicide attempters did not differ from patient controls in terms of brain activation for any contrast. Analyses showed a significant association between depression and brain activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and medial thalamus during Go v. No-Go, and in the bilateral parietal cortex and left orbitofrontal cortex during No-Go v. baseline. These regions were correlated with psychological pain, suicidal ideation and global functioning. There was no association between brain activation and personal histories of suicidal act. Conclusions Our study suggests that deficits in cognitive inhibition, in relation to the inferior frontal gyrus, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and parietal cortex, are related to the depressive state and not specifically to suicide vulnerability.

This study aims to compare the regional and global brain volume patterns associated with gait performances assessed with Timed Up and Go test (TUG) between cognitively healthy individuals (CHI) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Material and methods: A total of 171 (80 CHI, 25 with amnestic MCI [a-MCI] and 66 with non-amnestic MCI [na-MCI]) participants (70.2 +/- 4.0 years; 37% female) consecutively realized (rTUG) and imagined (iTUG) the TUG. rTUG measures the time needed to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around and return to a seated position and iTUG represents the validated imagined version of the TUG. Global and regional brain volumes were quantified from three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI using a semi-automated software. Results: Linear regression models show that increased rTUG (i.e. worse performance) was associated with lower total white matter, total gray matter, left and right hippocampal volume in patients with na-MCI (P < 0.045), and with lower right hippocampal volume in CHI (P=0.013). Increased iTUG was associated with lower gray matter and left premotor cortex volumes in patients with na-MCI (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings showed different patterns of brain volume reduction associated with increased rTUG and iTUG between CHI and MCI patients, except for the right hippocampal volume which was smaller in both groups.

Interleukin-27 (IL-27), a pleiotropic cytokine, has been shown to dampen the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but it is still unresolved whether IL-27 plays a role in the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS). IL-27 contribution to local modulation of immune responses in the brain of MS patients was investigated. The expression of IL-27 subunits (EBI3 and p28) and its cognate receptor IL-27R (the gp130 and TCCR chains) was elevated within post-mortem MS brain lesions compared with normal control brains. Moreover, astrocytes (GFAP(+) cells) as well as microglia and macrophages (Iba1(+) cells) were important sources of IL-27. Brain-infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressed the IL-27R specific chain (TCCR) implying that these cells could respond to local IL-27 sources. In primary cultures of human astrocytes inflammatory cytokines increased IL-27 production, whereas myeloid cell inflammatory M1 polarization and inflammatory cytokines enhanced IL-27 expression in microglia and macrophages. Astrocytes in postmortem tissues and in vitro expressed IL-27R. Moreover, IL-27 triggered the phosphorylation of the transcription regulator STAT1, but not STAT3 in human astrocytes; indeed IL-27 up-regulated MHC class I expression on astrocytes in a STAT1-dependent manner. These findings demonstrated that IL-27 and its receptor were elevated in MS lesions and that local IL-27 can modulate immune properties of astrocytes and infiltrating immune cells. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting IL-27 may influence not only peripheral but also local inflammatory responses within the brain of MS patients.

Small increases in power performance are now financially attractive to owners. For this reason, the need for more accurate evaluations of wind turbine power curves is increasing. New investigations are underway with the main objective of improving the precision of power curve modeling. Due to the non-linear relationship between the power output of a turbine and its primary and derived parameters, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has proven to be well suited for power curve modelling. It has been shown that a multi-stage modelling techniques using multilayer perceptron with two layers of neurons was able to reduce the level of both the absolute and random error in comparison with IEC methods and other newly developed modelling techniques. This newly developed ANN modeling technique also demonstrated its ability to simultaneously handle more than two parameters. Wind turbine power curves with six parameters have been modelled successfully. The choice of the six parameters is crucial and has been selected amongst more than fifty parameters tested in term of variability in differences between observed and predicted power output. Further input parameters could be added as needed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex Responses to Repeated Social Evaluative Feedback in Young Women with and without a History of Depression	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						social evaluation; social rejection; dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; major depressive disorder; vulnerability; resilience	MAJOR DEPRESSION; POSITIVE EMOTIONS; REJECTION; PUNISHMENT; EXCLUSION; REWARD; RESILIENCE; DISORDER; STRESS; STATE	The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is recruited when a person is socially rejected or negatively evaluated. However, it remains to be fully understood how this region responds to repeated exposure to personally-relevant social evaluation, in both healthy populations and those vulnerable to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), as well as how responding in these regions is associated with subsequent clinical functioning. To address this gap in the literature, we recruited 17 young women with past history of MDD (previously depressed) and 31 healthy controls and exposed them to a social evaluative session in a neuroimaging environment. In two bouts, participants received an equal amount of positive, negative, and neutral feedback from a confederate. All participants reported increases in feelings of social evaluation in response to the evaluative task. However, compared to healthy controls, previously depressed participants tended to show greater increases in depressed mood following the task. At the neural level, in response to negative (vs. positive) feedback, no main effect of group or evaluation periods was observed. However, a significant interaction between group and evaluation periods was found. Specifically, over the two bouts of evaluation, activity in the dACC decreased among healthy participants while it increased among previously depressed individuals. Interestingly and unexpectedly, in the previously depressed group specifically, this increased activity in dACC over time was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms at baseline and at 6-months following the evaluation session (controlling for baseline levels). Thus, the subset of previously depressed participants who showed increases in the recruitment of the dACC over time in response to the negative evaluation seemed to fair better emotionally. These findings suggest that examining how the dACC responds to repeated bouts of negative evaluation reveals a new dimension to the role of the dACC in processing exclusion and contributing to mental health outcomes in a population vulnerable to MDD. Further, investigation of the dynamics of the dACC response to negative social evaluation is warranted.

In the embryo, glycine and GABA are depolarizing due the immature chloride gradient, which is only reversed to become hyperpolarizing later in post-natal development. We previously showed that glycine regulates neurogenesis via paracrine signaling that promotes calcium transients in neural stem cells (NSCs) and their differentiation into interneurons within the spinal cord of the zebrafish embryo. However, the subjacent molecular mechanisms are not yet understood. Our previous work suggests that early neuronal progenitors were not differentiating correctly in the developing spinal cord. As a result, we aimed at identifying the downstream molecular mechanisms involved specifically in NSCs during glycine-dependent embryonic neurogenesis. Using a gfap:GFP transgenic line, we successfully purified NSCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from whole zebrafish embryos and in embryos in which the glycine receptor was knocked down. The strength of this approach is that it focused on the NSC population while tackling the biological issue in an in vivo context in whole zebrafish embryos. After sequencing the transcriptome by RNA-sequencing, we analyzed the genes whose expression was changed upon disruption of glycine signaling and we confirmed the differential expression by independent RTqPCR assay. While over a thousand genes showed altered expression levels, through pathway analysis we identified 14 top candidate genes belonging to five different canonical signaling pathways (signaling by calcium, TGF-beta, sonic hedgehog. Wnt, and p53-related apoptosis) that are likely to mediate the promotion of neurogenesis by glycine.

In recent years, many potential lead structures have been suggested that can potentially be used for diagnosis and therapy. However, the mode of action of these compounds is so far not understood. Among these small molecules, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac sulfide received a lot of attention. In this manuscript, we characterize the interaction between the monomeric A beta peptide and the NSAID sulindac sulfide. We find that sulindac sulfide efficiently depletes the pool of toxic oligomers by enhancing the rate of fibril formation. In vitro, sulindac sulfide forms colloidal particles which catalyze the formation of fibrils. Aggregation is immediate, presumably by perturbing the supersaturated A beta solution. We find that sulindac sulfide induced A beta aggregates are structurally homogeneous. The C-terminal part of the peptide adopts a beta-sheet structure, whereas the N-tetminus is disordered. The salt bridge between D23 and K28 is present, similar as in wild type fibril structures. C-13-F-19 transferred echo double resonance experiments suggest that sulindac sulfide colocalizes with the A beta peptide in the aggregate.

Using Ptch1(+/-) mice to study medulloblastoma progression, we found that Ptch1 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is an early event that is associated with high levels of cell senescence in preneoplasia. In contrast, advanced tumors have evaded senescence. Remarkably, we discovered that the majority of advanced medulloblastomas display either spontaneous, somatic p53 mutations or Cdkn2a locus inactivation. Consistent with senescence evasion, these p53 mutations are always subsequent to Ptch1 LOH. Introduction of a p53 mutation prevents senescence, accelerates tumor formation, and increases medulloblastoma incidence. Altogether, our results show that evasion of senescence associated with Ptch1 LOH allows progression to advanced tumors.

Vestibular Compensation in Unilateral Patients Often Causes Both Gain and Time Constant Asymmetries in the VOR	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						vestibulo-ocular reflex; vestibular compensation; commissural neuron circuitry; unilateral vestibular lesion; plasticity	VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; OCULAR REFLEX; MECHANISMS; ADAPTATION; FREQUENCY; ROTATIONS; DYNAMICS; DAMAGE	The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is essential in our daily life to stabilize retinal images during head movements. Balanced vestibular functionality secures optimal reflex performance which otherwise can be distorted by peripheral vestibular lesions. Luckily, vestibular compensation in different neuronal sites restores VOR function to some extent over time. Studying vestibular compensation gives insight into the possible mechanisms for plasticity in the brain. In this work, novel experimental analysis tools are employed to reevaluate the VOR characteristics following unilateral vestibular lesions and compensation. Our results suggest that following vestibular lesions, asymmetric performance of the VOR is not only limited to its gain. Vestibular compensation also causes asymmetric dynamics, i.e., different time constants for the VOR during leftward or rightward passive head rotation. Potential mechanisms for these experimental observations are provided using simulation studies.

Inability to suppress salient distractors predicts low visual working memory capacity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						suppression; attention; working memory; event-related potentials; distractor positivity	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE; STROOP INTERFERENCE; SECONDARY MEMORY; REACTION-TIME; SEARCH; OBJECTS; INTELLIGENCE	According to contemporary accounts of visual working memory (vWM), the ability to efficiently filter relevant from irrelevant information contributes to an individual's overall vWM capacity. Although there is mounting evidence for this hypothesis, very little is known about the precise filtering mechanism responsible for controlling access to vWM and for differentiating low- and high-capacity individuals. Theoretically, the inefficient filtering observed in low-capacity individuals might be specifically linked to problems enhancing relevant items, suppressing irrelevant items, or both. To find out, we recorded neurophysiological activity associated with attentional selection and active suppression during a competitive visual search task. We show that high-capacity individuals actively suppress salient distractors, whereas low-capacity individuals are unable to suppress salient distractors in time to prevent those items from capturing attention. These results demonstrate that individual differences in vWM capacity are associated with the timing of a specific attentional control operation that suppresses processing of salient but irrelevant visual objects and restricts their access to higher stages of visual processing.

Inhibition of the kinase WNK1/HSN2 ameliorates neuropathic pain by restoring GABA inhibition	SCIENCE SIGNALING			English	Article							LAMINA-I NEURONS; SPINAL-CORD; NERVE INJURY; WNK KINASES; PHOSPHORYLATION; HYPERSENSITIVITY; MUTATIONS; PHENOTYPE; MODELS; IMPACT	HSN2 is a nervous system predominant exon of the gene encoding the kinase WNK1 and is mutated in an autosomal recessive, inherited form of congenital pain insensitivity. The HSN2-containing splice variant is referred to as WNK1/HSN2. We created a knockout mouse specifically lacking the Hsn2 exon of Wnk1. Although these mice had normal spinal neuron and peripheral sensory neuron morphology and distribution, the mice were less susceptible to hypersensitivity to cold and mechanical stimuli after peripheral nerve injury. In contrast, thermal and mechanical nociceptive responses were similar to control mice in an inflammation-induced pain model. In the nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, WNK1/HSN2 contributed to a maladaptive decrease in the activity of the K+-Cl- cotransporter KCC2 by increasing its inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr(906) and Thr(1007), resulting in an associated loss of GABA (g-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition of spinal pain-transmitting nerves. Electrophysiological analysis showed that WNK1/HSN2 shifted the concentration of Cl-such that GABA signaling resulted in a less hyperpolarized state (increased neuronal activity) rather than a more hyperpolarized state (decreased neuronal activity) in mouse spinal nerves. Pharmacologically antagonizing WNK activity reduced cold allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia, decreased KCC2 Thr(906) and Thr(1007) phosphorylation, and restored GABA-mediated inhibition (hyperpolarization) of injured spinal cord lamina II neurons. These data provide mechanistic insight into, and a compelling therapeutic target for treating, neuropathic pain after nerve injury.

Individual Differences in the Frequency-Following Response: Relation to Pitch Perception	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AUDITORY BRAIN-STEM; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; HESCHLS GYRUS; COMPLEX TONES; BIOLOGICAL MARKER; NON-MUSICIANS; SPEECH; CORTEX; REPRESENTATION; CHILDREN	The scalp-recorded frequency-following response (FFR) is a measure of the auditory nervous system's representation of periodic sound, and may serve as a marker of training-related enhancements, behavioural deficits, and clinical conditions. However, FFRs of healthy normal subjects show considerable variability that remains unexplained. We investigated whether the FFR representation of the frequency content of a complex tone is related to the perception of the pitch of the fundamental frequency. The strength of the fundamental frequency in the FFR of 39 people with normal hearing was assessed when they listened to complex tones that either included or lacked energy at the fundamental frequency. We found that the strength of the fundamental representation of the missing fundamental tone complex correlated significantly with people's general tendency to perceive the pitch of the tone as either matching the frequency of the spectral components that were present, or that of the missing fundamental. Although at a group level the fundamental representation in the FFR did not appear to be affected by the presence or absence of energy at the same frequency in the stimulus, the two conditions were statistically distinguishable for some subjects individually, indicating that the neural representation is not linearly dependent on the stimulus content. In a second experiment using a within-subjects paradigm, we showed that subjects can learn to reversibly select between either fundamental or spectral perception, and that this is accompanied both by changes to the fundamental representation in the FFR and to cortical-based gamma activity. These results suggest that both fundamental and spectral representations coexist, and are available for later auditory processing stages, the requirements of which may also influence their relative strength and thus modulate FFR variability. The data also highlight voluntary mode perception as a new paradigm with which to study top-down vs bottom-up mechanisms that support the emerging view of the FFR as the outcome of integrated processing in the entire auditory system.

The connectivity and synaptic network of the hippocampus are implicated in depression, schizophrenia and anxiety. We thus examined the underlying molecular adaptations in the hippocampus as a function of the fetal conditions associated with low birth weight. We used tissues from the non-human primate, Macaca fascicularis, to identify changes in hippocampal gene expression early in postnatal development associated with naturally occurring low compared with normal birth weight. Microarrays were used to analyze gene expression and DNA methylation in the hippocampus of five low- and five normal-birth weight neonates. Real-time PCR was employed to validate differentially expressed genes. Birth weight associated with altered global transcription in the hippocampus. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles from 24,154 probe sets grouped all samples except one by their birth weight status. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in biological processes associated with neuronal projection, positive regulation of transcription and apoptosis. About 4% of the genes with differential expression co-varied with DNA methylation levels. The data suggest that low birth weight is closely associated with hippocampal gene expression with a small epigenetic underpinning by DNA methylation in neonates. The data also provide a potential molecular basis for the developmental origin of an enhanced risk for mental disorders. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Buschdorf, J.

Early adversity could promote resilience by calibrating the prefrontal stress-regulatory dopaminergic neurotransmission to improve the individual's fit with the predicted stressful environment. Aberrant reactivity to such match between proximal and distal environments may, however, enhance psychosis disease risk. We explored the combined effects of childhood adversity and adult stress by exposing 12 unmedicated individuals with a diagnosis of non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD) and 12 healthy controls (HC) to psychosocial stress during an [F-18]fallypride positron emission tomography. Childhood trauma divided into early (ages 0-11 years) and late (12-18 years) was assessed retrospectively using a questionnaire. A significant group x childhood trauma interaction on the spatial extent of stress-related [18F] fallypride displacement was observed in the mPFC for early (b=-8.45, t(1,23) = -3.35, p=.004) and late childhood trauma (b=7.86, t(1,23) = -2.48, p=.023). In healthy individuals, the spatial extent of mPFC DA activity under acute psychosocial stress was positively associated with the severity of early (b=7.23, t(11) = 3.06, p=.016) as well as late childhood trauma (b=-7.86, t(1,23) = -2.48, p=.023). Additionally, a trend-level main effect of early childhood trauma on subjective stress response emerged within this group (b=-.7, t(11) = -2, p=.07), where higher early trauma correlated with lower subjective stress response to the task. In the NAPD group, childhood trauma was not associated with the spatial extent of the tracer displacement in mPFC (b=-1.22, t(11) = -0.67), nor was there a main effect of trauma on the subjective perception of stress within this group (b=.004, t(11) = .01, p=.99). These findings reveal a potential mechanism of neuroadaptation of prefrontal DA transmission to early life stress and suggest its role in resilience and vulnerability to psychosis.

Neuroimaging data implicate fronto-striatal circuitry, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Methods In this double-blind parallel group study, we investigated the effects of one session of sham-controlled high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left DLPFC (l-DLPFC) in 60 individuals with AN. A food exposure task was administered before and after the procedure to elicit AN-related symptoms. Outcomes The primary outcome measure was 'core AN symptoms', a variable which combined several subjective AN-related experiences. The effects of rTMS on other measures of psychopathology (e.g. mood), temporal discounting (TD; intertemporal choice behaviour) and on salivary cortisol concentrations were also investigated. Safety, tolerability and acceptability were assessed. Results Fourty-nine participants completed the study. Whilst there were no interaction effects of rTMS on core AN symptoms, there was a trend for group differences (p = 0.056): after controlling for pre-rTMS scores, individuals who received real rTMS had reduced symptoms post-rTMS and at 24-hour follow-up, relative to those who received sham stimulation. Other psychopathology was not altered differentially following real/sham rTMS. In relation to TD, there was an interaction trend (p = 0.060): real versus sham rTMS resulted in reduced rates of TD (more reflective choice behaviour). Salivary cortisol concentrations were unchanged by stimulation. rTMS was safe, well-tolerated and was considered an acceptable intervention. Conclusions This study provides modest evidence that rTMS to the I-DLPFC transiently reduces core symptoms of AN and encourages prudent decision making. Importantly, individuals with AN considered rTMS to be a viable treatment option. These findings require replication in multiple-session studies to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.

Based on the critical role of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors (GluA2/AMPARs) in long-term memory persistence, we tested in rats whether their synaptic removal underpins time-dependent memory loss. We found that blocking GluA2/AMPAR removal with the interference peptides GluA2(3Y) or G2CT in the dorsal hippocampus during a memory retention interval prevented the normal forgetting of established, long-term object location memories, but did not affect their acquisition. The same intervention also preserved associative memories of food-reward conditioned place preference that would otherwise be lost over time. We then explored whether this forgetting process could play a part in behavioral phenomena involving time-dependent memory change. We found that infusing GluA2(3Y) into the dorsal hippocampus during a 2 week retention interval blocked generalization of contextual fear expression, whereas infusing it into the infralimbic cortex after extinction of auditory fear prevented spontaneous recovery of the conditioned response. Exploring possible physiological mechanisms that could be involved in this form of memory decay, we found that bath application of GluA2(3Y) prevented depotentiation, but not induction of long-term potentiation, in a hippocampal slice preparation. Together, these findings suggest that a decay-like forgetting process that involves the synaptic removal of GluA2/AMPARs erases consolidated long-term memories in the hippocampus and other brain structures over time. This well regulated forgetting process may critically contribute to establishing adaptive behavior, whereas its dysregulation could promote the decline of memory and cognition in neuropathological disorders.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake transgenic fragile X rats: evidence of dysregulation in reward processing in the mesolimbic/habenular neural circuit	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; FMR1 KNOCKOUT MOUSE; MENTAL-RETARDATION SYNDROME; LEVEL-DEPENDENT SIGNAL; LATERAL HABENULA; DOPAMINE NEURONS; OLFACTORY SYSTEM; CONSCIOUS RATS; BASAL GANGLIA; CGG REPEAT	Anxiety and social deficits, often involving communication impairment, are fundamental clinical features of fragile X syndrome. There is growing evidence that dysregulation in reward processing is a contributing factor to the social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. Hence, we hypothesized that transgenic fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (fmr1) KO (FX) rats would display alterations in reward processing. To this end, awake control and FX rats were imaged for changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity in response to the odor of almond, a stimulus to elicit the innate reward response. Subjects were 'odor naive' to this evolutionarily conserved stimulus. The resulting changes in brain activity were registered to a three-dimensional segmented, annotated rat atlas delineating 171 brain regions. Both wild-type (WT) and FX rats showed robust brain activation to a rewarding almond odor, though FX rats showed an altered temporal pattern and tended to have a higher number of voxels with negative BOLD signal change from baseline. This pattern of greater negative BOLD was especially apparent in the Papez circuit, critical to emotional processing and the mesolimbic/habenular reward circuit. WT rats showed greater positive BOLD response in the supramammillary area, whereas FX rats showed greater positive BOLD response in the dorsal lateral striatum, and greater negative BOLD response in the retrosplenial cortices, the core of the accumbens and the lateral preoptic area. When tested in a freely behaving odor-investigation paradigm, FX rats failed to show the preference for almond odor which typifies WT rats. However, FX rats showed investigation profiles similar to WT when presented with social odors. These data speak to an altered processing of this highly salient novel odor in the FX phenotype and lend further support to the notion that altered reward systems in the brain may contribute to fragile X syndrome symptomology.

Although the general organization of the locomotor neural circuitry is relatively well understood, less is known about its activation by sensory inputs and its modulation. Utilizing the lamprey model, a detailed understanding of sensorimotor integration in vertebrates is emerging. In this article, we explore how the vertebrate CNS integrates sensory signals to generate motor behavior by examining the pathways and neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of cutaneous and olfactory inputs into motor output in the lamprey. We then review how 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) acts on these systems by modulating both sensory inputs and motor output. A comprehensive review of this fundamental topic should provide a useful framework in the fields of motor control, sensorimotor integration and neuromodulation.

Cerebral ischemia in the context of hemodynamic failure has been incriminated.(1) Indeed, LS-TIAs are associated with severe carotid steno-occlusive disease and often precipitated by a decrease in blood pressure.(1) A limited number of studies using transcranial Doppler,(2) (133)xenon SPECT,(3) or O-15-H2O-PET4 have shown reduced regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and diminished vasomotor reactivity. The latter techniques can only provide a single snapshot of regional CBF and do not allow for continuous assessment of cerebral hemodynamic changes during an actual LS-TIA. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique that can noninvasively monitor at the bedside cortical changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), and total hemoglobin (HbT, as a proxy to cerebral blood volume).(5) We report the hemodynamic changes observed throughout the course of LS-TIAs using a simultaneous multichannel fNIRS-EEG system.

The Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ) questionnaire investigates the main facets of music experience that could explain the variance observed in how people experience reward associated with music. Currently, only English and Spanish versions of this questionnaire are available. The objective of this study is to validate a French version of the BMRQ. Methods. The original BMRQ was translated and adapted into an international French version. The questionnaire was then administered through an online survey aimed at adults aged over 18 years who were fluent in French. Statistical analyses were performed and compared to the original English and Spanish version for validation purposes. Results. A total of 1,027 participants completed the questionnaire. Most responses were obtained from France (89.4%). Analyses revealed that congruence values between the rotated loading matrix and the ideal loading matrix ranged between 0.88 and 0.96. Factor reliabilities of subscales (i.e., Musical Seeking, Emotion Evocation, Mood Regulation, Social Reward and Sensory-Motor) also ranged between 0.88 and 0.96. In addition, reliability of the overall factor score (i.e., Music reward) was 0.91. Finally, the internal consistency of the overall scale was 0.85. The factorial structure obtained in the French translation was similar to that of the original Spanish and English samples. Conclusion. The French version of the BMRQ appears valid and reliable. Potential applications of the BMRQ include its use as a valuable tool in music reward and emotion research, whether in healthy individuals or in patients suffering from a wide variety of cognitive, neurologic and auditory disorders.

The coevolution of innovation and technical intelligence in primates	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						innovation; social learning; tool use; intelligence; primate cognition; brain evolution	BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY; CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE; SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE; BRAIN STRUCTURES; EVOLUTION; BIRDS; SIZE; WILD; INSECTIVORES; HYPOTHESIS	In birds and primates, the frequency of behavioural innovation has been shown to covary with absolute and relative brain size, leading to the suggestion that large brains allow animals to innovate, and/or that selection for innovativeness, together with social learning, may have driven brain enlargement. We examined the relationship between primate brain size and both technical (i.e. tool using) and non-technical innovation, deploying a combination of phylogenetically informed regression and exploratory causal graph analyses. Regression analyses revealed that absolute and relative brain size correlated positively with technical innovation, and exhibited consistently weaker, but still positive, relationships with non-technical innovation. These findings mirror similar results in birds. Our exploratory causal graph analyses suggested that technical innovation shares strong direct relationships with brain size, body size, social learning rate and social group size, whereas non-technical innovation did not exhibit a direct relationship with brain size. Nonetheless, non-technical innovation was linked to brain size indirectly via diet and life-history variables. Our findings support 'technical intelligence' hypotheses in linking technical innovation to encephalization in the restricted set of primate lineages where technical innovation has been reported. Our findings also provide support for a broad co-evolving complex of brain, behaviour, life-history, social and dietary variables, providing secondary support for social and ecological intelligence hypotheses. The ability to gain access to difficult-to-extract, but potentially nutrient-rich, resources through tool use may have conferred on some primates adaptive advantages, leading to selection for brain circuitry that underlies technical proficiency.

A vast literature on human innovation exists, from the development of problem-solving in children, to the evolution of technology, to the cultural systems supporting innovation. A more recent development is a growing literature on animal innovation, which has demonstrated links between innovation and personality traits, cognitive traits, neural measures, changing conditions, and the current state of the social and physical environment. Here, we introduce these fields, define key terms and discuss the potential for fruitful exchange between the diverse fields researching innovation. Comparisons of innovation between human and non-human animals provide opportunities, but also pitfalls. We also summarize some key findings specifying the circumstances in which innovation occurs, discussing factors such as the intrinsic nature of innovative individuals and the environmental and socio-ecological conditions that promote innovation, such as necessity, opportunity and free resources. We also highlight key controversies, including the relationship between innovation and intelligence, and the notion of innovativeness as an individual-level trait. Finally, we discuss current research methods and suggest some novel approaches that could fruitfully be deployed.

A plausible alternative is considering innovativeness as a co-opted product of traits that have evolved for other functions yet together predispose individuals to solve problems by adopting novel behaviours. However, this raises the question of why these adaptations should evolve together in an animal. Here, we develop the argument that the adaptations enabling animals to innovate evolve together because they are jointly part of a life-history, strategy for coping with environmental changes. In support of this claim, we present comparative evidence showing that in birds, (i) innovative propensity is linked to life histories that prioritize future over current reproduction, (ii) the link is in part explained by differences in brain size, and (iii) innovative propensity and life-history traits may evolve together in generalist species that frequently expose themselves to novel or unusual conditions. Combined with previous evidence, these findings suggest that innovativeness is not a specialized adaptation but more likely part of a broader general adaptive system to cope with changes in the environment.

Suicidal behaviour differs between sexes, age groups, geographic regions, and sociopolitical settings, and variably associates with different risk factors, suggesting aetiological heterogeneity. Although there is no effective algorithm to predict suicide in clinical practice, improved recognition and understanding of clinical, psychological, sociological, and biological factors might help the detection of high-risk individuals and assist in treatment selection. Psychotherapeutic, pharmacological, or neuromodulatory treatments of mental disorders can often prevent suicidal behaviour; additionally, regular follow-up of people who attempt suicide by mental health services is key to prevent future suicidal behaviour.

A significant bottleneck to the application of these methods in diverse cell lines, tissues, and developmental stages is the availability of validated IP-quality antibodies. Using IP followed by immunoblot assays, we have developed a validated repository of 438 commercially available antibodies that interrogate 365 unique RBPs. In parallel, 362 shorthairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs against 276 unique RBPs were also used to confirm specificity of these antibodies. These antibodies can characterize subcellular RBP localization.

At glutamatergic synapses, high and low activity of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is observed when pore-forming subunits coassemble with or without auxiliary subunits, respectively. Whether a common structural pathway accounts for these different gating modes is unclear. Here, we identify two structural motifs that determine the time course of AMPAR channel activation. A network of electrostatic interactions at the apex of the AMPAR ligand-binding domain (LBD) is essential for gating by pore-forming subunits, whereas a conserved motif on the lower, D2 lobe of the LBD prolongs channel activity when auxiliary subunits are present. Accordingly, channel activity is almost entirely abolished by elimination of the electrostatic network but restored via auxiliary protein interactions at the D2 lobe. In summary, we propose that activation of native AMPAR complexes is coordinated by distinct structural pathways, favored by the association/dissociation of auxiliary subunits.	[Dawe, G.

There is very limited data describing myocardial function in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI), as no prospective study has yet examined this association. The objective of our study was to evaluate cardiac function using echocardiography in patients with clinically important TBI. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of consecutive TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit. All patients older than 16 years with moderate to severe TBI according to the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) were eligible for the study. Only patients with a prior history of heart disease or cardiomyopathy or evidence of brain death on admission were excluded. A complete transthoracic echocardiogram was performed within 4 days of admission. Results: Forty-nine patients (67 % males, median age 34 years) were included in the study. Forty-one patients had severe TBI (84 %) with a median GCS of six, 44 patients (90 %) required mechanical ventilation and 36 (74 %) intracranial pressure monitoring. Hospital mortality was 18 %. No patients had global left ventricular dysfunction as defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 50 % (95 % CI, 0-0.07). Average LVEF was 65 +/- 4 %. Four patients (8 %) had regional wall motion abnormalities with preserved LVEF. Discussion: The main finding of this study is the absence of clinically significant myocardial dysfunction in patients with moderate or severe TBI. Although myocardial dysfunction has been well described in a variety of neurological settings, it is possible that the young age of TBI patients and the absence of cardiovascular risk factors are protective against significant myocardial injury from catecholamine excess. Conclusions: In a group of patients with clinically important TBI, we did not identify any significant cardiac dysfunction.

We have demonstrated that ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) could play a role in knee joint pathology associated with osteoarthritis (OA). Here, we delineate the in vivo role of EFNB2 in musculoskeletal growth, development, and in OA using a cartilage-specific EFNB2 knockout (EFNB2(Col2)KO) mouse model. Methods: EFNB2(Col2)KO was generated with Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice. The skeletal development was evaluated using macroscopy, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry, radiology, densitometry, and micro-computed tomography. Analyses were performed at P0 (birth) and on postnatal days P15, P21, and on 8-week- and 1-year-old mice. Results: EFNB2(Col2)KO mice exhibited significant reduction in size, weight, length, and in long bones. At P0, the growth plates of EFNB2(Col2)KO mice displayed increased type X collagen, disorganized hyphertrophic zone, and decreased mineralization. At P15, mutant mice demonstrated a significant reduction in VEGF and TRAP at the chondro-osseous junction and a delay in the secondary ossification, including a decrease in bone volume and trabecular thickness. At P21 and 8 weeks old, EFNB2(Col2)KO mice exhibited reduced bone mineral density in the total skeleton, femur and spine. One-year-old EFNB2(Col2)KO mice demonstrated OA phenotypic features in both the knee and hip. By P15, 27 % of the EFNB2(Col2)KO mice developed a hip locomotor phenotype, which further experiments demonstrated reflected the neurological midline abnormality involving the corticospinal tract. Conclusion: This in vivo study demonstrated, for the first time, that EFNB2 is essential for normal long bone growth and development and its absence leads to a knee and hip OA phenotype in aged mice.

Among the various candidate genes implicated in MDD, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism and 5-HT transporter gene linked polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) have garnered the most attention due to their putative roles in neural plasticity and antidepressant response. However, relatively few studies have assessed the influence of these polymorphysims on cortical thickness or brain volume in para-limbic and limbic regions in MDD, which was the aim of this study. Methods: Forty-three adults with MDD and 15 healthy controls (HC) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cortical thickness was assessed in frontal, cingulate and temporal regions. Volumetric measures were carried out in the thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus and amygdala. Participants were genotyped to determine their 5-HTTLPR (tri-allelic) and Val66Met polymorphisms. Results: In the combined sample (MDD + HC), smaller right pallidum volumes were found in LA/S (LA/S & LA/LG) heterozygotes compared to S/S (S/S, LG/S & LG/LG) homozygotes, though the effect was modest. In the MDD group, larger left thalamus and putamen volumes were observed in LA/LA homozygotes. No Val66Met or 5-HTTLPR genotype effects existed on cortical thickness and no main effects of the Val66Met polymorphism were observed. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with morphometric changes in regions known to play an important role in emotional and reward processing in depression. A larger sample size is required to replicate these findings and to potentially reveal subtle morphometric changes.

ELEGANS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; KINASE AAK-2; STRIATAL CELLS; AMYLOID-BETA; PC-12 CELLS	The adenosine monophosphate activated kinase protein (AMPK) is an evolutionary-conserved protein important for cell survival and organismal longevity through the modulation of energy homeostasis. Several studies suggested that AMPK activation may improve energy metabolism and protein clearance in the brains of patients with vascular injury or neurodegenerative disease. However, in Huntington's disease (HD), AMPK may be activated in the striatum of HD mice at a late, post-symptomatic phase of the disease, and high-dose regiments of the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide may worsen neuropathological and behavioural phenotypes. Here, we revisited the role of AMPK in HD using models that recapitulate the early features of the disease, including Caenorhabditis elegans neuron dysfunction before cell death and mouse striatal cell vulnerability. Genetic and pharmacological manipulation of aak-2/AMPKa shows that AMPK activation protects C. elegans neurons from the dysfunction induced byhumanexon-1 huntingtin (Htt) expression, in a daf-16/forkhead box O-dependent manner. Similarly, AMPK activation using genetic manipulation and low-dose metformin treatment protects mouse striatal cells expressing full-length mutant Htt (mHtt), counteracting their vulnerability to stress, with reduction of soluble mHtt levels by metformin and compensation of cytotoxicity by AMPK alpha 1. Furthermore, AMPK protection is active in the mouse brain as delivery of gain-of-function AMPK-gamma 1 to mouse striata slows down the neurodegenerative effects of mHtt. Collectively, these data highlight the importance of considering the dynamic of HD for assessing the therapeutic potential of stress-response targets in the disease. We postulate that AMPK activation is a compensatory response and valid approach for protecting dysfunctional and vulnerable neurons in HD.

Conserved pharmacological rescue of hereditary spastic paraplegia-related phenotypes across model organisms	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; NEURONAL TOXICITY; AXON OUTGROWTH; ER STRESS; PROTEIN; GENE; MICROTUBULES; MECHANISMS; INTERACTS; ATLASTIN	Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases causing progressive gait dysfunction. Over 50 genes have now been associated with HSP. Despite the recent explosion in genetic knowledge, HSP remains without pharmacological treatment. Loss-of-function mutation of the SPAST gene, also known as SPG4, is the most common cause of HSP in patients. SPAST is conserved across animal species and regulates microtubule dynamics. Recent studies have shown that it also modulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, utilizing null SPAST homologues in C. elegans, Drosophila and zebrafish, we tested FDA-approved compounds known to modulate ER stress in order to ameliorate locomotor phenotypes associated with HSP. We found that locomotor defects found in all of our spastin models could be partially rescued by phenazine, methylene blue, N-acetyl-cysteine, guanabenz and salubrinal. In addition, we show that established biomarkers of ER stress levels correlated with improved locomotor activity upon treatment across model organisms. Our results provide insights into biomarkers and novel therapeutic avenues for HSP.	[Julien, Carl; Lissouba, Alexandra; Fardghassemi, Yasmin; Drapeau, Pierre; Parker, J.

Light-sensitive brain pathways and aging	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Review						Light; Aging; Brain; Non-image-forming (NIF) functions	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; SHORT-WAVELENGTH LIGHT; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; NORADRENERGIC LOCUS-COERULEUS; SEASONAL AFFECTIVE-DISORDER; CLOCK GENE-EXPRESSION; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; BLUE-LIGHT	Notwithstanding its effects on the classical visual system allowing image formation, light acts upon several non-image-forming (NIF) functions including body temperature, hormonal secretions, sleep-wake cycle, alertness, and cognitive performance. Studies have shown that NIF functions are maximally sensitive to blue wavelengths (460-480 nm), in comparison to longer light wavelengths. Higher blue light sensitivity has been reported for melatonin suppression, pupillary constriction, vigilance, and performance improvement but also for modulation of cognitive brain functions. Studies investigating acute stimulating effects of light on brain activity during the execution of cognitive tasks have suggested that brain activations progress from subcortical regions involved in alertness, such as the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem, before reaching cortical regions associated with the ongoing task. In the course of aging, lower blue light sensitivity of some NIF functions has been reported. Here, we first describe neural pathways underlying effects of light on NIF functions and we discuss eye and cerebral mechanisms associated with aging which may affect NIF light sensitivity. Thereafter, we report results of investigations on pupillary constriction and cognitive brain sensitivity to light in the course of aging. Whereas the impact of light on cognitive brain responses appears to decrease substantially, pupillary constriction seems to remain more intact over the lifespan. Altogether, these results demonstrate that aging research should take into account the diversity of the pathways underlying the effects of light on specific NIF functions which may explain their differences in light sensitivity.

Neuronal calcium sensor-1 deletion in the mouse decreases motivation and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Neuronal calcium sensor-1; Frequenin; Motivation; Dopamine; Effort; Progressive ratio	PROGRESSIVE-RATIO PERFORMANCE; REWARD-RELATED STIMULI; CONDITIONED REINFORCEMENT; RESPONSE ALLOCATION; CA(V)2.1 CHANNELS; ENHANCED MOTIVATION; TASTE REACTIVITY; CHOICE PROCEDURE; FOOD MOTIVATION; MICE LACKING	Calcium sensors detect intracellular calcium changes and interact with downstream targets to regulate many functions. Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1) or Frequenin is widely expressed in the nervous system, and involved in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and learning. NCS-1 interacts with and regulates dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) internalization and is implicated in disorders like schizophrenia and substance abuse. However, the role of NCS-1 in behaviors dependent on dopamine signaling in the striatum, where D2R is most highly expressed, is unknown. We show that Ncs-1 deletion in the mouse decreases willingness to work for food. Moreover, Ncs-1 knockout mice have significantly lower activity dependent dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core in acute slice recordings. In contrast, food preference, responding for conditioned reinforcement, ability to represent changes in reward value, and locomotor response to amphetamine are not impaired. These studies identify novel roles for NCS-1 in regulating activity-dependent striatal dopamine release and aspects of motivated behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Alcoholism is one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this polymorphism increases the severity of alcohol abuse disorders. METHODS: We generated transgenic mice carrying the mouse homolog of the human Met66BDNF allele (Met68BDNF) and used alcohol-drinking paradigms in combination with viral-mediated gene delivery and pharmacology. RESULTS: We found that Met68BDNF mice consumed excessive amounts of alcohol and continued to drink despite negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Importantly, compulsive alcohol intake was reversed by overexpression of the wild-type valine68BDNF allele in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of the Met68BDNF mice or by systemic administration of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B agonist, LM22A-4. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that carrying this BDNF allele increases the risk of developing uncontrolled and excessive alcohol drinking that can be reversed by directly activating the BDNF receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B. Importantly, this work identifies a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of compulsive alcohol drinking in humans carrying the Met66BDNF allele.

Although the prognosis of ATRT patients is poor, some patients respond favorably to current treatments, suggesting molecular inter-tumor heterogeneity. To investigate this further, we genetically and epigenetically analyzed 192 ATRTs. Three distinct molecular subgroups of ATRTs, associated with differences in demographics, tumor location, and type of SMARCB1 alterations, were identified. Whole-genome DNA and RNA sequencing found no recurrent mutations in addition to SMARCB1 that would explain the differences between subgroups. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and H3K27Ac chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing of primary tumors, however, revealed clear differences, leading to the identification of subgroup-specific regulatory networks and potential therapeutic targets.

In order to differentiate the contributions of each cell type to the hemodynamic response during stimulation and resting state, intrinsic optical signal (IOI) was recorded synchronized with fluorescence imaging of calcium concentration sensitive dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1 AM. By changing the stimulation parameters (frequency and duration), it was possible to individually promote neuronal and glial responses and to compare them to levels of oxy (HbO), deoxy (HbR) and total (HbT) hemoglobin concentrations. Finally, resting state recordings were done to investigate the possible correlation between hemoglobin fluctuation and calcium transients, based on different frequency bands associated either with neuronal or glial activity.

However, the process of maintaining microglia homeostasis has not been fully understood. In this study, we dissected the features of spinal microglia repopulation following an acute partial depletion. By injecting intrathecally Mac-1-saporin, a microglia selective immunotoxin, we ablated 50% microglia in the spinal cord of naive mice. Spinal microglia repopulated rapidly and local homeostasis was re-established within 14 days post-depletion. Mac-1-saporin treatment resulted in microglia cell proliferation and circulating monocyte infiltration. The latter is indeed part of an acute, transient inflammatory reaction that follows cell depletion, and was characterized by an increase in the expression of inflammatory molecules and by the breakdown of the blood spinal cord barrier. During this period, microglia formed cell clusters and exhibited a M1-like phenotype. MCP-1/CCR2 signaling was essential in promoting this depletion associated spinal inflammatory reaction. Interestingly, ruling out MCP-1-mediated secondary inflammation, including blocking recruitment of monocyte-derived microglia, did not affect depletion-triggered microglia repopulation. Our results also demonstrated that newly generated microglia kept their responsiveness to peripheral nerve injury and their contribution to injury-associated neuropathic pain was not significantly altered.

The MS-DBB contains cholinergic, GABAergic, and recently described glutamatergic neurons, but their specific contribution to theta generation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons in theta rhythm using optogenetic activation and electrophysiological recordings performed in in vitro preparations and in freely behaving mice. The experiments in slices suggest that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons provide prominent excitatory inputs to a majority of local GABAergic and a minority of septal cholinergic neurons. In contrast, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic fiber terminals in hippocampal slices elicited weak postsynaptic responses in hippocampal neurons. In the in vitro septo-hippocampal preparation, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons did increase the rhythmicity of hippocampal theta oscillations, whereas stimulation of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic fibers in the fornix did not have an effect. In freely behaving mice, activation of these neurons in the MS-DBB strongly synchronized hippocampal theta rhythms over a wide range of frequencies, whereas activation of their projections to the hippocampus through fornix stimulations had no effect on theta rhythms, suggesting that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons played a role in theta generation through local modulation of septal neurons. Together, these results provide the first evidence that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons modulate local septal circuits, which in turn contribute to theta rhythms in the hippocampus.

Impaired TrkB Signaling Underlies Reduced BDNF-Mediated Trophic Support of Striatal Neurons in the R6/2 Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); DARPP-32; Huntington disease; R6/2; striatum; TrkB	IMMUNOREACTIVE GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; MUTANT-HUNTINGTIN; TRANSGENIC MICE; IN-VITRO; GENE-EXPRESSION; DARPP-32-CONTAINING NEURONS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; FULL-LENGTH; BRAIN	The principal projection neurons of the striatum are critically dependent on an afferent supply of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) for neurotrophic support. These neurons express TrkB, the cognate receptor for BDNF, which activates signaling pathways associated with neuronal survival and phenotypic maintenance. Impairment of the BDNF-TrkB pathway is suspected to underlie the early dysfunction and prominent degeneration of striatal neurons in Huntington disease (HD). Some studies in HD models indicate that BDNF supply is reduced, while others suggest that TrkB signaling is impaired earlier in disease progression. It remains important to determine whether a primary defect in TrkB signaling underlies reduced neurotrophic support and the early vulnerability of striatal neurons in HD. Using the transgenic R6/2 mouse model of HD we found that prior to striatal degeneration there are early deficits in striatal protein levels of activated phospho-TrkB and the downstream-regulated protein DARPP-32. In contrast, total-TrkB and BDNF protein levels remained normal. Primary neurons cultured from R6/2 striatum exhibited reduced survival in response to exogenous BDNF applications. Moreover, BDNF activation of phospho-TrkB and downstream signal transduction was attenuated in R6/2 striatal cultures. These results suggest that neurotrophic support of striatal neurons is attenuated early in disease progression due to defects in TrkB signal transduction in the R6/2 model of HD.

It is composed of a 17-amino-acid amphipathic segment (Htt17), an amyloidogenic segment of consecutive glutamines (Q(N)), and a proline-rich segment. Htt17 is of fundamental importance: it serves as a membrane anchor to control the localization of huntingtin, it modulates huntingtin's function through posttranslational modifications, and it controls the self-assembly of the amyloidogenic Q(N) segment into oligomers and fibrils. Experimentally, the conformational ensemble of the Htt17 monomer, as well as the impact of the polyglutamine and proline-rich segments, remains, however, mostly uncharacterized at the atomic level due to its intrinsic flexibility. Here, we unveil the free-energy landscape of Htt17, Htt17Q(17), and Htt17Q(17)P(11) using Hamiltonian replica exchange combined with well tempered metadynamics. We characterize the free-energy landscape of these three fragments in terms of a few selected collective variables. Extensive simulations reveal that the free energy of Htt17 is dominated by a broad ensemble of configurations that agree with solution NMR chemical shifts. Addition of Q(17) at its carboxy-terminus reduces the extent of the main basin to more extended configurations of Htt17 with lower helix propensity. Also, the aliphatic carbons of Q17 partially sequester the nonpolar amino acids of Htt17. For its part, addition of Q(17)P(11) shifts the overall landscape to a more extended and helical Htt17 stabilized by interactions with Q(17) and P-11, which almost exclusively form a PPII-helix, as well as by intramolecular H-bonds and salt bridges. Our characterization of Huntingtin's amino-terminus provides insights into the structural origin of its ability to oligomerize and interact with phospholipid bilayers, processes closely linked to the biological functions of this protein.

All for One: Contributions of Age, Socioeconomic Factors, Executive Functioning, and Social Cognition to Moral Reasoning in Childhood	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						moral reasoning; executive functions; affect recognition; theory of mind; childhood	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR; PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EFFORTFUL CONTROL; NEURAL BASIS; CHILDRENS; EMOTION; MIND; EMPATHY	Moral reasoning (MR) is a socio-cognitive skill essential to appropriate social functioning in childhood, and evolves in quality and complexity during ontogenetic development. Past research suggests that MR is related to age, socioeconomic factors, as well as some social and cognitive skills, such as executive functioning (EF), theory of mind (ToM), empathy, and affect recognition. However, their contributions have been studied in silos rather than comprehensively, with little integration of the relative and combined contribution of these skills to MR. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the putative links between these factors in childhood, a period during which these skills are in maturation. The aim of this study was to explore what factors predict moral maturity in typically developing children (n = 76, 47.4% males, M = 9.2, SD = 1.67 years), explore the potential moderating and mediating role of executive functions and social cognition in the relationship between age and MR maturity, and identify the specific contributions of age, socioeconomic factors, EF, and social cognition, using an innovative visual MR assessment tool (So-Moral). The results indicate that MR maturity was correlated with age, EF (inhibition, verbal fluency, and attentional control), and social cognition (ToM and affect recognition). Neither EF nor social cognition moderated the effect of age on MR maturity. However, verbal fluency and third-order false beliefs had a moderating role in this link. MR maturity in children was predicted by three variables from each of the three domains: age, verbal fluency, and third-order ToM. These results contribute to a better understanding of the underpinnings of MR during childhood, suggesting that MR is not reducible to general developmental factors such as age, but that higher order skills, such EF and social cognition also contribute to moral maturity. The findings have relevance for both typically developing and clinical populations in which social skills may be reduced, as well as for the identification of potential loci for intervention in children at-risk for socially maladaptive behaviors.

Pediat Emergency Res Canada PERC	Clinical Risk Score for Persistent Postconcussion Symptoms Among Children With Acute Concussion in the ED	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; PEDIATRIC CONCUSSION; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; RECOVERY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ADOLESCENTS; PREDICTORS; MEDICINE; SUPPORT	IMPORTANCE Approximately one-third of children experiencing acute concussion experience ongoing somatic, cognitive, and psychological or behavioral symptoms, referred to as persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS). However, validated and pragmatic tools enabling clinicians to identify patients at risk for PPCS do not exist. OBJECTIVE To derive and validate a clinical risk score for PPCS among children presenting to the emergency department. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multicenter cohort study (Predicting and Preventing Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics [5P]) enrolled young patients (aged 5-<18 years) who presented within 48 hours of an acute head injury at 1 of 9 pediatric emergency departments within the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network from August 2013 through September 2014 (derivation cohort) and from October 2014 through June 2015 (validation cohort). Participants completed follow-up 28 days after the injury. EXPOSURES All eligible patients had concussions consistent with the Zurich consensus diagnostic criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas PPCS risk score at 28 days, which was defined as 3 or more new or worsening symptoms using the patient-reported Postconcussion Symptom Inventory compared with recalled state of being prior to the injury. RESULTS In total, 3063 patients (median age, 12.0 years [interquartile range, 9.2-14.6 years]; 1205 [39.3%] girls) were enrolled (n = 2006 in the derivation cohort; n = 1057 in the validation cohort) and 2584 of whom (n = 1701 [85%] in the derivation cohort; n = 883 [84%] in the validation cohort) completed follow-up at 28 days after the injury. Persistent postconcussion symptoms were present in 801 patients (31.0%) (n = 510 [30.0%] in the derivation cohort and n = 291 [33.0%] in the validation cohort). The 12-point PPCS risk score model for the derivation cohort included the variables of female sex, age of 13 years or older, physician-diagnosed migraine history, prior concussion with symptoms lasting longer than 1 week, headache, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, answering questions slowly, and 4 or more errors on the Balance Error Scoring System tandem stance. The area under the curve was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69-0.74) for the derivation cohort and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65-0.72) for the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A clinical risk score developed among children presenting to the emergency department with concussion and head injury within the previous 48 hours had modest discrimination to stratify PPCS risk at 28 days. Before this score is adopted in clinical practice, further research is needed for external validation, assessment of accuracy in an office setting, and determination of clinical utility.

HBpF-proBDNF: A New Tool for the Analysis of Pro-Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptor Signaling and Cell Biology	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CONE RETRACTION; PRECURSOR; COMPLEX; PROTEIN; BDNF; PURIFICATION; ACTIVATION	Neurotrophins activate intracellular signaling pathways necessary for neuronal survival, growth and apoptosis. The most abundant neurotrophin in the adult brain, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is first synthesized as a proBDNF precursor and recent studies have demonstrated that proBDNF can be secreted and that it functions as a ligand for a receptor complex containing p75NTR and sortilin. Activation of proBDNF receptors mediates growth cone collapse, reduces synaptic activity, and facilitates developmental apoptosis of motoneurons but the precise signaling cascades have been difficult to discern. To address this, we have engineered, expressed and purified HBpF-proBDNF, an expression construct containing a 6X-HIS tag, a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) sequence, a PreScission (TM) Protease cleavage site and a FLAG-tag attached to the N-terminal part of murine proBDNF. Intact HBpF-proBDNF has activities indistinguishable from its wild-type counterpart and can be used to purify proBDNF signaling complexes or to monitor proBDNF endocytosis and retrograde transport.

J	Khan, S; Choi, RJ; Lee, J; Kim, YS				Khan, Salman; Choi, Ran Joo; Lee, Joohee; Kim, Yeong Shik			Attenuation of neuropathic pain and neuroinflammatory responses by a pyranocoumarin derivative, anomalin in animal and cellular models	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Neuropathic pain; Anti-neuroinflammation; STZ-induced diabetic type I; Anomalin; N2a cells	NF-KAPPA-B; NITRIC-OXIDE; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; CORTICAL-NEURONS; APOPTOSIS; MACROPHAGES; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; INHIBITORS; CELLS	The present study investigated the neuropathic pain, anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties of a pyranocoumarin derivative (anomalin) in in vivo and in vitro models. An in vivo streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathic pain model demonstrated that anomalin significantly suppressed neuropathic pain in mice. To identify the molecular mechanism of the anti-neuropathic pain activity of anomalin, sodium-nitroprusside (SNP)-induced neuroinflammation in neuro-2a (N2a) cells was further investigated in signaling pathways. The effects of anomalin against SNP-induced toxicity, nitrite production and related mRNA gene expression (iNOS and COX-2) were considerably reduced by anomalin in the SNP-induced N2a cells. In the molecular signaling pathway, anomalin effectively blocked the SNP-induced activation of the IKK alpha/beta, I kappa B alpha, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. Furthermore, anomalin remarkably reduced the increase in the SNP-induced nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Additionally, the pro-inflammatory cytokines level was remarkably inhibited by anomalin in high glucose-induced DRG primary neurons and SNP-induced N2a cells. These findings indicate that anomalin has anti-neuropathic pain, anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects against STZ-induced diabetic type I neuropathic pain and SNP-induced in neuronal cell models via the inactivation of the NF-kappa B, Nrf2 and MAPK signaling pathways.

It includes stimulating activities, information on aging, mnemonic strategies, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle and is offered over 10 weekly sessions to seniors with no known cognitive impairment. Purpose: This article describes the development and content of the program, as well as the results of the process evaluation. Methods: A coconstruction framework guided the development and evaluation of the program. The development involved experts, practitioners, and partners. The program was implemented by 13 community organizations (n=143 seniors). Program implementation, response of the participants, and group leaders' and managers' opinions of the program were documented. Results: The program was implemented in variable contexts, socioeconomic levels, type and size of settings, group leaders' background, and participants' profiles. Seniors' satisfaction and participation rates were high. Opinions from group leaders and managers were positive and suggestions for improvement were minor. Discussion: Jog Your Mind was considered as satisfactory and beneficial by participants and feasible by community organization practitioners. Translation to Health Education Practice: Using a systematic, coconstruction framework involving stakeholders can lead to relevant and practical interventions that are well received by practitioners and the target population.

Objectives and Design: Retrospectively reported coping strategies enacted during sexual identity formation among LGBs were assessed in relation to current stress indices measured using environmental (frequency of perceived daily hassles), psychological (perceived distress), and biological (allostatic load [AL] levels representing physiological dysregulations) perspectives. Methods: Forty-six healthy LGBs between the ages of 18 and 45 (M = 23.91, SE = .80) participated. Questionnaires included the Ways of Coping Checklist adapted to disclosure milestones, Daily Hassles Inventory, and Perceived Stress Scale. AL was calculated using 21 biomarkers of neuroendocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic functioning. Results: Avoidance coping during sexual identity formation was positively associated with frequency of daily hassles ( = .598, p < .001), perceived stress ( = .361, p = .015), and AL ( = .405, p = .006). By contrast, seeking social support was negatively associated with perceived stress ( = -.598, p = .048). Conclusions: Emotion-focused coping strategies during LGB sexual identity development are associated with current indices of biopsychosocial stress.

In the great majority of studies, a traditional face-to-face setting with phonological, semantic, and/or sensorimotor cues is used to enhance lexical access. Technology-based therapy is expanding rapidly and has the potential to help individuals with aphasia improve verb retrieval abilities.Aims: This study aimed to assess the treatment outcome of and satisfaction with a therapy for verb anomia in chronic poststroke aphasia using a tablet for self-administered treatment at home.Methods & Procedures: Single-case studies were conducted with two participants who presented with chronic poststroke verb anomia. The following four phases were completed: (1) baseline measures; (2) training on the use of the tablet; (3) self-administered therapy with the tablet; and (4) follow-up, generalisation, and rating of the therapy measures. Twenty self-administered sessions were completed.Outcomes & Results: A significant improvement in verb naming was observed for the two participants following therapy. No generalisation was found for untreated verbs or for treated verbs in a novel task. Both participants were very satisfied with the self-administered treatment using a tablet.Conclusions: The use of tablet-based therapy to improve verb naming could be an interesting way to enhance rehabilitation of acquired language deficits. New technologies are promising and further studies are needed to demonstrate their usefulness and determine the pros and cons of using them in clinical settings.

Distribution of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse after a single intravenous injection	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						Alzheimer disease transgenic mouse; blood-brain barrier; human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell; intravenous	BRAIN-BARRIER; MODEL; DRUG; DYSFUNCTION	The aim of this study was to track the migration of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) administered through a single intravenous injection and to observe the consequential therapeutic effects in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Ten-month-old APP/PS1 mice received a total injection of 1x10(6)cells through the lateral tail vein and were killed 1, 4, and 7 days after administration. On the basis of immunohistochemical analysis, hUCB-MSCs were not detected in the brain at any of the time points. Instead, most of the injected mesenchymal stem cells were found to be distributed in the lung, heart, and liver. In terms of the molecular effects, statistically significant differences in the amyloid protein, neprilysin, and SOX2 levels were not observed among the groups. On the basis of the results from this study, we suggest that single intravenously administered hUCB-MSCs are not delivered to the brain and also do not have a significant influence on Alzheimer's disease pathology.

Chandipura Virus (CHPV) belonging to family Rhabdoviridae is ranked among the emerging pathogens of the Indian subcontinent. Previously we have reported that CHPV induces neurodegeneration albeit the root cause of this degeneration is still an open question. In this study we explored the role of microglia following CHPV infection. Phenotypic analysis of microglia through lectin and Iba-1 staining indicated cells were in an activated state post CHPV infection in cortical region of the infected mouse brain. Cytokine Bead Array (CBA) analysis revealed comparatively higher cytokine and chemokine levels in the same region. Increased level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Nitric Oxide (NO) and Reactive Oxygen species (ROS) in CHPV infected mouse brain indicated a strong inflammatory response to CHPV infection. Hence it was hypothesized through our analyses that this inflammatory response may stimulate the neuronal death following CHPV infection. In order to validate our hypothesis supernatant from CHPV infected microglial culture was used to infect neuronal cell line and primary neurons. This study confirmed the bystander killing of neurons due to activation of microglia post CHPV infection.

J	Lavoie, ME; Champagne, J; Glaser, E; Mendrek, A				Lavoie, Marc E.; Champagne, Julie; Glaser, Emma; Mendrek, Adrianna			Emotional Memory and Electrocortical Activity in Schizophrenia	SANTE MENTALE AU QUEBEC			French	Article						schizophrenia; psychosis; event-related potentials; memory; emotion; valence; arousal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; AFFECTIVE PICTURES; NEURAL RESPONSE; EPISODIC MEMORY; VISUAL-STIMULI	Context Abnormal emotion processing is frequent in schizophrenia and affects social and functional outcome. Past event-related potential (ERP) research investigating processing of affective stimuli in schizophrenia was done mainly with facial expressions and revealed impaired facial emotion recognition in patients relative to control subjects. Experimentations involving fMRI with this group of patients, showed alteration of limbic and frontal regions in response to emotional unpleasant images, compared to neutral stimuli during a memory task. Other studies have also noted an increase in brain activity when the activation of the stimuli was high compared to low arousal stimuli. This may indicate a different sensitivity threshold to emotional arousal and emotional valence involving frontal pathways in these patients. But very few studies attempted to separate the contributions of emotional valence and arousal within an episodic memory protocol with ERP, in that population. Goal The aim of the current research is to investigate brain electro-cortical activity in schizophrenia in response to emotional images during an episodic memory task. Method ERP components were analyzed in 16 schizophrenic and 17 control participants matched for age, sex and intelligence. ERPs were obtained from 56 EEG electrodes. The tasks consisted in a classical episodic memory task that presented 100 repeated old and 100 new photographic images divided into four categories (unpleasant-high arousal, unpleasant-low arousal, pleasant-high arousal and pleasant-low arousal) selected from the International Affective Picture System. The N200, P300 and late positive component (LPC) mean amplitude, were analyzed using repeated-measure analyses of variance (MANOVA). Results Patients with schizophrenia and control subjects gave comparable subjective evaluations of arousal and valence. However, the frontal N200 and the P300 both showed an interaction of the group x memory x valence x hemisphere (F [1.32]= 8.36; p < .01). Thus, this complex interaction denotes an increase of the episodic memory effect in the right hemisphere in response to unpleasant stimuli, with schizophrenic patients. With respect to the control group, there is also an increase of this memory effect in the right hemisphere, but in response to pleasant stimuli. The schizophrenic patients presented a smaller LPC memory effect, especially at the frontal region. More specifically, the frontal LPC was reduced, and the clinical group was less reactive to the emotional arousal content, compared to the control group. Discussion Altogether, our results revealed that while the subjective evaluation of emotional pictures is equivalent across groups, cerebral differences are present in schizophrenic patients during emotional recognition. N200 and P300 results in the frontal region suggest impaired selective attention and episodic memory to unpleasant stimuli in patients, while later processes related to conscious recollection parietal LPC) are not affected with patients affected with schizophrenia. Conclusion This finding provides further support for the notion of a possible discrepancy between the subjective experience and the physiological expression of emotions in schizophrenia patients. Those results could open the door to new clinical research investigations in psychiatry, particularly in the comprehension of a relationship between frontal cortex vulnerability and episodic memory often present in psychosis.

Adolescence is known to be a period of high risk for BPD development as most patients identify the onset of their symptoms to be in the adolescent period. As with other mental health disorders, personality disorder, are thought to result from the interaction between biological and environmental factors. Functional neuroimaging studies are reporting an increasing amount of data on abnormal neuronal functions in BPD adult patients. However, no functional neuroimaging studies have been conducted in adolescents with BPD. Objectives This pilot project aims to evaluate the feasibility of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study coupled with clinical and psychological measures in adolescent girls with a diagnosis of BPD. It also aims to identify neuronal regions of interest (ROI) for the study of BPD in adolescent girls. Method Six female adolescents meeting DSM-IV criteria for BPD and 6 female adolescents without psychiatric disorder were recruited. Both groups were evaluated for BPD symptoms, depressive symptoms, impulsivity, affective lability, and other potential psychiatric comorbidities. We used fMRI to compare patterns of regional brain activation between these two groups as they viewed 20 positive, 20 negative and 20 neutral emotion-inducing pictures, which were presented in random order. Results Participants were recruited over a period of 22 months. The protocol was well tolerated by participants. Mean age of the BPD group and control group was 15.8 +/- 0.9 years-old and 15.5 +/- 1.2 years-old respectively. Psychiatric comorbidity and use of medication was common among participants in the BPD group. This group showed higher impulsivity and affective lability scores. For the fMRI task, BPD patients demonstrated greater differences in activation than controls, when viewing negative pictures compared with neutral pictures, in limbic regions (amygdala and right hippocampus and parahippocampal areas) as well as in the superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus and cerebellum, while control group showed greater activation in left precentral gyrus and right orbitofrontal area. Viewing positive pictures compared with neutral pictures led to increased activation of the left hippocampus and both parahippocampal regions, as well as middle cingulate cortex, superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum in the BPD group. In the control group, positive-scene viewing led to increased activity in the left superior parietal gyrus and right middle/superior temporal gyrus. Conclusion Limbic regions and areas from the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex are potential ROI for the study of the neurophysiology of BPD in female adolescents. The larger studies are needed to better understand the neural features found in these young patients.

The SoA is linked to motor control but also to self-awareness and could play an important role in social interactions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by an alteration of social interactions and communication (DSM-5; APA, 2013) and is often seen as a primary deficit of functions specific to social cognition. However, motor control is also altered in ASD. We hypothesize that motor symptoms and social impairments could both arise from the same alteration of SoA. We first introduce theoretical models of implicit and explicit SoA (Synofzik et al., 2008) and present their neurofunctional basis. Then, we assess the clinical expressions of a disrupted SoA in different neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. In ASD, the atypical formation of internal models of action during motor acquisition (Haswell et al., 2009) could be at the source of an altered implicit SoA. A lack of fidelity of sensorimotor agency cues (Zalla et al., 2015) could also entail an alteration of explicit SoA. We discuss the main clinical expressions of ASD that may ensue from a disrupted SoA (difficulties in theory of mind and imitation, deficits in motor coordination and praxis, etc.)	[Lafleur, Alexis] Univ Quebec, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Soulieres, Isabelle] Univ Quebec, Dept Psychol, CRIUSMM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [d'Arc, Baudouin Forgeot] Univ Quebec, Dept Psychiat, CRIUSMM, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Lafleur, A (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.							66	0	0	3	5	REVUE SANTE MENTALE QUEBEC	MONTREAL	C P 60194, MONTREAL, QC H2J 4E1, CANADA	0383-6320	1708-3923		SANTE MENT QUE	Sant.

UR students can thus have access to scientific conferences and classes on various topics and invite scientists or other professionals to further discuss new discoveries and techniques, and possible ways of improving healthcare from a patients' and service users' perspective. Our conversation with a scientist specialized in obsessive-compulsive disorders triggered this collective reflection on neuroimaging in terms of psychiatric diagnoses, prognoses, recovery opportunities and meta-cognition. Method At the core of the UR as a therapeutic education program is the Projet Citoyen, an adaptation and a transposition in Montreal of the Yale Citizens Project, which has been developed in New Haven, USA, over the past fifteen years. The Projet Citoyen is comprised of four main components: bi-weekly group discussions, individualized peer support, involvement and practicum in the community, and participation in public events and debates. UR students therefore evolve in the academic and scientific milieu, here regarded as a translational community and human laboratory towards social inclusion and full citizenship. UR students can be involved as auxiliaries of medical training to always promote and illustrate recovery opportunities when psychiatric 'dysfunctions' or 'disorders' are the topics of a medical class. In April 2016, UR students invited Dr Marc Lavoie to discuss is work on obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). The content of this group discussion is herein reported. Results UR students learned, among other things, that neuroimaging can be used to identify patterns of brain reactions to various stimuli and situations, reactions that can be different from one psychiatric condition to another and to the rest of the 'normal' population. For example, bright red, green, or blue shades of color can show an over-activation of the thalamus for persons with OCD. This difference can be indicative of a so-called cognitive impairment, with some people reacting more 'emotionally' to an image than other persons for whom the reaction would imply parts of the brain which are normally rather associated to 'rational' thinking (e.g.: the cerebral cortex). Such a difference, when it appears through a neuroimaging technique like EEG or MRI, does not lead to the enunciation of a particular diagnosis for an individual, but can give some complementary indications to be used in conjunction with other observations and can inform the choice for a therapeutic approach. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, for instance, has been statistically shown to be associated with anatomic changes in the human brain. Through some quite spectacular images of parts and subparts of the brain in action, UR students were able to admire all this beautiful neurodiversity. Then we discussed the concept of neuroplasticity: we now know that many aspects of the brain remain changeable or "plastic" even into adulthood, which contrasts with the previous common consensus that the human brain develops during childhood, then remains at once unchangeable afterward and "static." Conclusion Diverse neurological conditions appear as a result of normal variations in the human genome and in affect, the concepts of neurodiversity and of neuroplasticity go much beyond the prevailing prior conceptual conditioning of neurological differences as being inherently pathological and an irreversible "error of Mother Nature." There may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought, but rather emerge based on prior conditioning from the environment and other external and/or internal stimuli, and a psychotherapy could then consist of recognizing this conditioning and learning how to think and react differently to a triggering stimulus. The University of Recovery is thus first and foremost a principle of mutuality among its members - the students in recovery - who are allied through self-help as a basis for metacognitive therapeutic education.

J	Solomonova, E; Wei, SX				Solomonova, Elizaveta; Wei, Sha Xin			Exploring the Depth of Dream Experience The Enactive Framework and Methods for Neurophenomenological Research	CONSTRUCTIVIST FOUNDATIONS			English	Article						Dreaming; enaction; first-person research; consciousness; neurophenomenology		> Context Phenomenology and the enactive approach pose a unique challenge to dream research: during sleep one seems to be relatively disconnected from both world and body. Movement and perception, prerequisites for sensorimotor subjectivity, are restricted; the dreamer's experience is turned inwards. In cognitive neurosciences, on the other hand, the generally accepted approach holds that dream formation is a direct result of neural activations in the absence of perception, and dreaming is often equated with "delusions." > Problem Can enactivism and phenomenology account for the variety of dream experiences? What kinds of experiential and empirical approaches are required in order to probe into dreaming subjectivity? Investigating qualities of perception, sensation, and embodiment in dreams, as well as the relationship between the dream-world and waking-world requires a step away from a delusional or altered-state framework of dream formation and a step toward an enactive integrative approach. > Method In this article, we will focus on the "depth" of dream experiences, i.e., what is possible in the dream state. Our article is divided into two parts: a theoretical framework for approaching dreaming from an enactive cognition standpoint; and discussion of the role and strategies for experimentation on dreaming. Based on phenomenology and theories of enactivism, we will argue for the primacy of subjectivity and imagination in the formation of lived experience. > Results We propose that neurophenomenology of dreaming is a nascent discipline that requires rethinking the relative role of third-, first-and second-person methodologies, and that a paradigm shift is required in order to investigate dreaming as a phenomenon on a continuum of conscious phenomena as opposed to a break from or an alteration of consciousness. > Implications Dream science, as part of the larger enterprise of consciousness and subjectivity studies, can be included in the enactive framework. This implies that dream experiences are neither passively lived nor functionally disconnected from dreamers' world and body. We propose the basis and some concrete strategies for an empirical enactive neurophenomenology of dreaming. We conclude that investigating dream experiences can illuminate qualities of subjective perception and relation to the world, and thus challenge the traditional subject-object juxtaposition. > Constructivist content This article argues for an interdisciplinary enactive cognitive science approach to dream studies.

Resting Energy Expenditure Is Decreased in Pseudohypoparathyroidism Type 1A	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; GS-ALPHA GENE; OBESE CHILDREN; PREDICTION EQUATIONS; HORMONE RESISTANCE; PARENTAL ORIGIN; WHITE-CHILDREN; NORMAL-WEIGHT; MUTATIONS; ADOLESCENTS	Context: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A (PHP1A) is caused by loss-of-function mutations on the maternally inherited GNAS allele and is associated with early-onset obesity, neurocognitive defects, and resistance to multiple hormones. The role of energy intake vs central regulation of energy expenditure in the pathophysiology of obesity remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate resting energy expenditure (REE) in participants with PHP1A. Design: We assessed REE, biochemical, endocrine, and auxological status of 12 participants with PHP1A who had normal or elevated body mass index; controls were a cohort of 156 obese participants. Setting: This study took place at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and Sick Children's Hospital in Toronto. Main Outcome Measures: REE as a percent of predicted REE was the outcome measure. Results: PHP1A participants had normal endocrine status while receiving appropriate hormone replacement therapy, but had significantly decreased REE as a percent of predicted REE (using the modified Schofield equation). Conclusion: Our results are consistent with REE being the principal cause of obesity in PHP1A rather than it being caused by excessive energy intake or endocrine dysfunction.

It has been implicated as a defence DNase involved in the degradation of exogenous DNA after transfection of mammalian cells and in homologous recombination of viral and endogenous DNA. In this study, we looked at the effect of EndoG depletion on plasmid DNA uptake and the levels of homologous recombination in HeLa cells. We show that the proposed defence role of EndoG against uptake of non-viral DNA vectors does not extend to the cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, as targeting of EndoG expression by RNA interference failed to increase intracellular plasmid DNA levels. However, reducing EndoG levels in HeLa cells resulted in a statistically significant reduction of homologous recombination between two plasmid DNA substrates. These findings suggest that non-viral DNA vectors are also substrates for EndoG in its role in homologous recombination.

Real-Time Detection of Periforaminal Vessels in the Cervical Spine An Ultrasound Survey	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							EPIDURAL STEROID INJECTIONS; MEDIAL BRANCH BLOCKS; NERVE ROOT BLOCK; POWER DOPPLER; INTRAVASCULAR PENETRATION; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; MODEL	Background and Objectives: Compared with the thoracic and lumbar spine, transforaminal epidural injections and medial branch blocks in the cervical spine are associated with a higher incidence of neurological complications. Accidental breach of small periforaminal arteries has been implicated in many instances. In this observational study, using ultrasonography, we surveyed the incidence of periforaminal bloods vessels in the cervical spine. Methods: Patients undergoing ultrasound-guided cervical medial branch blocks were scanned using color power and pulsed wave Doppler. Five levels from C2/C3 to C6/C7 were studied. Incidental blood vessels located between the anterior tubercles of the transverses process and the posterior borders of the articular pillars were included for analysis. We recorded the diameter and position of arteries relative to contiguous bony landmarks as well the number of veins. Results: In 102 patients, we performed a total 201 scans (1005 cervical levels). Of the 363 incidental vessels identified, 238 were arteries (mean diameter, 1.25 +/- 0.45 mm). The latter were most commonly found at the posterior foraminal aspects of C5, C6, and C7 (13%, 11%, and 16% of scans, respectively); the transverse processes of C5 and C6 (10% and 16% of scans, respectively); and the articular pillars of C6 and C7 (19% and 16% of scans, respectively). Conclusions: Small periforaminal arteries are prevalent along the lateral aspect of the cervical spine, adjacent to areas commonly targeted by nerve block procedures. Further trials are required to determine if ultrasound guidance can reduce the incidence of complications related to accidental vascular breach.	[Finlayson, Roderick J.; Tran, De Q.

We hypothesize that changes in DNA methylation as well as other epigenetic markers could generate stable phenotypes. Early life adversity appears to result in altered DNA methylation of genes in the brain and peripheral tissues, and these changes are associated with adverse phenotypic changes. Although the data are still sparse, early epigenetic studies have provided a proof of principle that experiences and the environment leave marks on genes, and thus suggest molecular and physical mechanisms for the epidemiological concept of gene-environment interaction. The main attraction of DNA methylation for type I (TI) translational prevention science is the fact that, different from genetic changes that are inherited from our ancestors, DNA methylation is potentially preventable and reversible and, therefore, there is a prospect of epigenetically targeted interventions. In addition, DNA methylation markers might provide an objective tool for assessing effects of early adverse experience on individual risks as well as providing objective measures of progress of an intervention. In spite of this great potential promise of the emerging field of social and translational epigenetics, many practical challenges remain that must be addressed before behavioral epigenetics could become translational epigenetics.

However, it is unclear if and how they are modulated by brain developmental stage (and, therefore, by age at FEP as a proxy). This is a multicenter cross-sectional case-control brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Patients with FEP (n = 196), 65.3% males, with a wide age at FEP span (12-35 y), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 157), matched for age, sex, and handedness, were scanned at 6 sites. Gray matter volume and thickness measurements were generated for several brain regions using FreeSurfer software. The nonlinear relationship between age at scan (a proxy for age at FEP in patients) and volume and thickness measurements was explored in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), affective psychoses (AFP), and HC. Earlier SSD cases (ie, FEP before 15-20 y) showed significant volume and thickness deficits in frontal lobe, volume deficits in temporal lobe, and volume enlargements in ventricular system and basal ganglia. First-episode AFP patients had smaller cingulate cortex volume and thicker temporal cortex only at early age at FEP (before 18-20 y). The AFP group also had age-constant (12-35-y age span) volume enlargements in the frontal and parietal lobe. Our study suggests that age at first episode modulates the structural brain abnormalities found in FEP patients in a nonlinear and diagnosis-dependent manner. Future MRI studies should take these results into account when interpreting samples with different ages at onset and diagnosis.

Travel demand models are applied to simulate annual average daily traffic (AADT) every 5 years. A backpropagation neural network (BPN) with a generalized delta rule learning algorithm is applied to develop pavement performance models without uncertainties. Linear programming of life-cycle optimization is applied to develop maintenance and rehabilitation strategies to ensure the achievement of good levels of pavement condition subject to a given maintenance budget. The BPN network estimated that PCI values were predominantly determined by the differences in pavement condition index, AADT, and equivalent single axle loads. Dynamic linear programming optimization estimated that CAD$150 million is the minimum annual budget required to keep most of the arterial and local roads in good condition in Montreal.	[Amin, Md.

This study aims to assess the effect of an interactive virtual reality (VR) system that allows ongoing rehabilitation of the upper extremity (UE) following a stroke, while the person is in their own home, with offline monitoring and feedback from a therapist at a distance. Methods/design: A single-blind (evaluator is blind to group assignment) two-arm randomized controlled trial is proposed, with participants who have had a stroke and are no longer receiving rehabilitation services randomly allocated to: (1) 4-week written home exercise program, i.e. usual care discharge home program or (2) a 4-week home-based TR exercise program using VR in addition to usual care i.e. treatment group. Motor recovery of the UE will be assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-LIE and the Box and Block tests. To determine the efficacy of the system in terms of functional recovery, the Motor Activity Log, a self-reported measure of UE use will be used. Impact on quality of life will be determined using the Stroke Impact Scale-16. Lastly, a preliminary costeffectiveness analysis will be conducted using costs and outcomes for all groups. Discussion: Findings will contribute to evidence regarding the use of TR and VR to provide stroke rehabilitation services from a distance. This approach can enhance continuity of care once patients are discharged from rehabilitation, in order to maximize their recovery beyond the current available services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies in AD mouse models that recapitulate the amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology converge to demonstrate that it is possible to salvage cerebrovascular function with a variety of drugs and, particularly, therapies used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. These drugs can reestablish dilatory function mediated by various endothelial and smooth muscle ion channels as well as nitric oxide availability, benefits that result in normalized brain perfusion. These cerebrovascular benefits would favor brain perfusion, which may help maintain neuronal function and, possibly, delay cognitive failure. However, restoring cerebrovascular function in AD mouse models was not necessarily accompanied by rescue of cognitive deficits related to spatial learning and memory. The results with cardiovascular therapies rather suggest that drugs originally designed to treat cardiovascular diseases that concurrently restore cerebrovascular and cognitive function do so through their pleiotropic effects. Specifically, recent findings suggest that these drugs act directly on brain cells and neuronal pathways involved in memory formation, hence, working simultaneously albeit independently on neuronal and vascular targets. These findings may help select medications for patients with cardiovascular diseases at risk of developing AD with increasing age. Further, they may identify molecular targets for recovering memory pathways that bear potential for new therapeutic avenues.

Objective: To assess the impact of DAC HYP and disease activity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using data from this study. Methods: HRQoL was assessed at baseline, 12, 24, and 52 weeks using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), the 12-items Short Form Health Survey, and the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions. An analysis of covariance model was used to compare treatment difference in change from baseline. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the impact of disability progression, relapse, treatment, and interaction between treatment and these events on HRQoL outcome. Results: DAC HYP 150 mg resulted in significant positive impacts on HRQoL compared to placebo. It was also found to significantly reduce the adverse impact of relapse on the MSIS-29 physical scale (-12.45; p=0.0006). Relapse and disability progression were significantly associated with impaired HRQoL. Conclusion: DAC HYP 150 mg improved HRQoL in patients with RRMS compared to placebo. The treatment benefit can be partially attributed to reduction in disease activity and attenuation of the adverse impact of relapse on HRQoL. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PMIS is a popular algorithm for water resources modeling problems considering nonlinear input variable selection; however, this method requires the specification of two nonlinear regression models, each with parametric settings that greatly influence the selected input variables. Other attempts to develop input variable selection methods using conditional mutual information (CMI) (an analog to PMI) have been formulated under different parametric pretenses such as k nearest-neighbor (KNN) statistics or kernel density estimates (KDE). In this paper, we introduce a new input variable selection method based on CMI that uses a nonparametric multivariate continuous probability estimator based on Edgeworth approximations (EA). We improve the EA method by considering the uncertainty in the input variable selection procedure by introducing a bootstrap resampling procedure that uses rank statistics to order the selected input sets; we name our proposed method bootstrap rank-ordered CMI (broCMI). We demonstrate the superior performance of broCMI when compared to CMI-based alternatives (EA, KDE, and KNN), PMIS, and PCIS input variable selection algorithms on a set of seven synthetic test problems and a real-world urban water demand (UWD) forecasting experiment in Ottawa, Canada.

With the advent of numerous transgenic mouse lines, there is increasing interest in inducible murine models of ocular hypertension. Here, we present an occlusion model of glaucoma based on the injection of magnetic microbeads into the anterior chamber of the eye using a modified microneedle with a facetted bevel. The magnetic microbeads are attracted to the iridocorneal angle using a handheld magnet to block the drainage of aqueous humour from the anterior chamber. This disruption in aqueous dynamics results in a steady elevation of intraocular pressure, which subsequently leads to the loss of retinal ganglion cells, as observed in human glaucoma patients. The microbead occlusion model presented in this manuscript is simple compared to other inducible models of glaucoma and also highly effective and reproducible. Importantly, the modifications presented here minimize common issues that often arise in occlusion models. First, the use of a bevelled glass microneedle prevents backflow of microbeads and ensures that minimal damage occurs to the cornea during the injection, thus reducing injury-related effects. Second, the use of magnetic microbeads ensures the ability to attract most beads to the iridocorneal angle, effectively reducing the number of beads floating in the anterior chamber avoiding contact with other structures (e.g., iris, lens). Lastly, the use of a handheld magnet allows flexibility when handling the small mouse eye to efficiently direct the magnetic microbeads and ensure that there is little reflux of the microbeads from the eye when the microneedle is withdrawn. In summary, the microbead occlusion mouse model presented here is a powerful investigative tool to study neurodegenerative changes that occur during the onset and progression of glaucoma.

Embryonic elongation of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a late developmental stage consisting of the elongation of the embryo along its longitudinal axis. This developmental stage is controlled by intercellular communication between hypodermal cells and underlying body-wall muscles. These signaling mechanisms control the morphology of hypodermal cells by remodeling the cytoskeleton and the cell-cell junctions. Measurement of embryonic lethality and developmental arrest at larval stages as well as alteration of cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion structures in hypodermal and muscle cells are classical phenotypes that have been used for more than 25 years to dissect these signaling pathways. Recent studies required the development of novel metrics specifically targeting either early or late elongation and characterizing morphogenic defects along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo. Here, we provide detailed protocols enabling the accurate measurement of the length and the width of the elongating embryos as well as the length of synchronized larvae. These methods constitute useful tools to identify genes controlling elongation, to assess whether these genes control both early and late phases of this stage and are required evenly along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo.

Few studies have specifically explored social reward processing and its related neural substrates in schizophrenia. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and fifteen healthy controls participated in a two-part study to explore the functional neural correlates of social approval. In the first session, participants were led to believe their personality would be assessed based on their results from various questionnaires and an interview. Participants were then presented with the results of their supposed evaluation in the scanner, while engaging in a relevant fMRI social approval task. Subjects provided subjective reports of pleasure associated with receiving self-directed positive or negative feedback. Higher activation of the right parietal lobe was found in controls compared with individuals with schizophrenia. Both groups rated traits from the high social reward condition as more pleasurable than the low social reward condition, while intergroup differences emerged in the low social reward condition. Positive correlations were found in patients only between subjective ratings of positive feedback and right insula activation, and a relevant behavioural measure. Evidence suggests potential neural substrates underlying the cognitive representation of social reputation in schizophrenia.

Unfortunately, direct evidence linking empathy for pain and descending inhibitory controls (conditioned pain modulation) is lacking. This study, therefore, aimed to determine if the observation of ourselves or a loved-one in pain could activate descending pain inhibition without exposure to a noxious stimulation; which is otherwise required. Methods: Descending pain inhibition was triggered by immersing the right arm of participants (15 heterosexual couples; mean age +/- SE: 28.89 +/- 2.14) in a bath of cold water. The effects of empathy on descending pain inhibition were observed by immersing the right arm of participants in a bath of lukewarm water while having them watch a video of either themselves or their spouse during a previous nociceptive immersion. Immersion of the arm in a bath of lukewarm water without empathic (video) observation was also included as a control condition. Results: A strong inhibitory response activated by the mere observation of the video of themselves or their spouse in pain without a nociceptive conditioning stimulus. Associative statistics also showed that strong pain catastrophizing responses while watching the video resulted in stronger pain inhibition. Moreover, high levels of empathy were associated with stronger pain inhibition, but only for women. Discussion: This study showed that observing someone in pain triggers descending pain inhibition. Results also demonstrate how empathy and gender are affecting pain modulation mechanisms.

Methods: Seventeen EEG recordings with bilateral synchronous discharges of focal (focal group-FG: 10) and generalized (generalized group-GG: 7) epilepsy patients were selected for spikes and ripples marking; the spike-normalized ripple rate was calculated in each hemisphere (right/left - anterior/posterior) and a ripple-dominant hemisphere (the one with the highest rate) was identified. Concordance in FG between the ripple dominant hemisphere and the hemisphere of clinical lateralization was evaluated. The ripple-dominant/ripple-nondominant spike-normalized ripple rate ratio was studied to compare groups. Results: In FG the hemisphere of clinical lateralization and the ripple-dominant hemisphere were 100% concordant. In GG only 3/7 patients showed ripples (vs 10/10 FG), all with anterior dominance. No difference in hemisphere ripple dominance between groups was found. Conclusions: Ripples in secondary bilateral synchrony help to lateralize the epileptic focus but do not help to differentiate between focal and generalized epilepsy. This is the first report of visually identified ripples in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Significance: Ripples confirm the clinical lateralization of the epileptic focus in secondary bilateral synchrony but cannot distinguish between focal and generalized epilepsy.

J	Minn, P				Minn, Pierre			Components of a Moral Economy: Interest, Credit, and Debt in Haiti's Transnational Health Care System	AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST			English	Article						moral economy; international medical aid; humanitarianism; professional emigration; Haiti; ekonomi moral; ed medikal entenasyonal; imanite; emigrasyon pwofesyonel; Ayiti; economie morale; aide medicale internationale; humanitaire; exode des cerveaux; Haiti; economia moral; ayuda medica internacional; humanitarismo; emigracion profesional; Haiti	ETHICS; USURY	The concept of moral economy has garnered the attention of anthropologists for its juxtaposition of two central dimensions of human experience that are often treated as distinct realms. However, the concept's analytic potential remains limited, in part because of the challenges in identifying what specifically a moral economy might comprise or entail. I suggest that articulating components of moral economiesin this case interest, credit, and debtbrings into relief some of the more subtle features of social processes that involve diverse resources, transfers, and calculations. Specifically, I use this approach to examine the provision of health services in Haiti by foreign clinicians and the emigration of Haitian health professionals, drawing on ethnographic research conducted in and around the city of Cap-Haitien. I illustrate how moral economies exist through actions, experiences, and representations, and I shed light on less conspicuous dimensions of international medical interventions, humanitarianism, and brain drain.

RESUME Le concept d'economie morale a retenu l'attention des anthropologues du fait qu'il juxtapose deux domaines importants de l'experience humaine, souvent traites separement. Le potentiel analytique du concept demeure toutefois limite, en partie a cause de la difficulte a cerner ce que comprend ou implique une economie morale. Nous suggerons qu'articuler les composantes des economies moralesdans notre cas l'interet, le credit et la dettenous permet de mettre en relief les caracteristiques sous-jacentes des processus sociaux qui s'appuient sur divers ressources, transferts et calculs. Plus particulierement, nous utilisons cette approche pour examiner la prestation de services de sante en Haiti par les cliniciens etrangers et l'emigration des professionnels de la sante haitiens, en nous basant sur une recherche ethnographique effectuee dans la ville de Cap-Haitien et ses environs. Cette analyse illustre comment les economies morales existent a travers les actions, les experiences et les representations, et met en lumiere des dimensions moins visibles de l'aide medicale internationale, de l'humanitaire et de << l'exode des cerveaux >>. RESUMEN El concepto de la economia moral ha conseguido la atencion de los antropologos por su yuxtaposicion de dos dimensiones centrales de la experiencia humana que ha menudo son tratadas como esferas distintas. Sin embargo, el potencial analitico del concepto permanece limitado, en parte debido a los retos en identificar lo que especificamente una economia moral puede comprender o implicar. Planteo que al articular componentes de las economias moralesen este caso interes, credito, y deudase ponen de relieve algunas de las caracteristicas mas sutiles de los procesos sociales que incorporan recursos diversos, transferencias y calculos. Especificamente, uso esta aproximacion para analizar la provision de servicios de salud en Haiti por medicos extranjeros y la emigracion de profesionales de la salud Haitianos, haciendo uso de la investigacion etnografica llevada a cabo en y alrededor de la ciudad de Cabo Haitiano. Ilustro como las economias morales existen a traves de acciones, experiencias y representaciones, y arrojo luz sobre las dimensiones menos conspicuas de las intervenciones medicas internacionales, el humanitarismo y la fuga de cerebros.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cross-cultural replicability of the recently revised Alternative FFM (AFFM). A total of 15048 participants from 23 cultures completed the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire (ZKA-PQ) aimed at assessing personality according to this revised AFFM. Internal consistencies, gender differences and correlations with age were similar across cultures for all five factors and facet scales. The AFFM structure was very similar across samples and can be considered as highly replicable with total congruence coefficients ranging from .94 to .99. Measurement invariance across cultures was assessed using multi-group confirmatory factor analyses, and each higher-order personality factor did reach configural and metric invariance. Scalar invariance was never reached, which implies that culture-specific norms should be considered. The underlying structure of the ZKA-PQ replicates well across cultures, suggesting that this questionnaire can be used in a large diversity of cultures and that the AFFM might be as universal as the FFM or the PEN model. This suggests that more research is needed to identify and define an integrative framework underlying these personality models.

The discovery of this process has opened the doors to the development of siRNA therapeutics. Although several preclinical and clinical studies have shown great promise in the treatment of neurological disorders, cancers, dominant disorders, and viral infections with siRNA, siRNA therapy is still gaining ground in musculoskeletal tissue repair and bone regeneration. Here we present a comprehensive review of the literature to summarize different siRNA delivery strategies utilized to enhance bone regeneration. With advancement in understanding the targetable biological pathways involved in bone regeneration and also the rapid progress in siRNA technologies, application of siRNA for bone regeneration has great therapeutic potential. High rates of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases, and their inevitable consequences, impose a huge financial burden on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide.

Nichols (2004) argued for the existence of a place where these special beliefs are kept: the pretence box. We show that this theory has a number of drawbacks, including its inability to account for simultaneously keeping track of multiple imagined worlds. We offer an explanation that remedies these problems: beliefs of content imagination each belong to some number of microtheories; systems of ideas tagged as being true or false only in certain contexts.

We previously reported poorer cognitive and motor development in children exposed to Mn through drinking water, suggesting possible neurotoxic effects from Mn in water. Hyperintensity in the globus pallidus (GP) on Ti-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicates excessive brain Mn accumulation. Previous studies have reported GP hyperintensity related to Mn exposure in occupationally exposed individuals. However, no study has used MRI in children exposed to Mn in drinking water and who show no sign of overt intoxication. Objective: To examine MRI signal intensity in the GP in children exposed to contrasted levels of Mn in drinking water. Methods: We enrolled 13 children exposed to low Mn concentration in water and 10 children (ages 9-15 years) with high concentration (median of 1 and 145 mu g/L, respectively). We calculated three MRI T1 indexes: (i) standard pallidal index (PI) using frontal white matter as reference; (ii) PI using pericranial muscles as reference; and (iii) T1 relaxation time. Each MRI index was compared between exposure groups, and with respect to the estimated Mn intake from water consumption. Results: The standard PI did not differ between Mn-exposure groups. However, children in the group with high water-Mn concentration had significantly lower pericranial muscles PI than those with lower exposure and, accordingly, higher T1 relaxation time. Mn intake from water consumption was not correlated with the standard PI, but was significantly related to the pericranial muscles PI and Tl relaxation time. Motor performance was significantly lower in the high-exposure group. Conclusion: We observed lower signal intensity in the GP of children with higher exposure to Mn from drinking water. This result stands in contrast to previous MRI reports showing GP hyperintensity with greater Mn exposure. Differences in exposure pathways are discussed as a potential explanation for this discrepancy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hence, the number of patients receiving this treatment is steadily increasing. Considerable conceptual and technical progress has been made in recent years by manufacturers concerning this technique. This includes new features committed to improve its effectiveness as well as patient-ventilator interactions. The goal of this review is to deal with latest advances in ventilatory modes and features available for non-invasive ventilation. We present a comprehensive analysis of new modes of ventilator assistance committed to treat respiratory failure (hybrid modes) and central and complex sleep apnea (adaptive servo ventilation), and of new modes of triggering and cycling (neurally adjusted ventilatory assist). Technical aspects, modes of operation and settings of these new features as well as an exhaustive review of published data, their benefits and limits, and the potential place of these devices in clinical practice, are discussed.

However, the effects of stimulation parameters on the responses they evoke remain widely unknown. Objective: We aimed to investigate the contribution of each stimulation parameter to the response and identify interactions existing between parameters. Methods: Parameters of the constant-current, biphasic square waveform were examined in acute terminal experiments under ketamine anaesthesia. The motor cortex of 7 Sprague-Dawley rats was stimulated while recording motor evoked potentials (MEP) from the forelimb. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) parameters were systematically tested in a pair-wise fashion to observe the influence of each parameter on the amplitude and latency of the MEP. Results: The amplitude of the MEP increased continually with stimulus amplitude (p < 0.001) and pulse duration (p = 0.001) throughout the range tested. Increases were also observed when stimuli were raised from low to moderate values of frequency (p = 0.022) and train duration (p = 0.045), after which no further excitation occurs. The latency of MEP initiation decreased when stimulus amplitude (p = 0.037) and frequency (p = 0.001) were raised from low to moderate values, after which the responses plateaued. MEP latencies were further reduced by increasing the pulse duration (p = 0.011), but train duration had no effect. Conclusions: Our data indicate that MEP amplitude and onset latency can be modulated by alterations to a number of stimulus parameters, even in restrictive paradigms, and suggest that the parameters of the standard ICMS signal used for evoking movements from the motor cortex can be further optimized.

In doing so, special emphasis is directed to the significant involvement of Canadian scientists in these advances. Starting with the early studies that established GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter at central synapses, we summarize the results pointing at the GABA receptor as a drug target as well as more recent evidence showing that GABA(A) receptor signaling plays a surprisingly active role in neuronal network synchronization, both during development and in the adult brain. Finally, we briefly address the involvement of GABA in neurological conditions that encompass epileptic disorders and mental retardation.

Because of Nazi persecution following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Scheinker fled from Vienna to Paris, then after the German invasion of France, to New York. With the help of neurologist Tracy Putnam, Scheinker ended up at the University of Cincinnati, although his position was never guaranteed. He more than doubled his prior publications in America, and authored three landmark neuropathology textbooks. Despite his publications, he was denied tenure and had difficulty professionally in the Midwest because of prejudice against his European mannerisms. He moved back to New York for personal reasons in 1952, dying prematurely just 2 years later. Scheinker was twice uprooted, but persevered and eventually found some success as a refugee.

A number of researchers have suggested that the pattern of normative brain changes that occurs during this period not only predisposes adolescents to engage in risk behaviours, such as experimentation with drugs, but that they additionally make the adolescent brain more vulnerable to the direct pharmacological impact of substances of abuse. The neural circuits that we examine in this review involve cortico-basal-ganglia/limbic networks implicated in the processing of rewards, emotion regulation, and the control of behaviour, emotion and cognition. Findings and Conclusions: We identify certain neurocognitive and personality/comorbidity-based risk factors for the onset of substance misuse during adolescence, and summarise the evidence suggesting that these risk factors may be further impacted by the direct effect of drugs on the underlying neural circuits implicated in substance misuse vulnerability.

Developmental Responses of the Lateral Hypothalamus to Leptin in Neonatal Rats, and its Implications for the Development of Functional Connections with the Ventral Tegmental Area	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						leptin; pSTAT3; pERK1; 2; ORX-A; neurotensin; neonatal development; VTA afferents	MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE SYSTEM; ARCUATE NUCLEUS NEURONS; OREXIN NEURONS; ENERGY-BALANCE; NEUROTENSIN NEURONS; FEEDING CIRCUITS; NEURAL-CONTROL; FOOD-INTAKE; NEUROPEPTIDES; AFFERENTS	Food intake is regulated by a close communication between the hypothalamus and the mesocorticolimbic pathways, which are still developing during the perinatal period in the rat, and are known targets for peripheral metabolic hormones such as leptin. A key region for this communication is the lateral hypothalamus (LH), although the onset of leptin responsiveness in the LH is unknown. We examined the activation of cellular signalling molecules in identified LH neurones on postnatal day (PND)10 and 16 and determined whether leptin directly targets orexin A (ORX-A) or neurotensin (NT) LH neurones through the detection of leptin receptors (ObRb) mRNA on these neurones. Next, using retrograde labelling in PND6 pups, we tested whether phenotypically identified neurones of the LH that respond to leptin project to ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurones. Leptin significantly induced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)1/2 and phosphorylated signal transducer activator of transcription (pSTAT)3 in the LH on PND16, whereas, on PND10, modest pERK1/2- and sparse pSTAT3-positive cells were identified. On PND16, most pERK1/2-activated neurones contain ORX-A and leptin-induced pSTAT3 was observed in other unidentified neurones. Afferents to the VTA were observed on PND6, including a large input from the LH, which contained both ORX-A-positive and non-ORX-A neurones, with some of these ORX-A neurones being activated by leptin treatment. Leptin receptor (ObRb) mRNA in the LH did not colocalise with ORX-A neurones on PND10, and only a few NT-positive neurones displayed ObRb mRNA expression. Thus, functional responsiveness to leptin in LH neurones is only partially achieved prior to the onset of independent feeding on PND16, and ORX-A neurones are indirectly activated by leptin. The presence of anatomical connections between the LH and the VTA in the first week of life, prior to the development of leptin responsiveness in both structures, suggests that tissue responsiveness to leptin, rather than the maturation of neuronal connections, critically regulates the onset of independent feeding.

As a result of impaired peroxisomal activities, individuals with PBD-ZSD can manifest a complex spectrum of clinical phenotypes that typically result in shortened life spans. The extreme variability in disease manifestation ranging from onset of profound neurologic symptoms in newborns to progressive degenerative disease in adults presents practical challenges in disease diagnosis and medical management. Recent advances in biochemical methods for newborn screening and genetic testing have provided unprecedented opportunities for identifying patients at the earliest possible time and defining the molecular bases for their diseases. Here, we provide an overview of current clinical approaches for the diagnosis of PBD-ZSD and provide broad guidelines for the treatment of disease in its wide variety of forms.

Cortical contributions to the auditory frequency-following response revealed by MEG	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HUMAN BRAIN-STEM; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MUSICAL EXPERIENCE; PITCH PERCEPTION; AGING AFFECTS; SPEECH; CORTEX; REPRESENTATION; STIMULATION; PLASTICITY	The auditory frequency-following response (FFR) to complex periodic sounds is used to study the subcortical auditory system, and has been proposed as a biomarker for disorders that feature abnormal sound processing. Despite its value in fundamental and clinical research, the neural origins of the FFR are unclear. Using magnetoencephalography, we observe a strong, right-asymmetric contribution to the FFR from the human auditory cortex at the fundamental frequency of the stimulus, in addition to signal from cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus and medial geniculate. This finding is highly relevant for our understanding of plasticity and pathology in the auditory system, as well as higher-level cognition such as speech and music processing. It suggests that previous interpretations of the FFR may need re-examination using methods that allow for source separation.	[Coffey, Emily B. J.; Herholz, Sibylle C.; Chepesiuk, Alexander M.

To probe the role of stage 2 non-REM sleep (NREM2) in this process, we used a conditioning protocol in three different groups of participants who either received an odor during initial training on a motor sequence learning task and were re-exposed to this odor during different sleep stages of the post-training night (i.e., NREM2 sleep [Cond-NREM2], REM sleep [Cond-REM], or were not conditioned during learning but exposed to the odor during NREM2 [NoCond]). Results show that the Cond-NREM2 group had significantly higher gains in performance at retest than both the Cond-REM and NoCond groups. Also, only the Cond-NREM2 group yielded significant changes in sleep spindle characteristics during cueing. Finally, we found that a change in frequency of sleep spindles during cued-memory reactivation mediated the relationship between the experimental groups and gains in performance the next day. These findings strongly suggest that cued-memory reactivation during NREM2 sleep triggers an increase in sleep spindle activity that is then related to the consolidation of motor sequence memories.

Methods Retrospective case series and review of the literature. We present the clinical course of four asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia who presented with hypotension requiring inotropic support, and who displayed a secondary increase of serum lactate levels during hypothermia treatment. Serial serum lactate levels are correlated with blood pressure and inotropic support within the first 96 hours of life. Results Lactate levels initially decreased in the four patients. However, each of them started to present lower blood pressure, and lactate levels started to increase again. Inotropic support was started to raise blood pressure. The introduction of an epinephrine drip consistently worsened the increase of lactate levels in these newborns, whereas dopamine and dobutamine enabled the clearance of lactate in addition to raising the blood pressure. Rewarming was associated with hemodynamics perturbations (a decrease of blood pressure and/or an increase of lactate levels) in the three newborns who survived. Conclusions Lactate levels during the first 4 days of life should be followed as a potential marker for suboptimal hemodynamic status in term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia, for whom the maintenance of homeostasis during hypothermia treatment is of utmost importance to alleviate brain injury.

EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Movement Assessment of Infants; Alberta Infant Motor Scale; Extremely preterm infant; Infant outcome; Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler; Development	BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; CEREBRAL-PALSY; VALIDITY; RELIABILITY; ABNORMALITY; CHILDREN; SKILLS; BORN; AIMS	Background: Extremely preterm infants are at high-risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. The Movement Assessment of Infants (MAI) and the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) have been designed to predict outcome with modest accuracy with the Bayley-I or Bayley-II. Aims: To examine and compare the predictive validity of the MAI and AIMS in determining neurodevelopmental outcome with the Bayley-III. Design Retrospective cohort study of 160 infants born at <= 28 weeks gestation. Method: At their corrected age, infants underwent the MAI at 4 months, the AIMS at 4 and 10-12 months, and the Bayley-III and neurological examination at 18 months. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results: Infants had a mean gestation of 263 +/- 1.4 weeks and birth weight of 906 +/- 207 g. A high-risk score (>= 14) for adverse outcome was obtained by 57% of infants on the MAI. On the AIMS, a high-risk score (<5th percentile) was obtained by 56% at 4 months and 30% at 10-12 months. At 18 months, infants with low-risk scores on either the MAI or AIMS had higher cognitive, language, and motor Bayley-III scores than those with high-risk scores. They were less likely to have severe neurodevelopmental impairment. To predict Bayley-III scores <70, sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 49%, respectively, for the MAI and 78% and 48%, respectively, for the AIMS. Conclusions: Extremely preterm infants with low-risk MAI at 4 months or AIMS scores at 4 or 10-12 months had better outcomes than those with high-risk scores. However, both tests lack specificity to predict individual neurodevelopmental status at 18 months. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hardware Implementation of Associative Memories Based on Multiple-Valued Sparse Clustered Networks	IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Associative memory; content-addressable memory; digital circuit implementation; multiple-valued logic; neural networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS; TERNARY CAM; ARCHITECTURE; SCHEME	This paper presents algorithms and hardware implementations of associative memories based on multiple-valued sparse clustered networks (MV-SCNs). SCNs are recently-introduced binary-weighted associative memories that significantly improve the storage and retrieval capabilities over the prior state-of-the art. However, deleting or updating the messages stored in binary-weighted connections result in a significant increase in the data retrieval error probability as the binary-weighted connections deleted may be shared for several data patterns. In order to address the problem, the proposed algorithm exploits multiple-valued weighted connections of the network for storing the messages while maintaining the number of computation nodes in a cluster. The use of the multiple-valued weighted connections reduces the probability of deleting the shared connections compared to the binary-weighted connections. As a result, the proposed algorithm lowers the error rate by an order of magnitude for our sample network with 60% deleted contents compared to the conventional algorithm when the same amount of memory is used. For performance comparisons in hardware, the proposed SCNs are designed using Verilog-HDL and synthesized on TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. The synthesis results show that the proposed MV-SCNs are around 10% smaller than the conventional binary-weighted SCNs as the number of computation nodes in the proposed SCNs is smaller than that of the conventional SCNs with the comparable speed and memory size.

Single-barrier models are considered to reduce the algorithm's computational complexity and provide a relative comparison for rotors with different slots-per-pole combinations. Two objective values per sampled design (average and ripple torques) are computed using 2-D finite-element analysis simulations. Non-linear regression or surrogate models are trained for the two objectives through a Bayesian regularization backpropagation neural network. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to find the validated Pareto front solutions. An analytical ellipse constraint is then suggested to encapsulate optimal solutions. Compared with a direct sampling approach, this restriction captures an optimal region within the double-barrier space for further torque ripple reduction.	[Mohammadi, M.

Sex-related differences in age-associated downregulation of human ventricular myocardial beta(1)-adrenergic receptors	JOURNAL OF HEART AND LUNG TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article						ventricular myocardium; left ventricle; sex differences; beta(1)-adrenergic receptors; age; heart failure	ADRENERGIC NEUROEFFECTOR SYSTEMS; FAILING HUMAN-HEART; DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; CARDIAC-FUNCTION; GENE-EXPRESSION; BRAIN-INJURY; BETA; FAILURE; RESPONSES; STIMULATION	BACKGROUND: With increasing age, human ventricular myocardium exhibits selective downregulation of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (beta(1)-ARs). We tested the hypothesis that sex differences exist in age-related changes in beta(1)-ARs. METHODS: Left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular tissue was obtained from 61 unplaceable potential organ donor hearts ages 1 to 71 years with no known cardiac history and from LVs removed from 56 transplant recipients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. beta(1)-AR and beta(2)-AR densities, the frequency of beta(1)-AR389 gene variants, and beta-AR function were determined. RESULTS: Sex had a marked effect on the age-related decrease in beta(1)-ARs. Female LVs had more pronounced downregulation (by 42% [p < 0.001] vs 22% [p = 0.21] in 31 male LVs) comparing the youngest (average age, 15.3 +/- 5.5 years) to the oldest (average age, 50.8 +/- 9.1 years) sub-groups. On regression analyses, female LVs exhibited a closer relationship between beta(1)-AR density and age (r = -0.78, p < 0.001 vs r = -0.46, p = 0.009 in males), with a second-degree polynomial yielding the best fit. There was no statistically significant relationship of beta(1)-ARs to age in female or male idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy LVs. CONCLUSIONS: Sex affects age-related beta-AR downregulation in normal human ventricles, with females exhibiting more profound decreases with increasing age. The curvilinear relationship between age and receptor density that plateaus around age 40 in women suggests an effect of sex hormones on beta(1)-AR expression in the human heart.

These anxieties are linked to the dizziness of choices available to it, and the degree to which every move to compensate for anxieties produces its own form of anxiety. This article surveys ten distinct anxieties that are deemed to be constitutive of the movement. Ultimately, it argues that the neurotic nature of international criminal justice can be the source of its creativity and resilience.

It is now established that 20-40% of persons with PD will develop cognitive deficits early in the disease. Moreover, the risk of developing dementia is six times higher in PD patients than in age-matched controls and it is estimated that 80% of patients will develop dementia after 20 years of the disease. In order to address these symptoms properly it is crucial to identify very early in the disease the patients who are most likely to develop dementia rapidly. Persons who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibit measurable cognitive deficits but those deficits are not severe enough to interfere significantly with daily life. While the presence of MCI in PD increases the chance of developing dementia, various studies suggest that PD-MCI might consist of distinct subtypes with different pathophysiologies and prognoses. In this paper we comment on various biomarkers associated with cognitive decline in PD, specifically clinical, neuropathological, genetic and neuroimaging ones. We also discuss disrupted functional connectivity in PD-MCI and reveal preliminary results from our own group. We propose that the current studies looking at different types of biomarkers provide support for different causes being associated with cognitive decline in PD. Large-scale multi-disciplinary and multi-modal longitudinal studies are required to identify more specifically the different phenotypes associated with different cognitive profiles and evolution in PD.

In this paper, we propose and analyze a new clustering approach based on both hierarchical Dirichlet processes and the generalized Dirichlet distribution, which leads to an interesting statistical framework for data analysis and modelling. Our approach can be viewed as a hierarchical extension of the infinite generalized Dirichlet mixture model previously proposed in Bouguila and Ziou (IEEE Trans Neural Netw 21(1): 107-122, 2010). The proposed clustering approach tackles the problem of modelling grouped data where observations are organized into groups that we allow to remain statistically linked by sharing mixture components. The resulting clustering model is learned using a principled variational Bayes inference-based algorithm that we have developed. Extensive experiments and simulations, based on two challenging applications namely images categorization and web service intrusion detection, demonstrate our model usefulness and merits.

However, the relative importance of the 5-HT and NE systems in these effects and on effects of URB597 on postsynaptic 5-HT receptors remain to be determined. Using behavioural and electrophysiological approaches, we assessed the effects of acute-single and repeated URB597 treatment on responses predicting antidepressant/anxiolytic activity, and on hippocampal 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A/C receptor sensitivity. Acute-single or serial URB597 treatment, compared to vehicle, reduced immobility in the forced swim test (FST), increased open arm visits in the elevated plus maze and shortened feeding latency in the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT). Repeated URB597 treatment yielded more profound behavioural effects, which were associated with an increase in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The 5-HT synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenytalanine (pCPA), but not the NE neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) prevented URB597-mediated antidepressant/anxiolytic-like response in the FST and NSFT, while DSP4 did not further affect URB597-mediated increase in raphe 5-HT neuron firing. Repeated URB597 administration decreased hippocampal pyramidal firing in response to 5-HT2A/C and 5-HT1A, stimulation with 1[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane (DOI) and 8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), respectively, suggesting plastic adaptation of these receptors. The effects of acute-single and repeated URB597 administration on hippocampal cell firing in response to DOI or 8-OH-DPAT were similar in magnitude and intensity to the positive control citalopram. These data indicate that URB597 acts, either directly or indirectly, on the 5-HT system, increases hippocampal BDNF expression, and modifies 5 -HT1A and 5-HT2A/C function.

Familial prion protein mutants inhibit Hrd1-mediated retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins by depleting misfolded protein sensor BiP	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; ANTI-BAX FUNCTION; CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB-DISEASE; ER-ASSOCIATED DEGRADATION; HUMAN HRD1; TRANSCRIPTIONAL INDUCTION; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; QUALITY-CONTROL; UBIQUITIN; PATHWAY	Similar to many proteins trafficking through the secretory pathway, cellular prion protein (PrP) partly retrotranslocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway in an attempt to alleviate accumulation of cellular misfolded PrP. Surprisingly, familial PrP mutants fail to retrotranslocate and simultaneously block normal cellular PrP retrotranslocation. That impairments in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins could lead to global disruptions in cellular homeostasis prompted further investigations into PrP mutant retrotranslocation defects. A gain-and loss-of-function approach identified human E3 ubiquitin ligase, Hrd1, as a critical regulator of PrP retrotranslocation in mammalian cells. Expression of familial human PrP mutants, V210I(129V) and M232R(129V), not only abolished PrP retrotranslocation, but also that of Hrd1-dependent ERAD substrates, transthyretin TTRD18G and alpha 1-anti-trypsin A1AT(NHK). Mutant PrP expression decreased binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) levels by 50% and attenuated ER stress-induced BiP by increasing BiP turnover 6-fold. Overexpression of BiP with PrP mutants rescued retrotranslocation of PrP, TTRD18G and A1AT(NHK). PrP mutants-induced cell death was also rescued by co-expression of BiP. These results show that PrP mutants highjack the Hrd1-dependent ERAD pathway, an action that would result in misfolded protein accumulation especially in terminally differentiated neurons. This could explain the age-dependent neuronal degeneration in familial prion diseases.

The proposed control scheme has been realized at both kinematics and dynamics levels. The kinematics predictive steering controller generates command of desired velocities that are achieved by employing a low-level motion controller, while the dynamics predictive controller directly generates torques used to steer the WMR to the target. In the presence of both kinematics and dynamics constraints, the control design is carried out using quadratic programming (QP) for optimal performance. The neurodynamic optimization technique, particularly the primal-dual neural network, is employed to solve the QP problems. Theoretical analysis has been first performed to show that the desired velocities can be achieved with the guaranteed stability, as well as with the global convergence to the optimal solutions of formulated convex programming problems. Experiments have then been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and illustrate its advantage over the conventional methods.

It has been suggested that the low-voltage, fast onset pattern is mainly contributed by interneuronal (c-aminobutyric acidergic) signaling, whereas the hypersynchronous onset involves the activation of principal (glutamatergic) cells. Methods: Here, we tested this hypothesis using the optogenetic control of parvalbumin-positive or somatostatinpositive interneurons and of calmodulin-dependent, protein kinase-positive, principal cells in the mouse entorhinal cortex in the in vitro 4-aminopyridine model of epileptiform synchronization. Results: We found that during 4-aminopyridine application, both spontaneous seizure-like events and those induced by optogenetic activation of interneurons displayed low-voltage, fast onset patterns that were associated with a higher occurrence of ripples than of fast ripples. In contrast, seizures induced by the optogenetic activation of principal cells had a hypersynchronous onset pattern with fast ripple rates that were higher than those of ripples. Interpretation: Our results firmly establish that under a similar experimental condition (ie, bath application of 4-aminopyridine), the initiation of low-voltage, fast and of hypersynchronous onset seizures in the entorhinal cortex depends on the preponderant involvement of interneuronal and principal cell networks, respectively.

However, misclassification due to between-worker variability remains an unsolved challenge. A source-based approach, supported by detailed subject data on determinants of exposure, may allow for a more individualized exposure assessment. Detailed information on the use of occupational sources of exposure to EMF was collected as part of the INTERPHONE-INTEROCC study. To support a source-based exposure assessment effort within this study, this work aimed to construct a measurement database for the occupational sources of EMF exposure identified, assembling available measurements from the scientific literature. First, a comprehensive literature search was performed for published and unpublished documents containing exposure measurements for the EMF sources identified, a priori as well as from answers of study subjects. Then, the measurements identified were assessed for quality and relevance to the study objectives. Finally, the measurements selected and complementary information were compiled into an Occupational Exposure Measurement Database (OEMD). Currently, the OEMD contains 1624 sets of measurements (> 3000 entries) for 285 sources of EMF exposure, organized by frequency band (0 Hz to 300 GHz) and dosimetry type. Ninety-five documents were selected from the literature (almost 35% of them are unpublished technical reports), containing measurements which were considered informative and valid for our purpose. Measurement data and complementary information collected from these documents came from 16 different countries and cover the time period between 1974 and 2013. We have constructed a database with measurements and complementary information for the most common sources of exposure to EMF in the workplace, based on the responses to the INTERPHONE-INTEROCC study questionnaire. This database covers the entire EMF frequency range and represents the most comprehensive resource of information on occupational EMF exposure. It is available at .

Intricate interactions between the different cellular constituents of the BBB are crucial in establishing a functional BBB and maintaining the delicate homeostasis of the CNS microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the role of astrocytes and microglia in inducing and maintaining barrier properties under physiological conditions as well as their involvement during neuroinflammatory pathologies.

In the present study, we set out to determine the familiarity of temporal cortex morphologic alterations in a cohort of MTLE+HS patients and their asymptomatic siblings. A surface-based morphometry (SBM) method was applied to process MRI data acquired from 140 individuals (50 patients with unilateral MTLE+HS, 50 asymptomatic siblings of patients, and 40 healthy controls). Using a region-of-interest approach, alterations in temporal cortex morphology were determined in patients and their asymptomatic siblings by comparing with the controls. Alterations in temporal cortex morphology were identified in MTLE+HS patients ipsilaterally within the anterio-medial regions, including the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal pole. Subtle but similar pattern of morphology changes with a medium effect size were also noted in the asymptomatic siblings. These localized alterations were related to volume loss that appeared driven by shared contractions in cerebral cortex surface area. These findings indicate that temporal cortex morphologic alterations are common to patients and their asymptomatic siblings and suggest that such localized traits are possibly heritable.

To date, it remains disputed whether this deficit results from disrupted object or space perception. We asked both healthy participants as well as a patient with simultanagnosia to perform different visual search tasks of variable difficulty. We also modulated the number of objects (target and distracters) presented. For healthy participants, we found that each visual search task was performed with a specific "attentional field" depending on the difficulty of visual object processing but not on the number of objects falling within this "working space." This was demonstrated by measuring the cost in reaction times using different gaze-contingent visible window sizes. We found that bilateral damage to the superior parietal lobule impairs the spatial integration of separable features (within-object processing), shrinking the attentional field in which a target can be detected, but causing no deficit in processing multiple objects per se.

A flawed classification of items may lead to financial losses and customers dissatisfaction. This paper presents a technique for the identification and the correction of the bias that exists in the ABC items classification done by inventory experts and decision makers. In this study, the classification familiarity bias is found and rectified through patterns recognition. A pattern based reclassification is proposed using a multi-class model based on Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). Accuracy prediction tests are conducted in order to evaluate the proposed pattern based classification. The results are compared with the classification obtained based on the Euclidean distance.

Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Three 10-bed ICUs (two medical and one surgical) at an academic medical center in the United States. Patients: Sixty-eight mechanically ventilated patients with subsyndromal delirium without complicating neurologic conditions, cardiac surgery, or requiring deep sedation. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive IV haloperidol 1 mg or placebo every 6 hours until delirium occurred (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist >= 4 with psychiatric confirmation), 10 days of therapy had elapsed, or ICU discharge. Measurements and Main Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between the haloperidol (n = 34) and placebo (n = 34) groups. A similar number of patients given haloperidol (12/34 [35%]) and placebo (8/34 [23%]) developed delirium (p = 0.29). Haloperidol use reduced the hours per study day spent agitated (Sedation Agitation Scale >= 5) (p = 0.008), but it did not influence the proportion of 12-hour ICU shifts patients spent alive without coma (Sedation Agitation Scale <= 2) or delirium (p = 0.36), the time to first delirium occurrence (p = 0.22), nor delirium duration (p = 0.26). Days of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.80), ICU mortality (p = 0.55), and ICU patient disposition (p = 0.22) were similar in the two groups. The proportion of patients who developed corrected QT-interval prolongation (p = 0.16), extrapyramidal symptoms (p = 0.31), excessive sedation (p = 0.31), or new-onset hypotension (p = 1.0) that resulted in study drug discontinuation was comparable between the two groups. Conclusions: Low-dose scheduled haloperidol, initiated early in the ICU stay, does not prevent delirium and has little therapeutic advantage in mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults with subsyndromal delirium.

We reveal that translational control by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor elF2a (p-elF2a) accounts for adolescent hypersensitivity to cocaine. In adolescent (but not adult) mice, a low dose of cocaine reduced pelF2a in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), potentiated synaptic inputs to VTA dopaminergic neurons, and induced drug -reinforced behavior. Like adolescents, adult mice with reduced p-elF2-amediated translational control were more susceptible to cocaine -induced synaptic potentiation and behavior. Conversely, like adults, adolescent mice with increased p-eIF2a became more resistant to cocaine's effects. Accordingly, metabotropic glutamate receptor -mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) whose disruption is postulated to increase vulnerability to drug addiction was impaired in both adolescent mice and adult mice with reduced p-eIF2a mediated translation. Thus, during addiction, cocaine hijacks translational control by p-eIF2a, initiating synaptic potentiation and addiction -related behaviors. These insights may hold promise for new treatments for addiction.

In a companion study, we found that reduced activity of the translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha underlies the hypersensitivity of adolescent mice to the effects of cocaine. Here we report that nicotine potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons more readily in adolescent mice compared to adults. Adult mice with genetic or pharmacological reduction in p-eIF2 alpha-mediated translation are more susceptible to nicotine's synaptic effects, like adolescents. When we investigated the influence of allelic variability of the Eif2s1 gene (encoding eIF2 alpha) on reward -related neuronal responses in human smokers, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the Eif2s1 gene modulates mesolimbic neuronal reward responses in human smokers. These findings suggest that p-eIF2 alpha regulates synaptic actions of nicotine in both mice and humans, and that reduced p-eIF2 alpha may enhance susceptibility to nicotine (and other drugs of abuse) during adolescence.

The diagnostic accuracy of routine electroencephalography after a first unprovoked seizure	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Review						clinical neurophysiology; electroencephalography; epilepsy; sensitivity; specificity	QUALITY STANDARDS SUBCOMMITTEE; AMERICAN-EPILEPSY-SOCIETY; TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE; EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP; PRACTICE PARAMETER; RECURRENCE; RISK; CHILDHOOD; DEFINITION; NEUROLOGY	The clinical utility of routine electroencephalography (EEG) after a first unprovoked seizure remains uncertain. Its diagnostic accuracy in identifying adults and children with new onset epilepsy was examined. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining individuals who underwent routine EEG after a first unprovoked seizure and were followed for seizure recurrence for at least 1year was performed. A positive' test was defined by the presence of epileptiform discharges (ED). Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated using a bivariate random effects regression model. In all, 3096 records were reviewed, from which 15 studies were extracted with a total of 1799 participants. Amongst adult studies, the sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) of routine EEG were 17.3% (7.9, 33.8) and 94.7% (73.7, 99.1), respectively. Amongst child studies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 57.8% (49.7, 65.6) and 69.6% (57.5, 79.5), respectively. Based upon our positive likelihood ratios, and assuming a pre-test probability of 50%, an adult with ED on routine EEG after a first unprovoked seizure has a 77% probability of having a second seizure, whilst a child with similar findings has a 66% probability. Further studies are required to examine the impact of patient characteristics and EEG features on the diagnostic accuracy of routine EEG for new onset epilepsy.

Gait phenotype from mild cognitive impairment to moderate dementia: results from the GOOD initiative	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						aging; Alzheimer's disease; cohort studies; dementia; gait disorders; mild cognitive impairment; motor control; quantitative gait parameters	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; LOCOMOTOR FUNCTION; RISK; VARIABILITY; DECLINE; BRAIN; FALLS; DISTURBANCES	Background and purposeThe differences in gait abnormalities from the earliest to the later stages of dementia and in the different subtypes of dementia have not been fully examined. This study aims to compare spatiotemporal gait parameters in cognitively healthy individuals, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and non-amnestic MCI, and patients with mild and moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-Alzheimer's disease (non-AD). MethodsBased on a cross-sectional design, 1719 participants (77.4 7.3 years, 53.9% female) were recruited from cohorts from seven countries participating in the Gait, Cognition and Decline (GOOD) initiative. Mean values and coefficients of variation of spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured during normal pace walking with the GAITRite system at all sites. ResultsPerformance of spatiotemporal gait parameters declined in parallel with the stage of cognitive decline from MCI status to moderate dementia. Gait parameters of patients with non-amnestic MCI were more disturbed compared to patients with amnestic MCI, and MCI subgroups performed better than demented patients. Patients with non-AD dementia had worse gait performance than those with AD dementia. This degradation of gait parameters was similar between mean values and coefficients of variation of spatiotemporal gait parameters in the earliest stages of cognitive decline, but different in the most advanced stages, especially in the non-AD subtypes. ConclusionsSpatiotemporal gait parameters were more disturbed in the advanced stages of dementia, and more affected in the non-AD dementias than in AD. These findings suggest that quantitative gait parameters could be used as a surrogate marker for improving the diagnosis of dementia. Click to view the accompanying paper in this issue.

Transfer of tactile perceptual learning to untrained neighboring fingers reflects natural use relationships	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						perceptual learning; primary somatosensory cortex; co-activation; generalization; topography	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ADULT OWL MONKEYS; REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; HUMAN HAND; AREA 3B; ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; POSTCENTRAL GYRUS	Tactile learning transfers from trained to untrained fingers in a pattern that reflects overlap between the representations of fingers in the somatosensory system (e.g., neurons with multifinger receptive fields). While physical proximity on the body is known to determine the topography of somatosensory representations, tactile coactivation is also an established organizing principle of somatosensory topography. In this study we investigated whether tactile coactivation, induced by habitual inter-finger cooperative use (use pattern), shapes inter-finger overlap. To this end, we used psychophysics to compare the transfer of tactile learning from the middle finger to its adjacent fingers. This allowed us to compare transfer to two fingers that are both physically and cortically adjacent to the middle finger but have differing use patterns. Specifically, the middle finger is used more frequently with the ring than with the index finger. We predicted this should lead to greater representational overlap between the former than the latter pair. Furthermore, this difference in overlap should be reflected in differential learning transfer from the middle to index vs. ring fingers. Subsequently, we predicted temporary learning-related changes in the middle finger's representation (e.g., cortical magnification) would cause transient interference in perceptual thresholds of the ring, but not the index, finger. Supporting this, longitudinal analysis revealed a divergence where learning transfer was fast to the index finger but relatively delayed to the ring finger. Our results support the theory that tactile coactivation patterns between digits affect their topographic relationships. Our findings emphasize how action shapes perception and somatosensory organization.

First-Line Afatinib versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Common Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene Mutations and Brain Metastases	JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Afatinib; NSCLC; Brain metastases; Epidermal growth factor receptor	TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS; ERBB FAMILY BLOCKER; HIGH-DOSE ERLOTINIB; EGFR MUTATIONS; PHASE-III; ADENOCARCINOMA; MANAGEMENT; SURVIVAL; RADIOTHERAPY; GEFITINIB	Introduction: Metastatic spread to the brain is common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but these patients are generally excluded from prospective clinical trials. The studies, phase III study of afatinib or cisplatin plus pemetrexed in patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations (LUX-Lung 3) and a randomized, open-label, phase III study of BIBW 2992 versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR activating mutation (LUX-Lung 6) investigated first-line afatinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation positive patients with NSCLC and included patients with brain metastases; prespecified subgroup analyses are assessed in this article. Methods: For both LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6, prespecified subgroup analyses of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and objective response rate were undertaken in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline (n = 35 and n = 46, respectively). Post hoc analyses of clinical outcomes was undertaken in the combined data set (n = 81). Results: In both studies, there was a trend toward improved PFS with afatinib versus chemotherapy in patients with brain metastases (LUX-Lung 3:11.1 versus 5.4 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54, p = 0.1378; LUX-Lung 6:8.2 versus 4.7 months, HR = 0.47, p = 0.1060). The magnitude of PFS improvement with afatinib was similar to that observed in patients without brain metastases. In combined analysis, PFS was significantly improved with afatinib versus with chemotherapy in patients with brain metastases (8.2 versus 5.4 months; HR, 0.50; p = 0.0297). Afatinib significantly improved the objective response rate versus chemotherapy in patients with brain metastases. Safety findings were consistent with previous reports. Conclusions: These findings lend support to the clinical activity of afatinib in EGFR mutation-positive patients with NSCLC and asymptomatic brain metastases.

In the brain, AMPARs assemble with a number of auxiliary subunits, including TARPs, CNIHs and CKAMP44, which are important for AMPAR forward trafficking to synapses. Here we report that the membrane protein GSG1L negatively regulates AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Overexpression of GSG1L strongly suppresses, and GSG1L knockout (KO) enhances, AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. GSG1L-dependent regulation of AMPAR synaptic transmission relies on the first extracellular loop domain and its carboxyl-terminus. GSG1L also speeds up AMPAR deactivation and desensitization in hippocampal CA1 neurons, in contrast to the effects of TARPs and CNIHs. Furthermore, GSG1L association with AMPARs inhibits CNIH2-induced slowing of the receptors in heterologous cells. Finally, GSG1L KO rats have deficits in LTP and show behavioural abnormalities in object recognition tests. These data demonstrate that GSG1L represents a new class of auxiliary subunit with distinct functional properties for AMPARs.

Pediatric Donation After Circulatory Determination of Death: A Scoping Review*	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Review						literature review; ethics; withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy; scoping review; donation after circulatory death; organ donation; end of life care	NEONATAL ORGAN DONATION; FULL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE; HEART-BEATING DONORS; ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; CARDIAC DEATH; POLICY STATEMENT; CRITICAL-CARE; CARDIOCIRCULATORY DEATH; LUNG TRANSPLANTATION; CHILDRENS HOSPITALS	Objective: Although pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death is increasing in frequency, there are no national or international donation after circulatory determination of death guidelines specific to pediatrics. This scoping review was performed to map the pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death literature, identify pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death knowledge gaps, and inform the development of national or regional pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death guidelines. Data Sources: Terms related to pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death were searched in Embase and MEDLINE, as well as the non-MEDLINE sources in PubMed from 1980 to May 2014. Study Selection: Seven thousand five hundred ninety-seven references were discovered and 85 retained for analysis. All references addressing pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death were considered. Exclusion criteria were articles that did not address pediatric patients, animal or laboratory studies, surgical techniques, and local pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death protocols. Narrative reviews and opinion articles were the most frequently discovered reference (25/85) and the few discovered studies were observational or qualitative and almost exclusively retrospective. Data Extraction Retained references were divided into themes and analyzed using qualitative methodology. Data Synthesis: The main discovered themes were 1) studies estimating the number of potential pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death donors and their impact on donation; 2) ethical issues in pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death; 3) physiology of the dying process after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy; 4) cardiac pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death; and 5) neonatal pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death. Donor estimates suggest that pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death will remain an event less common than brain death, albeit with the potential to substantially expand the existing organ donation pool. Limited data suggest outcomes comparable with organs donated after neurologic determination of death. Although there is continued debate around ethical aspects of pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death, all pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death publications from professional societies contend that pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death can be practiced ethically. Conclusions: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the published literature related to pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death. In addition to informing the development of pediatric-specific guidelines, this review serves to highlight several important knowledge gaps in this topic.

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 type II (Cas9) system has emerged as a simple and inexpensive tool for editing genomic loci of interest in a variety of animal models. In zebrafish, error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) has been used as a simple method to disrupt gene function. We sought to develop a method to easily create site-specific SNPs in the zebrafish genome. Here, we report simple methodologies for using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair using single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide donor templates (ssODN) for site-directed single nucleotide editing, for the first time in two disease-related genes, tardbp and fus.

Methods- INTERACT2 was an international prospective, open, blinded end point, randomized controlled trial of 2839 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (< 6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (systolic blood pressure < 180 mm Hg) BP management. Associations of hyperglycemia at presentation (> 6.5 mmol/L) and combined and separate poor outcomes of death and major disability (scores of 3-6, 3-5, and 6, respectively, on the modified Rankin scale) at 90 days were determined in logistic regression models. Results- In 2653 patients with available data, there were 1348 (61%) with hyperglycemia and 292 (11%) with diabetes mellitus. Associations of baseline blood glucose and poor outcome were strong and near continuous. After adjustment for baseline variables, the highest fourth (7.9-25.0 mmol/L) of blood glucose was significantly associated with combined poor outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.80; P trend 0.015). Diabetes mellitus also predicted poor outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.02; P=0.023), though more important for residual disability than death on separate analysis. Conclusions- Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus are independent predictors of poor outcome in patients with predominantly mild to moderate severity of intracerebral hemorrhage. These data support guideline recommendations for good glycemic control in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: [GRAPHICS] . Unique identifier: NCT00716079.

INTERACT2 Investigators	Significance of Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage	STROKE			English	Article						cerebral small vessel disease; stroke; hypertension; cerebral hemorrhage; blood pressure	WHITE-MATTER LESIONS; VASOMOTOR REACTIVITY; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; STROKE TRIAL; LEUKOARAIOSIS; BRAIN; CT; MRI; ASSOCIATION; IMPAIRMENT	Background and Purpose- The significance of structural changes associated with cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD), including white matter lesions (WML), lacunes, and brain atrophy, to outcome from acute intracerebral hemorrhage is uncertain. We determined associations of computed tomographic radiological manifestations of cerebral SVD and outcomes, and in terms of any differential effect of early intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment, in the large-scale Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). Methods- We graded WML (van Swieten scale), the presence of lacunes, and brain atrophy (2 linear measurements and visual rating) for 2069 of 2839 patients with available baseline brain computed tomography (< 6 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage onset) by 3 independent neurologists blind to clinical data. Results- WML grade and 2 linear measurements of brain atrophy were associated with death or major disability at 90 days: multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for WML (grade 3 and 4 versus 0), frontal ratio, and third ventricle Sylvian fissure distance (most versus least severe atrophy quartile) were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.98), 1.47 (1.08-1.99), and 1.64 (1.21-2.22), respectively (all P for trend < 0.05). There was no association between lacunes and outcomes. There were no significant differences in the effects of intensive blood pressure-lowering across subgroups of cerebral SVD. Conclusions- Preexisting cerebral SVD manifestations of WML and brain atrophy predict poor outcome in acute intracerebral hemorrhage. There is no apparent hazard of early intensive lowering of blood pressure according to the INTERACT2 protocol, in patients with underlying cerebral SVD. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: [GRAPHICS] .

ESCAPE Trial Investigators	Intra-Arterial Therapy and Post-Treatment Infarct Volumes Insights From the ESCAPE Randomized Controlled Trial	STROKE			English	Article						management; modified Rankin Scale; stroke; ischemic stroke; infarct size; cerebrovascular disease/stroke	PERFUSION IMAGING EVALUATION; STROKE EVOLUTION DEFUSE; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; OUTCOME MEASURES; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; RECANALIZATION; REPERFUSION; DIFFUSION; OCCLUSION	Background and Purpose- The goal of reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke is to limit brain infarction. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment on functional outcome could be explained by a reduction in post-treatment infarct volume. Methods- The Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial was a multicenter randomized open-label trial with blinded outcome evaluation. Among 315 enrolled subjects (endovascular treatment n=165; control n=150), 314 subject's infarct volumes at 24 to 48 hours on magnetic resonance imaging (n=254) or computed tomography (n=60) were measured. Post-treatment infarct volumes were compared by treatment assignment and recanalization/reperfusion status. Appropriate statistical models were used to assess relationship between baseline clinical and imaging variables, post-treatment infarct volume, and functional status at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale). Results- Median post-treatment infarct volume in all subjects was 21 mL (interquartile range =65 mL), in the intervention arm, 15.5 mL (interquartile range =41.5 mL), and in the control arm, 33.5 mL (interquartile range =84 mL; P < 0.01). Baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (P < 0.01), site of occlusion (P < 0.01), baseline noncontrast computed tomographic scan Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS) (P < 0.01), and recanalization (P < 0.01) were independently associated with post-treatment infarct volume, whereas age, sex, treatment type, intravenous alteplase, and time from onset to randomization were not (P > 0.05). Post-treatment infarct volume (P < 0.01) and delta National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (P < 0.01) were independently associated with 90-day modified Rankin Scale, whereas laterality (left versus right) was not. Conclusions- These results support the primary results of the ESCAPE trial and show that the biological underpinning of the success of endovascular therapy is a reduction in infarct volume.

Methods- Patient-level data were pooled from trials in which the Solitaire was the only or the predominant device used in a prespecified meta-analysis (SEER Collaboration): Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME), Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE), Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits-Intra-Arterial (EXTEND-IA), and Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset (REVASCAT). The primary outcome was ordinal analysis of modified Rankin Score at 90 days. The primary analysis included all patients in the 4 trials with 2 sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding patients in whom Solitaire was not the first device used and (2) including the 3 Solitaire-only trials (excluding ESCAPE). Secondary outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0-2), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality. Results- The primary analysis included 787 patients: 401 randomized to endovascular thrombectomy and 386 to standard care, and 82.6% received intravenous thrombolysis. The common odds ratio for modified Rankin Score improvement was 2.7 (2.0-3.5) with no heterogeneity in effect by age, sex, baseline stroke severity, extent of computed tomography changes, site of occlusion, or pretreatment with alteplase. The number needed to treat to reduce disability was 2.5 and for an extra patient to achieve independent outcome was 4.25 (3.29-5.99). Successful revascularization occurred in 77% treated with Solitaire device. The rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and overall mortality did not differ between treatment groups. Conclusions- Solitaire thrombectomy for large vessel ischemic stroke was safe and highly effective with substantially reduced disability. Benefits were consistent in all prespecified subgroups.

Canadian Glaucoma Study Grp	Neuroretinal Rim Area Change in Glaucoma Patients With Visual Field Progression Endpoints and Intraocular Pressure Reduction. The Canadian Glaucoma Study: 4	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA; FIBER LAYER PROGRESSION; NORMAL-TENSION GLAUCOMA; OCULAR HYPERTENSION; STRUCTURAL-CHANGE; RISK-FACTORS; OPTIC DISC; RATES; TRIAL; REGRESSION	PURPOSE: To compare rim area rates in patients with and without the visual field (VF) progression endpoint in the Canadian Glaucoma Study and determine whether intraocular pressure (TOP) reduction following the endpoint altered rim area rate. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter cohort study. METHODS: SETTING: University hospitals. PATIENT POPULATION: Two hundred and six patients with open-angle glaucoma were examined at 4-month intervals with standard automated perimetry and confocal scanning laser tomography. INTERVENTION: After the endpoint, IOP was reduced by 2.0%. OUTCOME MEASURES: Univariate analysis for change in rim area rate and multivariable analysis to adjust for independent covariates (eg, age, sex, and IOP). RESULTS: Patients with an endpoint (n = 59) had a worse rim area rate prior to the endpoint compared to those without (n = 147; median [interquartile range]: -14 [-32, 11] x 10(-3) mm(2)/y and -5 [-14, 5] X 10(-3) mm(2)/y, respectively, P=.02). In univariate analysis, there was no difference in rim area rate before and after the endpoint (median difference [95% CI], 8 (-10, 24) x 10(-3) mm(2)/y), but the muItivariate analysis showed that IOP reduction >2 mm Hg after the endpoint was strongly linked to a reduction in rim area rate decline (8 x 10(-3) mm(2)/y for each additional 1 mm Hg reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a VF endpoint had a median rim area rate that was nearly 3 times worse than those without an endpoint. Lower mean follow-up IOP was independently associated with a slower decline in rim area. (C) 2016 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Disruption of structural covariance networks for language in autism is modulated by verbal ability	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						ASD; Verbal IQ; Language; Brain asymmetry; Structural covariance	CORTICAL THICKNESS ANALYSIS; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL GYRUS; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; WHITE-MATTER; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; SYMPTOM SEVERITY	The presence of widespread speech and language deficits is a core feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These impairments have often been attributed to altered connections between brain regions. Recent developments in anatomical correlation-based approaches to map structural covariance offer an effective way of studying such connections in vivo. In this study, we employed such a structural covariance network (SCN)-based approach to investigate the integrity of anatomical networks in fronto-temporal brain regions of twenty children with ASD compared to an age and gender-matched control group of twenty-two children. Our findings reflected large-scale disruption of inter and intrahemispheric covariance in left frontal SCNs in the ASD group compared to controls, but no differences in right fronto-temporal SCNs. Interhemispheric covariance in left-seeded networks was further found to be modulated by verbal ability of the participants irrespective of autism diagnosis, suggesting that language function might be related to the strength of interhemispheric structural covariance between frontal regions. Additionally, regional cortical thickening was observed in right frontal and left posterior regions, which was predicted by decreasing symptom severity and increasing verbal ability in ASD. These findings unify reports of regional differences in cortical morphology in ASD. They also suggest that reduced left hemisphere asymmetry and increased frontal growth may not only reflect neurodevelopmental aberrations but also compensatory mechanisms.

The development and appropriate use of new immunosupressants have considerably improved the outcome of patients in the last decades. However, noninvasive, sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection of complications leading to graft dysfunction are still needed. Current transplantation monitoring mostly relies on non-specific biochemical tests whereas diagnosis of rejection is generally based on invasive procedures such as biopsies. New approaches based on large scale profiling of body fluids and tissues are needed to address the complexity and multifactorial aspect of organ transplantation complications. Metabolomics aim to characterize and quantify the metabolome, which is the collection of the low-molecular weight compounds rising from metabolic pathways. Extracted from tissues or detected in body fluids, the small molecules are measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. By profiling the downstream products of cellular activity, metabolomics is most likely to represent the immediate cellular response to stresses. Diagnostic applications have been proposed in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, neurological diseases and many more. This review will focus on the potential applications of metabolomics in organ transplantation including follow up of graft function recovery, diagnostic of alloimmune rejection as well as monitoring of immunosuppressant toxicity.

However, questions remain about the impact of chronic exposure to lead-contaminated water on internal dose. Objective: Our goal was to estimate the relation between a cumulative water Pb exposure index (CWLEI) and blood Pb levels (BPb) in children 1-5 years of ages. METHODS: Between 10 September 2009 and 27 March 2010, individual characteristics and water consumption data were obtained from 298 children. Venous blood samples were collected (one per child) and a total of five 1-L samples of water per home were drawn from the kitchen tap. A second round of water collection was performed between 22 June 2011 and 6 September 2011 on a subsample of houses. Pb analyses used inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Multiple linear regressions were used to estimate the association between CWLEI and BPb. RESULTS: Each 1-unit increase in CWLEI multiplies the expected value of BPb by 1.10 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.15) after adjustment for confounders. Mean BPb was significantly higher in children in the upper third and fourth quartiles of CWLEI (0.7-1.9 and >= 1.9 mu g/kg of body weight) compared with the first (< 0.2 mu g/kg) after adjusting for confounders (19%; 95% CI: 0, 42% and 39%; 95% CI: 15, 67%, respectively). The trends analysis yielded a p-value < 0.0001 after adjusting for confounders suggesting a dose-response relationship between percentiles of CWLEI and BPb. CONCLUSIONS: In children 1-5 years of age, BPb was significantly associated with water lead concentration with an increase starting at a cumulative lead exposure of >= 0.7 mu g Pb/kg of body weight. In this age group, an increase of 1 mu g/L in water lead would result in an increase of 35% of BPb after 150 days of exposure.

However, the extent of the visual areas involved after lower limb amputation remains uncertain. In this investigation, we studied 48 adult patients with unilateral lower limb amputation and 48 matched healthy controls using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Template-based regions of interest analysis was implemented to detect the changes of cortical thickness in the specific visual areas. Compared with normal controls, amputees exhibited significantly lower thickness in the V5/middle temporal (V5/MT+) visual area, as well as a trend of cortical thinning in the V3d. There was no significant difference in the other visual areas between the two groups. In addition, no significant difference of cortical thickness was found between patients with amputation at different levels. Across all amputees, correlation analyses revealed that the cortical thickness of the V5/MT+ was negatively correlated to the time since amputation. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the amputation of unilateral lower limb could induce changes in the motor-related visual cortex and provide an update on the plasticity of the human brain after limb injury.

Pyramidal neurons in the superficial and deep layers of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex (EC) display this property of prolonged firing activity. Here, we focused on the regulation of this activity in EC neurons by mature brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor proBDNF. Results: Using patch clamp electrophysiology in acute mouse cortical slices, we observed that BDNF facilitates cholinergic PF in pyramidal neurons in layer V of the medial EC. Inhibition of TrkB with K252a blocks the potentiating effect of BDNF whereas inhibition of p75NTR with function-blocking antibodies does not. By recording spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSC), we find that BDNF acts pre-synaptically via TrkB to increase glutamate release whereas proBDNF acting via p75NTR acts to reduce it. MPEP abolished the facilitating effect of BDNF on PF, demonstrating that the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 plays a critical role in the BDNF effect. In contrast, paired pulse ratio and EPSC measurements indicated that proBDNF, via presynaptic p75NTR, is a negative regulator of glutamate release in the EC. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the BDNF/TrkB pathway facilitates persistent activity whereas the proBDNF/p75NTR pathway inhibits this mnemonic property of entorhinal pyramidal neurons.

A method is presented for real-time shim and motion correction (ShMoCo) using volumetric navigators to correct for motion and motion-related B-0 inhomogeneity during MSpc acquisition. A phantom experiment demonstrates that ShMoCo restores the GABA peak and improves spectral quality in the presence of motion and zero- and first-order shim changes. The ShMoCo scans were validated in three subjects who performed up-down and left-right head rotations. Qualitative assessment of these scans indicates effective reduction of subtraction artefacts and well edited GABA peaks, while quantitative analysis indicates superior fitting and spectral quality relative to scans with no correction.

A pilot study of active rehabilitation for adolescents who are slow to recover from sport-related concussion	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS			English	Article						Pediatric; mild traumatic brain injury; children; physiotherapy; sports; post-concussion symptoms; aerobics	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; OF-THE-LITERATURE; INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; VOLUNTARY EXERCISE; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; CONTUSION INJURY; TEMPORAL WINDOW; DEPRESSION	The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an active rehabilitation intervention for adolescents who are slow-to-recover after a sport-related concussion. Ten adolescents (three girls and seven boys) seen at the Montreal Children's Hospital Concussion Clinic participated in this case series. Adolescents who were symptomatic more than 4 weeks after the injury were provided with an active rehabilitation intervention (M=7.9 weeks following injury; range=3.7 to 26.2 weeks). The rehabilitation program includes gradual, closely monitored light aerobic exercise, general coordination exercises, mental imagery, as well as reassurance, normalization of recovery, and stress/anxiety reduction strategies. The program continued until complete symptom resolution and readiness to begin stepwise return to activities. The primary outcome of the study was evolution of post-concussion symptoms. Secondary outcomes included mood, energy, balance, and cognition. After the intervention, post-concussion symptoms significantly decreased for the group of participants. They also had decreased fatigue and improved mood after 6 weeks of initiating the rehabilitation intervention. This case series shows that postconcussive symptoms and functioning in adolescents following sports-related concussion can be improved after participation in an active rehabilitation intervention. The introduction of graded light intensity exercise in the post-acute period following concussion is safe, feasible and appears to have a positive impact on adolescents' functioning.

Although synaptic plasticity seems to contribute to both processes, the specific players involved are not well understood. The EphA4 tyrosine kinase receptor is a cell adhesion protein regulating synaptic plasticity. We investigated the role of EphA4 in sleep regulation using electrocorticography in mice lacking EphA4 and gene expression measurements. Methods: EphA4 knockout (KO) mice, Clock(Delta 19/Delta 19) mutant mice and littermates, C57BL/6J and CD-1 mice, and Sprague-Dawley rats were studied under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle, under undisturbed conditions or 6 h sleep deprivation (SLD), and submitted to a 48 h electrophysiological recording and/or brain sampling at different time of day. Results: EphA4 KO mice showed less rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), enhanced duration of individual bouts of wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) during the light period, and a blunted daily rhythm of NREMS sigma activity. The NREMS delta activity response to SLD was unchanged in EphA4 KO mice. However, SLD increased EphA4 expression in the thalamic/hypothalamic region in C57BL/6J mice. We further show the presence of E-boxes in the promoter region of EphA4, a lower expression of EphA4 in Clock mutant mice, a rhythmic expression of EphA4 ligands in several brain areas, expression of EphA4 in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN), and finally an unchanged number of cells expressing Vip, Grp and Avp in the SCN of EphA4 KO mice. Conclusions: Our results suggest that EphA4 is involved in circadian sleep regulation.

The aim of this study is to review the clinical and imaging features of patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of posttraumatic breast neuromas. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We report eight biopsy-proven posttraumatic neuromas in six patients with a history of breast surgery. Mammographic, sonographic, and breast MRI examinations were reviewed according to the BI-RADS lexicon. In addition, the tail sign, a specific sign known to be associated with neuromas in other parts of the body, was assessed. RESULTS. Mammographic, MRI, and sonographic examinations were performed in three, four and all six patients, respectively. The neuromas were occult on the three mammograms performed but all of them were identified on ultrasound as hypoechoic masses with parallel orientation; seven of the eight neuromas (87.5%) had an oval shape with circumscribed margins. Strain elastography performed for two patients (three neuromas) showed benign features (benign elasticity scores and fat-to-lesion ratio). Half of the masses showed a tail sign (focal thickening of the nerve adjacent to posttraumatic neuroma, similar to the dural tail sign). Of five lesions investigated by MRI, two were occult on MRI. The remaining three were visible as isointense foci on T1-weighted images, with a benign type 1 enhancement curve. CONCLUSION. In patients who underwent breast surgery, a mass with benign features raises the possibility of a neuroma. Although the tail sign was present in half of the posttraumatic neuromas, imaging-guided biopsy remains the standard of care.

Short-term mortality following surgical procedures for the diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors: outcome analysis in 5533 children from SEER, 2004-2011	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						30-day mortality; pediatric brain tumor; Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results; oncology	YOUNG-CHILDREN; UNITED-STATES; DATABASE; CHEMOTHERAPY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SURVIVAL; SURGERY; AGE	OBJECTIVE Thirty-day mortality is increasingly a reference metric regarding surgical outcomes. Recent data estimate a 30-day mortality rate of 1.4%-2.7% after craniotomy for tumors in children. No detailed analysis of short-term mortality following a diagnostic neurosurgical procedure (e.g., resection or tissue biopsy) for tumor in the US pediatric population has been conducted. METHODS The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data sets identified patients <= 21 years who underwent a diagnostic neurosurgical procedure for primary intracranial tumor from 2004 to 2011. One-and two-month mortality was estimated. Standard statistical methods estimated associations between independent variables and mortality. RESULTS A total of 5533 patients met criteria for inclusion. Death occurred within the calendar month of surgery in 64 patients (1.16%) and by the conclusion of the calendar month following surgery in 95 patients (1.72%). Within the first calendar month, patients < 1 year of age (n = 318) had a risk of death of 5.66%, while those from 1 to 21 years (n = 5215) had a risk of 0.88% (p < 0.0001). By the end of the calendar month following surgery, patients < 1 year (n = 318) had a risk of death of 7.23%, while those from 1 to 21 years (n = 5215) had a risk of 1.38% (p < 0.0001). Children < 1 year at diagnosis were more likely to harbor a high-grade lesion than older children (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.4). CONCLUSIONS In the SEER data sets, the risk of death within 30 days of a diagnostic neurosurgical procedure for a primary pediatric brain tumor is between 1.16% and 1.72%, consistent with contemporary data from European populations. The risk of mortality in infants is considerably higher, between 5.66% and 7.23%, and they harbor more aggressive lesions.

MYB-QKI rearrangements in angiocentric glioma drive tumorigenicity through a tripartite mechanism	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							BET BROMODOMAIN INHIBITION; ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA; LOW-GRADE GLIOMAS; NEURAL STEM-CELL; C-MYB; V-MYB; CANCER; PROTEIN; GENE; TRANSFORMATION	Angiocentric gliomas are pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) without known recurrent genetic drivers. We performed genomic analysis of new and published data from 249 PLGGs, including 19 angiocentric gliomas. We identified MYB-QKI fusions as a specific and single candidate driver event in angiocentric gliomas. In vitro and in vivo functional studies show that MYB-QKI rearrangements promote tumorigenesis through three mechanisms: MYB activation by truncation, enhancer translocation driving aberrant MYB-QKI expression and hemizygous loss of the tumor suppressor QKI. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a single driver rearrangement simultaneously transforming cells via three genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in a tumor.

J	Forget, H; Lacroix, A; Bourdeau, I; Cohen, H				Forget, Helene; Lacroix, Andre; Bourdeau, Isabelle; Cohen, Henri			Long-term cognitive effects of glucocorticoid excess in Cushing's syndrome	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Glucocorticoids; Hypercortisolism; Endogenous Cushing's syndrome; Attention; Memory; Cognitive functions	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DENDRITIC REORGANIZATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; DISEASE; BRAIN; CORTISOL; ATROPHY; DEPRESSION	Context and objective: We previously found that patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) scored lower than controls in several domains of cognitive function and that correction of hypercortisolism is not necessarily correlated with short-term improvement in intellectual performance. Here, we examined the long-term outcome in patients treated for CS by assessing the extent to which the detrimental effects of glucocorticoid (GC) excess on cognition can be reversed three years after corrective surgery. Design: A battery of neuropsychological tests, including tests of attention, visuospatial processing, learning and memory, and executive functioning were administered pre-treatment and 12, 24 and 36 months post-treatment. Patients and control subjects: We included 18 patients with endogenous CS recruited before surgical treatment and 18 controls matched for age, sex and education. Results: CS patients performed worse than controls on tests of attention, executive functioning and nonverbal aspects of memory. Moreover, at 36 months following eucortisolism, executive function performance and, to a lesser extent, attention tasks showed limited change compared to pre-treatment testing. Conclusion: Chronic hypercortisolism is accompanied by a deleterious impact on aspects of cognitive function. This negative effect on attention, executive performance and nonverbal memory seen in patients with CS suggests a differential effect of excess GCs upon different brain areas and networks. This influence persists years after the return to normal cortisol secretion levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Little is known about the functioning of these peptides in anorexia nervosa (AN). The aims of the current study were to evaluate the extent to which orexin-A might be linked to sleep and treatment outcome in AN. Method: Fasting plasma orexin-A concentrations were measured in 48 females with AN at the start of a day hospital treatment and in 98 normal-eater/healthy-weight controls. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was administered at the beginning of the treatment as a measure of sleep quality. Other psychopathological variables were evaluated with the Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL90R) and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI). Patients were assessed at the start and end of treatment by means of commonly used diagnostic criteria and clinical questionnaires. Results: The AN patients presented more sleep disturbances and poorer overall sleep quality than did the healthy controls (p = .026) but there were no global differences between groups in plasma orexin-A concentrations (p = .071). In the AN sample, orexin-A concentrations were associated with greater sleep disturbances (vertical bar r vertical bar = .30), sleep inefficiency (vertical bar r vertical bar = .22) and poorer overall sleep (vertical bar r vertical bar = .22). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed that both elevated orexin-A concentrations and inadequate sleep predicted poorer treatment outcome. Conclusion: Plasma orexin-A concentrations contribute to poor sleep quality in AN; and both of these variables are associated with therapy response. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, to the extent that RSA plays a role in the efficiency of gas exchange, it may be expected to correlate better with HR/f ('breathing specific heart rate') than with f, because the former is a better reflection of the cardio-respiratory coupling. We measured RSA breath-by-breath in 209 young men and women during spontaneous breathing and during volitional breathing under auditory cues at vastly different f. In either case, and for both genders, RSA correlated better with HR/f than with f As HR/f increased so did RSA, in a linear manner. When compared on the basis of HR/f, RSA did not differ significantly between spontaneous and volitional breathing. It is proposed that RSA is a central mechanism that ameliorates the matching between the quasi-continuous pulmonary blood flow and the intermittent airflow, irrespective of the type of ventilatory drive (cortical or autonomic).

Poor functioning within these domains can negatively affect academic success and school adjustment. As schools play a significant role in a child's development, understanding how to support the social, psychological, and physical needs of these children is important. This article reviews literature examining the neurobehavioural comorbidities associated with childhood epilepsy and the barriers these conditions create to academic success and school adjustment. The article also provides recommendations based on the authors' qualitative research about how best to support these children. Findings suggest that educating school communities about epilepsy and the challenges associated with it might promote inclusive school environments and mitigate negative school experiences. Findings also emphasize the need for an allied approach to the provision of support to ensure the needs of both students and faculty are met.

These offline gains can be eliminated if another skill is introduced soon afterward-a phenomenon called retroactive interference. Interference effects have been found in studies using two similar tasks involving the same motor effectors in a manual mode. The present study aimed to determine the extent to which differences in motor production mode modulate interference in skill learning. Healthy participants were assigned to one of three conditions and trained on a finger opposition sequence (FOS) learning task. All subjects were tested 24 h later on the original FOS learning task. Control subjects who were not exposed to a secondary learning task exhibited the expected offline gains after 24 h. Subjects who immediately learned a secondary task after the FOS training, either in the same manual mode (French Sign Language) or in an oral mode (CVC syllables), did not show any offline gains. Interestingly, the amount of interference was equivalent in the manual and oral learning conditions. The results reveal that interference effects in motor skill learning can occur when different effectors are involved in the primary and secondary tasks. The sequence processing abilities of the basal ganglia appear to play a major role in these interference effects.

Sensorimotor integration is enhanced in dancers and musicians	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Dancers; Musicians; Sensorimotor integration; Dance video game; Rhythm; Melody	RHYTHM SYNCHRONIZATION PERFORMANCE; MICROSOFT KINECT; POSTURAL CONTROL; STREET DANCERS; BRAIN; COORDINATION; PIANISTS; PERCEPTION; IMITATION; DYNAMICS	Studying individuals with specialized training, such as dancers and musicians, provides an opportunity to investigate how intensive practice of sensorimotor skills affects behavioural performance across various domains. While several studies have found that musicians have improved motor, perceptual and sensorimotor integration skills compared to untrained controls, fewer studies have examined the effect of dance training on such skills. Moreover, no study has specifically compared the effects of dance versus music training on perceptual or sensorimotor performance. To this aim, in the present study, expert dancers, expert musicians and untrained controls were tested on a range of perceptual and sensorimotor tasks designed to discriminate performance profiles across groups. Dancers performed better than musicians and controls on a dance imitation task (involving whole-body movement), but musicians performed better than dancers and controls on a musical melody discrimination task as well as on a rhythm synchronization task (involving finger tapping). These results indicate that long-term intensive dance and music training are associated with distinct enhancements in sensorimotor skills. This novel work advances knowledge of the effects of long-term dance versus music training and has potential applications in therapies for motor disorders.

Organ donation in adults: a critical care perspective	INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE			English	Review						Organ donation; Brain death; Donation after brain death	BRAIN-DEATH DETERMINATION; VIVO LUNG PERFUSION; CIRCULATORY DEATH; CARDIAC DEATH; EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; DONORS; VARIABILITY; TRANSPLANTATION; PROCUREMENT	The shortage of organs for transplantation is an important medical and societal problem because transplantation is often the best therapeutic option for end-stage organ failure. We review the potential deceased organ donation pathways in adult ICU practice, i.e. donation after brain death (DBD) and controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD), which follows the planned withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments (WLST) and subsequent confirmation of death using cardiorespiratory criteria. Strategies in the ICU to increase the number of organs available for transplantation are discussed. These include timely identification of the potential organ donor, optimization of the brain-dead donor by aggressive management of the physiological consequence of brain death, implementation of cDCD protocols, and the potential for ex vivo perfusion techniques. Organ donation should be offered as a routine component of the end-of-life care plan of every patient dying in the ICU where appropriate, and intensivists are the key professional in this process.

Study Design: Retrospective chart review (2002-2012). Results: Of 103 children referred for diagnosis, 81 were referred to a neurologist by other medical specialists at a mean of 13.6 15.7 months, whereas primary care providers referred much later (mean = 28.8 +/- 27.1 months). Children admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were referred earlier (mean = 9.3 +/- 10.2 months) than those not (28.1 +/- 24.9 months). Referral to rehabilitation was similarly delayed. Conclusions: Primary care providers generated a minority of referrals, of concern given their role in developmental surveillance. Remarkably high variability suggests knowledge of cerebral palsy attributes varies widely among service providers. Half of children with cerebral palsy do not have a complicated birth history; subsequently, referrals for diagnosis and management are often delayed. New strategies are needed to optimize prompt referral by primary care providers.

Dysregulation of FMRP/mTOR Signaling Cascade in Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury of Premature Human Brain	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						fragile X mental retardation protein; mammalian target of rapamycin; prematurity; brain injury; hypoxia; autism	FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; PERIVENTRICULAR LEUKOMALACIA; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; PROTECTIVE ROLE; RODENT MODEL; AUTISM; ENCEPHALOPATHY; MGLUR5	In this study the authors investigated whether dysregulation of the fragile X mental retardation protein and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling cascade can have a role in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy of prematurity following perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. The authors examined the brain tissue of newborns with encephalopathy and compared it to age-matched controls with normal brain development and adults. In normal controls, the fragile X mental retardation protein expression in cortical gray matter spiked 4-fold during 36-39 gestational weeks compared to the adult, with a concomitant suppression of p70S6K and S6. In encephalopathy cases, the developmental spike of fragile X mental retardation protein was not observed, and fragile X mental retardation protein levels remained significantly lower than in normal controls. Importantly, this fragile X mental retardation protein downregulation was followed by a significant overexpression of p70S6K and S6. These novel findings thus suggest that premature hypoxic-ischemic brain injury can affect the fragile X mental retardation protein/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, as otherwise observed in inherited syndromes of cognitive disability and autism spectrum disorders.

We report here 25 new patients with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency, and review the clinical and molecular findings in these and 46 previously reported patients. Patients and results Of the 71 patients, 50 had SUCLA2 mutations and 21 had SUCLG1 mutations. In the newly-reported 20 SUCLA2 patients we found 16 different mutations, of which nine were novel: two large gene deletions, a 1 bp duplication, two 1 bp deletions, a 3 bp insertion, a nonsense mutation and two missense mutations. In the newly-reported SUCLG1 patients, five missense mutations were identified, of which two were novel. The median onset of symptoms was two months for patients with SUCLA2 mutations and at birth for SUCLG1 patients. Median survival was 20 years for SUCLA2 and 20 months for SUCLG1. Notable clinical differences between the two groups were hepatopathy, found in 38 % of SUCLG1 cases but not in SUCLA2 cases, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which was not reported in SUCLA2 patients, but documented in 14 % of cases with SUCLG1 mutations. Long survival, to age 20 years or older, was reported in 12 % of SUCLA2 and in 10 % of SUCLG1 patients. The most frequent abnormality on neuroimaging was basal ganglia involvement, found in 69 % of SUCLA2 and 80 % of SUCLG1 patients. Analysis of respiratory chain enzyme activities in muscle generally showed a combined deficiency of complexes I and IV, but normal histological and biochemical findings in muscle did not preclude a diagnosis of succinate-CoA ligase deficiency. In five patients, the urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid was only marginally elevated, whereas elevated plasma methylmalonic acid was consistently found. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the largest study of patients with SUCLA2 and SUCLG1 deficiency. The most important findings were a significantly longer survival in patients with SUCLA2 mutations compared to SUCLG1 mutations and a trend towards longer survival in patients with missense mutations compared to loss-of-function mutations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and liver involvement was exclusively found in patients with SUCLG1 mutations, whereas epilepsy was much more frequent in patients with SUCLA2 mutations compared to patients with SUCLG1 mutations. The mutation analysis revealed a number of novel mutations, including a homozygous deletion of the entire SUCLA2 gene, and we found evidence of two founder mutations in the Scandinavian population, in addition to the known SUCLA2 founder mutation in the Faroe Islands.

In addition, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have characterized these neurotransmitters in task-induced deactivation processes during a working memory (WM) task. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between these neurotransmitters and task-induced oscillatory changes in the human brain. Here, using combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we investigated the modulation of GABA and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) concentrations related to task-induced oscillations in neural activity during a WM task. We first acquired resting-state MRS and MEG data from 20 healthy male volunteers using the n-back task. Time-frequency analysis was employed to determine the power induced during the encoding and retention phases in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pg-ACC), mid-ACC, and occipital cortex (OC). Statistical analysis showed that increased WM load was associated with task-induced oscillatory modulations (TIOMs) of the theta-gamma band relative to the zero-back condition (TIOM0B) in each volume of interest during the encoding phase of the n-back task. The task-induced oscillatory modulations in the two-back condition relative to the zero-back condition (TIOM2B-0B) were negatively correlated with the percent rate change of the correct hit rate for 2B-0B, but positively correlated with GABA/Glx. The positive correlation between TIOM2B-0B and GABA/Glx during the WM task indicates the importance of the inhibition/excitation ratio. In particular, a low inhibition/excitation ratio is essential for the efficient inhibition of irrelevant neural activity, thus producing precise task performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Documenting changes in the structure of anatomical networks for this population would substantiate the notion that the brain's core network-level organization may undergo neuroplasticity as a result of life-long experience. To examine this issue, we compared whole-brain networks of regional cortical-thickness covariance in early blind and matched sighted individuals. This covariance is thought to reflect signatures of integration between systems involved in similar perceptual/cognitive functions. Using graph-theoretic metrics, we identified a unique mode of anatomical reorganization in the blind that differed from that found for sighted. This was seen in that network partition structures derived from subgroups of blind were more similar to each other than they were to partitions derived from sighted. Notably, after deriving network partitions, we found that language and visual regions tended to reside within separate modules in sighted but showed a pattern of merging into shared modules in the blind. Our study demonstrates that early visual deprivation triggers a systematic large-scale reorganization of whole-brain cortical-thickness networks, suggesting changes in how occipital regions interface with other functional networks in the congenitally blind.

It is not clear how lesion size affects motor representations in the contralesional hemisphere and how the effects in the 2 hemispheres compare. Our goal was to study how lesion size affects motor representations in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres. In rats, we induced lesions of different sizes in the caudal forelimb area (CFA), the equivalent of M1. The effective lesion volume in each animal was quantified histologically. Behavioral recovery was evaluated with the Montoya Staircase task for 28 days after the lesion. Then, the organization of the CFA and the rostral forelimb area (RFA)the putative premotor area in ratsin the 2 cerebral hemispheres was studied with intracortical microstimulation mapping techniques. The distal forelimb representation in the RFA of both the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres was positively correlated with the size of the lesion. In contrast, lesion size had no effect on the contralesional CFA, and there was no relationship between movement representations in the 2 hemispheres. Finally, only the contralesional RFA was negatively correlated with chronic motor deficits of the paretic forelimb. Our data show that lesion size has comparable effects on motor representations in premotor areas of both hemispheres and suggest that the contralesional premotor cortex may play a greater role in the recovery of the paretic forelimb following large lesions.

Their resection involves training and the use of the multiple microsurgical techniques available for removal. Simulation models,with haptic and visual realism, may be useful for improving the bimanual technical skills of neurosurgical residents and neurosurgeons, potentially decreasing surgical errors and thus improving patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess an ex vivo placental model for brain tumor microsurgery using a simulation tool in neurosurgical psychomotor teaching and assessment. METHODS: Sixteen human placentas were used in this research project. Intravascular blood remnants were removed by continuous saline solution irrigation of the 2 placental arteries and placental vein. Brain tumors were simulated using silicone injections in the placental stroma. Eight neurosurgeons and 8 neurosurgical residents carried out the resection of simulated tumors using the same surgical instruments and bimanual microsurgical techniques used to perform human brain tumor operations. Face and content validity was assessed using a subjective evaluation based on a 5-point Likert scale. Construct validity was assessed by analyzing the surgical performance of the neurosurgeon and resident groups. RESULTS: The placenta model simulated brain tumor surgical procedures with high fidelity. Results showed face and content validity. Construct validity was demonstrated by statistically different surgical performances among the evaluated groups. CONCLUSION: Human placentas are useful haptic models to simulate brain tumor microsurgical removal. Results using this model demonstrate face, content, and construct validity.

We have previously reported that lithium stimulated the protein kinase B/Forkhead box O1 (Akt/FoxO1) pathway in rats. However, little information is available regarding its neuroprotective role of this pathway and underlying mechanisms. PC12 cells treated with serum deprivation were used as a toxicity model to study the protective effect of lithium and its underlying mechanisms. Cell viability was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and Hoechst staining. FoxO1 subcellular location and its overexpression were used to study the underlying mechanisms. Various pathway inhibitors were used to investigate the possible pathways, while the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 was analyzed by Western blot. Lithium pretreatment dose-dependently reduced PC12 cell apoptosis induced by serum starvation. The protective effect of lithium was abolished by LY294002, a PI3K-specific inhibitor, and Akt inhibitor Akt inhibitor VIII, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK kinase) inhibitor U0126 had no effect. Lithium induced the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Lithium-induced phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 is mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Serum deprivation caused nuclear translocation of FoxO1 while application of lithium reversed the effect of serum deprivation. Moreover, overexpression of FoxO1 enhanced cell apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. Finally, lithium was found to reduce the exogenous and endogenous FoxO1 protein levels in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. The protective effect of lithium against serum starvation cell death is mediated by the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 pathway.

We propose a conceptual model in which variance in the ERN reflects individual differences in the degree to which errors are evaluated as threatening. We also discuss evidence for the placement of the ERN in the Sustained Threat construct, as well as evidence that the ERN may more specifically reflect sensitivity to endogenous threat. Following this, we present data from a sample of 515 adolescent females demonstrating a larger ERN in relation to self-reported checking behaviors, but only in older adolescents, suggesting that sensitivity to internal threat and the ERN-checking relationship may follow a developmental course as adolescents develop behavioral control. In contrast, depressive symptoms were linked to a smaller ERN, and this association was invariant with respect to age. Collectively, these data suggest that the magnitude of the ERN is sensitive both to specific anxiety-related processes and depression, in opposing directions that may reflect variation in internal threat sensitivity. We discuss directions for future research, as well as ways in which findings for the ERN complement and challenge aspects of the current RDoC matrix.

Most studies of sleep in autism have been based on subjective measures, notably parental reports. A few studies have used objective, laboratory polysomnography (PSG) measures, but often include confounding factors such as intellectual disability, sleep problems, other psychiatric illnesses, and medication. To address these limitations, we examined the relationship between sleep and behavior in prototypical AS of typical level of intelligence and non-autistic children not complaining of sleep problems. We examined sleep variables with The Children' Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) and a daily sleep agenda, both filled out by parents, and by PSG. These subjective and objective measures both revealed that sleep latency was longer in AS than in non autistic children. Furthermore, AS children also showed less slow-wave sleep (SWS: stages 3+4), fewer sleep spindles and fewer K-complexes than non-autistic children. REM sleep, including eye movement density, was similar between the two groups. The proportion of light sleep, (stage 1 non-REM sleep) was negatively correlated with IQ(Wechsler and Raven matrices) in both groups of participants. A large amount of SWS predicted low levels of internalizing behavior in both groups and typical social functioning as determined by ADOS in AS children. These results indicate that autistic children not complaining of sleep problems may nonetheless be affected by poor sleep, which in turn influences their daytime functioning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to describe risk factors for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and death, as well as BCR rates and overall survival (OS) rates in both treatment groups. Patients and methods: Overall, 5,619 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent either RP (n = 5,200) or HDR-BT (n = 419) between 1999 and 2009. Median follow-up time was 72.4 months. Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed for the overall cohort and for a propensity score matched cohort to predict BCR and OS rates. Within the matched cohort, stratified analyses were repeated for HDR-BT alone (n = 206) and HDR-BT plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (n = 213). Sensitivity analyses were performed to adjust for prostate-specific antigen rebound. Results: The 5-year BCR-free survival rates were 82.1% vs. 80.3% (P < 0.01) for RP and HDR-BT, respectively. Corresponding 5-year OS rates were 97.1% vs. 92.4% (P < 0.01). In the propensity score matched cohort, 5-year BCR-free survival rates were 80.3% vs. 77.1%; P = 0.06 and 5-year OS rates were 95.7% vs. 92.4%; P = 0.5. In multivariable models, the overall HDR-BT exerted no significant effect on BCR, and the same results were recorded in the matched cohort. In stratified analyses, HDR-BT alone vs. RP increased BCR risk (1.45; P < 0.01); conversely, HDR-BT plus ADT vs. RP decreased BCR risk (hazard ratio = 0.66; P = 0.02). Conclusions: First, RP offers equivalent oncological control without the need for concurrent hormone therapy and its morbidity. Second, patients who have RP avoid ADT (2%) and the need for salvage and adjuvant external-beam radiation therapy is low at 11% and 3%, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Lipid droplets are postulated to sequester hydrophobic therapeutic agents, thereby reducing drug effectiveness. We hypothesized that the inhibition of lipid droplet accumulation in glioblastoma cells using pyrrolidine-2, a cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 alpha inhibitor, can sensitize cancer cells to the killing effect of curcumin, a promising anticancer agent isolated from the turmeric spice. We observed that curcumin localized in the lipid droplets of human U251N glioblastoma cells. Reduction of lipid droplet number using pyrrolidine-2 drastically enhanced the therapeutic effect of curcumin in both 2D and 3D glioblastoma cell models. The mode of cell death involved was found to be mediated by caspase-3. Comparatively, the current clinical chemotherapeutic standard, temozolomide, was significantly less effective in inducing glioblastoma cell death. Together, our results suggest that the inhibition of lipid droplet accumulation is an effective way to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect of curcumin against glioblastoma multiforme.

In vivo MRI signatures of hippocampal subfield pathology in intractable epilepsy	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						DTI; hippocampal sclerosis; hippocampal subfields; histology; MRI; temporal lobe epilepsy; volumetry	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EX-VIVO; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; QUANTITATIVE MRI; TASK-FORCE; 3T MRI; DIFFUSION; CLASSIFICATION; HISTOLOGY	ObjectivesOur aim is to assess the subfield-specific histopathological correlates of hippocampal volume and intensity changes (T1, T2) as well as diff!usion MRI markers in TLE, and investigate the efficacy of quantitative MRI measures in predicting histopathology in vivo. Experimental DesignWe correlated in vivo volumetry, T2 signal, quantitative T1 mapping, as well as diffusion MRI parameters with histological features of hippocampal sclerosis in a subfield-specific manner. We made use of on an advanced co-registration pipeline that provided a seamless integration of preoperative 3 T MRI with postoperative histopathological data, on which metrics of cell loss and gliosis were quantitatively assessed in CA1, CA2/3, and CA4/DG. Principal ObservationsMRI volumes across all subfields were positively correlated with neuronal density and size. Higher T2 intensity related to increased GFAP fraction in CA1, while quantitative T1 and diffusion MRI parameters showed negative correlations with neuronal density in CA4 and DG. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that in vivo multiparametric MRI can predict neuronal loss in all the analyzed subfields with up to 90% accuracy. ConclusionOur results, based on an accurate co-registration pipeline and a subfield-specific analysis of MRI and histology, demonstrate the potential of MRI volumetry, diffusion, and quantitative T1 as accurate in vivo biomarkers of hippocampal pathology.

Reward Sensitivity of ACC as an Intermediate Phenotype between DRD4-521T and Substance Misuse	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; DOPAMINE D-4 RECEPTOR; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SCREENING-TEST ASSIST; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; HUMAN BRAIN; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS	The development and expression of the midbrain dopamine system is determined in part by genetic factors that vary across individuals such that dopamine-related genes are partly responsible for addiction vulnerability. However, a complete account of how dopamine-related genes predispose individuals to drug addiction remains to be developed. Adopting an intermediate phenotype approach, we investigated whether reward-related electrophysiological activity of ACCa cortical region said to utilize dopamine reward signals to learn the value of extended, context-specific sequences of goal-directed behaviorsmediates the influence of multiple dopamine-related functional polymorphisms over substance use. We used structural equation modeling to examine whether two related electrophysiological phenomena associated with the control and reinforcement learning functions of ACCtheta power and the reward positivitymediated the relationship between the degree of substance misuse and genetic polymorphisms that regulate dopamine processing in frontal cortex. Substance use data were collected from 812 undergraduate students. One hundred ninety-six returned on a subsequent day to participate in an electrophysiological experiment and to provide saliva samples for DNA analysis. We found that these electrophysiological signals mediated a relationship between the DRD4-521T dopamine receptor genotype and substance misuse. Our results provide a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between genes and behavior in drug addiction and illustrate how future interventions might be individually tailored for specific genetic and neurocognitive profiles.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients who presented with hydronephrosis from 2008 to 2013. We included patients diagnosed prenatally and those with hydronephrosis discovered incidentally during the first year of life. We excluded cases involving urinary tract infection, neurogenic bladder and chromosomal anomalies, those associated with extraurinary congenital malformations and those with followup of less than 24 months without resolution. Hydronephrosis was graded postnatally using the Society for Fetal Urology system, and then the management protocol was chosen. All units were regraded using the Urinary Tract Dilation classification system and compared to the Society for Fetal Urology system to assess reliability. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the validity of the Urinary Tract Dilation classification system in predicting hydronephrosis resolution and surgical intervention. Results: A total of 490 patients (730 renal units) were eligible to participate. The Urinary Tract Dilation classification system was reliable in the assessment of hydronephrosis (parallel forms 0.92). Hydronephrosis resolved in 357 units (49%), and 86 units (12%) were managed by surgical intervention. The remainder of renal units demonstrated stable or improved hydronephrosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that the likelihood of surgical intervention was predicted independently by Urinary Tract Dilation classification system risk group, while Society for Fetal Urology grades were predictive of likelihood of resolution. Conclusions: The Urinary Tract Dilation classification system is reliable for evaluation of postnatal hydronephrosis and is valid in predicting surgical intervention.

However, limited attention has been paid to underlying homeostatic mechanisms in wild birds such as changes in the expression of genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationships between hepatic concentrations of major organohalogens (PBDEs and OCs), and circulating thyroid hormone (free and total thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3)) levels and transcription of 14 thyroid-related genes in three tissues (thyroid, brain, and liver) of an urban-adapted bird exposed to high organohalogen concentrations in the Montreal area (QC, Canada), the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis). Positive correlations were found between liver concentrations of several polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PBDEs as well as chlordanes and total plasma T4 levels. Hepatic concentrations of several PBDEs were negatively correlated with mRNA levels of deiodinase type 3, thyroid peroxidase, and thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) in the thyroid gland. Liver PCB (deca-CB) correlated positively with mRNA levels of sodium-iodide symporter and TR alpha. In brain, concentrations of most PBDEs were positively correlated with mRNA levels of organic anion transporter protein 1C1 and transthyretin, while PCBs positively correlated with expression of TR alpha and TR beta as well as deiodinase type 2. These multiple correlative linkages suggest that organohalogens operate through several mechanisms (direct or compensatory) involving gene transcription, thus potentially perturbing the HPT axis of this highly organohalogen-contaminated ring-billed gull population.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for gastrointestinal surgery, part 2: consensus statement for anaesthesia practice	ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Review							RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; LAPAROSCOPIC COLORECTAL SURGERY; ABDOMINIS PLANE BLOCK; SURGICAL-SITE INFECTION; NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; PATIENT-CONTROLLED ANALGESIA; ERAS((R)) SOCIETY RECOMMENDATIONS; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT; RESIDUAL NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCK; CONTINUOUS WOUND INFUSION	Background: The present interdisciplinary consensus review proposes clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthetic practice in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. Methods: Studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined and reviewed. The group reached a consensus recommendation after critical appraisal of the literature. Results: This consensus statement demonstrates that anaesthesiologists control several preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative ERAS elements. Further research is needed to verify the strength of these recommendations. Conclusions: Based on the evidence available for each element of perioperative care pathways, the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ((R))) Society presents a comprehensive consensus review, clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthesia care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery within an ERAS programme. This unified protocol facilitates involvement of anaesthesiologists in the implementation of the ERAS programmes and allows for comparison between centres and it eventually might facilitate the design of multi-institutional prospective and adequately powered randomized trials.

However, propranolol may also exert cognitive effects by modulating stress and arousal. Method: Within a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial, propranolol's impact on cognitive functioning was examined in individuals who were diagnosed with chronic PTSD. Participants received a single dose of 1 mg/kg of propranolol (n=20) or placebo (n=21), and completed subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition (WAIS-III). PTSD symptoms were assessed 1 week before and after treatment by the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R). Results: The propranolol group performed significantly better on the Processing Speed composite measure compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, greater heart rate decreases were associated with higher Perceptual Organization performance, within the propranolol group. Limitations: The generalizability of results may have been reduced as participants were treatment seeking; the sample size was small and included a greater proportion of females.This study could not assess whether pre-existing psychological function influenced cognitive performance, post-trauma. Future studies might consider including a non-PTSD control group to determine if our findings are specific to propranolol's effect on PTSD associated cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Our preliminary results demonstrated that cognitive functioning improved following propranolol administration in PTSD patients. The implications are discussed with regards to the processing of traumatic events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Field recordings revealed interictal- (duration: 1.1 to 2.2 s) and ictal-like (duration: 31 to 103 s) activity occurring synchronously in EC and PC; in addition, interictal spiking in PC increased in frequency shortly before the onset of ictal oscillatory activity thus resembling the hypersynchronous seizure onset seen in epileptic patients and in in vivo animal models. Intracellular recordings with K-acetate + QX314-filled pipettes in PC principal cells showed that spikes at ictal onset had post-burst hyperpolarizations (presumably mediated by postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors), which gradually decreased in amplitude. This trend was associated with a progressive positive shift of the post-burst hyperpolarization reversal potential. Finally, the transient elevations in [K+](o) (up to 4.4 mM from a base line of 3.2 mM) - which occurred with the interictal events in PC - progressively increased (up to 7.3 mM) with the spike immediately preceding ictal onset.

However, the respective roles played by interneurons (GABAergic) and principal (glutamatergic) cells during interictal and ictal discharges remain unclear. Here, we employed tetrode wire recordings to establish the involvement of these two cell types in 4-aminopyridine-induced interictal- and low-voltage fast (LVF) onset ictal-like discharges in the rat entorhinal cortex in an in vitro slice preparation. We recorded a total of 90 single units (69 putative interneurons, 17 putative principal and 4 unclassified cells) from 36 slices, and found that: (i) interneurons (66.7%) were more likely to fire during interictal discharges than principal cells (35.3%); (ii) interneuron activity increased shortly before LVF ictal onset, whereas principal cell activity did not change; (iii) interneurons and principal cells fired at high rates throughout the tonic phase of the ictal discharge; however, (iv) only interneurons showed phase-locked relationship with LVF activity at 5-15 Hz during the tonic phase. Finally, the association of interneuron firing with interictal discharges was maintained during blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic transmission. Our findings demonstrate the prominent involvement of interneurons in interictal discharge generation and in the transition to LW ictal activity in this in vitro model of epileptiform synchronization.

For instance, additional sensory stimulation and task cueing enhanced motor learning in people with PD, whereas exercising using musical rhythms or console computer games improved gait and balance, and reduced some motor symptoms, in addition to increasing task enjoyment. Yet, despite these advances, important knowledge gaps remain. Most studies investigating motor learning in PD used laboratory-specific tasks and equipment, with little resemblance to real life situations. Thus, it is unknown whether similar results could be achieved in more ecological setups and whether individual's task engagement could further improve motor learning capacity. Moreover, the role of social interaction in motor skill learning process has not yet been investigated in PD and the role of mind-set and self-regulatory mechanisms have been sporadically examined. Here, we review evidence suggesting that these psychosocial factors may be important modulators of motor learning in PD. We propose their incorporation in future research, given that it could lead to development of improved non-pharmacological interventions aimed to preserve or restore motor function in PD.

In response to netrin-1 stimulation, DCC becomes a signaling platform to recruit proteins that promote axon outgrowth and guidance. The Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) p120RasGAP inhibits Ras activity and mediates neurite retraction and growth cone collapse in response to repulsive guidance cues. Here we show an interaction between p120RasGAP and DCC that positively regulates netrin-1-mediated axon outgrowth and guidance in embryonic cortical neurons. In response to netrin-1, p120RasGAP is recruited to DCC in growth cones and forms a multiprotein complex with focal adhesion kinase and ERK. We found that Ras/ERK activities are elevated aberrantly in p120RasGAP-deficient neurons. Moreover, the expression of p120RasGAP Src homology 2 (SH2)-SH3-SH2 domains, which interact with the C-terminal tail of DCC, is sufficient to restore netrin-1-dependent axon outgrowth in p120RasGAP-deficient neurons. We provide a novel mechanism that exploits the scaffolding properties of the N terminus of p120RasGAP to tightly regulate netrin-1/DCC-dependent axon outgrowth and guidance.

Some authors have suggested that the concept of frailty could be a more useful approach in this population. We investigated whether frailty markers are associated with treatment recommendations in an oncogeriatric clinic. Methods This prospective study included 70 years and older patients with solid tumors and referred for an oncogeriatric assessment. The CGA included nine domains: autonomy, comorbidities, medication, cognition, nutrition, mood, neurosensory deficits, falls, and social status. Five frailty markers were assessed (nutrition, physical activity, energy, mobility, and strength). Patients were categorized as Frail (three or more frailty markers), pre-frail (one or two frailty markers), or not-frail (no frailty marker). Treatment recommendations were classified into two categories: standard treatment with and without any changes and supportive/palliative care. Multiple logistic regression models were used to analyze factors associated with treatment recommendations. Results 217 patients, mean age 83 years (+/- Standard deviation (SD) 5.3), were included. In the univariate analysis, number of frailty markers, grip strength, physical activity, mobility, nutrition, energy, autonomy, depression, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scale of Performance Status (ECOG-PS), and falls were significantly associated with final treatment recommendations. In the multivariate analysis, the number of frailty markers and basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were significantly associated with final treatment recommendations (p<0.001 and p = 0.010, respectively). Conclusion Frailty markers are associated with final treatment recommendations in older cancer patients. Longitudinal studies are warranted to better determine their use in a geriatric oncology setting.

Understanding the mechanisms by which glioblastoma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) undergo metamorphosis into tumor-supportive cells, characterizing the heterogeneity of immune cell phenotypes within glioblastoma subtypes, and discovering new targets can help the design of new efficient immunotherapies. In this study, we performed a comprehensive battery of immune phenotyping, whole-genome microarray analysis, and microRNA expression profiling of GAMs with matched blood monocytes, healthy donor monocytes, normal brain microglia, nonpolarized M0 macrophages, and polarized M1, M2a, M2c macrophages. Glioblastoma patients had an elevated number of monocytes relative to healthy donors. Among CD11b(+) cells, microglia and MDSCs constituted a higher percentage of GAMs than did macrophages. GAM profiling using flow cytometry studies revealed a continuum between the M1- and M2-like phenotype. Contrary to current dogma, GAMs exhibited distinct immunological functions, with the former aligned close to nonpolarized M0 macrophages.

Genome-wide association study using family-based cohorts identifies the WLS and CCDC170/ESR1 loci as associated with bone mineral density	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Osteoporosis; BMD; GWAS; Polygenic; SNP; Pleiotropic	CALCIUM INTAKE; GENETIC DETERMINATION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; OSTEOPOROSIS; METAANALYSIS; FRACTURE; WOMEN; MASS; VARIANTS; DETERMINANTS	Background: Osteoporosis is a common and debilitating bone disease that is characterised by a low bone mineral density (BMD), a highly heritable trait. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be very successful in identifying common genetic variants associated with BMD adjusted for age, gender and weight, however a large portion of the genetic variance for this trait remains unexplained. There is evidence to suggest significant genetic correlation between body size traits and BMD. It has also recently been suggested that unintended bias can be introduced as a result of adjusting a phenotype for a correlated trait. We performed a GWAS meta-analysis in two populations (total n = 6,696) using BMD data adjusted for only age and gender, in an attempt to identify genetic variants associated with BMD including those that may have potential pleiotropic effects on BMD and body size traits. Results: We observed a single variant, rs2566752, associated with spine BMD at the genome-wide significance level in the meta-analysis (P = 3.36 x 10(-09)). Logistic regression analysis also revealed an association between rs2566752 and fracture rate in one of our study cohorts (P = 0.017, n = 5,654). This is an intronic variant located in the wntless Wnt ligand secretion mediator (WLS) gene (1p31.3), a known BMD locus which encodes an integral component of the Wnt ligand secretion pathway. Bioinformatics analyses of variants in moderate LD with rs2566752 produced strong evidence for a regulatory role for the variants rs72670452, rs17130567 and rs1430738. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis suggested that the variants rs12568456 and rs17130567 are associated with expression of the WLS gene in whole blood, cerebellum and temporal cortex brain tissue (P = 0.034-1.19 x 10(-23)). Gene-wide association testing using the VErsatile Gene-based Association Study 2 (VEGAS2) software revealed associations between the coiled-coil domain containing 170 (CCDC170) gene, located adjacent to the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene, and BMD at the spine, femoral neck and total hip sites (P = 1.0 x 10(-06), 2.0 x 10(-06) and 2.0 x 10(-06) respectively). Conclusions: Genetic variation at the WLS and CCDC170/ESR1 loci were found to be significantly associated with BMD adjusted for only age and gender at the genome-wide level in this meta-analysis.

The repeat-containing intron should be degraded after being spliced out, however GGGGCC repeat-containing RNA species either accumulate in nuclear foci or are exported to the cytoplasm where they are translated into potentially toxic dipeptide repeat proteins by repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation. Results: In order to determine the mechanisms of repeat-containing intron misprocessing, we have analyzed C9orf72 transcripts in lymphoblasts from C9orf72 expansion carriers (n = 15) and control individuals (n = 15). We have identified polyadenylated C9orf72 RNA species retaining the repeat-containing intron and in which downstream exons are spliced correctly resulting in a C9orf72 mRNA with an enlarged 5'-UTR containing the GGGGCC repeats. Intron-retaining transcripts are produced from both wild-type and mutant alleles. Intron-retaining C9orf72 transcripts were also detected in brain with a 2.7 fold increase measured in the frontal cortex from heterozygous expansion carriers (n = 11) compared to controls (n = 10). The level of intron-retaining transcripts was increased 5.9 fold in a case homozygous for the expansion. We also show that a large proportion of intron 1-retaining C9orf72 transcripts accumulate in the nucleus. Conclusions: Retention of the repeat-containing intron in mature C9orf72 mRNA can potentially explain nuclear foci formation as well as nuclear export of GGGGCC repeat RNA and suggests that the misprocessing of C9orf72 transcripts initiates the pathogenic process caused by C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions as well as provides the basis for novel therapeutic strategies.

Do Political and Economic Choices Rely on Common Neural Substrates? A Systematic Review of the Emerging Neuropolitics Literature	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						neuroeconomics; decision-making; reward; heuristics; functional MRI; meta-analysis	VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE; DOPAMINE NEURONS; CINGULATE CORTEX; VOTING-BEHAVIOR; BRAIN; FMRI; NEUROBIOLOGY; SCIENCE	The methods of cognitive neuroscience are beginning to be applied to the study of political behavior. The neural substrates of value-based decision making have been extensively examined in economic contexts; this might provide a powerful starting point for understanding political decision-making. Here, we asked to what extent the neuropolitics literature to date has used conceptual frameworks and experimental designs that make contact with the reward related approaches that have dominated decision neuroscience. We then asked whether the studies of political behavior that can be considered in this light implicate the brain regions that have been associated with subjective value related to "economic" reward. We performed a systematic literature review to identify papers addressing the neural substrates of political behavior and extracted the fMRI studies reporting behavioral measures of subjective value as defined in decision neuroscience studies of reward. A minority of neuropolitics studies met these criteria and relatively few brain activation foci from these studies overlapped with regions where activity has been related to subjective value. These findings show modest influence of reward-focused decision neuroscience on neuropolitics research to date. Whether the neural substrates of subjective value identified in economic choice paradigms generalize to political choice thus remains an open question. We argue that systematically addressing the commonalities and differences in these two classes of value-based choice will be important in developing a more comprehensive model of the brain basis of human decision-making.

However, the mechanisms regulating expression of Bdnf in drug addiction remain elusive. In the present study, using the conditioned place preference (CPP) model, we showed that expression of Bdnf IV is upregulated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of conditioned animals while Bdnf I is upregulated in cocaine-treated mice irrespective of conditioning. The methylation level of a putative c-MYB binding site in the promoter region of Bdnf IV was significantly decreased in the NAc under cocaine CPP conditioning but remained unchanged without conditioning, concurrently with increased binding of c-MYB to this site. Exon IV promoter/luciferase reporter assays revealed that transactivation of Bdnf by c-MYB was blocked by methylation of this c-MYB binding site. Administration of methionine, a precursor of SAM, inhibited cocaine CPP, reversed demethylation of c-MYB binding site and induction of Bdnf IV expression by cocaine CPP. Our results imply that Bdnf IV demethylation at c-MYB binding site is involved in cocaine-triggered seeking behavior, whereas Bdnf I responds to the immediate pharmacological effects of cocaine.

Some drivers are prone to repeated episodes of risky driving (RD) and are over-represented in crashes and related morbidity. However, their characteristics are heterogeneous, hampering development of targeted intervention strategies. This study hypothesized that distinct personality, cognitive, and neurobiological processes are associated with the type of RD behaviours these drivers predominantly engage in. Methods Four age-matched groups of adult (19-39 years) males were recruited: 1) driving while impaired recidivists (DWI, n = 36); 2) non-alcohol reckless drivers (SPEED, n = 28); 3) drivers with a mixed RD profile (MIXED, n = 27); and 4) low-risk control drivers (CTL, n = 47). Their sociodemographic, criminal history, driving behaviour (by questionnaire and simulation performance), personality (Big Five traits, impulsivity, reward sensitivity), cognitive (disinhibition, decision making, behavioural risk taking), and neurobiological (cortisol stress response) characteristics were gathered and contrasted. Results Compared to controls, group SPEED showed greater sensation seeking, disinhibition, disadvantageous decision making, and risk taking. Group MIXED exhibited more substance misuse, and antisocial, sensation seeking and reward sensitive personality features. Group DWI showed greater disinhibition and more severe alcohol misuse, and compared to the other RD groups, the lowest level of risk taking when sober. All RD groups exhibited less cortisol increase in response to stress compared to controls. Discussion Each RD group exhibited a distinct personality and cognitive profile, which was consistent with stimulation seeking in group SPEED, fearlessness in group MIXED, and poor behavioural regulation associated with alcohol in group DWI. As these group differences were uniformly accompanied by blunted cortisol stress responses, they may reflect the disparate behavioural consequences of dysregulation of the stress system. In sum, RD preference appears to be a useful marker for clarifying explanatory pathways to risky driving, and for research into developing more personalized prevention efforts.

Cortical thickness modulations may underlie, or accompany, functional brain activity changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during emotional processing that tend to be observed in MDD. Methods: Thirteen unmedicated young adults with mild to moderate MDD, aged 18-24, completed a facial expression Go/No Go task and underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess cortical thickness. Cortical thickness and performance on the Go/No Go task was also assessed in age-matched healthy comparison subjects (HCs; N = 14). Results: Participants with depression had thicker left pars opercularis cortices than HCs. They also exhibited impaired response inhibition to neutral faces when responding only to sad faces, and a faster response time overall. Conclusions: Though our sample size is limited, this pilot study nevertheless provides evidence for cortical thickening in left frontal brain regions in a non-severely depressed, young adult group compared to healthy controls. There was also evidence of disturbances in emotion processing in this group.

The aim of the present study was to obtain new quantitative data describing volume, surface area, and thickness of transient compartments in the human fetal cerebrum. Forty-four postmortem fetal brains aged 13-40 postconceptional weeks (PCW) were included in this study. High-resolution T1 weighted MR images were acquired on 19 fetal brain hemispheres. MR images were processed using in-house software (MNI-ACE toolbox). Delineation of fetal compartments was performed semi-automatically by co-registration of MRI with histological sections of the same brains, or with the age-matched brains from Zagreb Neuroembryological Collection. Growth trajectories of transient fetal compartments were reconstructed. The composition of telencephalic wall was quantitatively assessed. Between 13 and 25 PCVV, when the intensity of neuronal proliferation decreases drastically, the relative volume of proliferative (ventricular and subventricular) compartments showed pronounced decline. In contrast, synapse- and extracellular matrix-rich subplate compartment continued to grow during the first two trimesters, occupying up to 45% of telencephalon and reaching its maximum volume and thickness around 30 PCW. This developmental maximum coincides with a period of intensive growth of long cortico-cortical fibers, which enter and wait in subplate before approaching the cortical plate. Although we did not find significant age related changes in mean thickness of the cortical plate, the volume, gyrification index, and surface area of the cortical plate continued to exponentially grow during the last phases of prenatal development. This cortical expansion coincides developmentally with the transformation of embryonic cortical columns, dendritic differentiation, and ingrowth of axons. These results provide a quantitative description of transient human fetal brain compartments observable with MRI. Moreover, they will improve understanding of structural-functional relationships during brain development, will enable correlation between in vitro/in vivo imaging and fine structural histological studies, and will serve as a reference for study of perinatal brain injuries.

Studies on the neural underpinnings of beat processing in the general population suggest that the auditory system is capable of pre -attentively generating a predictive model of upcoming sounds in a rhythmic pattern, subserved largely within auditory cortex and reflected in mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3 event -related potential (ERP) components. The current study examined these neural correlates of beat perception in two beat -deaf individuals, Mathieu and Marjorie, and a group of control participants under conditions in which auditory stimuli were either attended or ignored. Compared to control participants, Mathieu demonstrated reduced behavioral sensitivity to beat omissions in metrical patterns, and Marjorie showed a bias to identify irregular patterns as regular. ERP responses to beat omissions reveal an intact pre -attentive system for processing beat irregularities in cases of beat deafness, reflected in the MMN component, and provide partial support for abnormalities in later cognitive stages of beat processing, reflected in an unreliable P3b component exhibited by Mathieu but not Marjorie compared to control participants. P3 abnormalities observed in the current study resemble P3 abnormalities exhibited by individuals with pitch -based amusia, and are consistent with attention or auditory -motor coupling accounts of deficits in beat perception.

Temporal Prediction in lieu of Periodic Stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory perception; behavior; oscillation; prediction; psychophysics; rhythm	SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL EXPECTATIONS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; ATTENTION; TIME; PERCEPTION; SELECTION; DYNAMICS	Predicting not only what will happen, but also when it will happen is extremely helpful for optimizing perception and action. Temporal predictions driven by periodic stimulation increase perceptual sensitivity and reduce response latencies. At the neurophysiological level, a single mechanism has been proposed to mediate this twofold behavioral improvement: the rhythmic entrainment of slow cortical oscillations to the stimulation rate. However, temporal regularities can occur in aperiodic contexts, suggesting that temporal predictions per se may be dissociable from entrainment to periodic sensory streams. We investigated this possibility in two behavioral experiments, asking human participants to detect near-threshold auditory tones embedded in streams whose temporal and spectral properties were manipulated. While our findings confirm that periodic stimulation reduces response latencies, in agreement with the hypothesis of a stimulus-driven entrainment of neural excitability, they further reveal that this motor facilitation can be dissociated from the enhancement of auditory sensitivity. Perceptual sensitivity improvement is unaffected by the nature of temporal regularities (periodic vs aperiodic), but contingent on the co-occurrence of a fulfilled spectral prediction. Altogether, the dissociation between predictability and periodicity demonstrates that distinct mechanisms flexibly and synergistically operate to facilitate perception and action.

Here, in a cohort of 354 humans with varying karyotypes (XX, XY, XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY, XXXXY), we investigate sex and SCA effects on subcortical size and shape; focusing on the striatum, pallidum and thalamus. Wefind large effect-size differences in the volume and shape of all three structures as a function of sex and SCA. We correct for TBV effects with a novel allometric method harnessing normative scaling rules for subcortical size and shape in humans, which we derive here for the first time. We show that all three subcortical volumes scale sublinearly with TBV among healthy humans, mirroring known relationships between subcortical volume and TBV among species. Traditional TBV correction methods assume linear scaling and can therefore invert or exaggerate sex and SCA effects on subcortical anatomy. Allometric analysis restricts sex-differences to: (1) greater pallidal volume (PV) in males, and (2) relative caudate head expansion and ventral striatum contraction in females. Allometric analysis of SCA reveals that supernumerary X-and Y-chromosomes both cause disproportionate reductions in PV, and coordinated deformations of striatopallidal shape. Our study provides a novel understanding of sex and sex-chromosome dosage effects on subcortical organization, using an allometric approach that can be generalized to other basic and clinical structural neuroimaging settings.

Dopamine cross-sensitization between psychostimulant drugs and stress in healthy male volunteers	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SOCIAL DEFEAT STRESS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; NEUROCHEMICAL SENSITIZATION; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; CORTISOL RESPONSES; HPA AXIS; AMPHETAMINE	Dysregulation of the stress response system is a potential etiological factor in the development of and relapse to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Previously we reported that repeated intermittent D-amphetamine administration can lead to progressively greater dopamine release, thereby providing evidence of drug-induced neurochemical sensitization. Here, we test the hypothesis that repeated exposure to D-amphetamine increases dopaminergic responses to stress; that is, produces cross-sensitization. Using positron emission tomography, we measured in 17 healthy male volunteers (mean +/- s.d. = 22.1 +/- 3.4 years) [C-11]raclopride binding responses to a validated psychosocial stress task before and 2 weeks after a regimen of repeated D-amphetamine (3 x 0.3 mg kg(-1), by mouth; n = 8) or placebo (3 x lactose, by mouth; n = 9). Mood and physiological measurements were recorded throughout each session. Before the D-amphetamine regimen, exposure to the stress task increased behavioral and physiological indices of stress (anxiety, heart rate, cortisol, all P <= 0.05). Following the D-amphetamine regimen, the stress-induced cortisol responses were augmented (P < 0.04), and voxel-based analyses showed larger stress-induced decreases in [11C] raclopride non-displaceable binding potential across the striatum. In the placebo group, re-exposure to stress led to smaller clusters of decreased [C-11]raclopride binding, primarily in the sensorimotor striatum (P < 0.05). Together, this study provides evidence for drug x stress cross-sensitization; moreover, random exposure to stimulants and/or stress cumulatively, while enhancing dopamine release in striatal areas, may contribute to a lowered set point for psychopathologies in which altered dopamine neurotransmission is invoked.

Within the last decade, the nonmedical use of prescription drugs has raised concern, particularly among young adults. Psychostimulants, that is to say amphetamine and its derivatives, are pharmaceuticals, which contribute to what has come to be known in Canada and the United States as the prescription drug crisis. Research in the fields of public health, addiction studies, and neuroethics has attempted to further understand this mounting issue; however, there is a paucity of data concerning the underlying social logics related to the use of these substances. Objectives. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the current literature related to the social context of prescription psychostimulant use among young adults, and to discuss theoretical considerations as well as implications for future research. Methods. A narrative review of the literature was performed. Results. We found that research efforts have chiefly targeted college students, yet there is a lack of knowledge concerning other social groups likely to use these pharmaceuticals nonmedically, such as persons with high strain employment. Three main emerging patterns related to prescription psychostimulant use were identified: (1) control of external stressors, (2) strategic use toward the making of the self, and (3) increasing one's performance. Conclusions. Prescription psychostimulant use among young adults is anchored in contemporary normativity and cannot be separated from the developing performance ethic within North-American and other Western societies. We suggest that pharmaceuticalization and Actor-Network Theory are useful conceptual tools to frame future research efforts.

Neurons diversify astrocytes in the adult brain through sonic hedgehog signaling	SCIENCE			English	Article							SPECIFICATION; TRANSCRIPTOME; INHIBITION; DATABASE; CIRCUIT; CELLS; MODEL; GLIA	Astrocytes are specialized and heterogeneous cells that contribute to central nervous system function and homeostasis. However, the mechanisms that create and maintain differences among astrocytes and allow them to fulfill particular physiological roles remain poorly defined. We reveal that neurons actively determine the features of astrocytes in the healthy adult brain and define a role for neuron-derived sonic hedgehog (Shh) in regulating the molecular and functional profile of astrocytes. Thus, the molecular and physiological program of astrocytes is not hardwired during development but, rather, depends on cues from neurons that drive and sustain their specialized properties.

J	Gauthier, B; Parent, V; Lageix, P				Gauthier, Bruno; Parent, Veronique; Lageix, Philippe			Exploring the dynamics of design fluency in children with and without ADHD using artificial neural networks	CHILD NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ADHD; Process measures; Design fluency; Executive function; Connectionism; Artificial neural networks; Self-organizing maps	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; VERBAL FLUENCY; NORMATIVE DATA; PERFORMANCE; DYSFUNCTION; MOVEMENTS; STATES; TESTS	The neuropsychology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been extensively studied, with a general focus on global performance measures of executive function. In this study, we compared how global (i.e., endpoint) versus process (i.e., dynamic) measures of performance may help characterize children with and without ADHD using a design fluency task as a case study. The secondary goal was to compare the sensitivity of standard versus connectionist statistical models to group differences in cognitive data. Thirty-four children diagnosed with ADHD and 37 children without ADHD aged 8-11years old were tested on the Five-Point Test. The continuous process measure of performance, indexed as the number of produced designs at each consecutive 1 minute interval during 5 minutes, was analyzed against the discrete process measure, that is, the number of designs between first and last intervals and the standard global performance measure of total number of produced designs. Results show that the continuous process measure distinguished the two groups better than the two other measures. The detailed observation of production patterns revealed a decreasing linear trajectory in children without ADHD that contrasts with the flat, but fluctuating productivity pattern of children with ADHD. With regards to the second goal, results show that the connectionist and standard methods are equally sensitive to group differences for the three types of measures. This illustrates the utility of quantitative process measures together with the connectionist method in neuropsychological research and suggests great potential for a dynamical approach to cognition.

Methods: We compared MRI-based cortical thickness and folding complexity between 2 frontal lobe epilepsy cohorts with histologically verified focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) (13 type I; 28 type II) and 41 closely matched controls. Pattern learning algorithms evaluated the utility of group-level findings to predict histologic FCD subtype, the side of the seizure focus, and postsurgical seizure outcome in single individuals. Results: Relative to controls, FCD type I displayed multilobar cortical thinning that was most marked in ipsilateral frontal cortices. Conversely, type II showed thickening in temporal and postcentral cortices. Cortical folding also diverged, with increased complexity in prefrontal cortices in type I and decreases in type II. Group-level findings successfully guided automated FCD subtype classification (type I: 100%; type II: 96%), seizure focus lateralization (type I: 92%; type II: 86%), and outcome prediction (type I: 92%; type II: 82%). Conclusion: FCD subtypes relate to diverse whole-brain structural phenotypes. While cortical thickening in type II may indicate delayed pruning, a thin cortex in type I likely results from combined effects of seizure excitotoxicity and the primary malformation. Group-level patterns have a high translational value in guiding individualized diagnostics.

In the present functional neuroimaging study, we explore the neural bases of active retrieval for auditory nonverbal information, about which almost nothing is known. Human participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a task in which they were presented with short melodies from different locations in a simulated virtual acoustic environment within the scanner and were then instructed to retrieve selectively either the particular melody presented or its location. There were significant activity increases specifically within the midventrolateral prefrontal region during the selective retrieval of nonverbal auditory information. During the selective retrieval of information from auditory memory, the right midventrolateral prefrontal region increased its interaction with the auditory temporal region and the inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere. These findings provide evidence that the midventrolateral prefrontal cortical region interacts with specific posterior cortical areas in the human cerebral cortex for the selective retrieval of object and location features of an auditory memory experience.

Models of drug-induced epileptiform synchronization in vitro	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Animal models in vitro; K+ channel blockers; GABA(A) receptor antagonists; Epileptiform synchronization	ADULT-RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; ORGANOTYPIC SLICE CULTURES; GABA-MEDIATED POTENTIALS; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; GUINEA-PIG; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; INTERICTAL SPIKES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CELL-CULTURE	Models of epileptiform activity in vitro have many advantages for recording and experimental manipulation. Neural tissues can be maintained in vitro for hours, and in neuronal or organotypic slice cultures for several weeks. A variety of drugs and other agents increase activity in these in vitro conditions, in many cases resulting in epileptiform activity, thus providing a direct model of symptomatic seizures. We review these preparations and the experimental manipulations used to induce epileptiform activity. The most common of drugs used are GABA(A) receptor antagonists and potassium channel blockers (notably 4-aminopyridine). Muscarinic agents also can induce epileptiform synchronization in vitro, and include potassium channel inhibition amongst their cellular actions. Manipulations of extracellular ions are reviewed in another paper in this special issue, as are ex vivo slices prepared from chronically epileptic animals and from people with epilepsy. More complex slices including extensive networks and/or several connected brain structures can provide insights into the dynamics of long range connections during epileptic activity. Visualization of slices also provides opportunities for identification of living neurons and for optical recording/stimulation and manipulation. Overall, the analysis of the epileptiform activity induced in brain tissue in vitro has played a major role in advancing our understanding of the cellular and network mechanisms of epileptiform synchronization, and it is expected to continue to do so in future.

Some of these models are based on the systemic administration of chemoconvulsants to induce an initial precipitating injury (status epilepticus) that is followed by the appearance of recurrent seizures originating from limbic structures. In this paper we will review two chemically-induced TLE models, namely the kainic acid and pilocarpine models, which have been widely employed in basic epilepsy research. Specifically, we will take into consideration their behavioral, electroencephalographic and neuropathologic features. We will also evaluate the response of these models to anti-epileptic drugs and the impact they might have in developing new treatments for TLE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most studies in vertebrates have focused on the role of mitotic spindle orientation in proliferative asymmetric divisions and it remains unclear whether altering spindle orientation is required for the production of asymmetric fates in differentiative terminal divisions. Here, we show that the GoLoco motif protein LGN, which interacts with G alpha i to control apicobasal division orientation in Drosophila neuroblasts, is excluded from the apical domain of retinal progenitors undergoing planar divisions, but not in those undergoing apicobasal divisions. Inactivation of LGN reduces the number of apicobasal divisions in mouse retinal progenitors, whereas it conversely increases these divisions in cortical progenitors. Although LGN inactivation increases the number of progenitors outside the ventricular zone in the developing neocortex, it has no effect on the position or number of progenitors in the retina. Retinal progenitor cell lineage analysis in LGN mutant mice, however, shows an increase in symmetric terminal divisions producing two photoreceptors, at the expense of asymmetric terminal divisions producing a photoreceptor and a bipolar or amacrine cell. Similarly, inactivating Gai decreases asymmetric terminal divisions, suggesting that LGN function with Gai to control division orientation in retinal progenitors. Together, these results show a context-dependent function for LGN and indicate that apicobasal divisions are not involved in proliferative asymmetric divisions in the mouse retina, but are instead essential to generate binary fates at terminal divisions.

Acceptance of evidence-supported hypotheses generates a stronger signal from an underlying functionally-connected network	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Hypothesis judgment; Decision-making; Functional connectivity; MEG; fMRI; CPCA	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; DISCONFIRMATORY EVIDENCE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; DEFAULT NETWORK	Choosing one's preferred hypothesis requires multiple brain regions to work in concert as a functionally connected network. We predicted that a stronger network signal would underlie cognitive coherence between a hypothesis and the available evidence. In order to identify such functionally connected networks in magneto encephalography (MEG) data, we first localized the generators of changes in oscillatory power within three frequency bands, namely alpha (7-13 Hz), beta (18-24 Hz), and theta (3-7 Hz), with a spatial resolution of 5 mm and temporal resolution of 50 ms. We then used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify functionally connected networks reflecting co-varying post-stimulus changes in power. As predicted, PCA revealed a functionally connected network with a stronger signal when the evidence supported accepting the hypothesis being judged. This difference was driven by beta-band power decreases in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and midline occipital cortex.

However, surprisingly little is known about the regulation of NGF in these conditions. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are pattern recognition receptors classically associated with innate immunity but more recently were found to be activated by endogenous alarmins such as fragmented extracellular matrix proteins found in degenerating discs or cartilage. In this study we investigated if TLR activation regulates NGF and which signaling mechanisms control this response in intervertebral discs. TLR2 agonists, TLR4 agonists, or IL-1 (control) treatment increased NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and IL-1 gene expression in human disc cells isolated from healthy, pain-free organ donors. However, only TLR2 activation or IL-1 treatment increased NGF protein secretion. TLR2 activation increased p38, ERK1/2, and p65 activity and increased p65 translocation to the cell nucleus. JNK activity was not affected by TLR2 activation. Inhibition of NF-B, and to a lesser extent p38, but not ERK1/2 activity, blocked TLR2-driven NGF up-regulation at both the transcript and protein levels. These results provide a novel mechanism of NGF regulation in the intervertebral disc and potentially other pathogenic connective tissues. TLR2 and NF-B signaling are known to increase cytokines and proteases, which accelerate matrix degradation. Therefore, TLR2 or NF-B inhibition may both attenuate chronic pain and slow the degenerative progress in vivo.	[Krock, Emerson; Currie, J.

Post-vaccination myositis and myocarditis in a previously healthy male	ALLERGY ASTHMA AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Vaccine; Myocarditis; Rhabdomyolysis; Autoimmune; ASIA	ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; INFLUENZA VACCINE; RHABDOMYOLYSIS; ADJUVANTS; AUTOIMMUNITY; ASIA; PERSPECTIVES; INFECTION; FAILURE; DISEASE	Background: The immunological literature has been redefining clinical phenomena as hypotheses emerge regarding causal links between triggers, immunologic manifestations, and their specific inflammatory cascades. Of late, autoimmune manifestations that appear to be caused by an external adjuvant have been grouped into a complex syndrome referred to as autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). This syndrome may present with diverse clinical problems, which may include neurocognitive impairment, inflammatory musculoskeletal changes, and constitutional symptoms. There is evidence in the literature linking vaccines to different auto-immune manifestations. Vaccines have not traditionally been reported to trigger ASIA, although reports are emerging linking the human papilloma virus and hepatitis B vaccines to it. Case presentation: We report the first suspected case of ASIA in a previously healthy patient who received the Fluad seasonal influenza vaccine, which contains the MF59 adjuvant. He presented to hospital with profound weakness and was diagnosed with severe rhabdomyolysis. He also had elevated troponin-I and extensive cardiac investigations enabled the diagnosis of myocarditis. His infectious and rheumatologic work-ups were negative. He responded well to conservative management and did not require immune suppressive therapy. Conclusion: Given the benefits of the influenza vaccine, and the low incidence of clinically significant complications, we encourage ongoing seasonal influenza immunization. However, ongoing surveillance is required to evaluate the occurrence of rare adverse events, including ASIA.

Predators inhibit brain cell proliferation in natural populations of electric fish, Brachyhypopomus occidentalis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						predators; brain cell proliferation; neurogenesis; cortisol; fish	ADULT HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; NEURAL PLASTICITY; STRESS; BEHAVIOR; HYPOTHESIS; RESPONSES; PRESSURE; EXPOSURE	Compared with laboratory environments, complex natural environments promote brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Predators are one important feature of many natural environments, but, in the laboratory, predatory stimuli tend to inhibit brain cell proliferation. Often, laboratory predatory stimuli also elevate plasma glucocorticoids, which can then reduce brain cell proliferation. However, it is unknown how natural predators affect cell proliferation or whether glucocorticoids mediate the neurogenic response to natural predators. We examined brain cell proliferation in six populations of the electric fish, Brachyhypopomus occidentalis, exposed to three forms of predator stimuli: (i) natural variation in the density of predatory catfish; (ii) tail injury, presumably from predation attempts; and (iii) the acute stress of capture. Populations with higher predation pressure had lower density of proliferating (PCNA+) cells, and fish with injured tails had lower proliferating cell density than those with intact tails. However, plasma cortisol did not vary at the population level according to predation pressure or at the individual level according to tail injury. Capture stress significantly increased cortisol, but only marginally decreased cell proliferation. Thus, it appears that the presence of natural predators inhibits brain cell proliferation, but not via mechanisms that depend on changes in basal cortisol levels. This study is the first demonstration of predator-induced alteration of brain cell proliferation in a free-living vertebrate.

However, electrophysiology and functional MRI studies of spontaneous activity patterns, which have greatly increased in number over the past decade, have revealed a close correspondence between these intrinsic patterns and the structural network architecture of functional brain circuits. In particular, by analyzing the large-scale covariation of spontaneous hemodynamics, researchers are able to reliably identify functional networks in the human brain. Subsequent work has sought to identify the corresponding neural signatures via electrophysiological measurements, as this would elucidate the neural origin of spontaneous hemodynamics and would reveal the temporal dynamics of these processes across slower and faster timescales. Here we survey common approaches to quantifying spontaneous neural activity, reviewing their empirical success, and their correspondence with the findings of neuroimaging. We emphasize invasive electrophysiological measurements, which are amenable to amplitude-and phase based analyses, and which can report variations in connectivity with high spatiotemporal precision. After summarizing key findings from the human brain, we survey work in animal models that display similar multi-scale properties. We highlight that, across many spatiotemporal scales, the covariance structure of spontaneous neural activity reflects structural properties of neural networks and dynamically tracks their functional repertoire.

Patients were divided into EO-SVCI (n = 30, age at onset <65 years) and LO-SVCI (n = 112, age at onset 65 years) groups. All patients underwent neuropsychological tests, 3T brain MRI, and [C-11] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET. We compared pathologic burden such as small vessel disease and amyloid burden; structural changes such as structural network, cortical thickness, and hippocampal volume; and cognitive function between EO-SVCI and LO-SVCI.Results:EO-SVCI patients had more lacunes, while LO-SVCI patients had higher PiB standardized uptake value ratios. EO-SVCI patients exhibited more severe structural network disruptions in the frontal area, while LO-SVCI patients exhibited more severe cortical and hippocampal atrophy. Although disease severity did not differ between the 2 groups, frontal-executive dysfunction was more severe in EO-SVCI patients.Conclusions:EO-SVCI patients showed more vascular related factors, while LO-SVCI patients exhibited more Alzheimer disease-related characteristics. The greater number of lacunes in EO-SVCI might account for the more severe frontal network disruption and frontal-executive dysfunction, while the greater amyloid burden in LO-SVCI might account for the more severe cortical and hippocampal atrophy. Our findings suggest that the age at onset is a crucial factor that determines distinct features in SVCI patients, such as pathologic burden, structural changes, and cognitive function.

However, the ability to perform subcellular light stimulation to investigate localized signaling has been limited. Here, we introduce an all optical method for the stimulation and the monitoring of localized Ca2+ signaling in neurons that takes advantage of plasmonic excitation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We show with confocal microscopy that 800 nm laser pulse application onto a neuron decorated with a few AuNPs triggers a transient increase in free Ca2+, measured optically with GCaMP6s. We show that action potentials, measured electrophysiologically, can be induced with this approach. We demonstrate activation of local Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ signaling via CaMKII in dendritic domains, by illuminating a single or few functionalized AuNPs specifically targeting genetically-modified neurons. This NP-Assisted Localized Optical Stimulation (NALOS) provides a new complement to light-dependent methods for controlling neuronal activity and cell signaling.

Some readers possess multidomains for modification recognition and are thus multivalent. Bromodomain- and plant homeodomain-linked finger-containing protein 3 (BRPF3) is such a chromatin reader, containing two plant homeodomain-linked fingers, one bromodomain and a PWWP domain. However, its molecular and biological functions remain to be investigated. Here, we report that endogenous BRPF3 preferentially forms a tetrameric complex with HBO1 (also known as KAT7) and two other subunits but not with related acetyltransferases such as MOZ, MORF, TIP60, and MOF(also known as KAT6A, KAT6B, KAT5, and KAT8, respectively). We have also characterized a mutant mouse strain with a lacZ reporter inserted at the Brpf3 locus. Systematic analysis of beta-galactosidase activity revealed dynamic spatiotemporal expression of Brpf3 during mouse embryogenesis and high expression in the adult brain and testis. Brpf3 disruption, however, resulted in no obvious gross phenotypes. This is in stark contrast to Brpf1 and Brpf2, whose loss causes lethality at E9.5 and E15.5, respectively. In Brpf3-null mice and embryonic fibroblasts, RT-quantitative PCR uncovered no changes in levels of Brpf1 and Brpf2 transcripts, confirming no compensation from them. These results indicate that BRPF3 forms a functional tetrameric complex with HBO1 but is not required for mouse development and survival, thereby distinguishing BRPF3 from its paralogs, BRPF1 and BRPF2.

What sensory cues guide the newborn to the nipple and trigger its attachment to it? Previous experiments showed that low intensity electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion induces FL movement in in vitro preparations and that trigeminal innervation of the facial skin is well developed in the newborn. The skin does not contain Vater-Pacini or Meissner touch corpuscles at this age, but it contains cells which appear to be Merkel cells (MC). We sought to determine if touch perceived by MC could exert an influence on FL movements. Application of the fluorescent dye AM1-43, which labels sensory cells such as MC, revealed the presence of a large number of labeled cells in the facial epidermis, especially in the snout skin, in newborn opossums. Moreover, calibrated pressure applied to the snout induced bilateral and simultaneous electromyographic responses of the triceps muscle in in vitro preparations of the neuraxis and FL from newborn. These responses increase with stimulation intensity and tend to decrease over time. Removing the facial skin nearly abolished these responses. Metabotropic glutamate 1 receptors being involved in MC neurotransmission, an antagonist of these receptors was applied to the bath, which decreased the EMG responses in a reversible manner. Likewise, bath application of the purinergic type 2 receptors, used by AM1-43 to penetrate sensory cells, also decreased the triceps EMG responses. The combined results support a strong influence of facial mechanosensation on FL movement in newborn opossums, and suggest that this influence could be exerted via MC.

Individual Differences in Rhythmic Cortical Entrainment Correlate with Predictive Behavior in Sensorimotor Synchronization	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MEDIAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; STATE EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; MUSICAL RHYTHMS; PERCEPTION; BEAT; DISCRIMINATION; REPRESENTATION; STIMULATION; MOVEMENTS	The current study aims at characterizing the mechanisms that allow humans to entrain the mind and body to incoming rhythmic sensory inputs in real time. We addressed this unresolved issue by examining the relationship between covert neural processes and overt behavior in the context of musical rhythm. We measured temporal prediction abilities, sensorimotor synchronization accuracy and neural entrainment to auditory rhythms as captured using an EEG frequency-tagging approach. Importantly, movement synchronization accuracy with a rhythmic beat could be explained by the amplitude of neural activity selectively locked with the beat period when listening to the rhythmic inputs. Furthermore, stronger endogenous neural entrainment at the beat frequency was associated with superior temporal prediction abilities. Together, these results reveal a direct link between cortical and behavioral measures of rhythmic entrainment, thus providing evidence that frequency-tagged brain activity has functional relevance for beat perception and synchronization.

The leptin > melanocortin > SIM1 pathway is dysregulated in multiple monogenic human obesity syndromes but its downstream targets are still unknown. In ten individuals from six families, with overlapping 6q16.1 deletions, we describe a disorder of variable developmental delay, intellectual disability, and susceptibility to obesity and hyperphagia. The 6q16.1 deletions segregated with the phenotype in multiplex families and were shown to be de novo in four families, and there was dramatic phenotypic overlap among affected individuals who were independently ascertained without bias from clinical features. Analysis of the deletions revealed a similar to 350 kb critical region on chromosome 6q16.1 that encompasses a gene for proneuronal transcription factor POU3F2, which is important for hypothalamic development and function. Using morpholino and mutant zebrafish models, we show that POU3F2 lies downstreamof SIM1 and controls oxytocin expression in the hypothalamic neuroendocrine preoptic area. We show that this finding is consistent with the expression patterns of POU3F2 and related genes in the human brain. Our work helps to further delineate the neuro-endocrine control of energy balance/body mass and demonstrates that this molecular pathway is conserved across multiple species.

The trilateral link between anaesthesia, perioperative visual loss and Flammer syndrome	BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						Perioperative visual loss; Flammer syndrome; Autoregulation; Ocular blood flow; Anesthesia; Ocular/nonocular surgery; Doppler ultrasonography; Velocity; Resistance index; Plasma Endothelin-1 level	ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY; RETINAL VENOUS-PRESSURE; CEREBRAL VASOSPASM; EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID; ENDOTHELIN; GLAUCOMA; POPULATION; SURGERY	Background: A variety of factors have been linked to perioperative visual loss during or directly after nonocular and ocular surgeries. Prolonged immobilization, biochemical factors and hemodynamic instability have been discussed as factors in the pathogenesis of this devastating complication. Perioperative visual loss in four consecutive patients, all featuring Flammer syndrome, is reported herein. To our knowledge, we present the first case series, which associates perioperative visual loss with Flammer syndrome. We assume that a low perfusion pressure, disturbed autoregulation of the ocular blood flow and altered drug sensitivity in such subjects, play significant role in the pathogenesis of this dreaded complication. Cases presentation: We analysed the medical records of four consecutive patients with permanent perioperative visual loss and complemented our findings with additional history taking and clinical examinations. A variety of tests was performed, including colour Doppler ultrasonography of the retroocular vessels, static and dynamic retinal vessel analysis. The visual loss was unilateral in three patients and bilateral in one. An extensive review of published perioperative vision loss cases was conducted. All four patients were male Caucasians, and exhibited prominent signs and symptoms of Flammer syndrome. The visual loss originated from a propensity for unstable ocular blood flow, combined with hyperreactivity toward pharmacological stimuli, leading together to disturbed autoregulation of the blood supply, and subsequently - to ocular hypoxia. An identified intrinsic hypoperfusion diathesis was a crucial pathophysiologic link in all of the patients. Other, yet unknown systemic or local factors may also be involved in this process. Conclusions: A review of numerous publications of perioperative visual loss and our data, support our hypothesis for a novel pathophysiologic model and incorporate Flammer syndrome as a distinct risk factor for paradoxical visual loss, during nonocular and ocular surgeries, or invasive procedures. To prevent the complications produced by disturbed blood flow autoregulation in such patients, guidelines for screening and tailored preoperative approach are given.

The term used in the literature to refer to this co-occurrence is dual diagnosis. The high prevalence of dual diagnosis has led physicians to observe the effects of medication prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders on the co-occurring substance use disorder and vice versa. The concept of medications between psychiatric and addictive disorders stems from these clinical observations, alongside which, however, it has developed from the observation that both psychiatric and substance use disorders share common neurobiological pathways and trigger common cognitive disorders. This has led researchers to develop medications on the basis of neurobiological and cognitive rationales. Material and method: In our article, we review peculiar medications based on neurobiological and cognitive rationales and that have an impact in both psychiatric and addictive disorders. Results: We highlight how interesting these new prescriptions are for clinical observation and for the treatment of patients suffering from dual diagnosis. Conclusion: We then go on to discuss the interest in them from the perspective of clinical practice and clinical research, in that the development of medications to treat dual diagnosis helps to further our knowledge of both psychiatric and substance use disorders.

Orexin Neurons Respond Differentially to Auditory Cues Associated with Appetitive versus Aversive Outcomes	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						arousal; EEG; EMG; MCH; reward; sleep	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; C-FOS EXPRESSION; CANINE NARCOLEPSY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; HYPOCRETIN NEURONS; NEURAL RESPONSES; SLEEP; RAT; REWARD; ACTIVATION	Orexin (Orx) neurons are known to be involved in the promotion and maintenance of waking because they discharge in association with cortical activation and muscle tone during waking and because, in their absence, waking with muscle tone cannot be maintained and narcolepsy with cataplexy ensues. Whether Orx neurons discharge during waking in association with particular conditions, notably with appetitive versus aversive stimuli or positive versus negative emotions, is debated and considered important in understanding their role in supporting particular waking behaviors. Here, we used the technique of juxtacellular recording and labeling in head-fixed rats to characterize the discharge of Orx neurons during the performance of an associative discrimination task with auditory cues for appetitive versus aversive outcomes. Of 57 active, recorded, and neurobiotin-labeled neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, 11 were immunohistochemically identified as Orx-positive (Orx (+)), whereas none were identified as melanin-concentrating hormone-positive. Orx (+) neurons discharged at significantly higher rates during the tone associated with sucrose than during the tone associated with quinine delivered upon licking. They also discharged at high rates after the tone associated with sucrose. Across periods and outcomes, their discharge was positively correlated with EEG gamma activity and EMG activity, which is indicative of cortical activation and behavioral arousal. These results suggest that Orx neurons discharge in a manner characteristic of reward neurons yet also characteristic of arousal neurons. Accordingly, the Orx neurons may respond to and participate in reward processes while modulating cortical activity and muscle tone to promote and maintain arousal along with learned adaptive behavioral responses.

All patients with MS underwent structural MRI and clinical examinations (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite [MSFC]). Whole-brain voxel-wise and cerebellar volumetry were performed to assess differences in regional brain volumes between genotype groups. Resting-state fMRI was acquired from 62 patients with MS to evaluate differences in cerebellar functional connectivity. All participants were genotyped for 4 potentially functional SCN10A polymorphisms.Results:Two SCN10A polymorphisms in high linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.95) showed significant association with MSFC performance in patients with MS (rs6795970: p = 6.2 x 10(-4); rs6801957: p = 0.0025). Patients with MS with rs6795970(AA) genotype performed significantly worse than rs6795970(G) carriers in MSFC (p = 1.8 x 10(-4)) and all of its subscores. This association was independent of EDSS and cerebellar atrophy. Although the genotype groups showed no difference in regional brain volumes, rs6795970(AA) carriers demonstrated significantly diminished cerebellar functional connectivity with the thalami and midbrain. No significant SCN10A-genotype effect was observed on MSFC performance in healthy participants.Conclusions:Our data suggest that SCN10A variation substantially influences functional status, including prominent effects on motor coordination in patients with MS. These findings were supported by the effects of this variant on a neural system important for motor coordination, namely cerebello-thalamic circuitry. Overall, our findings add to the emerging evidence that suggests that sodium channel Na(V)1.8 could serve as a target for future drug-based interventions to treat cerebellar dysfunction in MS.

Prednisone may be offered for improving timed motor function (Level C), reducing the need for scoliosis surgery (Level C), and delaying cardiomyopathy onset by 18 years of age (Level C). Deflazacort may be offered for improving strength and timed motor function and delaying age at loss of ambulation by 1.4-2.5 years (Level C). Deflazacort may be offered for improving pulmonary function, reducing the need for scoliosis surgery, delaying cardiomyopathy onset, and increasing survival at 5-15 years of follow-up (Level C for each). Deflazacort and prednisone may be equivalent in improving motor function (Level C). Prednisone may be associated with greater weight gain in the first years of treatment than deflazacort (Level C). Deflazacort may be associated with a greater risk of cataracts than prednisone (Level C). The preferred dosing regimen of prednisone is 0.75 mg/kg/d (Level B). Over 12 months, prednisone 10 mg/kg/weekend is equally effective (Level B), with no long-term data available. Prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d is associated with significant risk of weight gain, hirsutism, and cushingoid appearance (Level B).

A Multimodal 7-T and 3-T MR Imaging Study with Surface and Tract-based Analysis	RADIOLOGY			English	Article							NORMAL APPEARING WHITE; IN-VIVO; 7 T; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; CONTRAST; DISCONNECTION; DEMYELINATION; TRACTOGRAPHY	Purpose: To investigate in vivo the spatial specificity of the interdependence between intracortical and white matter (WM) pathologic changes as function of cortical depth and distance from the cortex in multiple sclerosis (MS), and their independent contribution to physical and cognitive disability. Materials and Methods: This study was institutional review board-approved and participants gave written informed consent. In 34 MS patients and 17 age-matched control participants, 7-T quantitative T2* maps, 3-T T1-weighted anatomic images for cortical surface reconstruction, and 3-T diffusion tensor images (DTI) were obtained. Cortical quantitative T2* maps were sampled at 25%, 50%, 75% depth from pial surface. Tracts of interest were reconstructed by using probabilistic tractography. The relationship between DTI metrics voxelwise of the tracts and cortical integrity in the projection cortex was tested by using multilinear regression models. Results: In MS, DTI abnormal findings along tracts correlated with quantitative T2* changes (suggestive of iron and myelin loss) at each depth of the cortical projection area (P < .01, corrected). This association, however, was not spatially specific because abnormal findings in WM tracts also related to cortical pathologic changes outside of the projection cortex of the tract (P < .001). Expanded Disability Status Scale pyramidal score was predicted by axial diffusivity along the corticospinal tract (beta = 4.6 x 10(3); P < .001), Symbol Digit Modalities Test score by radial diffusivity along the cingulum (beta = -4.3 x 10(4); P < .01), and T2* in the cingulum cortical projection at 25% depth (beta = -1.7; P < .05). Conclusion: Intracortical and WM injury are concomitant pathologic processes in MS, which are not uniquely distributed according to a tract-cortex-specific pattern; their association may reflect a common stage-dependent mechanism.

PREDICT Sunnybrook ICH CTA Study	Perihematomal Edema Is Greater in the Presence of a Spot Sign but Does Not Predict Intracerebral Hematoma Expansion	STROKE			English	Article						computed tomographic angiography; edema; hematoma expansion; intracerebral hemorrhage; outcome; spot sign	NEUROLOGIC DETERIORATION; CEREBRAL-HEMORRHAGE; NATURAL-HISTORY; BRAIN EDEMA; TIME-COURSE; VOLUME; ENLARGEMENT; MORTALITY; GROWTH; TRIAL	Background and Purpose-Perihematomal edema volume may be related to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume at baseline and, consequently, with hematoma expansion. However, the relationship between perihematomal edema and hematoma expansion has not been well established. We aimed to investigate the relationship among baseline perihematomal edema, the computed tomographic angiography spot sign, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcome in patients with acute ICH. Methods-Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT) was a prospective observational cohort study of ICH patients presenting within 6 hours from onset. Patients underwent computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography scans at baseline and 24-hour computed tomography scan. A post hoc analysis of absolute perihematomal edema and relative perihematomal edema (absolute perihematomal edema divided by ICH) volumes was performed on baseline computed tomography scans (n=353). Primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (>6 mL or >33%). Secondary outcomes were early neurological deterioration, 90-day mortality, and poor outcome. Results-Absolute perihematomal edema volume was higher in spot sign patients (24.5 [11.5-41.8] versus 12.6 [6.9-22] mL; P<0.001), but it was strongly correlated with ICH volume (rho=0.905; P<0.001). Patients who experienced significant hematoma expansion had higher absolute perihematomal edema volume (18.4 [10-34.6] versus 11.8 [6.5-22] mL; P<0.001) but similar relative perihematomal edema volume (1.09 [0.89-1.37] versus 1.12 [0.88-1.54]; P=0.400). Absolute perihematomal edema volume and poorer outcomes were higher by tertiles of ICH volume, and perihematomal edema volume did not independently predict significant hematoma expansion. Conclusions-Perihematomal edema volume is greater at baseline in the presence of a spot sign. However, it is strongly correlated with ICH volume and does not independently predict hematoma expansion.

Progression of White Matter Disease and Cortical Thinning Are Not Related in Older Community-Dwelling Subjects	STROKE			English	Article						ageing; brain; cortex; MRI; white matter hyperintensities	AUSTRIAN STROKE PREVENTION; SMALL-VESSEL DISEASE; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; BLOOD-PRESSURE; BRAIN ATROPHY; MRI DATA; HYPERINTENSITIES; LESIONS; AGE; ASSOCIATION	Background and Purpose-We assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and regional cortical thickness. Methods-We measured WMH volume and regional cortical thickness on magnetic resonance imaging at approximate to 73 and approximate to 76 years in 351 community-dwelling subjects from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. We used multiple linear regression to calculate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between regional cortical thickness and WMH volume controlling for age, sex, Mini Mental State Examination, education, intelligence quotient at age 11, and vascular risk factors. Results-We found cross-sectional associations between WMH volume and cortical thickness within and surrounding the Sylvian fissure at 73 and 76 years (rho=-0.276, Q=0.004). However, we found no significant longitudinal associations between (1) baseline WMH volume and change in cortical thickness; (2) baseline cortical thickness and change in WMH volume; or (3) change in WMH volume and change in cortical thickness. Conclusions-Our results show that WMH volume and cortical thinning both worsen with age and are associated cross-sectionally within and surrounding the Sylvian fissure. However, changes in WMH volume and cortical thinning from 73 to 76 years are not associated longitudinally in these relatively healthy older subjects. The underlying cause(s) of WMH growth and cortical thinning have yet to be fully determined.

MicroRNA Expression Patterns in Human Astrocytes in Relation to Anatomical Location and Age	JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Adult; Fetal; Brain; Human astrocytes; Laser micro-dissection; MicroRNAs	HUMAN-FETAL-BRAIN; ADULT HUMAN ASTROCYTES; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; GLUTAMATE UPTAKE; GERMINAL MATRIX; GENE-EXPRESSION; ISCHEMIA; CANCER; DIFFERENTIATION	Anatomic distribution and age are variables linked to functions of astrocytes under physiologic and pathologic conditions. We measured the relative expression of a panel of microRNAs (miRNAs) in astrocytes captured by laser micro-dissection from normal human adult white and grey matter, human fetal white matter and germinal matrix samples. Although expression of most miRNAs was comparable between adult and fetal samples, regional differences were observed. In the adult cerebral cortex, expression of miRNAs in morphologically distinct inter-laminar astrocytes underlying the glial limitans differed from those in deeper cortical layers, suggesting functional specialization possibly related to structural stability and defense from potentially harmful factors in the cerebrospinal fluid. Differences between adult white and grey matter miRNA expression included higher expression of pro-inflammatory miRNAs in the former, potentially contributing to differences in inflammation between grey and white matter plaques in multiple sclerosis. Lower expression of miRNAs in fetal versus adult white matter astrocytes likely reflects the immaturity of these migrating cells. Highly expressed miRNAs in the fetal germinal matrix are probably relevant in development and also recapitulate some responses to injury. Future studies can address regional alterations of miRNA expression in pathological conditions.	[Rao, Vijayaraghava T.

Medical use of cannabis products Lessons to be learned from Israel and Canada	SCHMERZ			English	Article						Cannabinoids; Herbal cannabis; Medical use; Israel-Canada; Regulatory framework	MARIJUANA	Introduction. The German government intends to reduce the barriers for the medical use of cannabis products. A discussion on the indications and contraindications of the medical use of cannabis and on the changes of the regulatory framework has already begun in Germany. It is useful to draw from the experiences of other countries with a more liberal medical use of cannabis. Methods. The Israeli and Canadian experience is outlined by physicians who have been charged with expertise on the medical use of cannabis by their jurisdiction. Results. In Israel, only the plant-based cannabinoid nabiximol (mixture of tetrahydro-cannabinol/cannabidiol) can be prescribed for spasticity/chronic pain in multiple sclerosis and for cancer pain. The costs of nabiximole are reimbursed by some, but not by all health maintenance organizations. The medical use of marijuana is permitted; however, it is strictly regulated by the government. Selected companies are allowed to produce marijuana for medical use, and only certain physicians are licensed to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic drug for specific indications such as chronic neuropathic, and cancer pain, inflammatory bowel diseases, or posttraumatic stress disorder if conventional treatments have failed. The costs of marijuana are not reimbursed by health insurance companies. In Canada, synthetic cannabinoids and the plant-based (nabiximol) are licensed for neuropathic and cancer pain, HIV-related anorexia and chemotherapy-associate nausea. The costs of these synthetic cannabinoids are covered by health insurance companies. The medical use of marijuana as a treatment option is allowed for individual patients suffering from any medical condition when authorized by a medical practitioner or nurse. Licensed producers are the only source for patients to newly access medical cannabis, al-though those with previous permission to grow may continue cultivation at the present time. The costs of marijuana are not reimbursed by health insurance companies. There are multiple contraindications for the medical use of cannabis products in both countries. Conclusions. The use of standardized, synthetic, and plant-based cannabis products should be allowed in Germany for defined medical conditions when high-level evidence of efficacy and safety exists. The costs should be reimbursed by the health insurance companies. Contraindications for the medical use of cannabis should be defined. Growing marijuana by patients for their medical use should not be allowed.

Reading fiction and reading minds: the role of simulation in the default network	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fiction; reading; theory of mind; default network; simulation; functional MRI	STORY COMPREHENSION; SOCIAL COGNITION; BRAIN PLASTICITY; MODE NETWORK; NEURAL BASES; FUTURE; EXPOSURE; MEMORY; CONSTRUCTION; LANGUAGE	Research in psychology has suggested that reading fiction can improve individuals' social-cognitive abilities. Findings from neuroscience show that reading and social cognition both recruit the default network, a network which is known to support our capacity to simulate hypothetical scenes, spaces and mental states. The current research tests the hypothesis that fiction reading enhances social cognition because it serves to exercise the default subnetwork involved in theory of mind. While undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants read literary passages that differed along two dimensions: (i) vivid vs abstract and (ii) social vs non-social. Analyses revealed distinct subnetworks of the default network respond to the two dimensions of interest: the medial temporal lobe subnetwork responded preferentially to vivid passages, with or without social content; the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) subnetwork responded preferentially to passages with social and abstract content. Analyses also demonstrated that participants who read fiction most often also showed the strongest social cognition performance. Finally, mediation analysis showed that activity in the dmPFC subnetwork in response to the social content mediated this relation, suggesting that the simulation of social content in fiction plays a role in fiction's ability to enhance readers' social cognition.

This approach is based on the support vector machines (SVMs) methodology and an optimization meta-heuristic algorithm called extended great deluge (EGD). The novelty of this approach is the hybridization between the SVM and the EGD algorithm. The EGD is used to optimize the SVM parameters. The training and validation of this new identification approach is realized using the aerodynamic coefficients of an ATR-42 wing model. The aerodynamic coefficients data are obtained with the XFoil software and experimental tests using the Price-Paidoussis wind tunnel. The predicted results with our approach are compared with those from the XFoil software and experimental results for different flight cases of angles of attack and Mach numbers. The main purpose of this methodology is to rapidly predict aircraft aerodynamic coefficients. (C) 2016 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.

As of now, studies about the validity of self-reported use of analgesics among chronic pain (CP) populations are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of self-reported prescribed analgesic medication use. This was attained by comparing the data collected in the Quebec Pain Registry (QPR) database to those contained in the Quebec administrative prescription claims database (Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec [RAMQ]). Methods: To achieve the linkage between the QPR and the RAMQ databases, the first 1285 patients who were consecutively enrolled in the QPR between October 31, 2008 and January 27, 2010 were contacted by mail and invited to participate in a study in which they had to provide their unique RAMQ health insurance number. Using RAMQ prescription claims as the reference standard, kappa coefficients, sensitivity, specificity, and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each therapeutic class of prescribed analgesic drugs that the participants reported taking currently and in the past 12 months. Results: A total of 569 QPR patients responded to the postal mailing, provided their unique health insurance number, and gave informed consent for the linkage (response proportion=44%). Complete RAMQ prescription claims over the 12 months before patient enrollment into the QPR were available for 272 patients, who constituted our validated study population. Regarding current self-reported prescribed analgesic use, kappa coefficients measuring agreement between the 2 sources of information ranged from 0.66 to 0.78 for COX-2-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, skeletal muscle relaxants, synthetic cannabinoids, opiate agonists/partial agonists/antagonists, and antimigraine agents therapeutic classes. For the past 12-month self-reported prescribed analgesic use, QPR patients were less accurate regarding anticonvulsants (kappa=0.59), opiate agonists/partial agonists/antagonists (kappa=0.57), and antimigraine agents use (kappa=0.39). Discussion: Information about current prescribed analgesic medication use as reported by CP patients was accurate for the main therapeutic drug classes used in CP management. Accuracy of the past year self-reported prescribed analgesic use was somewhat lower but only for certain classes of medication, the concordance being good on all the others.

Although antithrombotic-associated intracranial hemorrhage can be devastating, rapid reversal of coagulopathy may help limit hematoma expansion and improve outcomes. Methods The Neurocritical Care Society, in conjunction with the Society of Critical Care Medicine, organized an international, multi-institutional committee with expertise in neurocritical care, neurology, neurosurgery, stroke, hematology, hemato-pathology, emergency medicine, pharmacy, nursing, and guideline development to evaluate the literature and develop an evidence-based practice guideline. Formalized literature searches were conducted, and studies meeting the criteria established by the committee were evaluated. Results Utilizing the GRADE methodology, the committee developed recommendations for reversal of vitamin K antagonists, direct factor Xa antagonists, direct thrombin inhibitors, unfractionated heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, heparinoids, pentasaccharides, thrombolytics, and antiplatelet agents in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions This guideline provides timely, evidencebased reversal strategies to assist practitioners in the care of patients with antithrombotic-associated intracranial hemorrhage.

Centromeres are largely specified by the histone H3 variant CENP-A (also known as Cse4 in yeasts). Structurally, centromere DNA sequences are highly diverse in nature. However, the evolutionary consequence of these structural diversities on de novo CENP-A chromatin formation remains elusive. Here, we report the identification of centromeres, as the binding sites of four evolutionarily conserved kinetochore proteins, in the human pathogenic budding yeast Candida tropicalis. Each of the seven centromeres comprises a 2 to 5 kb non-repetitive mid core flanked by 2 to 5 kb inverted repeats. The repeat-associated centromeres of C. tropicalis all share a high degree of sequence conservation with each other and are strikingly diverged from the unique and mostly non-repetitive centromeres of related Candida species-Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, and Candida lusitaniae. Using a plasmid-based assay, we further demonstrate that pericentric inverted repeats and the underlying DNA sequence provide a structural determinant in CENP-A recruitment in C. tropicalis, as opposed to epigenetically regulated CENP-A loading at centromeres in C. albicans. Thus, the centromere structure and its influence on de novo CENP-A recruitment has been significantly rewired in closely related Candida species. Strikingly, the centromere structural properties along with role of pericentric repeats in de novo CENP-A loading in C. tropicalis are more reminiscent to those of the distantly related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Taken together, we demonstrate, for the first time, fission yeast-like repeat-associated centromeres in an ascomycetous budding yeast.

The functions attributed to the midcingulate cortex (MCC) embrace, among others, feedback processing, pain, salience, action-reward association, premotor functions, and conflict monitoring. This multiplicity of functional concepts suggests either unresolved separation of functional contributions or integration and convergence. We here provide evidence from recent experiments in humans and from a meta-analysis of monkey data that MCC feedback-related activity is generated in the rostral cingulate premotor area by specific body maps directly related to the modality of feedback. As such, we argue for an embodied mechanism for adaptation and exploration in MCC. We propose arguments and precise tools to resolve the origins of performance monitoring signals in the medial frontal cortex, and to progress on issues regarding homology between human and nonhuman primate cingulate cortex.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of age at menopause and the duration of the reproductive period with the risk for depression among postmenopausal women with naturally occurring menopause. DATA SOURCES A search strategy for use of MEDLINE was developed (through January 1, 2015) using the key terms menopause, climacteric, reproductive period, depression, and mood disorders. References of included studies and reviews were also screened; authors were contacted to maximize synthesized evidence. STUDY SELECTION A total of 12 323 articles, without language restriction, were screened by pairs of reviewers to identify observational studies related to the study hypothesis; 14 studies were eligible formeta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Pairs of reviewers independently extracted information on study design and type of analysis by participants' characteristics and methods of depression ascertainment. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and fixed-or random-effects models were implemented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pooled-effect estimates for depression, defined by psychiatric evaluation or validated instruments, by age at menopause and duration of the reproductive period. RESULTS The 14 studies included in the meta-analysis represented 67 714 women. An inverse association (reported as odds ratio [OR]; 95% CI of 2-year increments) with depression in postmenopausal women was shown for increasing age at menopause (0.98; 0.96-0.99 [67 434 unique participants; 13 studies]) and duration of the reproductive period (0.98; 0.96-0.99 [54 715 unique participants; 5 studies]). Menopause at age 40 or more years compared with premature menopause was associated with a 50% decreased risk for depression (3033 unique participants; 4 studies). Pooling of studies examining severe depression showed a 5% decrease in risk of severe depression with increasing (2-year increment) age at menopause (52 736 unique participants; 3 studies); sensitivity analysis of studies controlling for past depression revealed similar results for age at menopause (0.98; 0.96-1.00 [48 894 unique participants; 3 studies). No heterogeneity or publication bias was evident in the main analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Longer exposure to endogenous estrogens, expressed as older age at menopause and longer reproductive period, is associated with a lower risk of depression in later life. Identifying women at higher risk for depression due to early menopause who could benefit from psychiatric intervention or estrogen-based therapies could be useful in the clinical setting.

Methods: Sixteen mice bearing a human tumor cell line xenograft (CH-157MN) were imaged with three different Ga-68-DOTA-peptides (DOTANOC, DOTATATE, DOTATOC) using a small animal PET-CT scanner. Regional activities (input function and tumor) were obtained after manual delineation of regions of interest over the image. The algorithm was implemented under the jClustering framework and used to extract the same regional activities as in the manual approach. The volume of distribution in the tumor was computed using the Logan linear method. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to investigate significant differences between the manually and automatically obtained volumes of distribution. Results: The algorithm successfully segmented all the studies. No significant differences were found for the same tracer across different segmentation methods. Manual delineation revealed significant differences between DOTANOC and the other two tracers (DOTANOC - DOTATATE, p=0.020; DOTANOC - DOTATOC, p=0.033). Similar differences were found using the leader-follower algorithm. Conclusion: An open implementation of a novel segmentation method for dynamic PET studies is presented and validated in rodent studies. It successfully replicated the manual results obtained in small animal studies, thus making it a reliable substitute for this task and, potentially, for other dynamic segmentation procedures.

In addition to the ubiquitous roles of 14-3-3 isoforms, unique tissue specific functions are also described for each isoform. Owing to their role in regulating cell cycle, protein trafficking, and steroidogenesis, 14-3-3 proteins are prevalent in human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and reproductive disorders, and, therefore, serve as valuable drug targets. In this review, we summarize the role of 14-3-3 proteins in normal and disease states, with a focus on 14-3-3-gamma and epsilon. We also discuss drug compounds targeting 14-3-3 proteins and their potential therapeutic uses.

Intracellular mGluR5 plays a critical role in neuropathic pain	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; CORD DORSAL-HORN; NORMAL SENSORY TRANSMISSION; RAT SPINAL-CORD; GROUP-I; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; UP-REGULATION; STRIATAL NEURONS; LOCALIZATION; ANTAGONIST	Spinal mGluR5 is a key mediator of neuroplasticity underlying persistent pain. Although brain mGluR5 is localized on cell surface and intracellular membranes, neither the presence nor physiological role of spinal intracellular mGluR5 is established. Here we show that in spinal dorsal horn neurons >80% of mGluR5 is intracellular, of which similar to 60% is located on nuclear membranes, where activation leads to sustained Ca2+ responses. Nerve injury inducing nociceptive hypersensitivity also increases the expression of nuclear mGluR5 and receptor-mediated phosphorylated-ERK1/2, Arc/Arg3.1 and c-fos. Spinal blockade of intracellular mGluR5 reduces neuropathic pain behaviours and signalling molecules, whereas blockade of cell-surface mGluR5 has little effect. Decreasing intracellular glutamate via blocking EAAT-3, mimics the effects of intracellular mGluR5 antagonism. These findings show a direct link between an intracellular GPCR and behavioural expression in vivo. Blockade of intracellular mGluR5 represents a new strategy for the development of effective therapies for persistent pain.

The aim of this study was to verify whether hLEECs or hREECs secretion of ET-1 induced by NPY is due, in part, to the activation of ETA and/or ETB receptors by the secreted ET-1. Using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence coupled to real 3-D confocal microscopy, as well as ELISA, our results show that in hREECs, the NPY-induced release of ET-1 seems to be due, in part, to the activation of both ETA and ETB receptors. On the other hand, in hLEECs, ETA and ETB receptors do not contribute to the ET-1 released by NPY. Therefore, our results suggest that the NPY-induced release of ET-1 in EECRs is due to NPY receptor activation and the subsequent activation of the ETA and ETB receptors by the released ET-1. However, the release of ET-1 by NPY in hLEECs is mainly due to NPY receptor activation. Furthermore, this secretory process of ET-1 is different between the right and left ventricular cells and highlights the important tuning roles that right and left ventricular EECs possess as well as their contribution to the physiological and pathophysiological states of the underlying heart muscle.

In that view, the buildup of neural activity during perceptual decision making is attributed to temporal integration. However, an alternative explanation is that sensory estimates are computed quickly with a low-pass filter and combined with a growing signal reflecting the urgency to respond and it is the latter that is primarily responsible for neural activity buildup. These models are difficult to distinguish empirically because they make similar predictions for tasks in which sensory information is constant within a trial, as in most previous studies. Here we presented subjects with a variant of the classic constant-coherence motion discrimination (CMD) task in which we inserted brief motion pulses. We examined the effect of these pulses on reaction times (RTs) in two conditions: 1) when the CMD trials were blocked and subjects responded quickly and 2) when the same CMD trials were interleaved among trials of a variable-motion coherence task that motivated slower decisions. In the blocked condition, early pulses had a strong effect on RTs but late pulses did not, consistent with both models. However, when subjects slowed their decision policy in the interleaved condition, later pulses now became effective while early pulses lost their efficacy. This last result contradicts models based on perfect integration of sensory evidence and implies that motion signals are processed with a strong leak, equivalent to a low-pass filter with a short time constant.

Two distinct types of remapping in primate cortical area V4	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUAL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; PERISACCADIC MISLOCALIZATION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SINGLE-UNIT; TIME-COURSE; ATTENTION	Visual neurons typically receive information from a limited portion of the retina, and such receptive fields are a key organizing principle for much of visual cortex. At the same time, there is strong evidence that receptive fields transiently shift around the time of saccades. The nature of the shift is controversial: Previous studies have found shifts consistent with a role for perceptual constancy; other studies suggest a role in the allocation of spatial attention. Here we present evidence that both the previously documented functions exist in individual neurons in primate cortical area V4. Remapping associated with perceptual constancy occurs for saccades in all directions, while attentional shifts mainly occur for neurons with receptive fields in the same hemifield as the saccade end point. The latter are relatively sluggish and can be observed even during saccade planning. Overall these results suggest a complex interplay of visual and extraretinal influences during the execution of saccades.

Impaired neural processing of dynamic faces in left-onset Parkinson's disease	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Event-related potentials; Dynamic facial expressions; Emotion; Side of disease onset	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; BASAL GANGLIA; HEMIPARKINSONS-DISEASE; EMOTIONAL PROSODY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PERCEPTION; MEMORY; FMRI; MOTION; N170	Parkinson's disease (PD) affects patients beyond the motor domain. According to previous evidence, one mechanism that may be impaired in the disease is face processing. However, few studies have investigated this process at the neural level in PD. Moreover, research using dynamic facial displays rather than static pictures is scarce, but highly warranted due to the higher ecological validity of dynamic stimuli. In the present study we aimed to investigate how PD patients process emotional and non emotional dynamic face stimuli at the neural level using event-related potentials. Since the literature has revealed a predominantly right-lateralized network for dynamic face processing, we divided the group into patients with left (LPD) and right (RPD) motor symptom onset (right versus left cerebral hemisphere predominantly affected, respectively). Participants watched short video clips of happy, angry, and neutral expressions and engaged in a shallow gender decision task in order to avoid confounds of task difficulty in the data. In line with our expectations, the LPD group showed significant face processing deficits compared to controls. While there were no group differences in early, sensory-driven processing (fronto-central N1 and posterior P1), the vertex positive potential, which is considered the fronto-central counterpart of the face-specific posterior N170 component, had a reduced amplitude and delayed latency in the LPD group. This may indicate disturbances of structural face processing in LPD. Furthermore, the effect was independent of the emotional content of the videos. In contrast, static facial identity recognition performance in LPD was not significantly different from controls, and comprehensive testing of cognitive functions did not reveal any deficits in this group. We therefore conclude that PD, and more specifically the predominant right-hemispheric affection in left-onset PD, is associated with impaired processing of dynamic facial expressions, which could be one of the mechanisms behind the often reported problems of PD patients in their social lives.

Subdivision of Broca's region based on individual-level functional connectivity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical; fMRI; language; neuroimaging; parcellation	RESTING-STATE FMRI; COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AREAS; PARCELLATION; LANGUAGE; MONKEY	Broca's region is composed of two adjacent cytoarchitectonic areas, 44 and 45, which have distinct connectivity to superior temporal and inferior parietal regions in both macaque monkeys and humans. The current study aimed to make use of prior knowledge of sulcal anatomy and resting-state functional connectivity, together with a novel visualization technique, to manually parcellate areas 44 and 45 in individual brains invivo. One hundred and one resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets from the Human Connectome Project were used. Left-hemisphere surface-based correlation matrices were computed and visualized in brainGL. By observation of differences in the connectivity patterns of neighbouring nodes, areas 44 and 45 were manually parcellated in individual brains, and then compared at the group-level. Additionally, the manual labelling approach was compared with parcellation results based on several data-driven clustering techniques. Areas 44 and 45 could be clearly distinguished from each other in all individuals, and the manual segmentation method showed high test-retest reliability. Group-level probability maps of areas 44 and 45 showed spatial consistency across individuals, and corresponded well to cytoarchitectonic probability maps. Group-level connectivity maps were consistent with previous studies showing distinct connectivity patterns of areas 44 and 45. Data-driven parcellation techniques produced clusters with varying degrees of spatial overlap with the manual labels, indicating the need for further investigation and validation of machine learning cortical segmentation approaches. The current study provides a reliable method for individual-level cortical parcellation that could be applied to regions distinguishable by even the most subtle differences in patterns of functional connectivity.

It remains, however, relatively unclear whether the side of seizure focus differentially impacts the degree of structural damage. This work performed a comprehensive surface-based analysis of mesiotemporal and neocortical morphology on preoperative 1.5 T MRI in 25/35 LTLE/RTLE patients that achieved seizure freedom after surgery (i.e., Engel-I outcome; 7 +/- 2 years follow-up), an imaging-independent confirmation of focus lateralization. Compared to 46 age-and sex-matched controls, both TLE groups displayed marked ipsilateral atrophy in mesiotemporal regions, while cortical thinning was bilateral. Direct contrasts between LTLE and RTLE did not reveal significant differences. Bootstrap simulations indicated low reproducibility of observing a between-cohort difference; power analysis revealed that more than 110 patients would be necessary to detect subtle differences. No difference between LTLE and RTLE was confirmed when using voxel-based morphometry, an independent proxy of gray matter volume. Similar results were obtained analyzing a separate 3 T dataset (15/15 LTLE/RTLE patients; Engel-I after 462 years follow-up; 42 controls). Our results strongly support equivalent gray matter compromise in left and right TLE. The morphological profile of seizure-free patients, presenting with ipsilateral mesiotemporal and bilateral cortical atrophy, motivates the development of neuromarkers of outcome that consider both mesiotemporal and neocortical structures.

A T-2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) MRI technique was recently developed to measure Y-v. A multisite evaluation of this technique would be an important step toward broader availability and potential clinical utilizations of Y-v measures. Methods: TRUST MRI was performed on a total of 250 healthy subjects, 125 from the developer's site and 25 each from five other sites. All sites were equipped with a 3 Tesla (T) MRI of the same vendor. The estimated Y-v and the standard error (SE) of the estimation epsilon(Yv) were compared across sites. Results: The averaged Y-v and epsilon(Yv) across six sites were 61.1% +/- 61.4% and 1.3% +/- 60.2%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the estimated Y-v was dependent on age (P = 0.009) but not on performance site. In contrast, the SE of the Y-v estimation was site-dependent (P = 0.024) but was less than 1.5% in all six sites. Further analysis revealed that epsilon(Yv) was positively associated with the amount of subject motion (P< 0.001) but negatively associated with blood signal intensity (P< 0.001). Conclusion: This work suggests that TRUST MRI can yield equivalent results of Y-v estimation across different sites. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two popular paradigms here are canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based approaches and autoencoder (AE)-based approaches. CCA-based approaches learn a joint representation by maximizing correlation of the views when projected to the common subspace. AE-based methods learn a common representation by minimizing the error of reconstructing the two views. Each of these approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, while CCA-based approaches outperform AE-based approaches for the task of transfer learning, they are not as scalable as the latter. In this work, we propose an AE-based approach, correlational neural network (CorrNet), that explicitly maximizes correlation among the views when projected to the common subspace. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed CorrNet is better than AE and CCA with respect to its ability to learn correlated common representations. We employ CorrNet for several cross-language tasks and show that the representations learned using it perform better than the ones learned using other state-of-the-art approaches.

In a previous study, Aldavert-Vera et al. (2013) reported that post-acquisition LH-ICSS improved 48 h retention of a delay two-way active avoidance conditioning (TWAA) and induced c-Fos expression increase in CA3 at 90 min after administration. Nevertheless, this c-Fos induction was only observed after the acquisition session and not after the retention test at 48 h, when the ICSS improving effect was observed on memory. This current study aims to examine the hypothesis that post-training ICSS treatment may stimulate c-Fos expression at the time of the TWAA retention test in retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a hippocampus-related brain region more closely related with long-lasting memory storage. Effects of ICSS on Arc protein, a marker of memory-associated synaptic plasticity, were also measured by immunohistochemistry in granular and agranular RSC. The most innovative results are that the ICSS treatment potentiates the c-Fos induction across TWAA conditions (no conditioning, acquisition and retention), specifically in layer V of the granular RSC, along with increases of Arc protein levels in the granular but not in agranular areas of RSC ipsilaterally few hours after ICSS. This leads us to suggest that plasticity-related protein activation in the granular RSC could be involved in the positive modulatory effects of ICSS on TWAA memory consolidation, opening a new approach for future research in ICSS memory facilitation.

It usually affects young adults, with a female predominance of 3:1. Men are more likely to develop symptoms at a slightly older age with a more progressive disease course. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory investigations, with a central role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although the exact etiology is still obscure, the leading hypothesis behind MS relapses is acute inflammatory attacks on CNS myelin and axons. This complex process involves B and T cells together with macrophages and microglia. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to be major contributors to the disease's evolution. MS therapies consist of long-term (immunomodulatory) management, focusing on disease modification, and short-term symptomatic control. Symptomatic treatment includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to protect function and restore quality of life (QoL). The introduction and development of disease-modifying medications provide opportunities to change the face of this disease, enhancing QoL over the long-term. Interferon (INF) and Glatiramer acetate (GLAT) represent first line medications with limited effect and relatively fair safety profile. Newer medications with improved efficacy along with a more hazardous side effect profile are now considered second line therapy. ConclusionsThe present review summarizes current knowledge of this frequent disease. Urologists must acquire a deeper understanding for better integration of practice recommendations. Neurourol.

Perceptual learning alters movements, motor learning, and motor networks of the brain. Motor learning changes perceptual function and the sensory circuits of the brain. Here, we review studies of both human limb movement and speech that indicate that plasticity in sensory and motor systems is reciprocally linked. Taken together, this points to an approach to motor learning in which perceptual learning and sensory plasticity have a fundamental role.

This study aims to examine the association of postural sway with hippocampal volume while maintaining upright stance in healthy older individuals. Seventy healthy individuals (mean age 69.7 +/- 3.4 years; 41.4 % women) were recruited in this study based on cross-sectional design. Hippocampal volume (quantified from a three-dimensional T-1-weighted MRI using semi-automated software), three center of pressure (COP) motion parameters (sway area, path length of anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) displacement) while maintaining upright stance (eyes open and closed), and the relative difference between open and closed eye conditions were used as outcome measures. Age, sex, body mass index, lower limb proprioception, distance vision, 15-item geriatric depression scale score, total cranial volume, and white matter abnormalities were used as covariates. The sway area decreased from open to closed eye condition but this variation was non-significant (P = 0.244), whereas path length of AP andML displacement increased significantly (P < 0.003). Increase in sway area from open to closed eyes was associated with greater hippocampal volume (beta -18.21; P = 0.044), and a trend for an association of increase in path length of AP displacement (P = 0.075 for open eyes and P = 0.071 for closed eyes) with greater hippocampal volume was reported. The hippocampus is involved in upright postural control in normal aging, such that an increase in sway area of COPmotion from open to closed eyes is associated with greater hippocampal volume in healthy older adults.

The current study used event-related brain potentials (ERP) to investigate the time course of the explicit processing of erotic, emotional, and neutral pictures in 22 pedophilic patients and 22 healthy controls. Consistent with previous studies, early latency anterior ERP components were highly selective for erotic pictures. Although the ERPs elicited by emotional stimuli were similar in patients and controls, an early frontal positive (P2) component starting as early as 185 ms was significantly attenuated and slow to onset in pedophilia, and correlated with a clinical measure of cognitive distortions. Failure of rapid attentional capture by erotic stimuli suggests a relative reduction in early processing in pedophilic patients which may be associated with relatively diminished sexual interest in adults.

The natural history is unpredictable, and the optimal management of these tumors in children is poorly defined. The aim was to identify outcomes, prognostic factors, and response to various modalities of treatment in a relatively large population of pediatric thalamic tumors from many centers within a fairly homogeneous health care system. We performed a Canadian multicenter retrospective review of pediatric thalamic tumors presenting during the MRI era (1989-2012). Radiology and pathology were reviewed by central independent reviewers. Paraffin shavings for RNA extraction were taken and tested for fusion events involving KIAA1549:BRAF. Tumors were classified as unilateral or bithalamic based on their origin on imaging. Univariate and multivariate analyses on factors influencing survival were performed. Seventy-two thalamic tumors were identified from 11 institutions. Females represented 53 % of the study population, and the mean age at presentation was 8.9 years. Sixty-two tumors were unilateral and 10 bithalamic. Unilateral tumors had a greater propensity to grow inferiorly towards the brainstem. These tumors were predominantly low grade in comparison to bithalamic tumors which were high-grade astrocytomas. The 5-year overall survival was 61 +/- 13 % for unithalamic tumors compared to 37 +/- 32 % for bithalamic tumors (p = 0.097). Multivariate analysis indicated tumor grade as the only significant prognostic factor for unithalamic tumors. Six unilateral tumors, all low grade, were BRAF fusion positive. Unilateral and bilateral thalamic tumors behave differently. Surgical resection is an appropriate treatment option in unilateral tumors, most of which are low grade, but outcome is not related to extent of resection (EOR). Bilateral thalamic tumors have a poorer prognosis, but the occasional patient does remarkably well. The efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated. Novel therapeutic approaches are required to improve the prognosis for malignant unilateral thalamic tumors and bilateral thalamic tumors.

Analysis of Neurological Improvement in a Prospective Cohort Study	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						ASIA impairment scale; fracture; spinal cord; spinal cord injury; spine; surgery; surgical timing; trauma	LATE SURGERY; RECOVERY; STABILIZATION; INTERVENTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; TRAUMA	The prognosis for patients with a complete traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is generally poor. It is unclear whether some subgroups of patients with a complete traumatic SCI could benefit from early surgical decompression of the spinal cord. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the effect of early and late surgical decompression on neurological recovery in complete traumatic SCI and (2) to assess whether the impact of surgical timing is different in patients with cervical or thoracolumbar SCI. A prospective cohort study was followed in a single Level 1 Trauma Center specializing in SCI care. All consecutive patients who sustained a traumatic SCI and were referred between 2010 and 2013 were screened for eligibility. Neurological status was assessed systematically using the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale (AIS) at arrival to the trauma center and at rehabilitation discharge. Patients operated within 24h of the trauma were compared with patients operated later than 24h after the trauma. Potential confounders such as age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), smoking history, body mass index (BMI), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and duration of follow-up were recorded. Fifty-three patients with complete SCI were included in the study: 33 thoracolumbar and 20 cervical SCIs. The 38 patients operated <24h were generally younger than the 15 patients operated 24h (p=0.049). Overall, 28% (15/53) of complete SCI had improvement in AIS: 34% (13/38) who were operated <24h and 13% (2/15) who were operated 24h (p=0.182). Sixty-four percent (9/14) of cervical complete SCI operated <24h had improvement in AIS as opposed to none in the subgroup of six complete cervical SCI operated 24h (p=0.008). Surgical decompression within 24h in complete SCI may optimize neurological recovery, especially in patients with cervical SCI.

It is therefore important to efficiently monitor oil and gas pipelines to optimize their operations and to reduce their failures to an acceptable safety limit. Several models have recently been developed to predict oil and gas pipeline failures and conditions. However, most of these models were limited to the use of corrosion features as the sole factor in assessing pipeline condition. In addition, the use of internal corrosion features in the condition assessment requires the pipe to be piggable, which is not always the case. Modifying pipelines with pigging facilities is not always an easy option and can be very costly and time consuming. This paper presents the development of condition forecasting models for unpiggable oil and gas pipelines based on factors other than those related to internal corrosion. In addition, the paper examines the degree of confidence of the unpiggable model by comparing its results to those obtained using piggable models. Unpiggable models can save both time and cost of usual scheduled in-line inspections. Regression analysis, artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree techniques were used to develop the models based on historical inspection data of existing pipelines in Qatar. All necessary statistical diagnoses have shown sound results for the developed models. When they were validated, the models showed robustness with a satisfactory average validity percentage.

Sentinel Events During the Transition From Hospital to Home: A Longitudinal Study of Women With Traumatic Brain Injury	ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Community integration; Rehabilitation; Traumatic brain injuries; Women	ANXIETY STRESS SCALES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; VOCATIONAL-REHABILITATION; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; DEPRESSION; INDIVIDUALS; OUTCOMES; HEALTH; SAMPLE; PARTICIPATION	Objective: To describe the occurrence of sentinel events and their influence on community integration of women with traumatic brain injury (TBI) transitioning from hospital to home. Design: A longitudinal study was completed with data collected before and at 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge. Setting: Brain injury rehabilitation unit and acute neuroscience ward. Participants: Women (N=25) with severe TBI (aged between 17 and 50 years; duration of posttraumatic amnesia ranged from 1 to 123d). Sixteen family caregivers also participated. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Community integration was measured using the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory. Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. The Sentinel Events Questionnaire was used to record life events that potentially influence the transition process. Results: Most women (>16 at each time point) experienced mild to moderate impairments in psychosocial integration. A third of the sample reported symptoms of depression (n=8), anxiety (n=9), and stress (n=7) that exceeded clinical cutoff levels on at least 1 occasion. At 6 months, 3 women reported clinically significant depression and anxiety (12%) and 2 reported significant stress levels (8%). Positive sentinel events such as return to meaningful occupation were common (n=14). Negative sentinel events were also quite common. For example, reduced access to therapy, reported by 10 women, was associated with poorer participation levels. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the presence of sentinel events influences the transition experiences of women with TBI in this sample. Rehabilitation should consider the occurrence and impact of sentinel events because this may facilitate successful transitions.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Acute care hospitals. Participants: Index cases of TBI (N=29,269) were identified from the Discharge Abstract Database for fiscal years 2002/2003 through 2009/ 2010 and were followed-up until 36 months after injury. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Rehospitalization was defined as admission to an acute care facility that occurred up to 36 months after index injury. Diagnoses associated with subsequent rehospitalization were examined by age and sex. Results: Of the patients with TBI, 35.5% (n=10,390) were subsequently hospitalized during the 3-year follow-up period. Multivariable logistic regression (controlling for index admission hospital) identified men, older age, mechanism of injury being a fall, greater injury severity, rural residence, greater comorbidity, and psychiatric comorbidity to be significant predictors of rehospitalization in a 3-year period postinjury. The most common causes for rehospitalization differed by age and sex. Conclusions: Rehospitalization after TBI is common. Factors associated with rehospitalization can inform long-term postdischarge planning. Findings also support examining causes for rehospitalization by age and sex.

Herein, we demonstrate that curcumin-encapsulated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) 50:50 nanoparticles (NPs-Cur 50:50) are able to prevent the phosphorylation of Akt and Tau proteins in SK-N-SH cells induced by H2O2 and display higher anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities than free curcumin. PLGA can display various physicochemical and degradation characteristics for controlled drug release applications according to the matrix used. We demonstrate that the release of curcumin entrapped into a PLGA 50:50 matrix (NPs-Cur 50:50) is faster than into PLGA 65:35. We have studied the effects of the PLGA matrix on the expression of some key antioxidant-and neuroprotective-related genes such as APOE, APOJ, TRX, GLRX, and REST. NPs-Cur induced the elevation of GLRX and TRX while decreasing APOJ mRNA levels and had no effect on APOE and REST expressions. In the presence of H2O2, both NPs-Cur matrices are more efficient than free curcumin to prevent the induction of these genes. Higher uptake was found with NPs-Cur 50:50 than NPs-Cur 65:35 or free curcumin. By using PLGA nanoparticles loaded with the fluorescent dye Lumogen Red, we demonstrated that PLGA nanoparticles are indeed taken up by neuronal cells. These data highlight the importance of polymer composition in the therapeutic properties of the nanodrug delivery systems. Our study demonstrated that NPs-Cur enhance the action of curcumin on several pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overall, these results suggest that PLGA nanoparticles are a promising strategy for the brain delivery of drugs for the treatment of AD.

We found that GABA neurons from the lateral hypothalamus (LHGABA) exert a strong inhibitory control over TRN GABA neurons (TRNGABA). We found that optogenetic activation of this circuit recapitulated state-dependent changes of TRN neuron activity in behaving mice and induced rapid arousal during NREM, but not REM, sleep. During deep anesthesia, activation of this circuit induced sustained cortical arousal. In contrast, optogenetic silencing of LHGABA-TRNGABA transmission increased the duration of NREM sleep and amplitude of delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TRN cells integrate subcortical arousal inputs selectively during NREM sleep and may participate in sleep intensity.

Here we investigated structural brain differences in expert pianists compared to non-musician controls, as well as the effect of the age of onset (AoO) of piano playing. Differences with non-musicians and the effect of sensitive periods in musicians have been studied previously, but importantly, this is the first time in which the age of onset of music-training was assessed in a group of musicians playing the same instrument, while controlling for the amount of practice. We recruited a homogeneous group of expert pianists who differed in their AoO but not in their lifetime or present amount of training, and compared them to an age-matched group of non-musicians. A subset of the pianists also completed a scale-playing task in order to control for performance skill level differences. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was used to examine gray-matter differences at the whole-brain level. Pianists showed greater gray matter (GM) volume in bilateral putamen (extending also to hippocampus and amygdala), right thalamus, bilateral lingual gyri and left superior temporal gyrus, but a GM volume shrinkage in the right supramarginal, right superior temporal and right postcentral gyri, when compared to non-musician controls. These results reveal a complex pattern of plastic effects due to sustained musical training: a network involved in reinforcement learning showed increased GM volume, while areas related to sensorimotor control, auditory processing and score-reading presented a reduction in the volume of GM. Behaviorally, early-onset pianists showed higher temporal precision in their piano performance than late-onset pianists, especially in the left hand. Furthermore, early onset of piano playing was associated with smaller GM volume in the right putamen and better piano performance (mainly in the left hand). Our results, therefore, reveal for the first time in a single large dataset of healthy pianists the link between onset of musical practice, behavioral performance, and putaminal gray matter structure. In summary, skill-related plastic adaptations may include decreases and increases in GM volume, dependent on an optimization of the system caused by an early start of musical training. We believe our findings enrich the plasticity discourse and shed light on the neural basis of expert skill acquisition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As estimation methods assuming a canonical shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) might not be optimal, we sought to model patient-specific HRF (sHRF) with a simple deconvolution approach for IED-related analysis with EEG-fNIRS data. Furthermore, a quadratic term was added to the model to account for the nonlinearity in the response when IEDs are frequent. Prior to analyzing clinical data, simulations were carried out to show that the HRF was estimable by the proposed deconvolution methods under proper conditions. EEG-fNIRS data of five patients with refractory focal epilepsy were selected due to the presence of frequent clear IEDs and their unambiguous focus localization. For each patient, both the linear sHRF and the nonlinear sHRF were estimated at each channel. Variability of the estimated sHRFs was seen across brain regions and different patients. Compared with the SPM8 canonical HRF (cHRF), including these sHRFs in the general linear model (GLM) analysis led to hemoglobin activations with higher statistical scores as well as larger spatial extents on all five patients. In particular, for patients with frequent IEDs, nonlinear sHRFs were seen to provide higher sensitivity in activation detection than linear sHRFs. These observations support using sHRFs in the analysis of IEDs with EEG-fNIRS data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Preliminary studies have suggested that orthodontic treatments, such as orthopedic mandibular advancement or rapid maxillary expansion, may be effective treatments. The aim is to investigate the efficacy of orthopedic mandibular advancement and/or rapid maxillary expansion in the treatment of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. Pubmed, Medline, Embase, and Internet were searched for eligible studies published until April 2014. Articles with adequate'data were selected for the meta-analysis; other articles were reported in the qualitative assessment. Data extraction was conducted by two independent authors. A total of 58 studies were identified. Only eight studies were included in the review; of these, six were included in the meta-analysis. The research yielded only a small number of studies. Consequently, any conclusions from the pooled diagnostic parameters and their interpretation should be treated carefully. Although the included studies were limited, these orthodontic treatments may be effective in managing pediatric snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. Other related health outcomes, such as neurocognitive and cardiovascular functions have not yet been systematically addressed. More studies are needed with larger sample size, specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and standardized data reporting to help establish guidelines for the orthodontic treatment of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.

Our goal was to evaluate the significance of overall ALK activation in neuroblastoma. Expression of phosphorylated ALK, ALK, and its putative ligands, pleiotrophin and midkine, was screened in 289 neuroblastomas and 56 paired normal tissues. ALK was expressed in 99% of tumors and phosphorylated in 48% of cases. Pleiotrophin and midkine were expressed in 58% and 79% of tumors, respectively. ALK activation was significantly higher in tumors than in paired normal tissues, together with ALK and midkine expression. ALK activation was largely independent of mutations and correlated with midkine expression in tumors. ALK activation in tumors was associated with favorable features, including a younger age at diagnosis, hyperdiploidy, and detection by mass screening. Antitumor activity of the ALK inhibitor TAE684 was evaluated in wild-type or mutated ALK neuroblastoma cell Lines and xenografts. TAE684 was cytotoxic in vitro in all cell lines, especially those harboring an ALK mutation. TAE684 efficiently inhibited ALK phosphorylation in vivo in both F1174I and R1275Q xenografts but demonstrated antitumor activity only against the R1275Q xenograft. In conclusion, ALK activation occurs frequently during neuroblastoma oncogenesis, mainly through mutation-independent mechanisms. However, ALK activation is not associated with a poor outcome and is not always a driver of cell proliferation and/or survival in neuroblastoma.

Because oncogenic lesions often cause deregulation of vascular effectors, including procoagulant tissue factor (TF), this study explores whether there is a Link between C19MC oncogenic miRNAs (oncomirs) and the coagulant properties of cancer cells, a question previously not studied. In a pediatric embryonal brain tumor tissue microarray, we observed an association between C19MC amplification and reduced fibrin content and TF expression, indicative of reduced procoagulant activity. In medulloblastoma cell Lines (DAOY and UW228) engineered to express miR-520g, a biologically active constituent of the C19MC cluster, we observed reduced IF expression, procoagulant and TF signaling activities (responses to factor VIIa stimulation), and diminished IF emission as cargo of extracellular vesicles. Antimir and Luciferase reporter assays revealed a specific and direct effect of miR-520g on the IF 3' untranslated region. Although the endogenous MIR520G locus is methylated in differentiated cells, exposure of DAOY cells to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or their growth as stem cell like spheres up-regulated endogenous miR-520g with a coincident reduction in TF expression. We propose that the properties of tumors harboring oncomirs may include unique alterations of the vascular microenvironment, including deregulation of TF, with a possible impact on the biology, therapy, and hemostatic adverse effects of both disease progression and treatment.

ResultsOf the 147 term-born children with CP (82 males, 65 females; median age 37 months, interquartile range [IQR] 26-52.5) who after moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy had the required outcome data, 61 (41%) met criteria for suspected birth asphyxia. They had a higher frequency of non-ambulatory GMFCS status (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72-6.8), spastic quadriplegia (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.6), non-verbal communication skills impairment (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.0-8.6), isolated deep grey matter injury (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.8-9.5), a lower frequency of spastic hemiplegia (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07-0.42), focal injury (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.04-0.93), and more comorbidities (p=0.017) than those who did not meet criteria. InterpretationTerm-born children who develop CP after neonatal encephalopathy with suspected birth asphyxia have a greater burden of disability than those without suspected birth asphyxia.

High noise correlations between neurons have been reported to increase the encoding accuracy of a neuronal population; however, low noise correlations have also been documented to play a critical role in cortical microcircuits. Therefore, the role of noise correlations in neural encoding is highly debated. To this aim, through multi-electrodes, we recorded neuronal ensembles in the primary visual cortex of anaesthetized cats. By computing cross-correlograms, we divulged the functional network (microcircuit) between neurons within an ensemble in relation to a specific orientation. We show that functionally connected neurons systematically exhibit higher noise correlations than functionally unconnected neurons in a microcircuit that is activated in response to a particular orientation. Furthermore, the mean strength of noise correlations for the connected neurons increases steeply than the unconnected neurons as a function of the resolution window used to calculate noise correlations. We suggest that neurons that display high noise correlations in emergent microcircuits feature functional connections which are inevitable for information encoding in the primary visual cortex.

PREDICT Sunnybrook ICH	Small intracerebral hemorrhages have a low spot sign prevalence and are less likely to expand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE			English	Article						Intracerebral hemorrhage; hemorrhagic stroke; hematoma expansion; prognosis; spot sign	PREDICTS HEMATOMA EXPANSION; CONTRAST EXTRAVASATION; MORTALITY; GROWTH; VOLUME; RISK	Background Hematoma expansion is a major predictor of morbidity and mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Both baseline hematoma volume and the CT-angiogram (CTA) spot sign predict hematoma expansion. Because the CTA spot sign may represent foci of active hemorrhage, we hypothesized that patients with smaller baseline hematoma volumes are less likely to be spot sign positive, and therefore less likely to expand. Aim We sought to validate our prior finding that small hematomas are unlikely to expand, and to determine the relationship between baseline hematoma volume, spot sign status, and risk of hematoma expansion. Methods Data were from the prospective PREDICT ICH study. Patients presenting within 6h of symptom onset with completed baseline CT, CTA, and follow-up CT were included. Baseline hematoma volume was categorized a priori (<3mL, 3-10mL, 10-20mL, >20mL). The primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (6mL, 12.5mL or 33%) and secondary outcomes were early neurological worsening, good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-3), and mortality at 90 days. Results Among 315 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, baseline hematoma volume category predicted absolute hematoma expansion (p<0.001), spot sign prevalence (p<0.001), early neurologic worsening (p=0.002), clinical outcome (p<0.001), and mortality (p<0.001). Very small hematomas (<3mL) were unlikely to be spot positive (7.7%), unlikely to expand (2.6%), and were associated with a 73% chance of good clinical outcome. Spot sign appeared to be most predictive of expansion in the 3-10mL baseline hematoma volume category. Conclusion Very small hematomas are unlikely to expand and have a low spot sign prevalence. Hemostatic therapy trials may be best targeted at hemorrhages >3mL in volume.

Research Review: Executive function deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - a meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; attention-deficit; hyperactivity disorder; meta-analysis; executive function; neuropsychology	PRENATAL ALCOHOL; HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DEFICITS; NEUROBEHAVIORAL PROFILE; NEUROCOGNITIVE PROFILE; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CHILDREN; EXPOSURE	BackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms are common in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD and ADHD groups both display executive function impairments; however, there is ongoing debate whether the pattern and magnitude of executive function deficits differs between these two types of disorders. MethodsAn electronic literature search was conducted (PubMed, PsychInfo; 1972-2013) to identify studies comparing the executive functioning of children with FASD with ADHD or control groups. FASD groups included those with and without dysmorphy (i.e., FAS, pFAS, ARND, and other FASD diagnoses). Effect sizes (Hedges' g, standardized mean difference) were calculated. Random effects meta-analytic models were performed using the metafor package for R. ResultsFifty-one studies met inclusion criteria (FASD N=2,115; ADHD N=453; controls N=1,990). Children with FASD showed the strongest and most consistent deficits in planning, fluency, and set-shifting compared to controls (Hedges' g=-0.94, -0.78) and children with ADHD (Hedges' g=-0.72, -0.32). FASD was associated with moderate to large impairments in working memory, compared to controls (Hedges' g=-.84, -.58) and small impairments relative to groups with ADHD (Hedges' g=-.26). Smaller and less consistent deficits were found on measures of inhibition and vigilance relative to controls (Hedges' g=-0.52, -0.31); FASD and ADHD were not differentiated on these measures. Moderator analyses indicated executive dysfunction was associated with older age, dysmorphy, and larger group differences in IQ. Sex and diagnostic system were not consistently related to effect size. ConclusionsWhile FASD is associated with global executive impairments, executive function weaknesses are most consistent for measures of planning, fluency, and set-shifting. Neuropsychological measures assessing these executive function domains may improve differential diagnosis and treatment of FASD.

Effects of Subdural Monopolar Cortical Stimulation Paired With Rehabilitative Training on Behavioral and Neurophysiological Recovery After Cortical Ischemic Stroke in Adult Squirrel Monkeys	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						implanted stimulation electrodes; primate; primary motor cortex; premotor cortex; neuronal plasticity	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; RAT MODEL; SPINAL-CORD; PLASTICITY; REPRESENTATIONS	Background. Cortical stimulation (CS) combined with rehabilitative training (RT) has proven effective for enhancing poststroke functional recovery in rats, but human clinical trials have had mixed outcomes. Objective. To assess the efficacy of CS/RT versus RT in a nonhuman primate model of cortical ischemic stroke. Methods. Squirrel monkeys learned a pellet retrieval task, then received an infarct to the distal forelimb (DFL) representation of primary motor cortex. A subdural monopolar electrode was implanted over the spared DFL representation in dorsal premotor cortex (PMD). Seven weeks postinfarct, monkeys underwent 4 to 6 weeks of RT (n = 8) or CS/RT (n = 7; 100 Hz, cathodal current) therapy. Behavioral performance was assessed before and after infarct, prior to therapy, and 1 and 12 weeks posttherapy (follow-up). The primary outcome measure was motor performance at 1 week posttherapy. Secondary outcomes included follow-up performance at 12 weeks and treatment-related changes in neurophysiological maps of spared DFL representations. Results. While postinfarct performance deficits were found in all monkeys, both groups demonstrated similar recovery profiles, with no difference in motor recovery between the RT and CS/RT groups. Posttherapy, PMD DFL area was significantly expanded in the RT group but not the CS/RT group. A significant relationship was found between motor recovery and DFL expansion in premotor cortex. Conclusions. Results suggest that the specific parameters utilized here were not optimal for promoting behavioral recovery in nonhuman primates. Though CS/RT has consistently shown efficacy in rat stroke models, the present finding has cautionary implications for translation of CS/RT therapy to clinical populations.

We hypothesized that apoptosis in the fetal brain will be increased in response to both prolonged moderate hypoxia and intermittent severe hypoxia. Twenty-one near term (126-127 days) sheep were divided into 3 groups: control (CON; n = 7), placental embolization (EMB; n = 7), and umbilical cord occlusion (UCO; n = 8). The EMB group had microsphere injections into the umbilical arterial circulation until the oxygen content was at 50% of baseline value. The UCO group had complete cord occlusion for 2 minutes every hour, 6 times a day for 2 consecutive days. At 4 pm on day 2, the animals were euthanized; fetal brains were fixed and prepared for apoptosis staining using the terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay method. In the cerebellar white matter, there was a 3-fold increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells per 1000 cells in both EMB and UCO animals as compared to CON (P = .017). There was also a significant increase in the frontal cortical grey matter (layers 1-3) in EMB animals as compared to CON (P = .014). As such, apoptosis in the near term fetal sheep brain is altered with both sustained moderate hypoxia and intermittent severe hypoxia in the latter part of pregnancy, with potential for long-term neurological sequelae.

Electrocorticographic language mapping with a listening task consisting of alternating speech and music phrases	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; Electrocorticography; Electrocortical stimulation mapping; Language; Music	ELECTRICAL CORTICAL STIMULATION; GAMMA ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; EEG	Objective: Electrocorticographic (ECoG) mapping of high gamma activity induced by language tasks has been proposed as a more patient friendly alternative for electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM), the gold standard in pre-surgical language mapping of epilepsy patients. However, ECoG mapping often reveals more language areas than considered critical with ESM. We investigated if critical language areas can be identified with a listening task consisting of speech and music phrases. Methods: Nine patients with implanted subdural grid electrodes listened to an audio fragment in which music and speech alternated. We analysed ECoG power in the 65-95 Hz band and obtained task-related activity patterns in electrodes over language areas. We compared the spatial distribution of sites that discriminated between listening to speech and music to ESM results using sensitivity and specificity calculations. Results: Our listening task of alternating speech and music phrases had a low sensitivity (0.32) but a high specificity (0.95). Conclusions: The high specificity indicates that this test does indeed point to areas that are critical to language processing. Significance: Our test cannot replace ESM, but this short and simple task can give a reliable indication where to find critical language areas, better than ECoG mapping using language tasks alone.

Here we asked whether this altered neural response reflects a specific devaluation of monetary rewards relative to drug-related rewards by ACC. Methods: We recorded the reward positivity from SD and ND individuals who currently smoke, following an overnight period of abstinence, while they engaged in two feedback tasks. In a money condition the feedback indicated either a monetary reward or no reward, and in a cigarette condition the feedback indicated either a drug-related reward or no reward. Results: Overall, cigarette relative to monetary rewards elicited a larger reward positivity. Further, for the subjects who engaged in the money condition first, the reward positivity was smaller for the SD compared to the ND participants, but for the subjects who engaged in the cigarette condition first, the reward positivity was larger for the SD compared to the ND participants. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the initial category of feedback "primed" the response of the ACC to the alternative feedback type on subsequent trials, and that SD and ND individuals responded differently to this priming effect. Significance: We propose that for people who misuse addictive substances, the prospect of obtaining drug-related rewards engages the ACC to exert control over extended behaviors.

The present study assessed the extent to which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-based metrics of intracortical inhibition are related to motor disability and brain damage. Methods: Participants included forty-three persons with RRMS in the remitting phase and twenty-nine healthy controls. We stimulated the dominant hemisphere and recorded from the dominant hand to assess short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP) duration. Disability was evaluated with the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). Regional cortical thickness and lesion volume were measured. Results: RRMS participants with dominant upper limb dexterity impairments had prolonged CSP, but equivalent SICI, compared to participants with preserved function. CSP was not related to walking or cognitive performance. Higher normalized lesion volume correlated with longer CSP duration. When adjusting for normalized lesion volume, longer CSP significantly predicted worse dominant upper extremity impairment. Conclusions: High intracortical inhibition possibly contributes to (or prevents remission from) motor impairment. Lesions may be associated with intracortical inhibition shifts. Significance: CSP duration and lesion burden should be considered when developing interventions aiming to mitigate motor impairment. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Recent evidence indicates that upstream autophagy signaling events can be triggered by MT1-MMP, a membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase that contributes to the invasive phenotype of brain cancer cells. The signaling functions of MT1-MMP require its intracellular domain, and recent identification of MTCBP-1, a cytoplasmic 19 kDa protein involved in the inhibition of MT1-MMP-mediated cell migration, suggests that modulation of MT1-MMP cytoplasmic domain-mediated signaling may affect other carcinogenic processes. Using qPCR and screening of cDNA generated from brain tumor tissues of grades I, II, III, and IV, MT1-MMP gene expression was found to correlate with increased grade of tumors. Inversely, MTCBP-1 expression decreased with increasing grade of brain tumor. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis revealed that overexpressing a cytoplasmic-deleted MT1-MMP recombinant protein mutant prevented MTCBP-1 recruitment to the intracellular leaf of plasma membrane in U87 glioblastoma cells. The interaction between MTCBP-1 and the 20 amino acids peptide representing the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic domain was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Overexpression of a full-length Wt-MT1-MMP triggered acidic autophagy vesicle formation and autophagic puncta formation for green fluorescent microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (GFP-LC3). Autophagic vesicles and GFP-LC3 puncta formation were abrogated in the presence of MTCBP-1. Our data elucidate a new role for MTCBP-1 regulating the intracellular function of MT1-MMP-mediated autophagy. The inverse correlation between MTCBP-1 and MT1-MMP expression with brain tumor grades could also contribute to the decreased autophagic index observed in high-grade tumors.

The distribution of linear combinations of complex normally distributed random vectors is then obtained, as well as the behavior of quadratic forms in complex multinormal random vectors. We look into the problem of estimating the complex parameters of the complex normal distribution and give their asymptotic distribution. We then propose a virtually omnibus goodness-of-fit test for the complex normal distribution with unknown parameters, based on the empirical characteristic function. Monte Carlo simulation results show that our test behaves well against various alternative distributions. The test is then applied to an fMRI data set and we show how it can be used to "validate" the usual hypothesis of normality of the outside-brain signal.

Previously, we detected expression of Vangl2 in the developing retina during late embryogenesis, which led us to investigate the possible role of Vangl2-mediated PCP signaling in eye development. We have generated a Vangl2(BGeo) knock-in mouse allowing us to evaluate Vangl2 mRNA expression during retinal development, and used an isoform-specific antibody to examine Vangl2 protein expression in cryosections. To investigate the role of Vangl2 in retinal development, we examined eyes taken from embryos homozygous for independent alleles of Looptail (Lp, Lp(m1jus)) mutant mice. We found that Vangl2 mRNA and protein are dynamically expressed in the developing embryonic and postnatal retina, with Vangl2 expression becoming progressively restricted to the ganglion cell layer and optic nerve as the retina matures. The expression pattern of Vangl2 transcript and protein is most prominent in retinal ganglion cells (RGC), and their axons. Additionally, we show that Vangl2 is required for retinal and optic nerve development as Vangl2 (Lp/Lp) mutant embryos display a significantly reduced eye size, marked thickening of the retina, and striking abnormalities in the morphology of the optic nerve (significant hypoplasia, and aberrant exit trajectory). Notably, we identified a salient intraretinal axon guidance defect in Vangl2 (Lp/Lp) mutant embryos through which axon bundles traverse the entire thickness of the retina and become trapped within the subretinal space. Our observations identify a new and essential role for Vangl2-dependent PCP signaling in the intraretinal path-finding of RGC axons. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To gain insight into Ostm1 function, we first investigated by sequence and biochemical analysis an immature 34-kDa type I transmembrane Ostm1 protein with a unique cytosolic tail. Mature Ostm1 is posttranslationally processed and highly N-glycosylated and has an apparent mass of similar to 60 kDa. Analysis the subcellular localization of Ostm1 showed that it is within the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and endosomes/lysosomes. By a wide protein screen under physiologic conditions, several novel cytosolic Ostm1 partners were identified and validated, for which a direct interaction with the kinesin 5B heavy chains was demonstrated. These results determined that Ostm1 is part of a cytosolic scaffolding multiprotein complex, imparting an adaptor function to Ostm1. Moreover, we uncovered a role for the Ostm1/KIF5B complex in intracellular trafficking and dispersion of cargos from the endoplasmic reticulum to late endosomal/lysosomal subcellular compartments. These Ostm1 molecular and cellular functions could elucidate all of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the wide phenotypic spectrum of Ostm1-deficient mice.	[Pandruvada, Subramanya N.

Human and animal studies demonstrate associations between obesity and blunted reward function at the behavioral and neural level, but it is unclear to what degree such changes are a consequence of an obese state and whether they are contingent on dietary lipid class. We sought to determine the impact of prolonged ad libitum intake of diets rich in saturated or monounsaturated fat, separate from metabolic signals associated with increased adiposity, on dopamine (DA)-dependent behaviors and to identify pertinent signaling changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Male rats fed a saturated (palm oil), but not an isocaloric monounsaturated (olive oil), high-fat diet exhibited decreased sensitivity to the rewarding (place preference) and locomotor-sensitizing effects of amphetamine as compared with low-fat diet controls. Blunted amphetamine action by saturated high-fat feeding was entirely independent of caloric intake, weight gain, and plasma levels of leptin, insulin, and glucose and was accompanied by biochemical and behavioral evidence of reduced D1R signaling in the NAc. Saturated high-fat feeding was also tied to protein markers of increased AMPA receptor-mediated plasticity and decreased DA transporter expression in the NAc but not to alterations in DA turnover and biosynthesis. Collectively, the results suggest that intake of saturated lipids can suppress DA signaling apart from increases in body weight and adiposity-related signals known to affect mesolimbic DA function, in part by diminishing D1 receptor signaling, and that equivalent intake of monounsaturated dietary fat protects against such changes.

The present study investigates whether variability in cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults is related to the presence of whole brain or tract-specific changes in white matter microstructure. Specifically, we examine whether age-related decline in performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a cognitive screening tool, is mediated by the white matter microstructural decline. We also examine if this relationship is driven by the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or variability in cerebral arterial pulsatility, an index of cardiovascular risk. Sixty-nine participants (aged 43-87) completed behavioral and MRI testing including T1 structural, T2-weighted FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. Measures of white matter microstructure were calculated using diffusion tensor imaging analyses on the DWI sequence. Multiple linear regression revealed that MoCA scores were predicted by radial diffusivity (RaD) of white matter beyond age or other cerebral measures. While increasing age and arterial pulsatility were associated with increasing RaD, these factors did not mediate the relationship between total white matter RaD and MoCA. Further, the relationship between MoCA and RaD was specific to participants who reported at least one cardiovascular risk factor. These findings highlight the importance of cardiovascular risk factors in the presentation of cognitive decline in old age. Further work is needed to establish whether medical or lifestyle management of these risk factors can prevent or reverse cognitive decline in old age.	[Jolly, Todd A.

This protracted development confers increased vulnerability for environmental and genetic factors to disrupt mesocortical wiring and subsequently influence responses to drugs of abuse in adulthood. The netrin-1 receptor, DCC, orchestrates medial prefrontal cortex dopamine input during adolescence and dictates the functional organization of local circuitry. Haploinsufficiency of dcc results in increased dopamine innervation to the medial prefrontal cortex, which in turn leads to resilience against the behavioral activating effects of stimulant drugs. However, whether sensitivity to the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse is also altered in dcc haploinsufficiency remains to be resolved. Here, we used the curve-shift method to measure cocaine-induced facilitation of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in adult dcc haploinsufficient mice and wild-type littermates. We found that dcc haploinsufficient mice acquire ICSS behavior at comparable stimulation parameters to wild-type controls. However, cocaine-induced potentiation of ICSS is significantly blunted in dcc haploinsufficient mice. These results are consistent with decreased sensitivity to the rewarding effects of cocaine and/or decreased proclivity to invest effort in the pursuit of reward in dcc haploinsufficient mice. Moreover, these findings suggest that DCC signaling determines adult susceptibility to drug abuse most likely by controlling prefrontal cortex development in adolescence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the spatial-cognitive mechanisms that underlie the involvement of these regions in spatial navigation have scarcely been studied. We therefore compared spatial learning and memory performance in mice with lesions in dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) using the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze (MWM) task. Compared to sham-operated controls, animals with DMS damage were impaired during MWM acquisition training. These mice displayed delayed spatial learning, increased thigmotaxis, and increased search distance to the platform, in the absence of major motor dysfunction, working memory defects or changes in anxiety or exploration. They failed to show a preference for the target quadrant during probe trials, which further indicates that spatial reference memory was impaired in these animals. Search strategy analysis moreover demonstrated that DMS-lesioned mice were unable to deploy cognitively advanced spatial search strategies. Conversely, MWM performance was barely affected in animals with lesions in DLS. In conclusion, our results indicate that DMS and DLS display differential functional involvement in spatial learning and memory. Our results show that DMS, but not DLS, is crucial for the ability of mice to acquire spatial information and their subsequent deployment of spatial search strategies. These data clearly identify DMS as a crucial brain structure for spatial learning and memory, which could explain the occurrence of neurocognitive impairments in brain disorders that affect the dorsal striatum.

Risk of venous thrombo- embolic events in pregnant patients with cancer	JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Cancer; deep vein thrombosis; pregnancy; pulmonary embolism; venous thromboembolism	BREAST-CANCER; THROMBOEMBOLISM; PROPHYLAXIS; MORTALITY; WOMEN	Objective: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the leading causes of pregnancy-associated death in the Western world. Cancer is a known risk factor for thrombosis outside of pregnancy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of cancer on the risk of VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnancy.Methods: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study using the Health Care Cost and Utilization Project database from 2003 to 2011. Risk of developing DVT, PE and VTE among pregnant patients with the 10 most prevalent malignancies was measured using unconditional logistic regression analysis.Results: A total of 2826 women were identified with underlying malignancies, among our study cohort of 7917453 women. Risk of VTE was increased among pregnant patients with cervical cancer (OR 8.64, 95% CI (2.15-34.79)), ovarian cancer (OR 10.35, 95% CI (1.44-74.19)), Hodgkin's disease (OR 7.87, 95% CI (2.94-21.05)) and myeloid leukemia (OR 20.75, 95% CI (6.61-65.12)). There was no increased risk of VTE among women with brain cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma and lymphoid leukemia.Conclusion: Many cancers may increase risk of VTE in pregnancy. Appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be considered in some of these women, particularly those with hematological malignancies and gynecologic cancers.

ATLAS Collaboration	Search for single top-quark production via flavour-changing neutral currents at 8TeV with the ATLAS detector	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; HADRON COLLIDERS; DOUBLET MODELS; CROSS-SECTION; ROOT-S=7 TEV; DECAYS; COLLISIONS; LHC; COUPLINGS; STANDARD	A search for single top-quark production via flavour-changing neutral current processes from gluon plus up- or charm-quark initial states in proton-proton collisions at the LHC is presented. Data collected with the ATLAS detector in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb(-1) are used. Candidate events for a top quark decaying into a lepton, a neutrino and a jet are selected and classified into signal- and background-like candidates using a neural network. No signal is observed and an upper limit on the production cross-section multiplied by the t -> Wb branching fraction is set. The observed 95% CL limit is sigma(qg -> t) x B(t -> Wb) < 3.4 pb and the expected 95% CL limit is sigma(qg -> t) x B(t -> Wb) < 2.9 pb. The observed limit can be interpreted as upper limits on the coupling constants of the flavour-changing neutral current interactions divided by the scale of new physics kappa(ugt)/Lambda < 5.8 x 10(-3) TeV-1 and kappa(cgt)/Lambda < 13x10(-3) TeV and on the branching fractions B(t -> ug) < 4.0 x 10(-5) and B(t -> cg) < 20 x 10(-5).

Neural responses towards a speaker's feeling of (un)knowing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERPs; Expressed confidence; Nonverbal communication; Prosody; Pragmatic inference	NON-VERBAL SIGNALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; EMOTIONAL PROSODY; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN RESPONSE; SPEECH PROSODY; VOCAL AFFECT; TIME-COURSE; CONFIDENCE; ERP	During interpersonal communication, listeners must rapidly evaluate verbal and vocal cues to arrive at an integrated meaning about the utterance and about the speaker, including a representation of the speaker's 'feeling of knowing' (i.e., how confident they are in relation to the utterance). In this study, we investigated the time course and neural responses underlying a listener's ability to evaluate speaker confidence from combined verbal and vocal cues. We recorded real-time brain responses as listeners judged statements conveying three levels of confidence with the speaker's voice (confident, close-to-confident, unconfident), which were preceded by meaning-congruent lexical phrases (e.g. I am positive, Most likely, Perhaps). Event-related potentials to utterances with combined lexical and vocal cues about speaker confidence were compared to responses elicited by utterances without the verbal phrase in a previous study (Jiang and Pell, 2015). Utterances with combined cues about speaker confidence elicited reduced, N1, P2 and N400 responses when compared to corresponding utterances without the phrase. When compared to confident statements, close-to-confident and unconfident expressions elicited reduced N1 and P2 responses and a late positivity from 900 to 1250 ms; unconfident and close-to-confident expressions were differentiated later in the 1250-1600 ms time window. The effect of lexical phrases on confidence processing differed for male and female participants, with evidence that female listeners incorporated information from the verbal and vocal channels in a distinct manner. Individual differences in trait empathy and trait anxiety also moderated neural responses during confidence processing. Our findings showcase the cognitive processing mechanisms and individual factors governing how we infer a speaker's mental (knowledge) state from the speech signal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Few studies have yet analyzed which of these measures are the most important for verdict modelling or which data classification techniques perform best for this application. To compare the performance of different techniques in classifying members of a criminal network, this article applies three different machine learning classifiers-Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest-with a range of social network measures and the necessary databases to model the verdicts in two real-world cases: the U.S. Watergate Conspiracy of the 1970' s and the now-defunct Canada-based international drug trafficking ring known as the Caviar Network. In both cases it was found that the Random Forest classifier did better than either Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes, and its superior performance was statistically significant. This being so, Random Forest was used not only for classification but also to assess the importance of the measures. For the Watergate case, the most important one proved to be betweenness centrality while for the Caviar Network, it was the effective size of the network. These results are significant because they show that an approach combining machine learning with social network analysis not only can generate accurate classification models but also helps quantify the importance social network variables in modelling verdict outcomes. We conclude our analysis with a discussion and some suggestions for future work in verdict modelling using social network measures.

In healthy subjects, gender is known to impact the functional brain organization. We investigated whether gender influences also acute stroke functional changes. In thirty-five ischemic stroke patients, we evaluated the excitability of the affected (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) by measuring resting and active motor threshold (AMT) and motor-evoked potential amplitude under baseline conditions and after intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) of AH. We also computed an index of the excitability balance between the hemispheres, laterality indexes (LI), to evidence hemispheric asymmetry. AMT differed significantly between AH and UH only in the male group (p = 0.004), not in females (p > 0.200), and both LIAMT and LIRMT were significantly higher in males than in females (respectively p = 0.033 and p = 0.042). LTP-like activity induced by iTBS in AH was more frequent in females. Gender influences the functional excitability changes that take place after human stroke and the level of LTP that can be induced by repetitive stimulation. This knowledge is of high value in the attempt of individualizing to different genders any non-invasive stimulation strategy designed to foster stroke recovery.

Genome-wide DNA methylation assessed in 9 months post nerve-injury (SNI) and Sham rats, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as in T cells revealed a vast difference in the DNA methylation landscape in the brain between the groups and a remarkable overlap (72%) between differentially methylated probes in T cells and prefrontal cortex. DNA methylation states in the PFC showed robust correlation with pain score of animals in several genes involved in pain. Finally, only 11 differentially methylated probes in T cells were sufficient to distinguish SNI or Sham individual rats. This study supports the plausibility of DNA methylation involvement in chronic pain and demonstrates the potential feasibility of DNA methylation markers in T cells as noninvasive biomarkers of chronic pain susceptibility.

IMPACT OF CHRONIC MORPHINE ON DELTA OPIOID RECEPTOR-EXPRESSING NEURONS IN THE MOUSE HIPPOCAMPUS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptor; chronic morphine; delta opioid receptor; hippocampus; abstinence	IN-VIVO; PROTRACTED ABSTINENCE; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MICE LACKING; ABUSE; DRUG; TRAFFICKING; ACTIVATION; WITHDRAWAL	Delta opioid (DOP) receptors participate to the control of chronic pain and emotional responses. Recent data also identified their implication in spatial memory and drug-context associations pointing to a critical role of hippocampal delta receptors. To better appreciate the impact of repeated drug exposure on their modulatory activity, we used fluorescent knock-in mice that express a functional delta receptor fused at its carboxy-terminus with the green fluorescent protein in place of the native receptor. We then tested the impact of chronic morphine treatment on the density and distribution of delta receptor-expressing cells in the hippocampus. A decrease in delta receptor-positive cell density was observed in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus without alteration of the distribution across the different GABAergic populations that mainly express delta receptors. This effect partly persisted after four weeks of morphine abstinence. In addition, we observed increased DOP receptor expression at the cell surface compared to saline-treated animals. In the hippocampus, chronic morphine administration thus induces DOP receptor cellular redistribution and durably decreases delta receptor-expressing cell density. Such modifications are likely to alter hippocampal physiology, and to contribute to long-term cognitive deficits. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we compared simultaneous (two languages from birth) and sequential (second language learned after age 5 years) bilinguals using a seed-based resting-state MRI approach. We focused on the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as our ROI, as recent studies have demonstrated both neurofunctional and neurostructural changes related to age of second language acquisition in bilinguals in this cortical area. Stronger functional connectivity was observed for simultaneous bilinguals between the left and right IFG, as well as between the inferior frontal gyrus and brain areas involved in language control, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum. Functional connectivity between the left IFG and the right IFG and right inferior parietal lobule was also significantly correlated with age of acquisition for sequential bilinguals; the earlier the second language was acquired, the stronger was the functional connectivity. In addition, greater functional connectivity between homologous regions of the inferior frontal gyrus was associated with reduced neural activation in the left IFG during speech production. The increased connectivity at rest and reduced neural activation during task performance suggests enhanced neural efficiency in this important brain area involved in both speech production and domain-general cognitive processing. Together, our findings highlight how the brain's intrinsic functional patterns are influenced by the developmental timeline in which second language acquisition occurs.

Women recovered from AN (AN REC, n = 17) and healthy controls (HC, n = 15) were recruited. The acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion (APTD) method was used to transiently decrease dopamine synthesis and transmission. The effect of dopamine precursor depletion on drive to exercise was measured using a progressive ratio (PR) exercise breakpoint task. Both groups worked for the opportunity to exercise, and, at baseline, PR breakpoint scores were higher in AN REC than HC. Compared to values on the experimental control session, APTD did not decrease PR breakpoint scores in AN REC, but significantly decreased scores in HC. These data show that women recovered from AN are more motivated to exercise than HC, although in both groups, activity is more reinforcing than inactivity. Importantly, decreasing dopamine does not reduce the motivation to exercise in people recovered from AN, but in contrast, does so in HC. It is proposed that in AN, drive to exercise develops into a behaviour that is largely independent of dopamine mediated reward processes and becomes dependent on cortico-striatal neurocircuitry that regulates automated, habit- or compulsive-like behaviours. These data strengthen the case for the involvement of reward, learning, habit, and dopaminergic systems in the aetiology of AN.

Emergence and evolution of yeast prion and prion-like proteins	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Prion; Evolution; Bias; Composition; Bioinformatics; Disease; Mutation; Yeast; Fungi	SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; COMPOSITIONAL BIAS; IDENTIFY PROTEINS; GENETIC-VARIATION; BUDDING YEAST; MUTATION-RATE; RICH DOMAINS; APLYSIA CPEB; URE3 PRION; PSI+	Background: Prions are transmissible, propagating alternative states of proteins, and are usually made from the fibrillar, beta-sheet-rich assemblies termed amyloid. Prions in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae propagate heritable phenotypes, uncover hidden genetic variation, function in large-scale gene regulation, and can act like diseases. Almost all these amyloid prions have asparagine/glutamine-rich (N/Q-rich) domains. Other proteins, that we term here 'prionogenic amyloid formers' (PAFs), have been shown to form amyloid in vivo, and to have N/Q-rich domains that can propagate heritable states in yeast cells. Also, there are >200 other S. cerevisiae proteins with prion-like N/Q-rich sequence composition. Furthermore, human proteins with such N/Q-rich composition have been linked to the pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative amyloid diseases. Results: Here, we exploit the increasing abundance of complete fungal genomes to examine the ancestry of prions/PAFs and other N/Q-rich proteins across the fungal kingdom. We find distinct evolutionary behavior for Q-rich and N-rich prions/PAFs; those of ancient ancestry (outside the budding yeasts, Saccharomycetes) are Q-rich, whereas N-rich cases arose early in Saccharomycetes evolution. This emergence of N-rich prion/PAFs is linked to a large-scale emergence of N-rich proteins during Saccharomycetes evolution, with Saccharomycetes showing a distinctive trend for population sizes of prion-like proteins that sets them apart from all the other fungi. Conversely, some clades, e.g. Eurotiales, have much fewer N/Q-rich proteins, and in some cases likely lose them en masse, perhaps due to greater amyloid intolerance, although they contain relatively more non-N/Q-rich predicted prions. We find that recent mutational tendencies arising during Saccharomycetes evolution (i.e., increased numbers of N residues and a tendency to form more poly-N tracts), contributed to the expansion/development of the prion phenomenon. Variation in these mutational tendencies in Saccharomycetes is correlated with the population sizes of prion-like proteins, thus implying that selection pressures on N/Q-rich protein sequences against amyloidogenesis are not generally maintained in budding yeasts. Conclusions: These results help to delineate further the limits and origins of N/Q-rich prions, and provide insight as a case study of the evolution of compositionally-defined protein domains.

Despite published guidelines, testing for LOPD is often overlooked or delayed in adults, owing to its low frequency compared to other muscle disorders with similar muscle patterns. Next-generation sequencing has the capability to test concurrently for several muscle disorders. This could potentially lead to increased diagnosis of LOPD, disorders with non-specific muscle weakness or atypical patients. Methods: We developed a gene panel to further study its clinical utility in a cohort of patients with suspected muscle disorders. We designed a gene panel to analyze the coding sequences and splice site junctions of GAA causing LOPD, along with 77 other genes causing muscle disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Results: At a median coverage of similar to 200X (sequences per base), all GAA exons were successfully covered with >20X and only 0.3 % of exons across all genes were <20X. The panel showed an excellent sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (98 %) across all selected genes, using known variations in Pompe patients and controls. We determined its clinical utility by analyzing 34 patients with suspected muscle disorders of undetermined etiology and various muscle patterns, who were referred or followed in neuromuscular and genetics clinics. A putative diagnosis was found in up to 32 % of patients. The gene panel was instrumental in reaching a diagnosis in atypical patients, including one LOPD case. Acid alpha-glucosidase activity was used to confirm the molecular results in all patients. Conclusion: This work highlights the high clinical utility of gene panels in patients with suspected muscle disorders and its potential to facilitate the diagnosis of patients showing non-specific muscle weakness or atypical phenotypes. We propose that gene panels should be used as a first-tier test in patients with suspected muscle disorders of undetermined etiology, which could further increase overall diagnosis of muscle conditions, and potentially reduce diagnostic delay. Further studies are necessary to determine the impact of first-tier gene panels on diagnostic delay and on treatment outcome for LOPD.

Relevance vector classifier decision fusion and EEG graph-theoretic features for automatic affective state characterization	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Affective states; Graph theory; Electroencephalography; Relevance vector machines; Decision fusion	EMOTION RECOGNITION; MUSIC VIDEOS; BRAIN; SIGNALS; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; MACHINE; CORTEX; CONSCIOUSNESS; INFORMATION	Objective characterization of affective states during music clip watching could lead to disruptive new technologies, such as affective brain-computer interfaces, neuromarketing tools, and affective video tagging systems, to name a few. To date, the majority of existing systems have been developed based on analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) patterns in specific brain regions. With music videos, however, a complex interplay of information transfer exists between various brain regions. In this paper, we propose the use of EEG graph-theoretic analysis to characterize three emotional ratings: valence, arousal, and dominance, as well as the "liking" subjective rating. For characterization, graph-theoretic features were used to classify emotional states through support vector machine (SVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM) classifiers. Moreover, fusion schemes at feature and decision levels were also used to improve classification performance. In general, our study shows that the EEG graph-theoretic features are better suited for emotion classification than traditionally used EEG features such as, spectral power features (SPF) and asymmetry index (AI) features. The percentage increase in classification performance, represented by F1-scores, obtained using the proposed methodologies relative to the traditionally used SPF and AI features ranged from: Valence (7-9%), Arousal (3-8%), Dominance (5-6%) and Liking (4-7%). These findings suggest that an EEG graph-theoretical approach along with a robust classifier can better characterize human affective states evoked during music clip watching. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies with healthy volunteers and patients using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) indicate that functional alterations within primary motor cortex (M1) might be one candidate mechanism that could explain MVF-induced changes in behavior. Until now, most studies have used MVF to improve performance of the non-dominant hand (NDH). The question remains if the behavioral effect of MVF differs according to hand dominance. Here, we conducted a study with two groups of young, healthy right-handed volunteers who performed a complex ball-rotation task while receiving MVF of the dominant (n = 16, group 1, MVFDH) or NDH (n = 16, group 2, MVFNDH). We found no significant differences in baseline performance of the untrained hand between groups before MVF was applied. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the amount of performance improvement between MVFDH and MVFNDH indicating that the outcome of MVF seems not to be influenced by hand dominance. Thus our findings might have important implications in neurorehabilitation suggesting that patients suffering from unilateral motor impairments might benefit from MVF regardless of the dominance of the affected limb.

Using resting-state fMRI data acquired before training in English speakers who underwent a 12 week intensive French immersion training course, we investigated whether individual differences in intrinsic resting-state functional connectivity relate to a person's ability to acquire an L2. Wefocused on two key aspects of language processing-lexical retrieval in spontaneous speech and reading speed-and computed whole-brain functional connectivity from two regions of interest in the language network, namely the left anterior insula/frontal operculum (AI/FO) and the visual word form area (VWFA). Connectivity between the left AI/FO and left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) and between the left AI/FO and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex correlated positively with improvement in L2 lexical retrieval in spontaneous speech. Connectivity between the VWFA and left mid-STG correlated positively with improvement in L2 reading speed. These findings are consistent with the different language functions subserved by subcomponents of the language network and suggest that the human capacity to learn an L2 can be predicted by an individual's intrinsic functional connectivity within the language network.

J	Thura, D; Cisek, P				Thura, David; Cisek, Paul			Modulation of Premotor and Primary Motor Cortical Activity during Volitional Adjustments of Speed-Accuracy Trade-Offs	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						decision-making; monkey; speed-accuracy trade-off; urgency	PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; URGENCY SIGNALS; ARM MOVEMENTS; VISUAL-MOTION; MODEL; TASK; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; NEURONS	Recent work suggests that while animals decide between reaching actions, neurons in dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortex reflect a dynamic competition between motor plans and determine when commitment to a choice is made. This competition is biased by at least two sources of information: the changing sensory evidence for one choice versus another, and an urgency signal that grows over time. Here, we test the hypothesis that the urgency signal adjusts the trade-off between speed and accuracy during both decision-making and movement execution. Two monkeys performed a reaching decision task in which sensory evidence continuously evolves over the course of each trial. In different blocks, task timing parameters encouraged monkeys to voluntarily adapt their behavior to be either hasty or conservative. Consistent with our hypothesis, during the deliberation process the baseline and gain of neural activity in decision-related PMd (29%) and M1 cells (45%) was higher when monkeys applied a hasty policy than when they behaved conservatively, but at the time of commitment the population activity was similar across blocks. Other cells (30% in PMd, 30% in M1) showed activity that increased or decreased with elapsing time until the moment of commitment. Movement-related neurons were also more active after longer decisions, as if they were influenced by the same urgency signal controlling the gain of decision-related activity.

Using rat neurons, microtools, and nanotools, we show that new, functional neurites can be created and precisely positioned to directly (re) wire neuronal networks. We show that an adhesive contact made onto an axon or dendrite can be pulled to initiate a new neurite that can be mechanically guided to form new synapses at up to 0.8 mm distance in <1 h. Our findings challenge current understanding of the limits of neuronal growth and have direct implications for the development of new therapies and surgical techniques to achieve functional regeneration.

Electroretinograms, visual evoked potentials (VEP), retinal histology and western blots were obtained from juvenile albino Sprague-Dawley rats at preselected postnatal ages (from P30 to P400) following exposure to 10,000 lux from P14 to P28. Our results show that while immediately following the cessation of exposure, photoreceptor degeneration was concentrated within a well delineated area of the superior retina (i.e. the photoreceptor hole), with time, this hole continued to expand to form an almost photoreceptor-free region covering most of superior-inferior axis. By the end of the first year of life, only few photoreceptors remained in the far periphery of the superior hemiretina. Interestingly, despite a significant impairment of the outer retinal function, the retinal output (VEP) was maintained in the early phase of this retinopathy. Our findings thus suggest that postnatal exposure to a bright luminous environment triggers a degenerative process that continues to impair the retinal structure and function (mostly at the photoreceptor level) long after the cessation of the exposure regimen (more than 1 year documented herein). Given the slow degenerative process triggered following postnatal bright light exposure, we believe that our model represents an attractive alternative (to other more genetic models) to study the pathophysiology of photoreceptor-induced retinal degeneration as well as therapeutic strategies to counteract it.

Abnormalities of white matter integrity have been reported among males with CD and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Little is known about white matter integrity in females with CD. The present study aimed to determine whether abnormalities of white matter are present among young women who presented CD before the age of 15, and whether abnormalities are independent of the multiple comorbid disorders and experiences of maltreatment characterizing females with CD that may each in themselves be associated with alterations of the white matter. Three groups of women, aged on average 24 years, were scanned using diffusion tensor imaging and compared: 28 with prior CD, three of whom presented ASPD; a clinical comparison (CC) group of 15 women with no history of CD but with similar proportions who presented alcohol dependence, drug dependence, anxiety disorders, depression disorders and physical and sexual abuse as the CD group; and 24 healthy women. Whole-brain, tract-based spatial statistics were computed to investigate differences in fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity. Compared with healthy women, women with prior CD showed widespread reductions in axial diffusivity primarily in frontotemporal regions. After statistically adjusting for comorbid disorders and maltreatment, group differences in the corpus callosum body and genu (including forceps minor) remained significant. Compared with the CC group, women with CD showed reduced fractional anisotropy in the body and genu of the corpus callosum. No differences were detected between the CD and healthy women in the uncinate fasciculus.

There is mixed evidence from cohort studies that young children exposed to anaesthesia can have an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in infancy has any effect on neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we report the secondary outcome of neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age in the General Anaesthesia compared to Spinal anaesthesia (GAS) trial. Methods In this international assessor-masked randomised controlled equivalence trial, we recruited infants younger than 60 weeks postmenstrual age, born at greater than 26 weeks ' gestation, and who had inguinal herniorrhaphy, from 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either awake-regional anaesthesia or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Web-based randomisation was done in blocks of two or four and stratified by site and gestational age at birth. Infants were excluded if they had existing risk factors for neurological injury. The primary outcome of the trial will be the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient score at age 5 years. The secondary outcome, reported here, is the composite cognitive score of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III, assessed at 2 years. The analysis was as per protocol adjusted for gestational age at birth. A difference in means of five points (1/3 SD) was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516 and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. Findings Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 363 infants were randomly assigned to receive awake-regional anaesthesia and 359 to general anaesthesia. Outcome data were available for 238 children in the awake-regional group and 294 in the general anaesthesia group. In the as-per-protocol analysis, the cognitive composite score (mean [SD]) was 98.6 (14.2) in the awake-regional group and 98.2 (14.7) in the general anaesthesia group. There was equivalence in mean between groups (awake-regional minus general anaesthesia 0.169, 95% CI-2.30 to 2.64). The median duration of anaesthesia in the general anaesthesia group was 54 min. Interpretation For this secondary outcome, we found no evidence that just less than 1 h of sevoflurane anaesthesia in infancy increases the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age compared with awake-regional anaesthesia.

We investigated the impact of mTBI on the perception of sine-wave gratings defined by first- and second-order characteristics. Fifteen adults diagnosed with mTBI were assessed at 15 days, 3 months, and 12 months postinjury. Fifteen matched controls followed the same testing schedule. Reaction times (RTs) for flicker detection and motion direction discrimination were measured. Stimulus contrast of first- and second-order patterns was equated to control for visibility, and correct-response RT means, standard deviations (SDs), medians, and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated. The level of symptoms was also evaluated to compare it to RT data. In general in mTBI, RTs were longer, and SDs as well as IQRs larger, than those of controls. In addition, mTBI participants' RTs to first-order stimuli were shorter than those to second-order stimuli, and SDs as well as IQRs larger for first- than for second-order stimuli in the motion condition. All these observations were made over the three sessions. The level of symptoms observed in mTBI was higher than that of control participants, and this difference did also persist up to 1 year after the brain injury, despite an improvement. The combination of RT measures with particular stimulus properties is a highly sensitive method for measuring mTBI-induced visuomotor anomalies and provides a fine probe of the underlying mechanisms when the brain is exposed to mild trauma.

We, therefore, aimed at clarifying the qualitative and quantitative relationship between decision-making and the risk of suicidal behavior in unipolar and bipolar disorders respectively, as well as establishing the strength of this relationship. Methods: (1) We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing IGT performances between 141 unipolar suicide attempters and 57 bipolar suicide attempters. (2) We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies comparing IGT performances in patients with vs. without a history of suicidal acts in bipolar and unipolar disorder, together and separately. Results: (1) Among suicide attempters, bipolar and unipolar groups performed similarly (t(195)=-0.7; p=0.48). Unipolar non-attempters performed better IGT than unipolar suicide attempters (t(221)=3.1; p=0.002), only in female gender, whereas performances were similar in bipolar patients whatever the history of suicide attempt (t(77)=-0.3; p=0.7). (2) A meta-analysis of 10 studies confirmed significantly impaired decision-making with a moderate effect-size (0.38 (95% CIF 0.61-0.161; z=-3.3; p=0.001) in unipolar disorder and (g=-0.4 (95% Cl [-0.75 to -0.05]; z=-2.2; p<0.026) in bipolar disorder suicide attempters compared to unipolar and bipolar non-attempters, respectively. Limitations: It was not possible to analyse according to the level of lethality attempt. Conclusion: Overall, a strong significant association was found between decision-making and the risk of suicidal behavior in unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder. However, further neuropsychological studies need to analyse separately unipolar and bipolar disorder and to study gender differences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The data are more variable in youth with MDD, where findings have been inconsistent and the effects of factors such as age and co-morbidity have not been systematically examined. This study therefore assessed hippocampus and subgenual anterior cingulate (sgACC) morphometry in 168 youth, aged 12-25, with or without MDD and comorbid anxiety. Methods: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and clinical assessments were obtained from 80 participants with MDD (36 with comorbid anxiety disorder) and 88 age-matched control participants. Results: Participants with MDD had smaller right hippocampi than controls (p=.013). Older depressed participants (20.1-25 years) had smaller hippocampal volumes than younger ones (< 20.1 years; p=.05); this age effect was not apparent in controls (p=.46). Depression scores, indexed by the HAMD(17), correlated with hippocampal volumes in older depressed youth. Depressed participants with comorbid anxiety had smaller sgACC, but not hippocampal, volumes than those without anxiety (p=.042). Limitations: Longitudinal, versus cross-sectional, studies can most optimally assess the influence of depression on neurodevelopmental profiles. Though our participants were largely treatment-naive or in their first week of pharmacotherapy, a handful had extensive treatment histories; thus, treatment history may have influenced brain morphometry. Conclusions: Age effects were apparent when hippocampal volumes of older and younger participants with MDD were compared; such differences were not apparent in healthy participants. Comorbid anxiety was associated with decreased sgACC volumes suggesting delayed or altered neurodevelopment in a key emotion regulation region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These neurons are excited trans-synaptically, but their precise role in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) has yet to be determined. This study assessed the hypothesis that midbrain dopamine neurons are in series with the directly stimulated substrate for self-stimulation of the MFB and either perform spatio-temporal integration of synaptic input from directly activated MFB fibers or relay the results of such integration to efferent stages of the reward circuitry. Psychometric current-frequency trade-off functions were derived from ICSS performance, and chemometric trade-off functions were derived from stimulation-induced dopamine transients in the nucleus accurhbens (NAc) shell, measured by means of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Whereas the psychometric functions decline monotonically over a broad range of pulse frequencies and level off only at high frequencies, the chemometric functions obtained with the same rats and electrodes are either U-shaped or level off at lower pulse frequencies. This discrepancy was observed when the dopamine transients were recorded in either anesthetized or awake subjects. The lack of correspondence between the psychometric and chemometric functions is inconsistent with the hypothesis that dopamine neurons projecting to the NAc shell constitute an entire series stage of the neural circuit subserving self-stimulation of the MFB.

Modeling of human motor control and motor learning has attracted researchers' attention in robotics and artificial intelligence for decades. It is obvious that discovering the motor control functionality of brain as the most complex, sophisticated and powerful information-processing device leads to significant advancements in robots movement Hence, our proposed modular controller is based on human brain behavior in using neural mechanisms named internal models and primitive motion identification which leads to extract and learn the latent simple motions in order to imitate observed complex movements. The study is accomplished based on formerly proposed structure, MOSAIC, which provides remarkable efficiency in motor control modeling. Examination of the proposed structure with real recorded data, confirms the performance of the controller in learning and executing motion tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some studies have reported inverted-U shape curves with peaks of CTh in late childhood to adolescence, while others suggested predominant monotonic decline after age 6. In this study, we reviewed CTh developmental trajectories in the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development, and in a second step, evaluated the impact of post-processing quality control (QC) procedures on identified trajectories. The quality-controlled sample included 384 individual subjects with repeated scanning (1-3 per subject, total scans n = 753) from 4.9 to 22.3 years of age. The best-fit model (cubic, quadratic, or first-order linear) was identified at each vertex using mixed-effects models. The majority of brain regions showed linear monotonic decline of CTh. There were few areas of cubic trajectories, mostly in bilateral temporo-parietal areas and the right prefrontal cortex, in which CTh peaks were at, or prior to, age 8. When controlling for total brain volume, CTh trajectories were even more uniformly linear. The only sex difference was faster thinning of occipital areas in boys compared to girls. The best-fit model for whole brain mean thickness was a monotonic decline of 0.027 mm per year. QC procedures had a significant impact on identified trajectories, with a clear shift toward more complex trajectories (i.e., quadratic or cubic) when including all scans without QC (n = 954). Trajectories were almost exclusively linear when using only scans that passed the most stringent QC (n=598). The impact of QC probably relates to decreasing the inclusion of scans with CTh underestimation secondary to movement artifacts, which are more common in younger subjects. In summary, our results suggest that CTh follows a simple linear decline in most cortical areas by age 5, and all areas by age 8. This study further supports the crucial importance of implementing post-processing QC in CTh studies of development, aging, and neuropsychiatric disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to large differences in the phenomena measured by these modalities, the assumptions necessary to make inferences about axonal connections, and the limitations accompanying each, brain connectivity remains an elusive concept. Despite this, only a handful of studies have directly compared connectivity as inferred from multiple modalities, and there remains much ambiguity over what the term is actually referring to as a biological construct. Here, we perform a direct comparison based on the high-resolution and high-contrast Enhanced Nathan Klein Institute (NKI) Rockland Sample neuroimaging data set, and the CoCoMac database of tract tracing studies. We compare four types of commonly-used primate connectivity analyses: tract tracing experiments, compiled in CoCoMac; group-wise correlation of cortical thickness; tractographic networks computed from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI); and correlational networks obtained from resting-state BOLD (fMRI). We find generally poor correspondence between all four modalities, in terms of correlated edge weights, binarized comparisons of thresholded networks, and clustering patterns. fMRI and DWI had the best agreement, followed by DWI and CoCoMac, while other comparisons showed striking divergence. Networks had the best correspondence for local ipsilateral and homotopic contralateral connections, and the worst correspondence for long-range and heterotopic contralateral connections. k-Means clustering highlighted the lowest cross-modal and cross-species consensus in lateral and medial temporal lobes, anterior cingulate, and the temporoparietal junction. Comparing the NKI results to those of the lower resolution/contrast International Consortium for Brain Imaging (ICBM) dataset, we find that the relative pattern of intermodal relationships is preserved, but the correspondence between human imaging connectomes is substantially better for NKI. These findings caution against using "connectivity" as an umbrella term for results derived from single empirical modalities, and suggest that any interpretation of these results should account for (and ideally help explain) the lack of multimodal correspondence.

Deep brain stimulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex causes reorganization of neuronal processes and vasculature	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MOUSE-BRAIN; RAT; MODEL; MICE; REGISTRATION; MEMORY	Background: Chronic high-frequency electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate region is currently being investigated clinically as a therapy for treatment of refractory depression. Experimental DBS of the homologous region, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), in rodent models has previously demonstrated anti-depressant-like effects. Our goal was to determine if structural remodeling accompanies the alterations of brain function previously observed as a result of chronic DBS. Methods: Here we applied 6 h of high-frequency bilateral VMPFC DBS daily to 8 9-week old C57Bl/6 mice for 5 days. We investigated the "micro-lesion" effect by using a sham stimulation group (8 mice) and a control group (8 mice with a hole drilled into the skull only). Whole brain anatomy was investigated post-mortem using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and areas demonstrating volumetric expansion were further investigated using histology and immunohistochemistry. Results: The DBS group demonstrated bilateral increases in whole hippocampus and the left thalamus volume compared to both sham and control groups. Local hippocampal and thalamic volume increases were also observed at the voxel-level; however these increases were observed in both DBS and sham groups. Follow-up immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus revealed DBS increased blood vessel size and synaptic density relative to the control group whereas the sham group demonstrated increased astrocyte size. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that DBS not only works by altering function with neural circuits, but also by structurally altering circuits at the cellular level. Neuroplastic alterations may play a role inmediating the clinical efficacy of DBS therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Chakravarty, M.

The Reference Ability Neural Network Study: Life-time stability of reference-ability neural networks derived from task maps of young adults	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; NEUROIMAGING DATA; VARIABLES; MATTER; BRAIN	Analyses of large test batteries administered to individuals ranging from young to old have consistently yielded a set of latent variables representing reference abilities (RAs) that capture the majority of the variance in age-related cognitive change: Episodic Memory, Fluid Reasoning, Perceptual Processing Speed, and Vocabulary. In a previous paper (Stern et al., 2014), we introduced the Reference Ability Neural Network Study, which administers 12 cognitive neuroimaging tasks (3 for each RA) to healthy adults age 20-80 in order to derive unique neural networks underlying these 4 RAs and investigate how these networks may be affected by aging. We used a multivariate approach, linear indicator regression, to derive a unique covariance pattern or Reference Ability Neural Network (RANN) for each of the 4 RAs. The RANNs were derived from the neural task data of 64 younger adults of age 30 and below. We then prospectively applied the RANNs to fMRI data from the remaining sample of 227 adults of age 31 and above in order to classify each subject-taskmap into one of the 4 possible reference domains. Overall classification accuracy across subjects in the sample age 31 and above was 0.80 +/- 0.18. Classification accuracy by RA domain was also good, but variable; memory: 0.72 +/- 0.32; reasoning: 0.75 +/- 0.35; speed: 0.79 +/- 0.31; vocabulary: 0.94 +/- 0.16. Classification accuracy was not associated with cross-sectional age, suggesting that these networks, and their specificity to the respective reference domain, might remain intact throughout the age range. Higher mean brain volume was correlated with increased overall classification accuracy; better overall performance on the tasks in the scanner was also associated with classification accuracy. For the RANN network scores, we observed for each RANN that a higher score was associated with a higher corresponding classification accuracy for that reference ability. Despite the absence of behavioral performance information in the derivation of these networks, we also observed some brain-behavioral correlations, notably for the fluid-reasoning network whose network score correlated with performance on the memory and fluid-reasoning tasks. While age did not influence the expression of this RANN, the slope of the association between network score and fluid-reasoning performance was negatively associated with higher ages. These results provide support for the hypothesis that a set of specific, age-invariant neural networks underlies these four RAs, and that these networks maintain their cognitive specificity and level of intensity across age. Activation common to all 12 tasks was identified as another activation pattern resulting from a mean-contrast Partial-Least-Squares technique. This common pattern did show associations with age and some subject demographics for some of the reference domains, lending support to the overall conclusion that aspects of neural processing that are specific to any cognitive reference ability stay constant across age, while aspects that are common to all reference abilities differ across age.

Baseline oxygenation in the brain: Correlation between respiratory-calibration and susceptibility methods	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain oxygenation; Oxygen extraction fraction; Quantitative susceptibility mapping; Calibrated BOLD; Magnetic resonance imaging	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; EXTRACTION FRACTION; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; VENOUS OXYGENATION; MAGNETIC-FIELD; FUNCTIONAL MRI; IN-VIVO; PHASE-CONTRAST; HYPEROXIA; HYPERCAPNIA	New MRI methods for noninvasive imaging of baseline oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the brain show great promise. Quantitative O-2 imaging (QUO2) applies a biophysical model to measure OEF in tissue from BOLD, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and end-tidal O-2 (ETO2) signals acquired during two or more gas manipulations. Alternatively, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) maps baseline OEF along cerebral vessels based on the deoxyhemoblogin (dHb) susceptibility shift between veins and water. However, these approaches have not been carefully compared to each other or to known physiological signals. The aims of this study were to compare OEF values by QUO2 and QSM; and to see if baseline OEF relates to BOLD and CBF changes during a visual task. Simultaneous BOLD and arterial spin labeling (ASL) scans were acquired at 7 T in 11 healthy subjects continuously during hypercapnia (5% CO2, 21% O-2), hyperoxia (100% O-2), and carbogen (5% CO2, 95% O-2) for QUO2 analysis. Separate BOLD-ASL scans were acquired during a checkerboard stimulus to identify functional changes in the visual cortex. Gradient echo phase images were also collected at rest for QSM reconstruction of OEF along cerebral veins draining the visual cortex. Mean baseline OEF was (43.5 +/- 14)% for QUO2 with two gases, (42.3 +/- 17)% for QUO2 with three gases, and (29.4 +/- 3)% for QSM across volunteers. Three-gas QUO2 values of OEF correlated with QSM values of OEF (P = 0.03). However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed that QUO2 tended to measure higher baseline OEF with respect to QSM, which likely results from underestimation of the hyperoxic BOLD signal and low signal-to-noise ratio of the ASL acquisitions. Across subjects, the percent CBF change during the visual task correlated with OEF measured by 3-gas QUO2 (P < 0.04); and by QSM (P = 0.035), providing evidence that the new methods measure true variations in brain physiology across subjects.

However, there is not yet a consensus on the preferred method for resting-state analysis. Because the brain is reported to have complex interconnected networks according to graph theoretical analysis, the independency assumption, as in the popular independent component analysis (ICA) approach, often does not hold. Here, rather than using the independency assumption, we present a new statistical parameter mapping (SPM)-type analysis method based on a sparse graph model where temporal dynamics at each voxel position are described as a sparse combination of global brain dynamics. In particular, a new concept of a spatially adaptive design matrix has been proposed to represent local connectivity that shares the same temporal dynamics. If we further assume that local network structures within a group are similar, the estimation problem of global and local dynamics can be solved using sparse dictionary learning for the concatenated temporal data across subjects. Moreover, under the homoscedasticity variance assumption across subjects and groups that is often used in SPM analysis, the aforementioned individual and group analyses using sparse dictionary learning can be accurately modeled by a mixed-effect model, which also facilitates a standard SPM-type group-level inference using summary statistics. Using an extensive resting fMRI data set obtained from normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease patient groups, we demonstrated that the changes in the default mode network extracted by the proposed method are more closely correlated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Research focused on early-life adversity revealed that early-life experiences have a persistent impact on gene expression and behavior through epigenetic mechanisms. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is sensitive to changes in the early-life environment that associate with DNA methylation of a neuron-specific exon 1(7) promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Nr3c1). Since initial findings were published in 2004, numerous reports have investigated GR gene methylation in relationship to early-life experience, parental stress, and psychopathology. We conducted a systematic review of this growing literature, which identified 40 articles (13 animal and 27 human studies) published since 2004. The majority of these examined the GR exon variant 1(F) in humans or the GR1(7) in rats, and 89% of human studies and 70% of animal studies of early-life adversity reported increased methylation at this exon variant. All the studies investigating exon 1(F)/1(7) methylation in conditions of parental stress (one animal study and seven human studies) also reported increased methylation. Studies examining psychosocial stress and psychopathology had less consistent results, with 67% of animal studies reporting increased exon 1(7) methylation and 17% of human studies reporting increased exon 1(F) methylation. We found great consistency among studies investigating early-life adversity and the effect of parental stress, even if the precise phenotype and measures of social environment adversity varied among studies. These results are encouraging and warrant further investigation to better understand correlates and characteristics of these associations.

The causes of compromised brain health are likely to be a multi-factorial combination of HIV-related biological factors, co-morbidities such as aging and cerebrovascular disease, and the erosion of coping skills, physical health, and social supports resulting from the strains of living with a chronic illness. Methods/design: This study aims to provide a better understanding of the relationship between cognitive complaints, depression, and objectively measured cognitive impairment in HIV, and of the key factors, whether biological or personal, which relate to these presentations and to their evolution over time. Characterization of this heterogeneity will permit more focused pathophysiological studies, and allow more targeted interventions. The project makes extensive use of Web-based research and health care delivery tools, aiming to provide cost-effective, "clinic ready" tools to improve brain health in HIV. This project has two overarching aims, reflecting our dual goals of understanding and improving brain health in HIV, focusing on cognitive impairment, its contributors and consequences. The objectives are to contribute evidence for the validity of a brief brain health assessment, to estimate the extent to which HIV-related cognition-relevant clinical factors and patient-centered outcomes inter-relate and evolve over time, allowing identification of the mechanisms underpinning longitudinal change in brain health and to contribute evidence for the feasibility, effectiveness potential, acceptability, and underlying mechanisms of promising interventions for optimizing brain health. We adopt a cohort multiple randomized control trials design. A total of 900 participants will be characterized prospectively over a 27-month period to answer questions about the evolution of outcomes of interest. All participants will be offered basic brain health self-management information. Sub-groups will participate in pilot studies of specific, more intensive interventions to provide pragmatic evidence for feasibility, effectiveness, and comparative effectiveness. Discussion: This work will provide needed estimates of the burden, heterogeneity, evolution, and mechanisms underlying compromised brain health in HIV, and test a range of promising non-pharmacological interventions. This is an on-going study; the trials nested within this cohort that are currently recruiting participants were registered on 7 October 2015 (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02571504 and NCT02571595).

Amblyopic eyes are subject to suppression from the fellow eye, generate weaker visual evoked potentials (VEPs) than fellow eyes and have multiple visual deficits including impairments in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Primate models and human psychophysics indicate that stronger suppression is associated with greater deficits in amblyopic eye contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. We tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the visual cortex would modulate VEP amplitude and contrast sensitivity in adults with amblyopia. tDCS can transiently alter cortical excitability and may influence suppressive neural interactions. Twenty-one patients with amblyopia and twenty-seven controls completed separate sessions of anodal (a-), cathodal (c-) and sham (s-) visual cortex tDCS. A-tDCS transiently and significantly increased VEP amplitudes for amblyopic, fellow and control eyes and contrast sensitivity for amblyopic and control eyes. C-tDCS decreased VEP amplitude and contrast sensitivity and s-tDCS had no effect. These results suggest that tDCS can modulate visual cortex responses to information from adult amblyopic eyes and provide a foundation for future clinical studies of tDCS in adults with amblyopia.

Meningeal Tertiary Lymphoid Tissues and Multiple Sclerosis: A Gathering Place for Diverse Types of immune Cells during CNS Autoimmunity	FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						meninges; multiple sclerosis; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; tertiary lymphoid tissues; stromal cells	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CORTICAL DEMYELINATION; SUBARACHNOID SPACE; LYMPHATIC VESSELS; RETICULAR CELLS; STROMAL CELLS; SPINAL-CORD; TH17 CELLS; REAL-TIME; B-CELLS	Collections of leukocytes in the meningeal space have been documented in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). These meningeal aggregates, which in the context of other autoimmune diseases have often been termed tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLT), have been associated with sub-pial cortical damage and disease progression. However, the key molecular and cellular signals required for their formation and maintenance remain unclear. Herein, we review TLT structures in other disease states in order to provide a framework for understanding these structures in the MS meninges. We then assess the evidence that the meningeal compartment serves as an important nexus for immune cells as well as a location for drainage of antigen into cervical lymph nodes. Extrapolating what is known about the molecular and cellular cues that initiate the formation of leukocyte aggregates in non-lymphoid tissues, we speculate on what signals lead to the formation and maintenance of meningeal TLT structures. Referring to the animal model of MS [ experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)], we also explore what is known about these structures in supporting B cell and T cell responses during neuroinflammation. Last, we examine the evidence that connects these structures to ongoing neuropathology. Collectively, our review points to the meningeal compartment as an important player in neuroinflammatory processes. Moreover, we hypothesize that in order to gain insights into pro-and anti-inflammatory properties of lymphocytes in MS, one must understand the cellular scaffolds that support lymphocyte retention within the meninges, thus highlighting the importance of non-immune cells (stromal cells) in the neuroinflammatory process.

Previous analysis of Muncl8-1(-/-) mouse mutants documented their grossly normal nervous system, but its molecular differentiation has not been assessed. Munc18-1 deletion in mice also results in widespread neurodegeneration that remains poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that the early stages of spinal motor circuit formation, including motor neuron specification, axon growth and pathfinding, and mRNA expression, are unaffected in 1VIunc18-1(-/-) mice, demonstrating that synaptic activity is dispensable for early nervous system development. Furthermore, we show that the neurodegenerat ion caused by Munc18-1 loss is cell autonomous, consistent with apparently normal expression of several neurotrophic factors and normal GDNF signaling. Consistent with cell-autonomous degeneration, we demonstrate defects in the trafficking of the synaptic proteins Syntaxinla and PSD-95 and the TrkB and DCC receptors in Munc18-1(-/-) neurons; these defects do not appear to cause ER stress, suggesting other mechanisms for degeneration. Finally, we demonstrate pathological similarities to Alzheimer's disease, such as altered Tau phosphorylation, neurofibrillary tangles, and accumulation of insoluble protein plaques. Together, our results shed new light upon the neurodegeneration observed in Munc18-1(-/-) mice and argue that this phenomenon shares parallels with neurodegenerative diseases.

Proper spatiotemporal localization of the evolutionarily conserved G alpha i-LGN-NuMA protein complex is critical for mitotic spindle orientation, but how this is achieved remains unclear. Here we identify Suppressor APC domain containing 2 (SAPCD2) as a previously unreported LGN-interacting protein. We show that SAPCD2 is essential to instruct planar mitotic spindle orientation in both epithelial cell cultures and mouse retinal progenitor cells in vivo. Loss of SAPCD2 randomizes spindle orientation, which in turn disrupts cyst morphogenesis in three-dimensional cultures, and triples the number of terminal asymmetric cell divisions in the developing retina. Mechanistically, we show that SAPCD2 negatively regulates the localization of LGN at the cell cortex, likely by competing with NuMA for its binding. These results uncover SAPCD2 as a key regulator of the ternary complex controlling spindle orientation during morphogenesis and asymmetric cell divisions.	[Chiu, Catherine W.

Hundreds of mutations in genes encoding voltage-gated ion channels responsible for action potential generation have been found to cause severe neurological diseases. In contrast, the roles of voltage-independent "leak" channels, important for the establishment and maintenance of resting membrane potentials upon which action potentials are generated, are not well established in human disease. UNC80 is a large component of the NALCN sodium-leak channel complex that regulates the basal excitability of the nervous system. Loss-of-function mutations of NALCN cause infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic fades (IHPRF). We report four individuals from three unrelated families who have homozygous missense or compound heterozygous truncating mutations in UNC80 and persistent hypotonia, encephalopathy, growth failure, and severe intellectual disability. Compared to control cells, HEK293T cells transfected with an expression plasmid containing the c.5098C>T (p.Pro1700Ser) UNC80 mutation found in one individual showed markedly decreased NALCN channel currents. Our findings demonstrate the fundamental significance of UNC80 and basal ionic conductance to human health.

In a previous study we revealed that the chemokine CXCL12 stimulates rodent OPC differentiation via activation of its receptor CXCR7. We could now demonstrate that CXCR7 is also expressed on NogoA-and Nkx2.2-positive oligodendroglial cells in human MS brains and that stimulation of cultured primary fetal human OPCs with CXCL12 promotes their differentiation as measured by surface marker expression and morphologic complexity. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR7 effectively blocks these CXCL12-dependent effects. Our findings therefore suggest that a specific activation of CXCR7 could provide a means to promote oligodendroglial differentiation facilitating endogenous remyelination activities.

In the present study we test this hypothesis in congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe deficits in the processing of pitch-based material. We manipulated the temporal characteristics of auditory stimuli and investigated the influence of the time given to encode pitch information on participants' performance in discrimination and short-term memory. Our results show that amusics' performance in such tasks scales with the duration available to encode acoustic information. This suggests that in auditory neuro-developmental disorders, abnormalities in early steps of the auditory processing can underlie the high-level deficits (here musical disabilities). Observing that the slowing down of temporal dynamics improves amusics' pitch abilities allows considering this approach as a potential tool for remediation in developmental auditory disorders.

J	Yu, ZX; Mei, M				Yu, Zhi-Xian; Mei, Ming			Uniqueness and stability of traveling waves for cellular neural networks with multiple delays	JOURNAL OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS			English	Article						Cellular neural networks; Uniqueness; Asymptotic behavior; Nonlinear stability; Weighted energy method; Squeezing technique	NICHOLSONS BLOWFLIES EQUATION; REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS; ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY; MONOSTABLE DYNAMICS; LATTICE EQUATIONS; POPULATION-MODEL; FRONTS; EXISTENCE; NONLINEARITY; SYSTEM	In this paper, we investigate the properties of traveling waves to a class of lattice differential equations for cellular neural networks with multiple delays. Following the previous study 1381 on the existence of the traveling waves, here we focus on the uniqueness and the stability of these traveling waves. First of all, by establishing the a priori asymptotic behavior of traveling waves and applying Ikehara's theorem, we prove the uniqueness (up to translation) of traveling waves phi(n - ct) with c <= c* for the cellular neural networks with multiple delays, where c* < 0 is the critical wave speed. Then, by the weighted energy method together with the squeezing technique, we further show the global stability of all non -critical traveling waves for this model, that is, for all monotone waves with the speed c <= c*, the original lattice solutions converge time -exponentially to the corresponding traveling waves, when the initial perturbations around the monotone traveling waves decay exponentially at far fields, but can be arbitrarily large in other locations.

The CT and MRI data were analyzed with a systematic approach. Moreover, we evaluated if an association exists between the neuroradiologic findings, clinical features, and genotype.Results:Brain calcifications were present in 110 subjects (90.9%). Severe calcification was associated with TREX1 mutations and early age at onset. Cerebral atrophy was documented in 111 subjects (91.8%). Leukoencephalopathy was present in 120 children (99.2%), with 3 main patterns: frontotemporal, diffuse, and periventricular. White matter rarefaction was found in 54 subjects (50.0%), strongly associated with mutations in TREX1 and an early age at onset. Other novel radiologic features were identified: deep white matter cysts, associated with TREX1 mutations, and delayed myelination, associated with RNASEH2B mutations and early age at onset.Conclusions:We demonstrate that the AGS neuroradiologic phenotype is expanding by adding new patterns and findings to the classic criteria. The heterogeneity of neuroradiologic patterns is partly explained by the timing of the disease onset and reflects the complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms.

A robust on-line identification algorithm is proposed for nonlinear systems identification via discrete multi-time scales dynamic neural networks. The main contribution of the paper is that the input-to-state stability (ISS) approach is used to tune the weights of the discrete multi-time scales dynamic neural networks in the sense of L1. The commonly used robustifying techniques, such as dead-zone or s-modification in the weight tuning, are not necessary for the proposed identification algorithm. The stability of the proposed identifier is proved by Lyapunov function and ISS theory. Two examples are given to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical results.

The endocannabinoid (ECB) system has recently surfaced as a fundamental component of the neuroendocrine stress response; however, the effect of earlylife stress on neonatal ECB signaling and the capacity to which ECB enhancement may modulate neonatal stress responses is relatively unknown. The present study assessed whether exposure to early-life stress in the form of limited access to nesting/bedding material (LB) from postnatal (PND) day 2 to 9 alters neuroendocrine activity and hypothalamic ECB content in neonatal rats challenged with a novel immobilization stressor. Furthermore, we examined whether inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of anandamide (AEA) affects neuroendocrine responses in PND10 pups as a function of rearing conditions. Neonatal rats showed a robust increase in corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretion in response to immobilization stress, which was significantly blunted in pups reared in LB conditions. Accordingly, LB pups exhibited reduced stress-induced Fos immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, with no significant differences in hypothalamic ECB content. Administration of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (0.3 mg/kg, ip) 90 min prior to immobilization stress significantly dampened stress-induced CORT release, but only in pups reared in LB conditions. These results suggest that rearing in restricted bedding conditions dampens the neuroendocrine response to stress, while augmenting AEA mitigates stress-induced alterations in glucocorticoid secretion preferentially in pups subjected to early-life stress.

Forty-six near-native L2 speakers of Persian were tested to examine the processing of transparent (non-idiomatic) and opaque (idiomatic) compound verbs, under masked priming paradigm. The results revealed a significant nominal priming effect in the opaque condition, and a numerically stronger nominal priming effect in the transparent condition. There was also an increase in the processing load on the parser when the target was an opaque compound. The results of this study seem to be compatible with the dual access or dual route hypothesis, yet with the version that assumes the two routes are activated in parallel rather than the version that assumes high frequency words are represented lexically but low frequency words are decomposed.

Although PM is important for daily functioning, it is not formally assessed in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to examine the role of executive functions in MS patients' PM revealed by the effect of strength of cue-action association on PM performance. Method: Thirty-nine MS patients were compared to 18 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and education on a PM task modulating the strength of association between the cue and the intended action. Results: Deficits in MS patients affecting both prospective and retrospective components of PM were confirmed using 2 x 2 x 2 mixed analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Among patients, multiple regression analyses revealed that the impairment was modulated by the efficiency of executive functions, whereas retrospective memory seemed to have little impact on PM performance, contrary to expectation. More specifically, results of 2 x 2 x 2 mixed-model analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) showed that low-executive patients had more difficulty detecting and, especially, retrieving the appropriate action when the cue and the action were unrelated, whereas high-executive patients' performance seemed to be virtually unaffected by the cue-action association. Conclusions: Using an objective measure, these findings confirm the presence of PM deficits in MS. They also suggest that such deficits depend on executive functioning and can be reduced when automatic PM processes are engaged through semantic cue-action association. They underscore the importance of assessing PM in clinical settings through a cognitive evaluation and offer an interesting avenue for rehabilitation.

Furthermore, the accessibility to high speed internet has escalated the level of multimedia exchanged by users across cyberspace every second. Accordingly, it has increased the demand for searching among large databases of images. Conventionally, text-based image retrieval is used. The major problems in text-based image retrieval are related to annotation that is often impossible due to human perception of images being subjective, and also due to the size of the information that needs indexing. To overcome such limitations, content-based image retrieval systems have been proposed. However, there is a key hindrance, namely, the need to match the human visual system to overcome the semantic gap between human perception and lowlevel features. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised method based on Hopfield neural networks that seeks to model human visual memory to increase the efficacy of retrieval and reduce the semantic gap. A comparative study with other neural-network based methods, such as the feed forward backpropagation and Boltzmann deep learning, shows the effectiveness of our method.	[Sabahi, F.; Ahmad, M.

However, exponentially deepening and mind boggling progress has been made during the last 30 years in the molecular and cellular understanding of what drives action potentials. The classical "synaptic relay model" of the action potential is now considered to be a special, minor case, most relevant to "machine- like" mentation and behavior. Volume transmission, not involving synapses, but certainly driving neuronal action potentials, is now understood to be far more prevalent, complex, and more relevant to "soul-like" mentation and behavior. Only a few very brief or highly technical accounts of this scientific revolution have been published specifically for psychiatrists despite the fact that psychiatry is the discipline most likely to gain in the short term, with neurology following more in the long term. We review here what we think are the most relevant aspects of extrasynaptic signaling for psychiatry in a manner we hope is most useful and enlightening for practicing psychiatrists.

Impaired holistic processing of personally familiar faces in a kindergarten teacher with acquired prosopagnosia	VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article						Acquired prosopagnosia; face recognition; personal familiarity; holistic representation	MIDDLE FUSIFORM GYRUS; UNFAMILIAR FACES; COVERT RECOGNITION; CONFIGURAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION IMAGES; SELECTIVE IMPAIRMENT; FACIAL RECOGNITION; INDIVIDUAL FACES; GAZE-CONTINGENCY; NEURAL SYSTEM	Acquired prosopagnosia is primarily defined as a defect in recognizing familiar faces. Nonetheless, for practical and methodological reasons, studies of such rare patients typically use pictures of unfamiliar faces. Here, we report an extensive investigation (17 behavioural tasks grouped in nine experiments) with a homogenous set of personally familiar faces in patient PS (Rossion et al., 2003. A network of occipito-temporal face-sensitive areas besides the right middle fusiform gyrus is necessary for normal face processing.), a well-documented case of acquired prosopagnosia with intact object recognition. PS's recognition of the face pictures of 3-4-year-old children of her kindergarten is severely impairedboth in terms of accuracy and speed of recognitionand differs qualitatively from her colleagues' performance. Relative to these typical individuals, PS relies more on external features, colour and local details of faces. She is also specifically impaired at processing the eye region in two-alternative face matching tasks, as well as in a familiar face recognition task performed both with pre-defined isolated parts and with randomly placed apertures revealing selective parts (Bubbles, >20.000 trials) of the personally familiar faces. These observations indicate that the same impairment observed previously with unfamiliar faces for PS and other cases of acquired prosopagnosia is associated with a deficient long-term representation of the eye region. Various manipulations that differentially affect the processing of the eye region suggest that this impairment is a consequence of the inability to represent the multiple parts of the eye region, and of the whole familiar face, as a single unit. This impairment in holistic processing is further evidenced here across different paradigms with composite faces, wholes and parts, and configurally distorted faces, mirroring and strengthening previous observations made with unfamiliar faces in PS and other cases of acquired prosopagnosia.

Hardware neural networks are promising for neuromorphic computing and have many prospective applications for bi-directional interface in prosthetics, and electroceuticals etc. Device simulation of upsilon-NWFET has been carried out followed by circuit implementation to validate the use of silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) as neuronal elements. A system level simulation of 258 neurons (225 sensor neurons, 50 hidden layer neurons and 3 output layer neurons) has been performed to demonstrate tactile pattern recognition. Training has been carried out and validation of the trained network gives an accurate classification of a database of 50 tactile images into 3 classifiers.

Writer-independent Feature Learning for Offline Signature Verification using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks	2016 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 24-29, 2016	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Nueral Network Soc, Evolutionary Programming Soc, IET, IEEE BigData, Gulf Univ Sci & Technol			CLASSIFIER	Automatic Offline Handwritten Signature Verification has been researched over the last few decades from several perspectives, using insights from graphology, computer vision, signal processing, among others. In spite of the advancements on the field, building classifiers that can separate between genuine signatures and skilled forgeries (forgeries made targeting a particular signature) is still hard. We propose approaching the problem from a feature learning perspective. Our hypothesis is that, in the absence of a good model of the data generation process, it is better to learn the features from data, instead of using hand-crafted features that have no resemblance to the signature generation process. To this end, we use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn features in a writer-independent format, and use this model to obtain a feature representation on another set of users, where we train writer-dependent classifiers. We tested our method in two datasets: GPDS-960 and Brazilian PUC-PR. Our experimental results show that the features learned in a subset of the users are discriminative for the other users, including across different datasets, reaching close to the state-of-the-art in the GPDS dataset, and improving the state-of-the-art in the Brazilian PUC-PR dataset.

The CoNN training process starts with a single hidden unit and then adds one hidden unit at a time when needed to enhance the network mapping capability to eventually obtain an effective and minimal neural network (NN). Historical insolation data, historical and forecasted meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather type), and the time parameter are used as input information to the CoNN. The proposed method is applied to real and actual dataset of hourly insolation data to demonstrate the forecasting superiority of our proposed approach over the naive persistence model (NPM), the autoregressive (AR) model, and the fixed-size feedforward NN (FFNN). Moreover, it has been revealed through extensive simulation studies that inclusion of a proper number of past weather variables and time parameter into the NN input vectors can further improve the prediction accuracy.

The focus is on identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) which is a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach uses the raw ECG signal as the input and automatically learns the representative features for PAF to be used by a classification mechanism. The features are learned directly from the time domain ECG signals by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with one fully connected layer. The learned features can replace the hand-crafted features and our experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the learned features in patient screening. The experimental results indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an End-to-End convolutional neural network classifier. The major characteristics of the proposed approach are to simplify the process of feature extraction for different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to specify the appropriate features. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG classification method is demonstrated through performing extensive simulation studies.

It is shown how both share Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) as learning process for a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). STDP was implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with very low-demanding resources, using an adaptation of the Synaptodendritic Kernel Adapting Neuron (SKAN) model. Moreover, it is shown how a 3-way version of STDP is needed to allow for OC. The robot was designed to use the CC and OC neuronal architectures proposed in this paper and was tested in a dynamic environment, which consisted of a maze with changing features. It was successful in presenting both types of learning. This paper thus validates an architecture with an important potential for very large scale time-dependent parallel data analysis, with high capacity of adaptation in a dynamic environment.

The subjects were monitored and repeatedly tested 72 hours, 2 weeks and 1 month post-injury. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PETCO2) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries were monitored during mental activation paradigms. In order to characterize CA we employed autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and impulse response models based on the Laguerre expansion technique (LET). By extracting gain and phase estimates from the obtained models we were able to detect disruptions in CA 72 hours following concussion and a slow recovery within a time period of one month.

The aim of this study was to characterize electric field magnitudes generated by tES optimization and to compare them to experimentally induced values as determined by data from intracranial electrodes. Local field potentials were recorded from two monkeys with implanted multi-site intracranial Utah arrays during transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and the neural effect predictions obtained from optimized electrode placement were assessed. Comparative data between the two sites of intracranial recordings during tDCS partially validated the predictions of our tES optimization algorithms.

To do so, we constructed binary functional brain networks from long-term, multichannel electroencephalographic data recorded from nine patients with epilepsy. The corresponding network properties were quantified using the average network degree. It was found that the network degree (as well as other network properties such as the network efficiency and clustering coefficient) exhibited large fluctuations over time; however, it also exhibited specific periodic temporal structure over different time scales (1.5hr-24hr periods) that was consistent across subjects. We investigated the correlation of the phases of these network periodicities with the seizure onset by using circular statistics. The results showed that the instantaneous phases of the 3.5hr, 5.5hr, 12hr and 24hr network degree periodic components are not uniformly distributed, suggesting that functional network properties are related to seizure generation and occurrence.

This paper proposes predicting the survival times of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients using texture features extracted in multi-contrast brain MRI images. Texture features are derived locally from contrast enhancement, necrosis and edema regions in T1-weighted post-contrast and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) MRIs, based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix representation. A statistical analysis based on the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test is used to identify the texture features related with the overall survival of GBM patients. Results are presented on a dataset of 39 GBM patients. For FLAIR images, four features (Energy, Correlation, Variance and Inverse of Variance) from contrast enhancement regions and a feature (Homogeneity) from edema regions were shown to be associated with survival times (p-value <0.01). Likewise, in T1-weighted images, three features (Energy, Correlation, and Variance) from contrast enhancement regions were found to be useful for predicting the overall survival of GBM patients. These preliminary results show the advantages of texture analysis in predicting the prognosis of GBM patients from multi-contrast brain MRI.

One of the main hurdle in the recording of cerebral magnetic activity is that the intensity of cerebral magnetic fields is very weak. In this regard, we explore another potential way to appreciate the magnetic cerebral activity using superparamagnetic nanoparticles. These particles react to magnetic fields and can aggregate under their influence. Being superparamagnetic, they are also visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Superparamagnetic nanoparticles distributed in cerebral tissue could aggregate under the influence of local magnetic fields, with this aggregation being visible using MRI. In order to explore the feasibility of this new concept, we observed the behaviour of nanoparticles brought in proximity of living rat's brain slices of different levels of activity. A statistically significant aggregation of nanoparticles that is proportional to the rat's brain activity was observed in the study of 9 rats. These results favour the statement that brain electrical magnetic fields are sufficient to induce an aggregation of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in their vicinity. These results serve as a first "stepping stone" for the basis of a new method to appreciate brain magnetic activity using aggregation of nanoparticles as a marker of increased brain activity.

In this paper, we present an ultra low-power sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter (ADC) intended for utilization into large-scale multi-channel neural recording implants. This proposed design, which provides a resolution of 9 bits using a one-bit oversampled ADC, presents several desirable features that allow for an in-channel ADC scheme, where one sigma-delta converter is provided for each channel, enabling development of scalable systems that can interface with different types of high-density neural micro-probes. The proposed circuit, which have been fabricated in a TSMC 180-nm CMOS process, employs a first order noise shaping topology with a passive integrator and a low-supply voltage of 0.6 V to achieve ultra low-power consumption and small size. The proposed ADC clearly outperforms other designs with a power consumption as low as 110 nW for a precision of 9 bits (11-fJ per conversion), a silicon area of only 82 mu m x 84 mu m, and one of the best reported figure of merit among recently published data converters utilized in similar applications.

Using a multi-channel microfluidic platform makes this biosensor capable of detecting NT-related currents going from nanoamperes to milliamperes, with a sensitivity of the order of picoamperes. Moreover, by using a fully differential potentiostat architecture, the biosensor offers a high common-mode rejection ratio (90 dB), making it appropriate for low-noise and high-sensitive applications. The system was implemented on a 15 mm x 15 mm PCB with direct interface to the microfluidic chambers. It was calibrated with a 5 mM ferrocyanide solution and successfully tested with dopamine at three concentrations. The system shows a minimum sensistivity of 100 pA and consumes 60 mW.

In the present article, we discuss how a dual-process model of creativity-much like the ones proposed to account for decision making and reasoning-could broaden our understanding of the processes involved in creative ideas generation. When generating creative ideas, children, adolescents, and adults tend to follow "the path of least resistance" and propose solutions that are built on the most common and accessible knowledge within a specific domain, leading to fixation effect. In line with recent theory of typical cognitive development, we argue that the ability to resist the spontaneous activation of design heuristics, to privilege other types of reasoning, might be critical to generate creative ideas at all ages. In the present review, we demonstrate that inhibitory control at all ages can actually support creativity. Indeed, the ability to think of something truly new and original requires first inhibiting spontaneous solutions that come to mind quickly and unconsciously and then exploring new ideas using a generative type of reasoning.

Max-pooling purposefully discards precise spatial information in order to create features that are more robust, and typically organized as lower resolution spatial feature maps. On some tasks, such as whole-image classification, max-pooling derived features are well suited; however, for tasks requiring precise localization, such as pixel level prediction and segmentation, max-pooling destroys exactly the information required to perform well. Precise localization may be preserved by shallow convnets without pooling but at the expense of robustness. Can we have our max-pooled multilayered cake and eat it too? Several papers have proposed summation and concatenation based methods for combining upsampled coarse, abstract features with finer features to produce robust pixel level predictions. Here we introduce another model-dubbed Recombinator Networks where coarse features inform finer features early in their formation such that finer features can make use of several layers of computation in deciding how to use coarse features. The model is trained once, end-to-end and performs better than summation-based architectures, reducing the error from the previous state of the art on two facial keypoint datasets, AFW and AFLW, by 30% and beating the current state-of-the-art on 300W without using extra data. We improve performance even further by adding a denoising prediction model based on a novel convnet formulation.

The proposed modification involves using an additional component in the original index. This approach improves performance of the index and provides better results during a clustering process, especially when changes of cluster separability are big. The new version of the index is called the SILA index and its maximum value identifies the best clustering scheme. The performance of the new index is demonstrated for several data sets, where the popular algorithm has been applied as underlying clustering techniques, namely the Complete-linkage algorithm. The results prove superiority of the new approach as compared to the original Silhouette validity index.

Hence, an appropriate real-time optimization method should be used so that the MFC always operates at its optimum. Extremum-seeking control (ESC) can be applied to optimize this type of system. However, when the optimal operating point of the MFC varies very fast due to external disturbances, the slow convergence of the ESC induces a lack of precision in the tracking of the optimal power point. In this paper, it is proposed to use adaptive excitation signal amplitude in the ESC scheme to improve the precision of the tracking. The amplitude adaptation is performed using a neural-network (NN) model which estimates in real-time the error between the optimal and the actual point of operation of the MFC based on the external disturbance measurements. The improved ESC performance in terms of convergence speed and precision will be demonstrated at the level of simulation in the case of a comparative study between classic ESC and ESC with adaptive excitation applied to an MFC model subject to variations of a measurable external disturbance, namely, the inlet substrate concentration.

However, it is unclear whether the hardware of today's devices is capable to handle this task. To this end, we conducted a comparative study regarding the capabilities of past and current tablets to allow for the design of PDBs based on the exploitation of the Kinematic Theory.

To address this concern, a promising approach consists in concatenating a speech enhancement and a speech recognition deep neural network and to jointly update their parameters as if they were within a single bigger network. Unfortunately, joint training can be difficult because the output distribution of the speech enhancement system may change substantially during the optimization procedure. The speech recognition module would have to deal with an input distribution that is non-stationary and unnormalized. To mitigate this issue, we propose a joint training approach based on a fully batch-normalized architecture. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework significantly overtakes other competitive solutions, especially in challenging environments.

To this end we build on an existing model that we refer to as Non-linear Within Class Normalization (NWCN) and introduce a novel Speaker Classifier Network (SCN). Both models deliver impressive speaker verification performance, showing a 56% and 68% relative improvement over standard i-vectors when combined with a cosine distance backend. The NWCN model also reduces the equal error rate for PLDA from 1.78% to 1.63%. We also test these models under the constraints of domain mismatch, i.e. when no in-domain training data is available. Under these conditions, SCN features in combination with cosine distance performs better than the PLDA baseline, achieving an equal error rate of 2.92% as compared to 3.37%.

Recurrent hidden cells allow these DNN-based models to manage long-term dependencies such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Nevertheless, these RNNs process a single input stream in one (LSTM) or two (Bidirectional LSTM) directions. But most of the information available nowadays is from multistreams or multimedia documents, and require RNNs to process these information synchronously during the training. This paper presents an original LSTM-based architecture, named Parallel LSTM (PLSTM), that carries out multiple parallel synchronized input sequences in order to predict a common output. The proposed PLSTM method could be used for parallel sequence classification purposes. The PLSTM approach is evaluated on an automatic telecast genre sequences classification task and compared with different state-of-the-art architectures. Results show that the proposed PLSTM method outperforms the baseline n-gram models as well as the state-of-the-art LSTM approach.

Among these methods, Neural Networks (NN), or Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), recently received a great interest from researchers due to their representation capability of complex internal structures in a low dimensional subspace. However, MLPs employ document representations based on basic word level or topic-based features. Therefore, these basic representations reveal little in way of document statistical structure by only considering words or topics contained in the document as a "bag-of-words", ignoring relations between them. We propose to remedy this weakness by extending the complex features based on Quaternion algebra presented in [1] to neural networks called QMLP. This original QMLP approach is based on hyper-complex algebra to take into consideration features dependencies in documents. New document features, based on the document structure itself, used as input of the QMLP, are also investigated in this paper, in comparison to those initially proposed in [1]. Experiments made on a SLU task from a real framework of human spoken dialogues showed that our QMLP approach associated with the proposed document features outperforms other approaches, with an accuracy gain of 2 % with respect to the MLP based on real numbers and more than 3 % with respect to the first Quaternion-based features proposed in [1]. We finally demonstrated that less iterations are needed by our QMLP architecture to be efficient and to reach promising accuracies.

Vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV) are very attractive to deliver the genes coding the mAbs because they allow long-term expression thus, reducing the number of administrations. They can also penetrate biological barriers such as the blood-brain-barrier to transduce cells localized in immunoprivileged organs. Recent animal studies with AAV have demonstrated the capacity of AAV to deliver sufficient quantity of antibodies to confer an efficient immunoprotection against chronic and infectious diseases for several months to years. The treatment was successfully applied either for prophylaxis or therapeutic use, depending on the disease and its progression. In this review, we discuss the advantages and the limitations of AAV for mAb and immunoadhesin delivery. Recent advances in vector design and antibody engineering are also presented. Optimization of the vector design can improve the kinetic and the level of mAbs expression whereas protein engineering can enhance transgene product properties. Furthermore, an exhaustive review of pre-clinical studies for chronic diseases including Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cancer is presented as well as for infectious diseases.

Because of the large number of neural crest cell derivatives, distinct structures/cell types (isolated or in combination) are affected in each neurocristopathy. The most important issues in this research field is that the underlying genetic cause and associated pathogenic mechanism of most cases of neurocristopathy are poorly understood. This article describes how a relatively simple insertional mutagenesis approach in the mouse has proved useful for identifying new candidate genes and pathogenic mechanisms for diverse neurocristopathies.

Substantial evidence suggests that abnormalities in inhibitory gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) interneuron function, especially in the parvalbumin subtype of GABA interneuron, both developmentally and in adulthood, may contribute mechanistically to cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. This study used a rat model to test whether prenatal immune activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; at gestation days, GD, 15 and 16) or maternal iron deficiency (from GD2 to postnatal day P7) or the combination of both insults alters major subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (parvalbumin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin) in brain regions relevant to schizophrenia (medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [PFC], hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus, ventral subiculum) in offspring at P14 or P28. Prenatal LPS treatment significantly increased the density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons at P14 in the medial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and ventral subiculum of offspring born from iron-sufficient but not iron-deficient dams. Prenatal LPS also increased cholecystokinin neuron density in the medial PFC at P28, under both iron-sufficient and iron-deficient conditions. We observed a large increase in parvalbumin neuron density from P14 to P28 in the medial PFC and subiculum across all birth groups, that was not observed in other brain regions, and significant decreases in somatostatin neuron density from P14 to P28 in all brain regions examined across all birth groups, indicating differential developmental trajectories for parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons in various brain regions during this early postnatal period. Thus, it appears that the medial PFC and ventral subiculum, brain regions involved in circuitry modulating ventral tegmental dopamine and nucleus accumbens activities, may be regions vulnerable to effects of prenatal LPS on specific subpopulations of interneurons. It is known that the timing of maturation and expansion of parvalbumin neurons in early development provides threshold levels of inhibition that trigger critical periods for cortical plasticity, leading to long-term circuit consolidation. Thus, our finding of increased parvalbumin neuron density at early developmental times might suggest a mechanism by which an acute prenatal insult like LPS exposure could produce long-term changes in prefrontal cortical or subicular function.

In fact, among the pathologies affecting HRV the most, there are the cardiovascular diseases and depressive disorders, which are associated with high medical cost in Western societies. Consequently, HRV is now widely used as an index of health. In order to better understand how this adaptation takes place, it is necessary to examine which factors directly influence HRV, whether they have a physiological or environmental origin. The primary objective of this research is therefore to conduct a literature review in order to get a comprehensive overview of the subject. The system of these factors affecting HRV can be divided into the following five categories: physiological and pathological factors, environmental factors, lifestyle factors, non-modifiable factors and effects. The direct interrelationships between these factors and HRV can be regrouped into an influence diagram. This diagram can therefore serve as a basis to improve daily clinical practice as well as help design even more precise research protocols.

J	Arnaud, S				Arnaud, Sarah			Autism Spectrum Disorder: An objective, rigorous and emotional moral agency	BIOETHIQUEONLINE			French	Article						ASD; autism; morality; emotional access; emotions; empathy	EMPATHY; COGNITION; JUDGMENT; CHILDREN	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and social interactions, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests and activities (1). Social interaction deficits notably include difficulties in empathic processes, often considered as affecting moral abilities in people suffering from ASD. Several studies in psychology and neuroscience have attempted to detect disturbed empathic processes that cause alterations in their understanding of morality (2-4). Social problems in autistic people are manifested by difficulties in their affective lives concerning their own emotional states (5-9). In this paper, I suggest that moral particularities of people with autism are a consequence of their particularities in emotional access, namely the way they relate to their own emotions, and not a consequence of empathic deficits. I will show that these particularities do not prevent them from belonging to the moral community. People with autism can indeed be rigorous moral agents, that is to say, they display a tendency to moral intransigence and inflexibility. These characteristics will be explained. In light of dual process theories, I will show how socio-emotional and moral particularities are underpinned by an overuse of type 2 processes, namely an overuse of deliberate and rule-based cognitive reasoning, instead of type 1 automatic processes. The main purpose of this study is to highlight the particularities that allow people with autism to be moral agents who, although inflexible, are nonetheless emotionally committed in moral situations.

SECS mainly extracts DC power from solar PV (Photovoltaic) array and converts it into AC power via a voltage source converter (VSC) and supplies it to grid and connected loads. This system functions on an incremental conductance (INC) driven MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithm along with unit vectors estimation via positive sequence voltages extraction and a neural network (NN) based least mean sixth (LM-Sixth) current control technique. The system aims to eliminate power quality issues and provides current conditioning while operating in coherence with a weak grid such as Indian grid which has poor power supply quality and voltages distortion and imbalances. The system provides functions of both SECS as well as shunt active power filter (SAPF) depending on the availability of sunlight. For validation of this system, experimental tests are carried out on a developed laboratory prototype and results are recorded for supporting the same.

The advantage of using deep features is to exploit already trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order to produce high level features without the burden of having to train a CNN from scratch. In this paper, we are investigating the use of deep features for the detection of small objects (cars and individual trees) in high resolution Pleiades imagery. Preliminary results show good detection performance and are very encouraging for future applications.

The relationship between OS and IUI and the risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) is unclear. Objective: To summarise the literature and evaluate the risk of multiple pregnancy and MCM associated with OS used alone and IUI used with or without OS compared to natural conception (spontaneously conceived infants without any type of fertility treatments). Methods: We carried out a systematic review to identify published papers between 1966 and 2014 in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included observational studies and randomized clinical trials related to the risk of multiple pregnancies and MCM conceived following OS alone or IUI compared to natural conception (spontaneously conceived infants without any fertility treatments). The quality of the included studies was evaluated using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Results: There were 63 studies included in this review. Our systematic review suggests that the use of any OS alone was associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancy compared to natural conception (pooled RR 8.80, 95% CI 5.09-15.20; p= 0.000; 9 studies). Similar increases in the risk of multiple pregnancies were observed following clomiphene citrate used without assisted reproductive technologies. Compared to natural conception, the use of IUI with or without OS was associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancy (pooled RR 9.73, 95% CI 7.52 -12.60; p= 0.000; 6 studies). Compared to natural conception, the use of any OS alone was associated with an increased risk of any MCM (RR pooled 1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.36; 11 studies), major musculoskeletal malformations (pooled RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.21-1.81; 7 studies), and malformations of the nervous system (pooled RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.15-2.61; 6 studies). Compared to natural conception, the use of IUI was associated with an increased risk of any MCM (pooled RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.37; 10 studies), major urogenital (pooled RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.04-2.22; 7 studies), and musculoskeletal malformations (pooled RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.20-1.98; 7 studies). The overall quality of the included studies was acceptable. Conclusions: The increased risk of multiple pregnancy and certain types of MCM associated with the use of less invasive fertility treatments, such as OS and IUI, found in this review, highlights the importance of the practice framing. Heterogeneity in OS protocols, the combination with other fertility agents, the limited number of studies and the methodological quality differences reduce our ability to draw conclusions on specific treatment. More observational studies, assessing the risk of multiple pregnancy or MCM, as a primary outcome, using standardized methodologies, in larger and better clinically defined populations are needed.

However, due to the uniform regularization of gradient sparsity, standard TV approaches often over-smooth edges in the image, resulting in the loss of important details. This paper presents a novel compressed sensing method for the reconstruction of MRI data, which uses a regularization strategy based on reweighted TV to preserve image edges. This method also leverages the redundancy of nonlocal image patches through the use of a sparse regression model. An efficient strategy based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to recover images with the proposed model. Experimental results on a simulated phantom and real brain MR data show our method to outperform state-of-the-art compressed sensing approaches, by better preserving edges and removing artifacts in the image.

Labelling physiological signals with meaningful words such as concentration, fatigue or effort is a hard task. Although those labels are well-documented in the medical and related literature, their meaning gets lost in translation in engineering and design sciences. Multistate analysis of physiological signals aims at alleviating this process by identifying pittfalls and errors backed by hard numerical and statistical evidence. In this paper, we use multistate analysis of EEG signals to revisit the effort-fatigue tradeoff in the conceptual design process. Many rules of thumb and intuitions may exist about the effort-fatigue tradeoff and the goal is to provide a quantitative framework where this tradeoff can bear meaning. Following our multistate analysis, we define different types of fatigue (TYPE 1-5 Fatigue) which behave differently based on our numerical analysis and conclude that fatigue and by extension effort are multidimensional concepts.

Interfacing a Salamander Brain with a Salamander-like Robot: Control of Speed and Direction with Calcium Signals from Brainstem Reticulospinal Neurons	2016 6TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ROBOTICS AND BIOMECHATRONICS (BIOROB)	Proceedings of the IEEE RAS-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob)	JUN 26-29, 2016	SINGAPORE	IEEE			MESENCEPHALIC LOCOMOTOR REGION; CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; SPINAL-CORD; PEDUNCULOPONTINE NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MACHINE INTERFACE; HINDBRAIN NEURONS; MOTOR CORTEX; LAMPREY; WALKING	An important topic in designing neuroprosthetic devices for animals or patients with spinal cord injury is to find the right brain regions with which to interface the device. In vertebrates, an interesting target could be the reticulospinal (RS) neurons, which play a central role in locomotor control. These brainstem cells convey the locomotor commands to the spinal locomotor circuits that in turn generate the complex patterns of muscle contractions underlying locomotor movements. The RS neurons receive direct input from the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR), which controls locomotor initiation, maintenance, and termination, as well as locomotor speed. In addition, RS neurons convey turning commands to the spinal cord. In the context of interfacing neural networks and robotic devices, we explored in the present study whether the activity of salamander RS neurons could be used to control off-line, but in real time, locomotor speed and direction of a salamander robot. Using a salamander semi-intact preparation, we first provide evidence that stimulation of the RS cells on the left or right side evokes ipsilateral body bending, a crucial parameter involved during turning. We then identified the RS activity corresponding to these steering commands using calcium (Ca2+) imaging of RS neurons in an isolated brain preparation. Then, using a salamander robot controlled by a spinal cord model, we used the ratio of RS Ca2+ signals on left and right sides to control locomotion direction by modulating body bending. Moreover, we show that the robot locomotion speed can be controlled based on the amplitude of the Ca2+ response of RS cells, which is controlled by MLR stimulation strength as recently demonstrated in salamanders.

The advantage of this kind controller is that it uses an improved subtractive clustering technique to obtain the structure of the system model in order to ensure the high accuracy of the intelligent control. Moreover, the information used is directly from the nonlinear system response without the knowledge of the robot physical parameters and complex models. Furthermore, the controller is designed in discrete-time domain for allowing its implementation. To conceive this kind intelligent control, first adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with an improved subtractive clustering computing is used to accomplish the integration of information of joint angular displacement and velocity for torque identification. The learning datasets are generated by using a discrete-time PID feedback control, which desired position is sufficiently rich to ensure that the learning system would include most characteristics of the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Then a discrete-time fuzzy feed forward control, combined with a conventional PID and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, is designed for the mechanism motion control. Simulation results from numerical experiment on a 4-bar planar parallel mechanism show the proposed controller can reduce joint position and velocity tracking errors with higher accuracy and higher reliability than a traditional PID controller and a computed torque controller.

Inspired by their biological counterparts, digital spiking neural networks have emerged as energy efficient alternatives to conventional hardware implementations, yet remain largely incompatible with cutting edge learning methods. Representing information with single-bit binary pulse trains, the behaviour of spiking neural networks exhibit many interesting analogues to the existing field of stochastic computing. In this paper, we not only illustrate the parallels between digital spiking neural networks and stochastic computing, but we also demonstrate that many computing elements in modern spiking hardware are, in fact, implementations of stochastic circuits. In addition, we show that stochastic computing design techniques can be leveraged in order to address shortcomings in current spiking neural network architectures.

Their usage in applications such as super resolution is thus problematic, despite their capacity for learning rich descriptions from local receptive fields. For example, due to model complexity, the number of parameters grows exponentially with respect to the size of the receptive field. In this paper we show how to deal with this limitation using a Convolutional Deep Boltzmann Machine (ConvDBM) for modelling distributions on large receptive fields with a controllable number of parameters. In particular, we show that i) by weight sharing and joint training over the second hidden layer, the prior distribution on a large receptive field can be represented properly using a small number of parameters; ii) scaling up to high resolution images can be achieved by applying the resulting ConvDBM sequentially with tiled weights. Experimental results are presented that show successful application of this approach to the problem of super-resolution.

Despite physiological evidence and management guidelines that support maintaining a higher haemoglobin level in patients with aSAH, current practice is one of a more restrictive approach to transfusion. The goal of this multicentre pilot trial is to determine the feasibility of successfully conducting a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion trial in adult patients with acute aSAH and anaemia (Hb <= 100 g/L), comparing a liberal transfusion strategy (Hb <= 100 g/L) with a restrictive strategy (Hb <= 80 g/L) on the combined rate of death and severe disability at 12 months. Methods: Design This is a multicentre open-label randomised controlled pilot trial at 5 academic tertiary care centres. Population We are targeting adult aSAH patients within 14 days of their initial bleed and with anaemia (Hb <= 110 g/L). Randomisation Central computer-generated randomisation, stratified by centre, will be undertaken from the host centre. Randomisation into 1 of the 2 treatment arms will occur when the haemoglobin levels of eligible patients fall to <= 100 g/L. Intervention Patients will be randomly assigned to either a liberal (threshold: Hb <= 100 g/L) or a restrictive transfusion strategy (threshold: Hb <= 80 g/L). Outcome Primary: Centre randomisation rate over the study period. Secondary: (1) transfusion threshold adherence; (2) study RBC transfusion protocol adherence; and (3) outcome assessment including vital status at hospital discharge, modified Rankin Score at 6 and 12 months and Functional Independence Measure and EuroQOL Quality of Life Scale scores at 12 months. Outcome measures will be reported in aggregate. Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol has been approved by the host centre (OHSN-REB 20150433-01H).

Inhibitory archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) proton pumps were delivered to Na(v)1.8(+) primary afferents using the Na(v)1.8-Cre driver line. Arch expression covered both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors and yellow light stimulation reliably blocked electrically induced action potentials in DRG neurons. Acute transdermal illumination of the hindpaws of Na(v)1.8-Arch(+) mice significantly reduced mechanical allodynia under inflammatory conditions, while basal mechanical sensitivity was not affected by the optical stimulation. Arch-driven hyperpolarization of nociceptive terminals was sufficient to prevent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in double-transgenic Na(v)1.8-ChR2(+)-Arch(+) mice. Furthermore, prolonged optical silencing of peripheral afferents in anesthetized Na(v)1.8-Arch(+) mice led to poststimulation analgesia with a significant decrease in mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity under inflammatory and neuropathic conditions. These findings highlight the role of peripheral neuronal inputs in the onset and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity, demonstrate the plasticity of pain pathways even after sensitization has occurred, and support the involvement of Na(v)1.8(+) afferents in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Together, we present a selective analgesic approach in which genetically identified subsets of peripheral sensory fibers can be remotely and optically inhibited with high temporal resolution, overcoming the compensatory limitations of genetic ablations.

The proposed architecture, called ReSeg, is based on the recently introduced ReNet model for image classification. We modify and extend it to perform the more challenging task of semantic segmentation. Each ReNet layer is composed of four RNN that sweep the image horizontally and vertically in both directions, encoding patches or activations, and providing relevant global information. Moreover, ReNet layers are stacked on top of pre-trained convolutional layers, benefiting from generic local features. Upsampling layers follow ReNet layers to recover the original image resolution in the final predictions. The proposed ReSeg architecture is efficient, flexible and suitable for a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. We evaluate ReSeg on several widely-used semantic segmentation datasets: Weiz-mann Horse, Oxford Flower, and CamVid; achieving state-of-the-art performance. Results show that ReSeg can act as a suitable architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, and may have further applications in other structured prediction problems.

However, their application to object recognition and detection thus far has focused largely on intensity or color images as inputs. Motivated by demonstrations that depth can enhance the performance of CNN-based approaches [2][5], in this paper we consider the benefits of also including differential geometric shape features. This elementary idea of using zeroth order (depth), first-order (surface normal) and second-order (surface curvature) features in a principled manner boosts the performance of a CNN that has been pretrained on a color image database. Notably, in an object detection task involving 19 categories we achieve 39.30% accuracy on the NYUv2 dataset, which is a 10.4% improvement over the current state-of-the-art accuracy of 35.6% using the method in [5]. In the simpler scenario of turntable style object recognition, our experiments on the University of Washington (UW) RGB-D dataset yield an accuracy of 88.7% correct recognition over 51 object categories, where the best competing result is 87.5% [2]. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that the abstraction of surface shape benefits object detection and recognition.

Partial oxidation of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol to methacrylic acid: experimental and neural network modeling	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CATALYTIC SELECTIVE OXIDATION; OXYGEN-POOR CONDITIONS; HETEROPOLY COMPOUNDS; ISOBUTANE OXIDATION; METHYL-METHACRYLATE; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; METHANE STORAGE; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; IRON	Methacrylic acid (MAA) is a specialty intermediate to producemethylmethacrylate (MMA), which is amonomer for poly methyl methacrylate. Current processes to MMA and MAA rely on expensive feedstocks and multi-step processes. Here we investigate the gas-phase oxidation of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (2MPDO) to MAA over heteropolycompounds as effective catalysts, finding that the maximum selectivity to MAA was 41% with 63% conversion of reactant at 250 degrees C over Cs(NH4)(2)PMo12O40(VO)Cu-0.5. Cesium (Cs) stabilized the catalyst structure at 250 degrees C, and vanadium(V) and copper (Cu) played a positive role as an oxidant and promoter, respectively. A 0.3 mm nozzle atomized the liquid reactant over the catalyst surface into a mu-fluidized bed reactor. The proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model predicts MAA selectivity based on 2MPDO and oxygen compositions and catalyst components (Cs, V, Cu) as independent factors. The model accounts for 97% of the variance in the data (R-2 = 0.97). Vanadium as a catalyst component and oxygen concentration are the two most significant factors. Genetic algorithms (GA) coupled with ANN modeling optimized the input parameters to improve the selectivity. The selectivity to MAA over the optimized catalyst (Cs(NH4) 2PMo12O40(VO)Cu-0.15) and optimum feed compositions (2MPDO/O-2/Ar = 13%/10%/77%) was 43% at 250 degrees C.

The Directed Transfer Function (DTF) has been proposed and validated as a quantitative approach to determine the flow of seizure activity. In this work, outflow and inflow features are extracted from the DTF matrix and used as inputs to a Kmeans unsupervised clustering approach. Results demonstrate the ability of the proposed methodology in automatically identifying sources and sinks of seizure activity as well as discriminating primary from secondary generators. Such distinction could lead to more tailored surgical resections.	[Assi, E. Bou; Sawan, M.] Polytech Montreal, Polystim Neurotech Lab, Inst Biomed Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nguyen, D.

Executive dysfunction following a mild traumatic brain injury revealed in early adolescence with locomotor-cognitive dual-tasks	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Executive functioning; gait; locomotion; concussion; adolescent	STABILITY FOLLOWING CONCUSSION; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; GAIT BALANCE CONTROL; POSTURAL CONTROL; HEAD-INJURY; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; ATTENTION	Objective: To compare gait parameters between children in early adolescence (EA) with and without a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during dual-task walking (DTW). Methods: Children in EA with mTBI (n = 14; six girls) were compared to those without (n = 13; five girls) while walking in different combinations of obstacle avoidance and cognitive dual-tasks. Gait speed and fluidity and their related dual-task costs (DTC) were analysed along with foot clearance and proximity to the obstacle. Results: No group effects were found for gait speed, proximity or clearance, but were found for fluidity DTC, specifically during the dual Stroop task and when crossing the deeper obstacle. There were also group differences for fluidity during the planning of obstacle avoidance for the narrow obstacle combined with the verbal fluency task and the deep obstacle with no cognitive task. Finally, gait fluidity showed group differences across unobstructed dual-task situations. Conclusions: Gait fluidity may be a more sensitive variable than gait speed for revealing executive dysfunction following mTBI in EA. Assessing DTW in level walking also seems to show a potential to reveal executive dysfunctions in this age group. These results provide direction for future research on clinical assessment using DTW post-mTBI in adolescents.

On a task we designed, all black-box state-of-theart machine learning algorithms which we tested, failed to generalize well. We motivate our work from the hypothesis that, there is a training barrier involved in the nature of such tasks, and that humans learn useful intermediate concepts from other individuals by using a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. Our results provide a positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, we trained a two-tiered MLP architecture on a dataset for which each input image contains three sprites, and the binary target class is 1 if all of three shapes belong to the same category and otherwise the class is 0. In terms of generalization, black-box machine learning algorithms could not perform better than chance on this task. Standard deep supervised neural networks also failed to generalize. However, using a particular structure and guiding the learner by providing intermediate targets in the form of intermediate concepts (the presence of each object) allowed us to solve the task efficiently. We obtained much better than chance, but imperfect results by exploring different architectures and optimization variants. This observation might be an indication of optimization difficulty when the neural network trained without hints on this task. We hypothesize that the learning difficulty is due to the composition of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with the hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of training of neural networks sometimes getting stuck, even though good solutions exist, both in terms of training and generalization error.

We have created 144 unique configurations for audiovisual content including various application and network parameters such as bitrates and distortions in terms of bandwidth, packet loss rate and jitter. To generate the data needed for model training and validation we have tasked 24 subjects, in a controlled environment, to rate the overall audiovisual quality on the absolute category rating (ACR) 5-level quality scale. We have developed models using Random Forest and Neural Network based machine learning methods in order to estimate Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) values. We have used information retrieved from the packet headers and side information provided as network parameters for model training. Random Forest based models have performed better in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient. The side information proved to be very effective in developing the model. We have found that, while the model performance might be improved by replacing the side information with more accurate bit stream level measurements, they are performing well in estimating perceived quality in audiovisual multimedia services.

In the present paper we circumvent this problem by introducing a class of models called hierarchical interaction models where the values of a function m : R-d -> R are computed in a feed-forward manner in several layers, where in each layer a function of at most d* inputs produced by the previous layer is computed. We introduce regression estimates based on neural networks with two hidden layers and apply them to estimation of regression functions from a class of hierarchical interaction models.

Symptoms of LNS include dystonia, gout, intellectual disability, and self-mutilation. Despite having been characterized over 50 years ago, it remains unclear precisely how deficits in hypoxanthine and guanine recycling can lead to such a profound neurological phenotype. Several studies have proposed different hypotheses regarding the etiology of this disease, and several treatments have been tried in patients, though none have led to a satisfactory explanation of the disease. New technologies such as next-generation sequencing, optogenetics, genome editing, and induced pluripotent stem cells provide a unique opportunity to map the precise sequential pathways leading from genotype to phenotype.

This paper proposes a new approach based on a critical clearing time (CCT) constraint that replaces the dynamic and transient stability constraints of the TSC-OPF problem. The CCT is computed by a multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN) trained using Gauss-Newton approximation for Bayesian regularization. In order to ensure a uniform distribution of generated points in the input space to train the neural networks, a Sobol quasi-random sequence is adopted for data generation. The proposed method has the merit of removing the computational burden of dynamic simulation during optimisation. Multi-contingency can simply be handled by adding a CCT constraint for each contingency. Simulation results for the New England 10-machine 39-bus system show that TSC-OPF using MFNN has very fast convergence to optimal operating points with the desired CCT.	[King, Robert T. F.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are utilized to reduce the dimension of these features.

This paper presents a handwritten Arabic character recognition system based on BA algorithm. BA algorithm is adopted to reduce the feature set size and to improve the accuracy rate. The proposed system is trained and tested by four well-known classifiers; Bayes Network (BN), artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Random forest (RF) with CENPARMI dataset. The proposed optimization algorithm obtained promising results in terms of classification accuracy as the proposed system is able to recognize 91.59 % of our test set correctly, as well as in terms of computational time reduction. BA algorithm is more efficient in most experiments when comparing with GA and PSO.

We track learner's reasoning according to different regions of the brain. Four standard lobes were taken into consideration: frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal. Each lobe was measured for each participant. We also studied the lobes measures distribution for all the participants. We found that some regions are more related to learner's vision and reflexion during the game and this could be an indice that the learner follows the correct reasoning process. Primary results show that our game enhance learners' performance. Moreover, the learners use almost occipital lobe to visualize the task presented in the game and the frontal lobe for the reasoning process.

Both the performance and computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design of characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been optimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present a multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of solution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling. Given spaces which can easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a near-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network complexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on specific datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must therefore be designed on a per-application basis. In our work, machine learning is leveraged by training an artificial neural network to predict the performance of future candidate networks. The method is evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, optimizing for both recognition accuracy and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can closely approximate the Pareto-optimal	[Smithson, Sean C.; Yang, Guang; Gross, Warren J.; Meyer, Brett H.] McGill Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Smithson, SC (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.	sean.smithson@mail.mcgill.ca; guang.yang3@mail.mcgill.ca; warren.gross@mail.mcgill.ca; brett.meyer@mcgill.ca						22	0	0	0	0	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA	1933-7760		978-1-4503-4466-1	ICCAD-IEEE ACM INT			2016										10.1145/2966986.2967058		8	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BG6HH	WOS:000390297800104		No			2017-07-26

To increase the sensitivity to higher penetration depth of investigation, the source and the detector separation should be small. We first show with simulation results that short source-detector separations results in the detection of a higher number of photons coming from a greater depth. However, at these shorter distances the number of early arriving photons also increase (mainly coming from the skull and scalp regions in brain imaging) which is a constraint. To reject the early arriving photons we need a gated detector to enable detections at specified time windows. We then confirm these results in an experimental study using a simplified photon detection scheme. The dependency of the photon counts on the gate window and the source-detector separation is analyzed. We conclude that placing the laser source and the detector quite close to each other is an option to consider for the design of optodes so as to improve the image quality in various biomedical appications.

Recently, template matching and compressed sensing (CS) techniques have attracted attention for their use in spike detection and data compression respectively. In this article, we propose an online adaptive digital spike detection and data compression system using Bayesian inference-based template matching and the CS technique. Bayesian inference is applied for spike detection using either pre-generated or automatically generated templates. The proposed module locates the spikes with a high-detection accuracy. Additionally, it integrates the CS technique and applies a sensing matrix, called a Minimum Euclidean or Manhattan Distance Cluster-based (MDC) matrix, to compress signals. Using the MDC matrix, the proposed system cannot only compress a signal with a high-compression rate (CR) but also with a low reconstruction error (RER).

Current mode digital-toanalog converters are used to generate the cathodic and the anodic stimulation phases. A sample-and-hold and a window comparator circuit are used to compare the voltage of the electrode and the tissue with a target value within a safe voltage range of -50 mV to +50 mV. When the electrode voltage falls below the lower bound or above the upper bound of such a safe voltage range, the anodic stimulation pulse width is modified in such a way that the electrode voltage remains in the safe range. High-level pulse shrinking (HLPS) and low-level pulse shrinking (HLPS) elements are used in digital part to modify anodic pulse width. Simulation results for the proposed circuit implemented in a 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS technology confirm proper functioning and show that the proposed circuit requires extremely low power compared to other charge balancing schemes, with a power consumption of 4.2 mu W.

In the CC architecture, this adapted SKAN model is used in a spiking neural network (SNN) to implement spike-timing-dependant-plasticity (STDP). However, in order to achieve a functioning OC architecture, a new STDP-inspired learning process is introduced. The modified CC architecture, new OC architecture, adapted SKAN model and new STDP-inspired process represent the four contributions presented here, along with simulation results on a FPGA which shows their adequacy in supporting CC and OC learning behaviors.

One means for gaining valuable information about the development of this aspect of global brain function is to relate brain electrical activity recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) signals to brain metabolic activity, collected by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET). A telemetric system for recording chicken embryo EEG signals that is electromagnetically compatible with a PET scanner has been developed for this purpose. An infrared data link has been used in order to avoid electromagnetic interference. The system is composed of a small, low-power IR transmitter which sends sampled data to a receiver that is connected to a PC for signal processing and data storage. The transmitter collects EEG/EMG data from six channels, with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz and an accuracy of 12 bits. The transmission range is up to approximately 30 cm, compatible with the required application. The total size of the transmitter is 21 mm x 16 mm, excluding the battery.

Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Practice Guidelines as Topic; Erythrocyte Transfusion [adverse effects; mortality; standards]; Hematocrit [standards]; Hemoglobin A [analysis]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Reference Values; Transplantation, Autologous [standards]; Transplantation, Homologous [mortality; standards]; Humans	RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINE; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; RESTRICTIVE TRANSFUSION; HIP FRACTURE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; CARDIAC-SURGERY; CRITICAL-CARE; SEQUENTIAL-ANALYSIS	Background There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients. Objectives The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL). Search methods We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials. Selection criteria We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered. Data collection and analysis We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'. Main results A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I-2 = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I-2 = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia). Authors' conclusions Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.
