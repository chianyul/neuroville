Tetraethyl lead was still in use as an antiknock agent in Paris during the sampling period of the study, while it has been replaced by methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) in Canada since 1977. By 1990, MMT was in 100% of gasoline in Canada. In a study of 160 pairs of mothers-neonates in Montreal and 206 pairs in Paris, we compared levels of Mn and Ph in the umbilical cord and in maternal blood. Neonates and mothers had significantly higher Pb levels in Paris where lead additives were still used in gasoline. Geometric mean maternal blood Pb levels were 5.4 mug/dl compared to 2.1 mug/dl in Montreal and cord blood Pb levels were 3.2 mug/dl in Parisian mothers compared to 1.7 mug/dl in Montreal. The prevalence of Paris Pb values superior to the 95th percentile of the Montreal distribution was highly elevated in all media studied. The prevalence of high Mn levels in umbilical cord blood was also significantly higher in Montreal. Surveillance programs are important to limit Pb overexposure and associated neurological effects in neonates where tetraethyl Ph is still in use as a gasoline additive. Since Mn is an essential element and dietary Mn intake may differ between Montreal and Paris, the difference observed with regard to high Mn values between Montreal and Paris cannot, at this time, be attributed to MMT in Montreal's gasoline. Further studies are needed to infer an association between Mn emissions from MMT and prenatal exposure to Mn. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lessard, N; Lepore, F; Villemagne, J; Lassonde, M				Lessard, N; Lepore, F; Villemagne, J; Lassonde, M			Sound localization in callosal agenesis and early callosotomy subjects: brain reorganization and/or compensatory strategies	BRAIN			English	Article						corpus callosum; monaural auditory localization; binaural auditory localization; moving sounds; cerebral plasticity	PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; CATS SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; HORIZONTAL PLANE; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; HUMAN LISTENERS; MONAURAL LOCALIZATION; SOURCE MOVEMENT; LAYER-III; NEURONS; SPACE	In order to evaluate the callosal involvement in sound localization, the present study examined the response accuracy of acallosal and early callosotomized subjects to monaural and binaural auditory targets presented in three-dimensional space. In these subjects, bilateral localization cues, such as interaural time and level differences, are integrated at the cortical and subcortical levels without the additional support of the callosal commissure. Because acallosal and early-callosotomized subjects have developed with this reduced source of binaural activation of cortical cells, they might have perfected their ability to use monaural sound localization cues. This hypothesis was tested by assessing localization performance under both binaural and monaural listening conditions. Five subjects with callosal agenesis, one callosotomized subject operated early in life and 19 control subjects were asked to localize broad-band noise bursts (BBNBs) of fixed intensity in the horizontal plane in an anechoic chamber. BBNBs were delivered through randomly selected loudspeakers. Two conditions were tested: (i) localization of a stationary sound source; and (ii) localization of a moving sound source. Listeners had to report the apparent stimulus location by pointing to its perceived position on a graduated perimeter. The results indicated that the acallosal subjects were less accurate than controls, but only in the binaural moving sound condition. More interestingly, in the monaural testing conditions, some of the acallosal subjects and the early-callosotomized subject performed significantly better than control subjects. This suggests that, because of the absence of the corpus callosum, these subjects compensate for their reduced access to cortically determined binaural cues by making more efficient use of monaural cues.

Naloxone (2 mg kg(-1), i.p.) challenge decreased both CGRP and substance P immunoreactivity and precipitated a robust withdrawal syndrome. 3 Acute intrathecal pre-treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist, CGRP(8) (37) (4.8 mug), a substance P receptor antagonist, SR 140333 (1.4, 2.8 mug), a cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor, ketorolac (30, 45 mug), and COX-2 selective inhibitors. DuP 697 (10, 30 mug) and nimesulide (30 mug), 30 min before naloxone challenge, partially attenuated the symptoms of morphine withdrawal. CGRP(8) (37) (8 mug), but no other agents, inhibited the decrease in CGRP immunoreactivity. 4 Chronic intrathecal treatment with CGRP(8) (37) (4. 8 mug). SR 140333 (1.4 mug). ketorolac (15, 30 mug). DuP 697 (10, 30 mug), and nimesulide (30 mug), delivered with daily morphine injection significantly attenuated both the symptoms of withdrawal and the decrease in CGRP but not substance P immunoreactivity. 5 The results of this study suggest that activation of CGRP and substance P receptors. at the spinal level, contributes to the induction and expression of opioid physical dependence and that this activity may be partially expressed through the intermediary actions of prostaglandins.

All actions of IL-1 identified to date appear to be mediated through its only known functional type I receptor (IL-1RI). However, our recent evidence Suggests that some actions of IL-1 in the brain may be IL-1RI independent, suggesting the involvement of a new, hitherto unknown functional receptor for IL-1. 2 The objective of the present Study was to determine if primary mixed glial cells express additional functional IL-1 receptors by studying the signalling mechanisms responsible for the proinflammatory actions of IL-1beta in cultures derived from IL-1RI-/- and wildtype mice, and to characterize the functional importance of IL-1 signalling pathways in glia. 3 IL-1beta induced marked release of IL-6 and prostaglandin-E-2 (PGE(2)) in the culture medium, and activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) in cells from wildtype mice. These responses were dependent on IL-1RI, since cells isolated from IL-1RI-/- mice did not demonstrate any of these responses. 4 In wildtype mice, inhibition of p38 or ERK1/2 MAPKs significantly reduced IL-1beta induced IL-6 release, whilst the NFkappaB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) modulated IL-1 induced IL-6 release by action on NFkappaB and MAPKs pathways. 5 These data demonstrate that IL-1RI is essential for IL-1beta signalling in cultured mixed glial cells. Thus IL-1 actions observed in IL-1RI-/- mice in vivo may occur via an alternative pathway and/or via different CNS cells.

Recently, it was suggested that an isoenzyme of the Na+,K+-ATPase containing the alpha(2) subunit, together with the glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1, participate in a coupling mechanism between neuronal activity and energy metabolism taking place in astrocytes. To substantiate this hypothesis, we compared the distribution Of alpha(2), GLAST and/or GLT-1 in the rat cerebral cortex using double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, and immunocytochemistry at the electron microscopic level. We also investigated the relationship between alpha(2), GLAST or GLT-1 and asymmetrical synaptic junctions (largely glutamatergic) and GABAergic nerve terminals. Results show that the alpha(2) subunit has an exclusive astroglial localization, and that it is almost completely co-distributed with GLAST and GLT-1 when evaluated by confocal microscopy. This similar distribution was confirmed at the ultrastructural level, which further showed that the vast majority of the alpha(2) staining (73% of all labelled elements), like that of GLAST and GLT-1, was located in glial leaflets surrounding dendritic spines and the dendritic and/or axonal elements of asymmetrical (glutamatergic) axo-dendritic synapses. Synapses ensheathed by alpha(2), GLAST or GLT-1 virtually never included (less than or equal to2%) GABAergic nerve terminals or synaptic junctions. However, a subset of GABAergic nerve terminals (10-14%) were directly apposed to asymmetrical axo-dendritic junctions surrounded by alpha(2), GLAST or GLT-1. Altogether these results demonstrate that alpha(2), GLAST and GLT-1 have comparable perisynaptic distribution within cortical astrocytes most likely associated with glutamatergic synapses.

J	Faucher, C; Kergoat, H				Faucher, C; Kergoat, H			Modulation of the scotopic electroretinogram and oscillatory potentials with systemic hyperoxia and hypercapnia in humans	CURRENT EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						electroretinogram; hypercapnia; hyperoxia; oscillatory potentials	CHOROIDAL BLOOD-FLOW; VASCULAR PERFUSION-PRESSURE; CAT RETINA; DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; OXYGEN DISTRIBUTION; HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS; MUDPUPPY RETINA; CARBON-DIOXIDE; FOVEAL REGION; OCULAR FUNDUS	Purpose. Systemic hyperoxia reduces blood flow to the retina while systemic hypercapnia has the Opposite effect. However, the effect this modification in blood flow has on neuroretinal function in humans has not been documented yet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of pure oxygen and carbogen breathing on scotopic electroretinograms (ERGs) and oscillatory potentials (OPs) in humans. Methods. Thirty-five healthy adults volunteered for this study. The ERGs and OPs were recorded: 1) during room air breathing, 2) after a period of pure oxygen (O-2) or carbogen breathing, 3) in room air just after the flow of gas was interrupted, and 4) 10 minutes after the end of the gas administration. Results. The amplitude and latency of the a- and b-waves were not altered during systemic hyperoxia. The amplitude of OP3 increased during hyperoxia while the amplitude of the other OPs was not altered. The latency of all OPs remained stable throughout the O-2 session. Ten minutes after the end of pure O-2 breathing, the a- and b-wave latencies were delayed. No change was found in the amplitude of the a-wave during the carbogen session that increased the end-tidal carbon dioxide by 7.1%, whereas the b-wave was reduced ten minutes after the end of carbogen breathing. The amplitude of OP5 was reduced during carbogen breathing, as well as 10 minutes later. The amplitude of all other OPs, as well as the latencies of all ERG and OP components remained stable throughout the carbogen session. Conclusions. Breathing pure O-2 or carbogen did not compromise retinal function in any major way, likely due to adequate retinal and choroidal regulatory mechanisms. Further investigations are required to better delineate the impact and temporal characteristics of such physiological challenges on retinal function.

A cohort of 72 preschool children was studied (38 females, 34 males; mean age 3 years 8 months, SD 1 year 2 months, range 2 to 5 years) who were considered to be at high risk due to placental insufficiency. The cohort was divided into four categories of neurological status: (1) minimal cerebral palsy (MCP) with independent walking before age 2 years; (2) Amiel-Tison triad (ATT) including imbalance of passive axial tone, phasic stretch reflex in triceps surae, and cranial signs, particularly on the squamous suture; (3) intermediate with one or two of the three ATT signs; and (4) absence of neurological findings. Six subscales of the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales assessing locomotion, eye-hand coordination, interpersonal skills, language, performance, and practical reasoning were administered. Significant differences were found according to neurological status in three specific domains of development: coordination (F=2.84,p=0.04), language (F=3.65,P=0.02), and practical reasoning (F=3.62, p=0.02). In addition, significant differences were also found in language (L) and practical reasoning (R) performances according to the side of the abnormal stretch reflex: bilateral stretches (L=87.8; R=75.3) or an isolated right stretch (L=95.3; R=83.6) are more strongly associated with impaired developmental performances than an isolated left stretch (L=101.3; R=88.2) with F=2.94;p=0.04 for language and F=3.00,p=0.04 for practical reasoning. We concluded that a short neurological examination, easily performed by pediatricians and family practitioners, can identify permanent markers of minor brain damage occurring before, during, or soon after birth and so anticipate consequences.

Recent studies involving electrophysiology and immunolabelling indicate that short-term insulin treatment of hippocampal neurons in culture induces changes in glutamate receptor function, suggesting that this receptor system can be altered on a relatively rapid time scale during diabetic conditions. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined whether brain glutamate receptors and long-term potentiation are altered in the early stages of diabetes mellitus in non-obese diabetic mice, a genetic model of Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Methods. In vitro receptor autoradiography and immunoblotting were used to study the impact of diabetes on brain glutamate receptors. From an electrophysiological point of view, field potential recordings were also examined in area CA1 of hippocampal slices to determine the influence of diabetes on long-term potentiation. Results. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis revealed enhanced H-3-glutamate binding to several brain regions of diabetes mice, with maximal increases in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Saturation kinetics within the cerebral cortex disclosed that this change of H-3-glutamate was possibly due to an increase in the maximal number of N-methyl-D-aspartate binding sites, an interpretation that was corroborated by Western blot analysis of N-methyl-D-aspartate 2A subunits. Impairment in the expression of hippocampal long-term potentiation was also observed in diabetic mice, while the failure to elicit synaptic potentiation was prevented by insulin treatment. Conclusion/interpretation. Because glutamate receptors are thought to be involved in several degenerative processes, our results suggest that up-regulation of these receptors in the early stages of diabetes could represent an important mechanism underlying neurological complications within the brain of diabetic patients.

J	Pitcher, GM; Henry, JL				Pitcher, GM; Henry, JL			Second phase of formalin-induced excitation of spinal dorsal horn neurons in spinalized rats is reversed by sciatic nerve block	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						central sensitization; formalin test; lidocaine; nerve block; nociception; pain; spinal cord; wide dynamic range neuron	C-FOS EXPRESSION; PERSISTENT NOCICEPTIVE RESPONSES; SUBCUTANEOUS FORMALIN; DIFFERENTIAL CONTRIBUTION; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; AMINO-ACIDS; IN-VIVO; PAIN; RECEPTORS; CORD	Considerable debate persists concerning peripheral vs. central mechanisms underlying the second phase of the nociceptive response in the formalin test in the rat. To gain insight into the neurophysiological basis of this pain, we investigated the effects of block of afferent nerve conduction during the second phase of formalin-evoked excitation of single nociceptive neurons recorded extracellularly from rat spinal dorsal horn segments (L3-4 ) in pentobarbital-anaesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were spinally transected (T-9 ) to examine exclusively peripheral and spinal nociceptive processing. In six control rats, hind paw intraplantar formalin injection (50 muL, 2.5%) induced the typical biphasic increase in the discharge rate of the six wide dynamic range neurons tested. This response consisted of a relatively brief immediate phase (approximately 5 min), followed by decreased firing. An ensuing second phase of elevated discharge began approximately 35 min after injection and persisted to at least 80 min. In this control group, 0.9% saline was applied to the exposed ipsilateral sciatic nerve after onset of the second phase (40 min after formalin injection). In a group of six test rats, application of 2% lidocaine instead of saline reversed the second phase of excitation in all six wide dynamic range neurons examined. When the firing rate was normalized to that at 40 min (100%), the time of saline or lidocaine administration, the rate at 50 min was 120 +/- 7.5% in the saline-treated group and 31 +/- 7.4% in the lidocaine-treated group; following lidocaine treatment firing rate remained markedly less than that before administration throughout the remainder of the recording. It is concluded that: (i) spinal mechanisms alone are not sufficient for induction and maintenance of second phase increased discharge of spinal nociceptive dorsal horn neurons; (ii) descending influences via supraspinal inputs are not causal in the development and maintenance of second phase increased discharge and (iii) tonic input from afferent neurons during the second phase plays a primary and essential role in generating and sustaining the second phase of elevated discharge of dorsal horn neurons and, thus, presumably the second phase of nociceptive scores in the formalin test. The data in this study reveal how much of an altered synaptically elicited response in the spinal dorsal horn can be attributed to postsynaptic plastic changes vs. how much can be simply due to increased synaptic input. The present results are important not only in the context of the formalin test but also in the context of other models related to inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain.

J	Stip, E				Stip, E			Happy birthday neuroleptics! 50 years later: la folie du doute	EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY			English	Editorial Material						antipsychotics; neuroleptics; evidence-based-medicine; history of neuroleptics; clozapine; meta-analysis	ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; CONTROLLED TRIALS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; METAANALYSIS; MECHANISM; HISTORY	Given that we are celebrating the 50th birthday of neuroleptics introduction in psychiatry, the author proposes to take a look at certain results related to therapeutic practice, After a brief chronological literature review of the clinical practices and theoretical models that have controlled drug treatment of schizophrenia, the author presents a critical review of four meta-analyses. Since Delay, Deniker and Harl's initial report, the story of neuroleptics comprises several periods. In 1963, the hyper-dopaminergic theory of psychoses was proposed. Another period began with models mainly based on the serotonin/dopamine relative blockade receptor hypothesis. More recently, a new framework to understand the differential effect of antipsychotics is related to the appropriate modulation (e.g., fast dissociation) of the D2 receptor alone. The concept of atypicality has become a new vista for research and to market new compounds. However, after 50, years of neuroleptic drugs, are we able to answer the following simple questions: Are neuroleptics effective in treating: schizophrenia? Is there a difference between atypical and conventional neuroleptics? How do the efficacy and safety of newer antipsychotic drugs compare with those of clozapine? Actually, the answers yielded by these simple questions by meta-analysis should elicit in us a good deal of humility. If we wish to base psychiatry on evidence-based medicine, we run a genuine risk in taking a closer look at what has long been considered fact. Each psychiatrist must continue to be critical, sceptical, optimistic (not overoptimistic) and to learn in order to integrate the positive aspects of our growing knowledge base.

The results suggested that the rate of variation in tangential stroking force is a significant determinant of roughness perception. In the first experiment, six volunteer subjects scaled the roughness of eight surfaces explored with a single, active scan of the middle finger. The surfaces were 7.5 x 2.4-cm polymer strips embossed with truncated cones 1.8 mm high with a spatial period of 2.0 mm in the transverse direction and 1.5-8.5 mm in the longitudinal, scanning direction. The surfaces were mounted on a six-axis force and torque sensor that measured the perpendicular, contact force (normal to the skin surface) and the tangential force along the axis of stroking. The results confirmed the findings of an earlier study that magnitude estimates of perceived roughness increase approximately linearly up to a longitudinal spatial period of 8.5 mm. Across subjects, no consistent correlations were found between perceived roughness and either the mean normal or tangential force alone. Although significant positive correlations were found between roughness and mean kinetic friction for all subjects, they were not as consistently robust as one might have expected. Furthermore, instantaneous kinetic friction varied widely over the course of a single stroke because of within trial oscillations in the tangential force. The amplitude of these oscillations increased with the longitudinal spatial period and their frequency was determined by a combination of the spatial period and the stroking velocity. These oscillations were even more conspicuous in the first derivative or rate of change of the tangential force (dFx/dt), which was quantified as the root mean square (RMS) of the tangential force rate. The mean normalized RMS proved to be strongly correlated with subjective roughness, averaging 0.88 for all subjects. In order to dissociate the fluctuations in tangential force from both the surface structure and the mean kinetic friction, a second experiment was performed on six additional subjects who estimated the roughness of identical lubricated and unlubricated (dry) surfaces. Lubrication with liquid soap reduced the mean kinetic friction by approximately 40%, the RMS of the tangential force rate by slightly more than 21% and the subjective estimates of roughness by 16.4%. Taken together, the results suggest that in tactile exploration, the RMS of the tangential force rate may be an important determinant of subjective roughness.

Because swallowing-induced peristalsis Is centrally controlled and depends on neural crest-derived esophageal innervation, we looked for esophageal dysmotility in patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Methods: Seven patients without dysphagia or any other upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms were studied prospectively (5 girls and 2 boys; median age, 14 years; range, 11-18 years). They were compared with 7 age- and sex-matched controls. Esophageal manometry was performed using a low-compliance infusion system and the station pull-through technique. At least 10 wet swallows were analyzed in each subject. Results: Pressure wave propagation was abnormal in all 7 patients (median percentage of swallows propagated, 18%, and range, 0-66; controls, 90% and 80-100; P < 0.001). Lower esophageal sphincter relaxation was abnormal in 5 patients (patients, 73% and 53-100; controls, 95% and 90-100; P = 0.01). In 2 patients, lower esophageal sphincter pressure was above the 95th percentile of control values. Conclusions: These abnormalities are strong evidence of lower esophageal dysfunction in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. We speculate that the underlying mechanism may be dysfunction of the central structures that control swallowing.

Yet, little is known regarding the neurobiological processes underlying such a gender difference. To investigate this issue, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare the neural correlates of SA in 20 male and 20 female subjects. Brain activity was measured while male and female subjects were viewing erotic film excerpts. Results showed that the level of perceived SA was significantly higher in male than in female subjects, When compared to viewing emotionally neutral film excerpts, viewing erotic film excerpts was associated, for both genders, With bilateral blood oxygen level dependant (BOLD) signal increases in the anterior cingulate, media! prefrontal, orbitofrontal, insular, and occipitotemporal cortices, as well as in the amygdala and the ventral striatum. Only for the group of male subjects was there evidence of a significant activation of the thalamus and hypothalamus, a sexually dimorphic area of the brain known to play a pivotal role in physiological arousal and sexual behavior. When directly compared between genders, hypothalamic activation was found to be significantly greater in male subjects. furthermore, for male subjects only, the magnitude of hypothalamic activation Was positively correlated with reported levels of SA. These findings reveal the existence of similarities and dissimilarities in the way the brain of both genders responds to erotic stimuli. They further suggest that the greater SA generally experienced by men, when viewing erotica, may be related to the functional gender difference found here With respect to the hypothalamus.

Because prostaglandins (PGs) are implicated in acute hypercapnia-induced hyperemia, this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that prolonged hypercapnia may cause a sustained increase in retinal blood flow (RBF) through a PG-dependent induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). METHODS. Time-dependent RBF (microsphere technique), PGE(2), nitrite (NO2+), and NOS protein (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH]-diaphorase staining) production were measured in hypercapnia (6% CO2)-treated piglets. From the same species, PGE(2), eNOS m-RNA, NOS protein, and vasomotor responses were measured in eyecup preparations, as were Ca2+ transients in neuroretinovascular endothelial cells. RESULTS. Hypercapnia caused biphasic (at 0.5 hours and 6-8 hours) increases in RBF that were abolished with normalization of the pH. The early phase (0.5 hour) was associated with an increase in PGE(2) levels and the latter phase (6-8 hours) with all increase in NO2- and NOS protein. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase by diclofenac revented the early and late increase in RBF. NOS inhibitor L-nitro-arginine prevented only the latter. Hypercapnic acidosis increased retinal PGE(2) levels and eNOS-dependent vasorelaxation ex vivo. The ex vivo time course of eNOS mRNA expression corresponded with the late-phase increase in RBF and was blocked by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and the receptor-operated Ca2+ channel blocker SK&F96365. In neuroretinovascular cells, acidosis increased Ca2+ transients, which were inhibited by SK&F96365, but Hot diclofenac. CONCLUSIONS. This study discloses a previously unexplored mechanism for late retinal hyperemia during sustained hyper-capnia that appears secondary to the induced expression of eNOS mediated by PGE(2).

Method: Boys of age 13 years were selected on the basis of childhood histories of physical aggression: stable, unstable, and non-aggressive. Performance on a Card Playing Task provided a perseveration index. Results: Physical aggression, regardless of history, predicted perseveration in adolescence. However, qualitative differences revealed that Neuroticism increased the risk for perseveration only in the unstable aggressive group relative to the other groups. Perseveration in the stable aggressive group maybe related to a more fundamental information-processing deficit. Conclusion: The identification of these processes has implications for developmental theories of physical aggression; they may help discriminate those children who show early physical aggression and who will remain aggressive from those who will only show occasional physical aggression during later childhood.

A few studies have indicated that cerebral atrophy can be found in patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS), but its evolution after cure has not been studied extensively. We report the presence of apparent cerebral atrophy in CS and its reversibility after the correction of hypercortisolism. Thirty-eight patients with CS, including 21 with Cushing's disease and 17 with adrenal CS were studied. The control groups consisted of IS patients with other non-ACTH-secreting sellar tumors and 20 normal controls. Twenty-two patients with CS were reevaluated after cure. Subjective loss of brain volume was present in 86% of patients with Cushing's disease and 100% of patients with adrenal CS. The values for third ventricle diameter, bicaudate diameter, and subjective evaluation were significantly increased in CS groups in comparison with the control group (P less than or equal to 0.001). Imaging reevaluated at 39.7 +/- 34.1 months after achieving eucortisolism showed an improvement of the third ventricle diameter (P = 0.001), bicaudate diameter (P < 0.0005), and subjective evaluation (P = 0.05). We conclude that brain volume loss is highly prevalent in CS and is at least partially reversible following correction of hypercortisolism.

It has been suggested that peripherin may play a role in axonal elongation and/or cytoskeletal stabilization during development and regeneration. To further clarify the function of peripherin, we generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of the peripherin gene. The perlpherin null mice were viable, reproduced normally and did not exhibit overt phenotypes. Microscopic analysis revealed no gross morphological defects in the ventral and dorsal roots, spinal cord, retina and gut, but protein analyses showed increased levels of the type IV IF alpha-internexin in ventral roots of peripherin null mice. Whereas the number and caliber of myelinated motor and sensory axons in the L5 roots remained unchanged in peripherin knockout mice, there was a substantial reduction (similar to 34%) in the number of L5 unmyelinated sensory fibers that correlated with a decreased binding of the lectin IB4. These results demonstrate a requirement of peripherin for the proper development of a subset of sensory neurons.

J	Francis, DD; Young, LJ; Meaney, MJ; Insel, TR				Francis, DD; Young, LJ; Meaney, MJ; Insel, TR			Naturally occurring differences in maternal care are associated with the expression of oxytocin and vasopressin (V1a) receptors: Gender differences	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						maternal behaviour; oxytocin receptors; vasopressin (V1a) receptors; sex differences	RAT-BRAIN; GLUCOCORTICOID REGULATION; STRESS RESPONSES; BINDING-SITES; PRAIRIE VOLES; BEHAVIOR; NUCLEUS; LOCALIZATION; FOREBRAIN; FEMALE	Variations in maternal care have been associated with long-term changes in neurochemistry and behaviour in adult rats. Rats receiving high levels of licking and grooming as pups are less fearful and more maternal than rats receiving low levels of maternal licking and grooming. Central pathways for oxytocin and vasopressin have been implicated in the neurobiology of anxiety and social behaviours. We assessed whether variations in maternal care were associated with differences in oxytocin receptors (OTR) or vasopressin (V1a) receptors in the brains of adult offspring. In the central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, OTR binding was increased in adult females, but not adult males, that had received high levels of maternal licking and grooming as pups. Conversely, amygdala V1a receptor binding was increased in males, but not females, that had received high levels of maternal licking and grooming. These findings suggest that variations in maternal care may influence the expression of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors in a gender-specific manner.

As previously demonstrated in our laboratory, chronic (7-day) intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) NPY infusion (6 mug/day) from days 8-15 postpartum (pp) caused a significant decrease in milk production and an early termination of lactational diestrus. Similar application of the mixed Y1/Y4/Y5 receptor agonist (Leu(31), Pro(34)) NPY (at 3, 6 and 9 mug/day) reproduced the effect of chronic NPY infusion on milk production in a dose-independent manner. Consistent with this effect, the potent Y1 antagonist/Y4 agonist, 1229U91, given concomitantly with NPY eliminated the decline in milk production. The Y2 receptor agonist, NPY13-36, had no effect on milk production at any of the doses used. Length of lactational diestrus was reduced following administration of the Y2 agonist at 18 mug/day but not at 9 mug or 27 mug/day whereas (Leu(31), Pro(34)) NPY infusion had no effect on this parameter at any of the doses used. However, the group that was treated with NPY plus 1229U91 exhibited the usual length of lactational diestrus, indicating that there is at least some Y1 involvement in the effects of NPY on lactational infertility. To test the possibility that the effects of NPY infusion are mediated through changes in circulating prolactin and progesterone, plasma concentrations of these hormones were measured on day 15 pp in NPY-, (Leu(31), Pro(34)) NPY- and vehicle-treated females. NPY-infused females had lower plasma prolactin concentrations than vehicle-infused dams but progesterone concentrations were similar across groups. Overall, these data indicate that chronic exogenous NPY-infusion in lactating females disrupts milk production and shortens lactational diestrus, most likely through reducing prolactin secretion, and that this effect is mediated via Y1 receptor activity.

J	Roy, JE; Cullen, KE				Roy, JE; Cullen, KE			Vestibuloocular reflex signal modulation during voluntary and passive head movements	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; VESTIBULAR NUCLEUS NEURONS; CERVICO-OCULAR REFLEXES; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; EYE-MOVEMENT; FIRING BEHAVIOR; ALERT MONKEY; SECONDARY NEURONS; NERVE AFFERENTS	The vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) effectively stabilizes the visual world on the retina over the wide range of head movements generated during daily activities by producing an eye movement of equal and opposite amplitude to the motion of the head. Although an intact VOR is essential for stabilizing gaze during walking and running, it can be counterproductive during certain voluntary behaviors. For example, primates use rapid coordinated movements of the eyes and head (gaze shifts) to redirect the visual axis from one target of interest to another. During these self-generated head movements, a fully functional VOR would generate an eye-movement command in the direction opposite to that of the intended shift in gaze. Here, we have investigated how the VOR pathways process vestibular information across a wide range of behaviors in which head movements were either externally applied and/or self-generated and in which the gaze goal was systematically varied (i.e., stabilize vs. redirect). VOR interneurons [i.e., type I position-vestibular-pause (PVP) neurons] were characterized during head-restrained passive whole-body rotation, passive head-on-body rotation, active eye-head gaze shifts, active eye-head gaze pursuit, self-generated whole-body motion, and active head-on-body motion made while the monkey was passively rotated. We found that regardless of the stimulation condition, type I PVP neuron responses to head motion were comparable whenever the monkey stabilized its gaze. In contrast, whenever the monkey redirected its gaze, type I PVP neurons were significantly less responsive to head velocity. We also performed a comparable analysis of type II PVP neurons, which are likely to contribute indirectly to the VOR, and found that they generally behaved in a quantitatively similar manner. Thus our findings support the hypothesis that the activity of the VOR pathways is reduced "on-line" whenever the current behavioral goal is to redirect gaze. By characterizing neuronal responses during a variety of experimental conditions, we were also able to determine which inputs contribute to the differential processing of head-velocity information by PVP neurons. We show that neither neck proprioceptive inputs, an efference copy of neck motor commands nor the monkey's knowledge of its self-motion influence the activity of PVP neurons per se. Rather we propose that efference copies of oculomotor/ gaze commands are responsible for the behaviorally dependent modulation of PVP neurons (and by extension for modulation of the status of the VOR) during gaze redirection.

J	Rushworth, MFS; Hadland, KA; Paus, T; Sipila, PK				Rushworth, MFS; Hadland, KA; Paus, T; Sipila, PK			Role of the human medial frontal cortex in task switching: A combined fMRI and TMS study	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MOVEMENT-RELATED ACTIVITY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SEQUENTIAL-PROCEDURES; PARIETAL CORTEX	We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity when subjects were performing identical tasks in the context of either a task-set switch or a continuation of earlier performance. The context, i.e., switching or staying with the current task, influenced medial frontal cortical activation; the medial frontal cortex is transiently activated at the time that subjects switch from one way of performing a task to another. Two types of task-set-switching paradigms were investigated. In the response-switching (RS) paradigm, subjects switched between different rules for response selection and had to choose between competing responses. In the visual-switching (VS) paradigm, subjects switched between different rules for stimulus selection and had to choose between competing visual stimuli. The type of conflict, sensory (VS) or motor (RS), involved in switching was critical in determining medial frontal activation. Switching in the RS paradigm was associated with clear blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal increases ("activations") in three medial frontal areas: the rostral cingulate zone, the caudal cingulate zone, and the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Switching in the VS task was associated with definite activation in just one medial frontal area, a region on the border between the pre-SMA and the SMA. Subsequent to the fMRI session, we used MRI-guided frameless stereotaxic procedures and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to test the importance of the medial frontal activations for task switching. Applying rTMS over the pre-SMA disrupted subsequent RS performance but only when it was applied in the context of a switch. This result shows, first, that the pre-SMA is essential for task switching and second that its essential role is transient and limited to just the time of behavioral switching. The results are consistent with a role for the pre-SMA in selecting between response sets at a superordinate level rather than in selecting individual responses. The effect of the rTMS was not simply due to the tactile and auditory artifacts associated with each pulse; rTMS over several control regions did not selectively disrupt switching. Applying rTMS over the SMA/pre-SMA area activated in the VS paradigm did not disrupt switching. This result, first, confirms the limited importance of the medial frontal cortex for sensory attentional switching. Second, the VS rTMS results suggest that just because an area is activated in two paradigms does not mean that it plays the same essential role in both cases.

Renewed interest in stereotactic neurosurgery for movement disorders has led to numerous reports of clinical outcomes associated with different treatment strategies. Nevertheless. there is a paucity of autopsy and imaging data that can be used to describe the optimal size and location of lesions or the location of implantable stimulators. In this study the authors correlated the clinical efficacy of stereotactic thalamotomy for tremor with precise anatomical localization by using postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and an integrated deformable digital atlas of subcortical structures. Methods. Thirty-one lesions were created by stereotactic thalamotomy in 25 patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson disease. Lesion volume and configuration were evaluated by reviewing early postoperative MR images and were correlated with excellent, good, or fair tremor outcome categories. To allow valid comparisons of configurations of lesions with respect to cytoarchitectonic thalamic boundaries. the MR image obtained in each patient was nonlinearly deformed into a standardized MR imaging space, which included an integrated atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The volume and precise location of lesions associated with different clinical outcomes were compared using nonparametric statistical methods. Probabilistic maps of lesions in each tremor outcome category were generated and compared. Statistically significant differences in lesion location between excellent and good. and excellent and fair outcome categories were demonstrated. On average, lesions associated with excellent outcomes involved thalamic areas located more posteriorly than sites affected by lesions in the other two outcome groups. Subtraction analysis revealed that lesions correlated with excellent outcomes necessarily involved the interface of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (Vim; also known as the ventral lateral posterior nucleus [VLp]) and the nucleus ventrocaudalis (Vc: also known as the ventral posterior [VP] nucleus). Differences in lesion volume among outcome groups did not achieve statistical significance. Conclusions. Anatomical evaluation of lesions within a standardized MR image-atlas integrated reference space is a useful method for determining optimal lesion localization. The results of an analysis of probabilistic maps indicates that optimal relief of tremor is associated with lesions involving the Vim (VLp) and the anterior Vc (VP).

Increasing evidence suggests that acute hyperammonemia results in alterations of mitochondrial and cellular energy function resulting from ammonia-induced inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme (x-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and by activation of the NMDA receptor. Antagonists of this receptor and NOS inhibitors prevent acute ammonia-induced seizures and mortality and prevent acute ammonia-induced changes in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and cellular energy metabolism. Acute hyperammonemia also results in decreased activities of free radical scavenging enzymes and again, free radical formation due to ammonia exposure is prevented by either NMDA receptor antagonists or NOS inhibitors. Acute hyperammonemia also results in activation of "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptors and monoamine oxidase-B, enzymes which are localized on the mitochondrial membranes of astrocytes in the CNS. Activation of these receptors results in mitochondrial swelling and in increased degradation of monoamines, respectively. Alterations of mitochondrial function could contribute to the neuronal dysfunction characteristic of acute hyperammonemic syndromes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nine healthy volunteers were scanned while performing both types of movement at an early phase of learning and after a 1-h training period of a sequence of dorsiflexions and plantarflexions with the left foot. These experimental conditions were compared directly, as well as to a perceptual control condition. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow associated with physical execution of the sequence early in the learning process were observed bilaterally in the dorsal premotor cortex and cerebellum, as well as in the left inferior parietal lobule. After training, however, most of these brain regions were no longer significantly activated., suggesting that they are critical for establishing the cognitive strategies and motor routines involved in executing sequential foot movements. By contrast, after practice, an increased level of activity was seen bilaterally in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and striatum, as well as in the left rostral portion of the anterior cingulate and a different region of the inferior parietal lobule, suggesting that these structures play an important role in the development of a long lasting representation of the sequence. Finally, as predicted, a similar pattern of dynamic changes Was observed in both phases of learning during the motor imagery conditions. This last finding suggests that the cerebral plasticity occuring during the incremental acquisition of a motor sequence executed physically is reflected by the covert production of this skilled behavior using motor imagery.

This often leads to the performance of a number of costly investigations in the hope of finding an explanation or treatable cause for the neuropathy. The authors propose that by performing a thorough history and physical examination in conjunction with findings on electrodiagnostic studies, a rational and limited differential diagnosis may be generated so that a targeted and cost effective investigation may be performed.

III. Genetic relationships among commonly used assays of nociception and hypersensitivity	PAIN			English	Article						genetic correlation; strain difference; stimulus modality; hyperalgesia; allodynia	HEREDITARY SENSORY NEUROPATHY; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; BEE VENOM INJECTION; NEUROGENIC HYPERALGESIA; THERMAL HYPERALGESIA; FORMALIN TEST; MECHANICAL HYPERALGESIA; FAMILIAL DYSAUTONOMIA; CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; OPIOID RECEPTORS	We and others have previously demonstrated that nociception in the mouse is heritable. A genetic correlation analysis of 12 common measures of nociception among a common set of inbred strains revealed three major clusters (or 'types') of nociception in this species. In the present study, we re-evaluated the major types of nociception and their interrelatedness using ten additional assays of nociception and hypersensitivity, including: three thermal assays (tail withdrawal from 47.5degreesC water or -15degreesC ethanol; tail flick from radiant heat), two chemical assays of spontaneous nociception (bee venom test; capsaicin test) and their subsequent thermal hypersensitivity states (including contralateral hypersensitivity in the bee venom test), a mechanical nociceptive assay (tail-clip test), and a mechanical hypersensitivity assay (intrathecal dynorphin). Confirming our earlier findings, the results demonstrate distinct thermal and chemical nociceptive types. It is now clear that mechanical hypersensitivity and thermal hypersensitivity are genetically dissociable phenomena. Furthermore, we now see at least two distinct types of thermal hypersensitivity: afferent-dependent, featuring a preceding significant period of spontaneous nociceptive behavior associated with afferent neural activity, and non-afferent-dependent. In conclusion, our latest analysis suggests that there are at least five fundamental types of nociception and hypersensitivity: (1) baseline thermal nociception; (2) spontaneous responses to noxious chemical stimuli; (3) thermal hypersensitivity; (4) mechanical hypersensitivity; and (5) afferent input-dependent hypersensitivity.

Definitions and functionality analyses of the verifiers are given. The measurement of precision rate is used to assess the system reliability in a class-specific manner. Verification-enhanced systems are proposed with extensive experiments conducted on both isolated and touching numerals. Two databases for touching numerals are built/organized to serve as standard data sets. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement in system precision rates by the verification scheme, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed systems and justifies the important role of verifiers in OCR systems.

Five such equivalents are presently recognized. Their clinical features and relative frequency in ambulatory pediatric neurology practice have not been well documented. Utilizing a comprehensive, standardized computer database, the occurrence of these migraine equivalents in a single pediatric neurology practice together with their observed clinical features were documented over an 8-year period. Of a total of 5,848 patients in the database, of whom 1,106 were migraineurs, 108 patients (1.8% of total, 9.8% of migraineurs) were identified to have migraine equivalents. The following distribution among migraine equivalents was observed: benign paroxysmal torticollis 11 (10.2% of patients with migraine equivalents), benign paroxysmal vertigo 41 (38%), abdominal migraine/cyclical vomiting 20 (18.5%), acephalgic migraine 31 (28.7%), and acute confusional migraine 5 (4.6%). In each type, with the exception of benign paroxysmal torticollis and acute confusional migraine, females clearly predominated, and in all types a strong positive family history of migraine was elicited (68%-100%). There was variation in the age of onset of a particular equivalent with considerable overlap observed. Coexisting more typical migraines were observed in from 10% (benign paroxysmal torticollis) to 70% (abdominal migraines/cyclical vomiting) of the cases. In conclusion, pediatric migraine equivalents occur with relative frequency in ambulatory practice, possessing discrete clinical features that have a clear relationship to more typical migrainous phenomena.

Here we show that a period-doubling cascade and chaotic dynamics are also found in systems with two coupled delayed negative feedback loops.

Mechanisms triggering prostatic NE differentiation are poorly understood. Since dog and man naturally develop prostatic proliferative diseases with age, our objectives were to confirm the presence of NE cells in the dog prostate and test their hormonal regulation in both species. METHODS. Serotonin staining was examined by immunohistochemistry in 37 dog prostates: 17 from intact and 20 from castrated animals. In intact dogs, 9 prostates were normal and 8 hyperplastic. In the castrated group, 6 dogs were left untreated while androgens and estrogens were administered to 7 dogs, each. Human prostates were from 48 prostate cancer patients; half of them were submitted to androgen ablation prior to prostatectomy. The density of serotonin-positive NE cells was expressed relatively to the number of acini. RESULTS. Serotonin-positive NE cells were morphologically similar in dog and human prostates and identified in all groups, independent of the hormonal status. NE cell densities were within the same range in normal and hyperplastic dog prostates but significantly higher after castration, Androgens and estrogens after castration restored NE cell density to normal values and induced luminal differentiation and basal metaplasia, respectively. In human, the density of serotonin-positive NE cells was also significantly higher in benign glands after androgen ablation. CONCLUSIONS. The dog is a suitable animal model and mimics the human, since androgen ablation favored prostatic NE differentiation in both species. The down-regulation elicited by steroids suggests that the process may be reversible and hormonally-repressed. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The panicogenic agent CO2 has been shown to induce a delayed release of NASs in both brain and plasma of rats. In the present study, we measured NASs plasma levels in response to challenge with another panicogenic agent, pentagastrin, and assessed the effect of ethynil estradiol (EE) pretreatment. Methods: A double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled design with randomization of the order of a three day pretreatment of EE (50 mug/day) or placebo was used to assess the effect of a 30 mug iv bolus injection of pentagastrin on the release of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and dehydroepian-drosterone (DHEA) into plasma in 15 male PD patients and 10 male healthy volunteers (HV). Results: After pentagastrin challenge there was a significant release of DHEA and a trend for the release of ALLO. EE pretreatment did not affect the pentagastrin-induced panic response or NAS release. Conclusions: Pentagastrin induced release of NASs into plasma, the purpose of which remains to be determined.

Digital images were collected in May 1998 using a commercially available digital camera. The intensities of the three primary colors (red, green, and blue) were compared for each pixel of the images. The three intensities of a pixel remained unchanged when, in the pixel, the green intensity was greater than each of the other two; otherwise, the three intensities of the pixel were set to zero. Background objects, except plants, were thus removed from the images. The resulting pixel intensities of the modified images were used as the inputs for Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs were trained to distinguish corn from weeds, as well as to differentiate between weed species. The success rate for a single ANN in distinguishing a given weed species from corn was as high as 90%, and as high as 80% in distinguishing any of four weed species from. corn. Better success rates might be obtainable with more elaborate schemes for data input and/or structural improvements such as cascading. The image processing time for the ANNs was as short as 0.48 s per image, thus making it useful for real-time data processing and application of herbicides. The development of such ANNs for weed recognition could be useful in precision farming to guide site-specific herbicide application and ultimately reduce the total amount of herbicide applied as well as lowering the risk of pollution.

We propose a new algorithm for the construction of a tree-structured predictor for the event of interest, which uses a new approach for dealing with continuous predictors. The novelty is that the tree uses splits for continuous variables. This means that at each node an individual goes to the right branch with a certain probability, function of a predictor. The predictor as well as the particular shape of the function is chosen from the data by the proposed algorithm. We evaluate its performance on several real data sets, in particular comparing it with a standard tree-growing algorithm. We also present an analysis of a well-known data set, the Pima Indian diabetes data set, to illustrate the application of the method in biostatistics. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), a transmembrane protein that is a receptor for netrin-1, is implicated in mediating both responses. However, the mechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear. Here we report that Rho GTPases are required for embryonic spinal commissural axon outgrowth induced by netrin-1. Using N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, we found that both Rac1 and Cdc42 activities are required for DCC-induced neurite outgrowth. In contrast, down-regulation of RhoA and its effector Rho kinase stimulates the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, DCC was found to trigger actin reorganization through activation of Rac1 but not Cdc42 or RhoA. We detected that stimulation of DCC receptors with netrin-1 resulted in a 4-fold increase in Rac1 activation. These results implicate the small GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA as essential components that participate in signaling the response of axons to netrin-1 during neural development.

Although the correlation of MRI measures with clinical disability and outcome continues to be investigated, MRI measures are routinely used both in clinical practice and in MS research. In addition to its use as a diagnostic tool, MRI is used as a surrogate marker to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. A variety of MRI measures are used in drug development studies and have aided our understanding of the potential benefits and possible mechanisms of action of drug therapies. Advances in MRI techniques may further elucidate the pathology of MS, thus providing opportunities for new treatment strategies.

To unravel the peripheral basis for this cortical response, we determined the distribution of presumptive low-threshold mechnoreceptors innervating the distal finger pads of monkeys. Endings were reconstructed in immunolabeled serial sections imaged by epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. Although classically implicated as cutaneous stretch receptors, no Ruffini corpuscles were found in the glabrous skin. Ruffini-like endings were only detected at the base of the finger nails. Pacinian corpuscles were sparsely distributed in the deep dermis. Meissner corpuscles (MCs) in dermal papillary ridges had a comparably high density in the thumb, index, and fifth fingers. Each MC was innervated by several large-caliber axons. Within the limits of our reconstructions, some of these axons terminated in only one MC, whereas others innervated several MCs. Merkel endings covered about 80% of the base of the intermediate epidermal ridges that form the pattern of fingerprints. In some cases, the distal tip of a Merkel-related axon gave rise to a several terminal branches that supplied endings to tightly circumscribed (30-70 mum) clusters of Merkel cells. In other cases, the nodes of axons gave rise to en passant branches that formed extended chains of endings among Merkel cells spread over territories up to 300 mum long, Based on their relatively diffuse distributions, the axons that innervate multiple MCs or the axons with en passant Merkel terminations seem most suited to transduce tangential forces.

Activation of P2X(7) purinoceptors by ATP or 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl ATP (BzATP) induces the formation of cytolytic pores and provokes release of interleukin-1beta from immune cells. We investigated the actions of other endogenous nucleotides on recombinant and microglial P2X(7) receptors using electrophysiology, fluorescence imaging, and interleukin-1beta release measurement. We found that initial application of ADP or AMP to Xenopus oocytes expressing P2X(7) receptors was ineffective. However, when ADP and AMP, but not UTP or adenosine, were applied after a brief exposure to ATP or BzATP, they activated P2X(7) receptors in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, responses to ADP and AMP were also elicited after exposure to low concentrations of ATP and were recorded several minutes after removal of ATP from the extracellular medium. Whole-cell recordings from mouse microglial cells showed that significant responses to ADP and AMP were elicited only after ATP application. YO-PRO-1 dye uptake imaging revealed that, unlike ATP, prolonged application of ADP or AMP did not cause an opening of large cytolytic pores in mouse microglial cells. Finally, ADP and AMP stimulated the release of interleukin-1beta from ATP-primed mouse and human microglial cells. We conclude that selective sensitization of P2X(7) receptors to ADP and AMP requires priming with ATP. This novel property of P2X(7) leads to activation by ATP metabolites and proinflammatory cytokine release from microglia without cytotoxicity.

J	Khiabani, KT; Kerrigan, CL				Khiabani, KT; Kerrigan, CL			Presence and activity of nitric oxide synthase isoforms in ischemia-reperfusion-injured flaps	PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT RELAXATION; RELAXING FACTOR; SKIN FLAPS; ENDOGENOUS NITROVASODILATOR; MYOCUTANEOUS FLAPS; MOLECULAR-CLONING; PULMONARY-ARTERY; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MAST-CELLS; L-ARGININE	Nitric oxide is produced front the amino acid L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase, which has three known isoforms: (1) endothelial nitric oxide synthase and (2) brain nitric oxide synthase, both of which are constitutive nitric oxide synthase; and (3) inducible nitric oxide synthase. The authors' hypothesis is that after reperfusion injury, endothelial cell dysfunction leads to disruption of nitric oxide synthase-mediated nitric oxide production and that this may in part explain the deleterious effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury on tissue survival and blood reflow in flaps. An experiment was designed to study the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury on the bioactivity of all three isoforms on nitric oxide synthase. Buttock skin flaps and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps were elevated in eight pigs. Flaps on one side of the animal were randomized to receive 6 hours of arterial ischemia whereas flaps on the other side served as controls. At 6 hours of ischemia and at 1, 4 and 18 hours after reflow, tissue biopsy, specimens were obtained and were processed for both constitutive nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme activity on the basis of the L-citrulline assay. In addition, specimens were processed for Western blot analysis of the three isoforms. The authors' results revealed three key findings: first, there was a statistically significant (p<0.001) decrease in constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity of ischemia-reperfusion-injured flaps as compared with controls in both skin and muscle for all time intervals measured. Second, Western blot analyses of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and brain nitric oxide synthase showed a significant decrease in the signal intensity in ischemic and reperfused tissue as compared with controls. Third, the inducible nitric oxide synthase isoform's activity and protein remained undetectable in both tissue types for all time points measured. The authors' data demonstrated that following ischemia-reperfusion injury in the pig flap model there was a disruption of constitutive nitric oxide synthase expression and activity, which may lead to decreased nitric oxide production. The significant decrease in nitric oxide synthase activity found in the current study may partly explain the mechanism of tissue damage in flaps subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Knowledge of the kinetics of nitric oxide synthase activity under conditions of ischemia-reperfusion injury has important implications for the choice and timing of delivery of therapeutic agents whose goal is to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide in reperfused tissue.

We presently studied mechanisms by which PGE2 induces eNOS expression in cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (ECs). 16,16-Dimethyl PGE(2) and selective EP3 receptor agonist M&B28767 increased eNOS expression in ECs and the NO-dependent vasorelaxant responses induced by substance P on cerebral microvessels. These effects could be prevented by prostaglandin transporter blocker bromcresol green and actinomycin D. EP3 immunoreactivity was confirmed on plasma and perinuclear membrane of ECs. M&B28767 increased eNOS RNA expression in EC nuclei, and this effect was augmented by overexpression of EP3 receptors. M&B28767 also induced increased phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 and Akt, as well as changes in membrane potential revealed by the potentiometric fluorescent dye RH421, which were prevented by iberiotoxin; perinuclear K-Ca channels were detected, and their functionality corroborated by NS1619-induced Ca2+ signals and nuclear membrane potential changes. Moreover, pertussis toxin, Ca2+ chelator, and channel blockers EGTA, BAPTA, and SK&F96365, as well as K-Ca channel blocker iberiotoxin, protein-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and PD 98059, and NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate prevented M&B28767-induced increase in Ca2+ transients and/or eNOS expression in EC nuclei. We describe for the first time that PGE(2) through its access into cell by prostaglandin transporters induces eNOS expression by activating perinuclear EP3 receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, a process that depends on nuclear envelope K-Ca channels, protein kinases, and NF-kappaB; the roles for nuclear EP3 receptors seem different from those on plasma membrane.

Hyperphosphorylation causes loss of tau function, microtubule instability, and neurodegeneration. Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) has been implicated in the phosphorylation of tau in normal and Alzheimer's disease brain. The molecular mechanism of GSK3beta-tau interaction has not been clarified. In this study, we find that when microtubules are disassembled, microtubule-associated GSK3beta dissociates from microtubules. From a gel filtration column, the dissociated GSK3beta elutes as an similar to400-kDa complex. When fractions containing the similar to400-kDa complex are chromatographed through an anti-GSK3beta immunoaffinity column, tau co-elutes with GSK3beta. From fractions containing the similar to400-kDa complex, both tau and GSK3beta co-immunoprecipitate with each other. GSK3beta binds to nonphosphorylated tau, and the GSK3beta-binding region is located within the N-terminal projection domain of tau. In vitro, GSK3beta associates with microtubules only in the presence of tau. From brain extract, similar to6-fold more GSK3beta co-immunoprecipitates with tau than GSK3alpha. These data indicate that, in brain, GSK3beta is bound to tau within a similar to400-kDa microtubule-associated complex, and GSK3beta associates with microtubules via tau.

However, it is unknown whether routine screening for neuroblastoma reduces mortality due to this disease. Methods: Through their parents, we offered screening for neuroblastoma at three weeks and six months of age to all 476,654 children born in the province of Quebec, Canada, during a five-year period (May 1, 1989, through April 30, 1994). The participation rate was 92 percent. The rate of death due to neuroblastoma was determined and compared with the rates in several unscreened control populations born during the same period. Results: Among children younger than eight years of age in the Quebec cohort, there were 22 deaths due to neuroblastoma; the cumulative (+/-SE) mortality rate due to neuroblastoma was 4.78+/-1.14 per 100,000 children over a period of nine years. The standardized incidence ratios for death due to neuroblastoma for the Quebec cohort were 1.11 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.92) as compared with a control group in Ontario, Canada; 0.90 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.48 to 1.70) as compared with a control group in Minnesota; 1.40 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 2.41) as compared with a control group in Florida; and 0.96 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.66) as compared with a control group in the Greater Delaware Valley. The standardized mortality ratio for the Quebec cohort as compared with the rest of Canada was 1.39 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.85 to 2.30); the odds ratio for the comparison with a cohort born in Quebec before the screening program began was 0.98 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.54 to 1.77). Conclusions: Screening infants for neuroblastoma does not appear to reduce mortality due to this disease.

Here, we use ecologically relevant measures of cognitive ability, the reported incidence of behavioral innovation, social learning, and tool use, to show that brain size and cognitive capacity are indeed correlated. A comparative analysis of 533 instances of innovation, 445 observations of social learning, and 607 episodes of tool use established that social learning, innovation, and tool use frequencies are positively correlated with species' relative and absolute "executive" brain volumes, after controlling for phylogeny and research effort. Moreover, innovation and social learning frequencies covary across species, in conflict with the view that there is an evolutionary tradeoff between reliance on individual experience and social cues. These findings provide an empirical link between behavioral innovation, social learning capacities, and brain size in mammals. The ability to learn from others, invent new behaviors, and use tools may have played pivotal roles in primate brain evolution.

In this study we evaluated the presence and localization of tyrosine nitration in various ventilatory and limb muscles. We also assessed the contribution of the neuronal (nNOS), the endothelial (eNOS), and the inducible (iNOS) isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to tyrosine nitration in skeletal muscles both under normal conditions and in response to severe sepsis. In normal rats and mice, muscle tyrosine nitration was detected at 52, 48, 40, 30, 18, and 10 kD protein bands. Tyrosine nitration of the majority of these protein bands was significantly reduced within 7 h of in vivo NOS inhibition in rats. Diaphragmatic protein tyrosine nitration in mice deficient in the inducible NOS (iNOS(-/-)) averaged similar to 50% of that detected in wild-type (iNOS(+/+)) mice. Injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in rats produced a significant rise in protein tyrosine nitration in the mitochondria) and membrane fractions but not in the cytosol of ventilatory muscles. Absence of iNOS expression (iNOS(-/-)), but not nNOS (nNOS(-/-)) or eNOS (eNOS(-/-)), in genetically altered mice resulted in a significant reduction in LPS-mediated rise in diaphragmatic nitrotyrosine. We conclude that tyrosine nitration of proteins occurs in normal muscle fibers and is dependent mainly on the activity of the iNOS isoform. Sepsis-mediated increase in protein tyrosine nitration is limited to the mitochondria and cell membrane and is highly dependent on the activity of the iNOS but not the nNOS or eNOS isoforms.

To this end, rats received direct intraventral tegmental area infusion of alpha4 antisense via osmotic minipump, and their locomotor response to nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) was tested. Eight antisense ODNs were screened, but only one inhibited nicotine-induced locomotion. This inhibition was reversible and selective, insofar as basal (saline) activity was unaffected, and a mismatch ODN was without effect. However, antisense treatment also caused sequence-dependent toxic effects, including neuronal degeneration in the ventral tegmental area, dopaminergic denervation, and weight loss. We conclude that despite previous reports, PS-capped PE-ODNs can cause severe neurotoxicity on chronic infusion into brain tissue. Moreover, sequence dependence and temporal reversibility, two generally accepted criteria of antisense action, may sometimes reflect the occurrence of toxic effects and resultant functional compensation.

A completion, a reading, and a repetition task were administered. Results show that both patients were able to correctly inflect adjectives within compounds, but not in noun phrases. Moreover, they were sensitive to constituent order (noun-adjective vs adjective-noun) within noun phrases, but less so within compounds, These results suggest differential processing for compounds as compared to noun phrases: While the latter require standard morphosyntactic operations that are often impaired in aphasic patients, the former can be accessed as whole words at the lexical level.

Methods: Ten patients were randomized to receive fentanyl, propofol and nitrous oxide (60%) or fentanyl, thiopental, isoflurane (1.2% end-tidal concentration) and nitrous oxide (60%). To obtain good intubation conditions and maintain adequate muscle relaxation during surgery, patients received two bolus doses of rocuronium: 0.5 mg.kg(-1) (1.7 x ED95) at induction followed one hour later by 0.3 mg.kg(-1) (1 x ED95), Arterial blood samples were obtained over six hours after the second bolus dose. Plasma concentrations of rocuronium were measured using high pressure liquid chromatography. Muscle twitch tension was monitored by mechanomyography for the two doses, Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined. Results: No differences in rocuronium pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between both groups. After the second bolus, clinical duration was 20 +/- 6 min in the propofol group vs 39 +/- 8 min in the isoflurane group (P < 0.05). The effect compartment concentration corresponding to 50% block, EC50. was higher under propofol anesthesia: 1008 vs 595 mug.L-1 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Rocuronium body disposition is similar under stable propofol or isoflurane anesthesia. In contrast to isoflurane, propofol does not prolong the neuromuscular block. Therefore, the potentiating effect of isoflurane is of pharmacodynamic origin only, as explained by an increased sensitivity at the neuromuscular junction. In contrast with isoflurane anesthesia where the dose of rocuronium has to be decreased under stable conditions, no dose adjustment is required under propofol anesthesia.

Their effects are mediated through the activation of two G-protein-coupled receptors, denoted B-1 and B-2. Functional and binding studies suggested that B-1 and B-2 receptors are upregulated in the medulla and spinal cord of hypertensive and diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to localize and quantify kinin receptors in post-mortem human medulla obtained from normotensive, hypertensive, and diabetic subjects, using in vitro receptor autoradiography with the radioligands [I-125]HPP-HOE140 (B-2 receptor) and [I-125]HPP[des-Arg(10)]-HOE140 (B-1 receptor). Data showed specific binding sites for B-2 receptor (0.4-1.5 fmol/mg tissue) in 11 medullary nuclei from 4 control specimens (paratrigeminal > ambiguus > cuneate, gelatinous layer of the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus > caudal and interpolar spinal trigeminal, external cuneate, solitary tract > hypoglossal > gracile > inferior olivary nuclei). Increased density of B-2 receptor binding sites was observed in seven medullary nuclei of four hypertensive specimens (paratrigeminal > external cuneate > interpolar and caudal spinal trigeminal, gracile, inferior olivary > hypoglossal nuclei). B-2 receptor binding sites were seemingly increased in the same medullary nuclei of two diabetic specimens. Specific binding sites for B-1 receptor (1.05 and 1.36 fmol/mg tissue) were seen only in the inferior olivary nucleus in two out of the ten studied specimens. The present results support a putative role for kinins in the regulation of autonomic, nociceptive, and motor functions at the level of the human medulla. Evidence is also provided that B-2 receptors are upregulated in medullary cardiovascular centers of subjects afflicted of cardiovascular diseases.

Patients with GBM have a very poor survival rate, with an average life expectancy of <1 year. We asked whether we could identify a survival pathway in high-grade glioma and oligodendroglioma cells that when suppressed, would induce apoptosis of these tumor cells but not of normal human adult astrocytes. To identify these pathways, we selectively suppressed the activity of a number of proteins (Ras, Rac1, Akt1, RhoA, c-jun, and MEK1/2) hypothesized to play roles in cell survival. We found that suppression of Rac1, a small GTP-binding protein, inhibited survival and produced apoptosis in three human glioma cell lines (U87, U343, and U373). Serum induced the activity of Rac1 and the activity or phosphorylation state of p21-activated kinase 1 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), two intracellular targets of Rac1. Suppression of Rac1 also induced apoptosis in 19 of 21 short-term cultures of human primary cells from grades II and III oligodendroglioma and grade IV glioblastoma that varied in p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor vIII, MDM2, and p16/p19 mutational or amplification status. In contrast, inhibition of Rac1 activity did not induce apoptosis of normal primary human adult astrocytes. In both established glioma cell lines and primary glioma cells, apoptosis induced by the inhibition of Rac was partially rescued by activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, an activator of JNK, suggesting that JNK functions downstream of Rac1 in glioma cells. These results indicate that Rac1 regulates a major survival pathway in most glioma cells, and that suppression of Rac1 activity stimulates the death of virtually all glioma cells, regardless of their mutational status. Agents that suppress Rac1 activity may therefore be useful therapeutic treatments for malignant gliomas.

In humans, a reliable pattern of cerebral activity occurs during the subjective experience of pain. Activity within the anterior cingulate cortex and possibly in other classical limbic structures, appears to be closely related to the subjective experience of pain unpleasantness and may reflect the regulation of endogenous mechanisms of pain modulation.

Here we examined the evolution of rectal sensitivity and of gastrointestinal symptomatology in IBS patients over time, to verify if the clinical and biological parameters showed parallel behavior. Patients complaining of IBS, identified by Rome I criteria, were included in this study. The severity of the gastrointestinal (Gastrointestinal) symptoms was assessed by a gastrointestinal index. The pain threshold to rectal distension was measured by a barostat programmed for phasic ascending distensions. Both measures were obtained before and after treatment. Thirty-nine patients were followed while on a 10-week group psychotherapy (psy) program. Twelve patients were controlled after pharmacological treatment with amitriptyline (Ami) 10 mg hours for two weeks and then 25 mg hours for the following 4 weeks. Clinical improvement with symptom reduction was achieved in both patients groups. With psy, the Gastrointestinal index declined from an initial value of 78.4 +/- 4.8 to 65.5 +/- 4.5 at the end of treatment (P < 0.05). With Ami. the gastrointestinal index decreased from 91.6 +/- 5.6 to 61.8 +/- 9.1 (p < 0.01). The pain threshold to rectal distension increased from 27.7 +/- 1.0 to 33.7 +/- 1.9 mmHg (P < 0.01) after drug treatment, but remained unchanged (30.6 +/- 1.0 vs 30.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg) with psy. Evolution of the gastrointestinal index and rectal sensitivity were directly correlated (r = -0.71; P < 0.01) in Ami patients, but not in those treated with Psy (r = -0.001). In conclusion, visceral hypersensitivity appeared as a stable biological defect over a 10- to 12-week period during clinically-effective treatment with psychotherapy. Rectal pain threshold, however, seemed to be pharmacologically manipulatable in patients treated with Ami.

The learning framework consists of a quantization layer which uses generalized learning vector quantization (GLVQ) and an ensemble layer which uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). The proposed method is tested on public handwritten character data sets, which obtains a promising performance consistently. In contrast to other methods, the proposed method is especially suitable for a large-scale real-world classification problems although it is easily scaled to a small training set while preserving a good performance.

Mice infected with the gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium exhibit marked genetic differences in disease manifestation, and the wild-derived strain Mus musculus molossinus MOLF/Ei is extremely susceptible to S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The kinetics of bacterial proliferation within the liver and the spleen and histological examination of tissue sections have suggested that MOLF/Ei mice do not succumb to infection because of overwhelming bacterial growth in the reticuloendothelial organs or massive tissue necrosis, as observed in other Salmonella-susceptible strains. MOLF/Ei mice respond normally to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo and in vitro, as determined by the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and spleen cell mitogenesis. However, they have a unique cytokine profile in response to infection compared to that observed for other Salmonella-susceptible mice. There was increased expression of mRNA of the interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) and IL-1beta genes as the infection in the spleens and livers of MOLF/Ei mice progressed. Despite the fact that MOLE/Ei mice have the ability to respond to LPS and the fact that there are significant increases in IL-1alpha and IL-1beta mRNA, Nos2 in the spleen is not upregulated and nitrite production by spleen cells is reduced. At the central level, the inflammatory response is characterized by strong upregulation of the inhibitory factor kappa B alpha and Toll-like receptor 2 genes, two genes known to be regulated by LPS and IL-1 in the brain. The high levels of IL-1 expression in the spleens and livers of MOLF/Ei mice may have important implications for the activation of peripheral and central innate immune mechanisms.

MAP2 proteins contain a microtubule-binding domain (C-terminal) that promotes microtubule assembly and a poorly characterized domain, the projection domain (N-terminal), extending at the surface of microtubules. MAP2b differs from MAP2c by an additional sequence of 1372 amino acids in the projection domain. In this study, we examined the role of the projection domain in the protrusion of microtubules from the cell surface and the subsequent process formation in SO cells. In this system, MAP2b has a lower capacity to induce process formation than MAP2c. To investigate the role of the projection domain in this event, we expressed truncated forms of MAP2b and MAP2c that have partial or complete deletion of their projection domain in Sf9 cells. Our results indicate that process formation is induced by the microtubule-binding domain of these MAP2 proteins and is regulated by their projection domain. Furthermore, the microtubule-binding activity of MAP2b and MAP2c truncated forms as well as the structural properties of the microtubule bundles induced by them do not seem to be the only determinants that control the protrusion of microtubules from the cell surface in Sf9 cells. Rather, our data suggest that microtubule protrusion and process formation are regulated by intramolecular interactions between the projection domain and its microtubule-binding domain in MAP2b.

In this study, we assessed the VEMPs in subjects with normal auditory brainstem evoked responses, with no history of vestibular symptoms or neck and other skeletal muscle abnormalities. To this effect, 32 subjects (64 ears), after ethics committee approval, were exposed to 75, 150, and 300 clicks at 100 dB, and the responses were averaged. Electromyographic activity was recorded by applying surface electrodes over the sternocleiodomastoid muscle under the following three conditions: no muscle contraction/no clicks, muscle contraction/no clicks, and muscle contraction/clicks. Our findings suggest that electromyographic responses have to be obtained, during muscle contraction, first without and then with clicks.

J	Beaumont, E; Gardiner, P				Beaumont, E; Gardiner, P			Effects of daily spontaneous running on the electrophysiological properties of hindlimb motoneurones in rats	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							GASTROCNEMIUS MOTOR UNITS; MEDIAL GASTROCNEMIUS; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; PHYSIOLOGICAL-PROPERTIES; LATERAL GASTROCNEMIUS; SODIUM-CHANNELS; MUSCLE; CAT; EXERCISE; SOLEUS	No evidence currently exists that motoneurone adaptations in electrophysiological properties can result from changes in the chronic level of neuromuscular activity. We examined, in anaesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) rats, the properties of motoneurones with axons in the tibial nerve, from rats performing daily spontaneous running exercise for 12 weeks in exercise wheels ('runners') and from rats confined to plastic cages ('controls'). Motoneurones innervating the hindlimb via the tibial nerve were impaled with sharp glass microelectrodes, and the properties of resting membrane potential, spike threshold, rheobase, input resistance, and the amplitude and time-course of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) were measured. AHP half-decay time was used to separate motoneurones into 'fast' (AHP half-decay time < 20 ms) and 'slow' (AHP half-decay time greater than or equal to 20 ms), the proportions of which were not significantly different between controls (58% fast) and runners (65% fast). Two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA revealed differences between motoneurones of runners and controls which were confined to the 'slow' motoneurones. Specifically, runners had slow motoneurones with more negative resting membrane potentials and spike thresholds, larger rheobasic spike amplitudes, and larger amplitude AHPs compared to slow motoneurones of controls. These adaptations were not evident in comparing fast motoneurones from runners and controls. This is the first demonstration that physiological modifications in neuromuscular activity can influence basic motoneurone biophysical proper-ties. The results suggest that adaptations occur in the density, localization, and/or modulation of ionic membrane channels that control these properties. These changes might help offset the depolarization of spike threshold that occurs during rhythmic firing.

Dependent measures were N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho) and creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) metabolite peak area ratios relative to total H2O. As expected, thalamic grey matter contained higher NAA ratios than telencephalic voxels (containing white and grey matter) (p<.001). The thalamic Cr/H2O ratio was higher on the right, but the opposite asymmetry was observed for the temporal lobe (p<.05). Women had a higher left frontal NAA/H2O ratio than men, but men had a higher hypothalamic NAA/H2O ratio than women. Right-handers had a higher temporal lobe NAA/H2O ratio than left-handers, particularly in the left hemisphere. In addition, several significant 2- and 3-way interactions between writing hand preference, gender, and hemisphere were observed, but only in the frontal lobe.

Induction by NGF of resistance to apoptosis is primarily thought to be the result of its binding to its high-affinity receptor, TrkA. The low-affinity NGF receptor, p75, has long been thought merely to facilitate NGF binding to TrkA. However, we have previously shown that the binding of NGF to its low-affinity receptor, p75, protects neuroblastoma cells that do not express TrkA against apoptosis induced by enediyne chemotherapeutic agents. In cells that express both receptors, it is not clear what determines which receptor is responsible for the protective effect of NGF. We now show that, in enediyne-treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma transfectants with native levels of p75 and a low TrkA/p75 ratio (1/100), the anti-apoptotic effect of NGF requires binding to p75. In contrast, in transfectants with native levels of p75 and a high TrkA/p75 ratio (100/100), NGF treatment prevents enediyne-induced apoptosis by a mechanism independent of p75 binding. Treatment of low TrkA/p75 ratio cells with NGF results in activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA. Analogous treatment of high TrkA/p75 ratio cells results only in phosphorylation of TrkA even though nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling is not inactive and can be initiated by other ligands. The ratio of TrkA/p75 in cells that express both receptors probably contributes to the determination of which of the two known roles of p75 (i.e., TrkA independent or TrkA facilitatory) are responsible for NGF-mediated protection from enediyne-induced apoptosis.

Bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)-oxovanadate does not elicit dopamine secretion in PC12 cells. However. treatment of PC12 cells with 30 muM bpV[phen] for 20 min significantly enhances the secretion induced by the Ca2+-ionophore A23187. The effects appear to be irreversible, and strikingly different from the transient and suppressing effects of orthovanadate, which, like bpV[phen], is also a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Contrastingly, the short-lived peroxovanadates, formed in situ by the addition of hydrogen peroxide and orthovanadate. are relatively ineffective. The Ca2+ chelating agent EGTA abolishes bpV [phen]-enhanced dopamine release. The extracellular-regulated protein kinases (ERK) and synaptophysin, proteins implicated in exocytosis, are both tyrosine-phosphorylated by bpV[phen] in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with a maximal effect at 30 muM. Pre-treatment of cells with PD98059 significantly reduced dopamine release (P < 0.05). These results suggest that this peroxovanadium complex enhances dopamine exocytosis, at least in part, by ERK-mediated signaling pathway and synaptophysin-associated phosphatase(s), (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using magnetic resonance images obtained from 100 healthy young volunteers (50 women and 50 men), we measured the surface area of the anterior cingulate gyrus and related it to the scores on the Temperament and Character Inventory. Anatomical data revealed that hemispheric asymmetry in the anterior cingulate gyrus surface area was very common (83% of cases) and that a prominent right anterior cingulate was more frequent in women than in men. In the correlational analysis, surface measurements of the right anterior cingulate gyrus accounted fora 24% score variance in Harm Avoidance. Both women and men with larger right anterior cingulate described themselves as experiencing greater worry about possible problems, fearfulness in the face of uncertainty, shyness with strangers, and fatigability. Furthermore, women reported overall higher scores in Harm Avoidance than men; these gender differences were largely explained by gender differences in the right anterior cingulate area in a covariate analysis. Our observations suggest that a large right anterior cingulate is related to a temperamental disposition to fear and anticipatory worry in both genders and that a higher prevalence of these traits in women may be coupled with a greater expansion of this brain region.

NE caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in total inositol phosphate (IPt) formation. The magnitude of this response increased as oligodendrocytes matured and was accompanied with an increase in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (alpha(1)-AR) levels. To pharmacologically characterize the alpha(1)-AR subtype mediating PI hydrolysis in 12-day differentiated oligodendrocytes, various selective antagonists were used. Prazosin, the non-selective 1-AR antagonist, blocked NE-mediated IPt formation. Similarly, the alpha(1A)-AR selective competitive antagonists, 5-methyl urapidil (5-MU) and WB4104. were potent blockers of NE-mediated IPt formation. In contrast, the alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR antagonist. chloroethylclonidine and the alpha(1D)-AR antagonist, BMY 7378, had no effect. These result,, suggest that NE-induced PI hydrolysis in differentiated oligodendrocytes was mediated through the alpha(1A)-AR. Furthermore, this response was prevented by EGTA and CdCl2, suggesting a requirement for extracellular calcium. The presence of alpha(1)-AR subtypes in oligodendrocytes was confirmed by reverse transcriptase coupled polymerase chain reaction and by immunoprecipitation, with subtype specific antibodies. The results indicated that mRNA and protein for the alpha(1A)-,alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR subtypes were expressed. In conclusion, Our findings show that oligodendrocytes express all three alpha(1)-AR subtypes but that only the alpha(1A)-AR was involved in NE-mediated IP1 formation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Pedicle screws in the cervical spine remain uncommon until now. In view of improved biomechanical stability compared to lateral mass screws, pedicle screws could be used, especially for patients with poor bone quality or defects in the anterior column. Nevertheless, there are potential risks of iatrogenic damage to the spinal cord, nerve roots, or the vertebral artery related to both techniques of posterior cervical spine instrumentation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether C1/2 transarticular screws as well as transpedicular screws in C3 and C4 can be applied safely and with high accuracy using a computer-assisted surgery (CAS) system. C1/2 transarticular screws as well as transpedicular screws in the cervical spine can be applied safely and with high accuracy using a CAS system in vitro. Therefore, this technique may be used in the clinical setup due to improved accuracy and reduced radiation dose for the patient and medical staff. Nevertheless, to prevent iatrogenic damage, users should be aware of known sources of possible errors that cause inaccuracies. Small pedicles with a diameter below 4.0 mm may not be suitable for pedicle screws.

The specific genes responsible have begun to be identified, but only for thermal nociception. In order to facilitate the identification of polymorphic, pain-related genes with more clinical relevance, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies of the most common assay of inflammatory nociception, the formalin test. QTL mapping is a technique that exploits naturally occurring variability among inbred strains for the identification of genomic locations containing genes contributing to that variability. An F, intercross was constructed using inbred A/J and C57BL/6J mice as progenitors, strains previously shown to display resistance and sensitivity, respectively, to formalin-induced nociception. Following phenotypic testing (5% formalin, 25 mul intraplantar injection), mice were genotyped at 90 microsatellite markers spanning the genome. We provide evidence for two statistically significant formalin test QTLs - chromosomal regions whose inheritance is associated with trait variability - on distal mouse chromosomes 9 and 10. Identification of the genes underlying these QTLs may illuminate the basis of individual differences in inflammatory pain, and lead to novel analgesic treatment strategies.

In the acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) technique, subjects ingest a mixture of amino acids devoid of tryptophan. This results in a transient decline in tissue tryptophan and in brain serotonin. ATD can result in lower mood and increase in irritability or aggressive responding. The magnitude of the effect varies greatly depending on the susceptibility of the subject to lowered mood or aggressivity. Unlike ATD, tryptophan can be given chronically. Tryptophan is an antidepressant in mild to moderate depression and a small body of data suggests that it can also decrease aggression. Preliminary data indicate that tryptophan also increases dominant behavior during social interactions. Overall, studies manipulating tryptophan levels support the idea that low serotonin can predispose subjects to mood and impulse control disorders, Higher levels of serotonin may help to promote more constructive social interactions by decreasing aggression and increasing dominance.

In Experiment 1, virgin and lactating rats were treated intraperitoneally with either saline or 2DG (400 mg/kg) and their food intake was compared across the next 6 h. In Experiment 2, lactating and virgin rats were given saline or 2DG, sacrificed I h later, and their brains were processed for Fos-like immunocytochemistry (FLI), The average number of cells expressing Fos protein within different brain regions was compared among the different groups. Statistical analyses of the data from Experiment I show that 2DG produces an increase in food intake in virgin rats, but not in lactating rats. These data correlate with the results from Experiment 2, where 2DG treatment resulted in an increase in FLI within the caudal ventrolateral medulla (cVLM), the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SON) of cycling females. In lactating rats, however, 2DG failed to increase FLI in these regions. Together, these results show that the 2DG-induced food intake response is attenuated during lactation and this attenuation is reflected in the activation of neuronal groups that are thought to participate specifically in the food intake response to glucoprivation. Processes mediating this differential response are discussed in terms of the hormonal and metabolic changes that are characteristic of lactation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

It has already been shown that CS patients scored significantly lower than controls on several aspects of cognitive function (J. Int. Neuropsychol. Soc. 6 (2000) 20). In the present study, 13 subjects who presented with CS Were investigated one year after surgical treatment to determine the extent to which the effects of hypercortisolism on cognitive function are reversible. Subjects were evaluated with U battery of tasks, similar to the original battery of a year earlier and including tests of attention, visuospatial processing, memory, reasoning and verbal fluency. Except for one task of visual organization, the results showed little change in performance. suggesting that prolonged exposure to high levels of GC can cause long-lasting deleterious effects on cognitive function. The data suggest that correction of hypercortisolism is not necessarily correlated with short-term improvement in cognitive function. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the first study, we used a hormone replacement protocol in which we pharmacologically decreased cortisol levels by administration of metyrapone and then restored baseline cortisol levels by a subsequent hydrocortisone replacement treatment, Memory function was tested after each pharmacological manipulation. We observed that metyrapone treatment significantly impaired delayed recall, while hydrocortisone replacement restored performance at placebo level. In the second study, we took advantage of the circadian variation of circulating levels in cortisol and tested the impact of a bolus injection of 35 mg of hydrocortisone in the late afternoon. at a time of very low cortisol concentrations. In a previous study with young normal controls, we injected a similar dose of hydrocortisone in the morning, at the time of the circadian peak, and reported detrimental effects of GC on cognitive function. Here, when we injected a similar dose of hydrocortisone in the afternoon, at the time of the circadian trough, we observed positive effects of GC on memory function. The results of these two studies provide evidence that GC are necessary for learning and memory in human populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Only recently, however, have molecular and cellular advances revealed how changes in the external concentration of Na+ and osmolality are detected during acute and chronic osmotic perturbations. In rat vasopressin-containing neurons, local osmosensitivity is conferred by intrinsic stretch-in activated cation channels and by taurine release from surrounding glia. Na+ detection is accomplished by acute regulation of the permeability of stretch-inactivated channels and by changes in Na+ channel gene expression. These features provide a first glimpse of the integrative processes at work in a central osmoregulatory reflex.

Indiana matrix (M) protein mutants and the wild-type New Jersey strain persisted in the human neural cell line H4 for at least 120 days. The Indiana wild-type virus (HR) and a non-M mutant (TP6), both unable to persist, induced apoptosis more strongly than all the other variants tested, as indicated by higher levels of DNA fragmentation and caspase-3-like activity. Transfection of H4 cells with mRNA coding for the VSV M protein confirmed the importance of this protein in the induction of apoptosis, Furthermore, the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk maintained cell survival to about 80%, whereas inhibition of caspase-8, caspase-9, or both only partially protected the cells against death, consistent with the fact that anti-apoptotic molecules from the Bcl-2 family also protect cells from death only partially. These results suggest that VSV activates many pathways of cell death and that an inefficient induction of caspase-3-related apoptosis participates in the establishment of a persistent infection of human neural cells by less virulent VSV variants.

Among the major substrates of SKI-1 are the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, regulating cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. Other substrates include the stress response factor activating transcription factor-6, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the surface glycoproteins of highly infectious viruses belonging to the family of Arenaviridae. Domain deletion and/or point mutants were used to gauge the role of the various domains of SKI-1. Biosynthesis, cellular trafficking, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 cleavage activity were used as diagnostic tools. Results revealed that Arg(130) and Arg(134) are critical for the autocatalytic primary processing of the prosegment and for the subsequent efficient exit of SKI-1 from the endoplasmic reticulum. Functional mapping of the growth factor cytokine receptor motif suggested a folding role within the endoplasmic reticulum. Microsequencing of the remaining membrane-bound stub following ectodomain shedding of SKI-1 localized the shedding site to KHQKLL(953)down arrow. Site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro cleavage of a synthetic peptide containing the shedding site, and inhibitor studies favor an autocatalytic event occurring at a non-canonical SKI-1 recognition sequence, with P2 and P1 Leu being very critical. In conclusion, multiple domains ensuring optimal functional characteristics control SKI-1 activity and cellular trafficking.

To test for a functional protein, Flt-1 antibodies were used to probe immunoprecipitated tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. Western blotting revealed a major 170-180 kDa band and a few bands below 116 kDa in dog prostate and human prostatic carcinoma PC-3 cells. with higher levels in PC-3. Similar results were obtained with human placental membranes used as a source of Flt-1. That the major Flt-1 tyrosine phosphorylated protein was likely VEGF-RI and part of VEGF signaling pathways was shown by enhanced level of only this protein when PC-3 cells were exposed to VEGF. Accordingly specific cell surface receptor complexes, displaced by VEGF but not EGF and compatible with Flt-1 in size, were revealed by chemical cross-linking after 121 I-VEGF binding. Similarly to the prostatic neuroproduct, gastrin-releasing peptide,bombesin, VEGF directly triggered the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and stimulated PC-3 cell motility. The titration of prostate tissue sections with VEGF-A antibodies revealed a confined staining in chromogranin A and/or serotonin positive neuroendocrine (NE) cells, including in primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Given that NE differentiation is associated with advanced disease, that NE cells are a significant source of VEGF in prostatic tumors, and that VEGF directly act on prostate cancer cells in vitro, VEGF-A may be more than angiogenic in prostate cancer and hence favor progression by affecting tumor cells.

Cd content was evaluated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Maternal blood Cd concentration increased by 127 and 223% of control for I and 5 days of exposure. Maternal lung Cd concentration increased significantly by 11.66- and by 48.24-fold after I and 5 days of treatment, while maternal liver showed an increase of 188 and 227% for I and 5 days of exposure. Also, fetal Cd concentration significantly increased in brain (156 and 192%). liver (159 and 174%) and heart (201 and 157%) after 1 and 5 days of exposure, compared to unexposed females. Placental calcium content decreased significantly by 16% of control after 5 days of exposure. These results suggest that low-level inhalation of Cd may pass through the guinea pig placenta and accumulate in fetal brain, liver and heart. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Objective To examine the impact of recent changes in congenital anomaly-related fetal and infant deaths on overall population-based infant mortality. Design, Setting, and Subjects Birth cohort-based study of all live births, stillbirths, and infant deaths in Canada (excluding Ontario) for 1991-1998. Main Outcome Measures Cause-specific infant mortality rates and gestational age-specific fetal death rates. Results The birth cohort-based infant mortality rate fluctuated between 6.4 and 6.1 per 1000 live births between 1991 and 1995, then dropped to 5.4 per 1000 in 1996 and 5.5 per 1000 in 1997. The rate of infant death from congenital anomalies was stable between 1991 and 1995 but declined by 21% (95% confidence interval, 19%-32%) from 1.86 per 1000 in 1995 to 1.47 per 1000 in 1996 and 1997. Fetal deaths due to pregnancy termination at 20 to 23 weeks' gestation increased dramatically in 1994, while fetal deaths due to congenital anomalies at 20 to 21 weeks increased in 1995 and subsequently. Provinces/territories with high rates of fetal death due to pregnancy termination/congenital anomalies at 20 to 23 weeks had fewer infant deaths due to congenital anomalies. Conclusion A large decrease in infant deaths due to congenital anomalies was associated with the most recent decline in infant mortality in Canada, suggesting that increases in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination for congenital anomalies are related to decreases in overall infant mortality at the population level.

The focus of studies on the MAGE proteins has been on their potential for cancer immunotherapy, as a result of the finding that peptides derived from MAGE gene products are bound by major histocompatibility complexes and presented on the cell surface of cancer cells. However, the normal physiological role of MAGE proteins has remained a mystery. Recent studies are beginning to provide insights into MAGE gene function. Necdin acts as a cell cycle regulatory protein and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome, a neurogenetic disorder. MAGE-D1, identified as a binding partner for the p75 neurotrophin receptor, the apoptosis inhibitory protein XIAP, and Dlx/MSX homeodomain proteins, blocks cell cycle progression and enhances apoptosis. This review provides an overview of the human MAGE genes and proteins, summarizes recent findings on their cellular roles, and provides a baseline for future studies on this intriguing gene family.

Signal processing depends, in part, on neuronal membrane properties. Intrinsic membrane properties of lamina I neurons were therefore investigated using whole cell patch clamp recordings in a slice preparation of adult rat spinal cord. Based on responses to somatic current injection, four cell types were identified: tonic, which fire comparatively slowly but continuously throughout stimulation; phasic, which fire a high frequency burst of variable duration; delayed onset, which fire irregularly and with a marked delay to the first spike; and single spike, which typically fire only one action potential even when strongly depolarised. Classification by spiking pattern was further refined by identification of characteristic stimulus-response curves and quantification of several response parameters. Objectivity of the classification was confirmed by cluster analysis. Responses to stimulus trains and synaptic input as well as the kinetics of spontaneous synaptic events revealed differences in the signal processing characteristics of the cell types: tonic and delayed onset cells appeared to act predominantly as integrators whereas phasic and single spike cells acted as coincidence detectors. Intracellular labelling revealed a significant correlation between morphological and physiological cell types: tonic cells were typically fusiform, phasic cells were pyramidal, and delayed onset and single spike cells were multipolar. Thus, there are multiple physiological cells types in lamina I with specific morphological correlates and distinctive signal processing characteristics that confer significant differences in the transduction of input into spike trains.

In effect, up to one-third of the cells respond preferentially to small incongruities between the optimal bar stimuli presented within the receptive fields of each eye. The aim of the present study was to determine whether cells in area 19 are also sensitive to phase disparities. Both types of disparities have been proposed as mechanisms through which stereoperception is achieved. Results indicate that phase disparities produced coherent interactions in 38% of the binocular cells, resulting in facilitation or summation. The remaining cells were phase insensitive. The overall results suggest that cells in area 19 code phase disparities in a proportion comparable to stimulus disparities, confirming that this area is implicated in binocular integration, albeit in a relatively smaller proportion than some of the other visual areas.

Previous studies in our laboratory mapped the causative gene for this disease to a 6.5-Mb region in chromosomal region 9q31-33, flanked by D9S302 and D9S1850. We have now used additional families and a panel of 26 microsatellite markers to construct haplotypes. Twelve recombination events that reduced the size of the candidate region to 560 kb were identified or inferred. This region is flanked by D9S1126 and D9S737 and contains at least four genes. Exons of these genes were sequenced in one affected individual, and four sequence variations were identified. The families included in our study and 100 control individuals were tested for these variations. On the basis of our results, the mutation in the tripartite-motif-containing gene (TRIM32) that replaces aspartate with asparagine at position 487 appears to be the causative mutation of LGMD2H. All affected individuals were found to be homozygous for D487N, and this mutation was not found in any of the controls. This mutation occurs in an NHL (named after the proteins NCL1, HT2A, and LIN-41) domain at a position that is highly conserved. NHL domains are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Although the function of TRIM32 is unknown, current knowledge of the domain structure of this protein suggests that it may be an E3-ubiquitin ligase. If proven, this represents a new pathogenic mechanism leading to muscular dystrophy.

HSA was diagnosed in three unrelated autosomal dominant families from Newfoundland, who presented mainly with severe leg spasticity, dysarthria, dysphagia, and ocular-movement abnormalities. A genomewide scan was performed on one family, and linkage to a novel locus for HSA on chromosome 12p13, which contains the as-yet-unidentified gene locus SAX1, was identified. Fine mapping confirmed linkage in the two large families, and the third, smaller family showed LOD scores suggestive of linkage. Haplotype construction by use of 13 polymorphic markers revealed that all three families share a disease haplotype, which key recombinants and overlapping haplotypes refine to similar to5 cM, flanked by markers D12S93 and GATA151H05. SAX1 is the first locus mapped for autosomal dominant HSA.

This hypothesis has recently received empirical support in a study of avian species introduced to New Zealand, but it remains to be determined whether behavioural flexibility is a general mechanism influencing invasion success. In this study, we examined introduction success of 69 bird species in different regions of the world as a function of their degree of behavioural flexibility. Specifically, we predicted that species with relatively large brains and a high frequency of foraging innovations in their area of origin should show a higher probability of establishing themselves where they were introduced than species with small brains and low innovation frequencies. An analysis with general linear modelling (GLM) supported the prediction for relative brain size, even when controlling for phylogenetic biases and potential confounding variables. The only covariates that remained with relative brain size were plumage dimorphism, human commensalism and nest site. A pairwise comparison of closely related species also revealed that successful invaders showed a higher frequency of foraging innovations in their region of origin. This result held even when differences in research effort between species were considered. Overall, the results confirm and generalize the hypothesis that behavioural flexibility is a major determinant of invasion success in birds. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

J	Ansaldo, AI; Arguin, M; Lecours, AR				Ansaldo, AI; Arguin, M; Lecours, AR			Initial right hemisphere take-over and subsequent bilateral participation during recovery from aphasia	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article							LANGUAGE; IMAGEABILITY; RECOGNITION; ASYMMETRIES; PLASTICITY; STROKE	Background: In 1887, Gowers proposed that supplemental action by the right frontal cortex could sustain language following aphasia. Since then, many studies using a wide variety of experimental paradigms have examined the role of the right hemisphere in the recovery from aphasia. Aims: This study examines the right hemisphere's participation in the recovery from aphasia between four and sixteen months following brain damage. Methods & Procedures: RJ, a young woman with severe Broca's aphasia resulting from a left fronto-temporal hematoma, was followed up at four-month intervals with a divided visual field presentation lexical decision task (LDT). At each time of measurement, we examined her performance with high- and low-imageability nouns and verbs, directed to either cerebral hemisphere and in central vision. A language test was used to examine the pattern of language recovery over time, and a non-verbal version of the Stroop test (NVST) served to follow up changes in attention. The results obtained with the LDT and the NVST were analyzed with ANOVAs; the changes in the pattern of language recovery and the results on the attentional task were also considered in the analysis. Outcomes & Results: There was a left visual field advantage with high-imageability words, regardless of their grammatical class, at four months post stroke. The right hemisphere advantage extended to low-imageability words at eight months after aphasia onset. Concurrently, language comprehension tasks made a significant recovery, whereas language expression tasks recovered only slightly. Furthermore, there was no significant improvement on the attentional task within the same time period. One year after the stroke, RJ's pattern of lateralization changed; there was a marginally significant central vision advantage on word processing, and no significant difference in her performance on lateralized presentations. There was a remarkable recovery on oral expression tasks, and some improvement on the attentional task within the same period. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that recovery from aphasia may be sustained by both cerebral hemispheres. The participation of either hemisphere may vary with time elapsed. Our results suggest that high-imageability nouns and verbs may constitute a good target for speech therapy during the first months post stroke, in order to benefit from right hemisphere takeover capacities. Furthermore, low imageability nouns and verbs are candidates for right hemisphere takeover as well, if enough time is allowed. Finally, the results of this study suggest that right hemisphere involvement in language recovery may occur in the absence of a concurrent improvement of attention. In line with previous studies, our results indicate that the recovery of oral expression coincides with the improvement of left hemisphere function. Hence, the fact that language expression started to improve one year after the stroke suggests that recovery from a severe language expression deficit is a long process, and may require long-term follow-up.

Objectives: To assess the ability of lymphocytes derived from the peripheral blood of patients with clinically active and inactive MS to migrate across an artificial model of the blood-brain barrier and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in such a process. Design: We developed an in vitro model of lymphocyte migration using a Boyden chamber coated with a monolayer of human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Results: The rates of migration of lymphocytes obtained from patients with acutely relapsing and active secondary progressive MS was significantly increased compared with those obtained from healthy controls and patients with inactive secondary progressive disease. Ribonuclease protection assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicated that monocyte chemoattractant protein I and interleukin 8 were the major chemokines produced by brain endothelial cells grown under the culture conditions used for the migration assays. The rate of migration of the MS lymphocytes could be inhibited by 60% with an antimonocyte chemoattractant protein I monoclonal antibody, indicating a functional role for this chemokine in the migration process. In agreement with previous reports, we found that the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, also reduced migration of MS lymphocytes by 50%. Conclusions: The results demonstrate an increased migration rate of MS T lymphocytes across the brain endothelium barrier and that such migration is dependent on chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein I and on matrix metalloproteinases.

To date, the mitogenic activity of INGAP has been identified only in nonneural tissues. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a pentadecapeptide of INGAP (INGAP peptide), the biologically active portion of the native protein, in cultured dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants from C57BL/6 mice. The present study provides evidence that INGAP peptide acts as a mitogen in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and that it enhances neurite outgrowth from DRGs in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The neuritogenic action of INGAP peptide correlates with an increase in [H-3]thymidine incorporation (P < 0.0001) and mitochondrial activity (P < 0.001). Results from these studies suggest that INGAP peptide promotes Schwann cell proliferation in the DRG which releases trophic factors that promote neurite outgrowth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Here we report such investigations in a large family, known as the KE family, half the members of which are affected by a severe disorder of speech and language, which is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. The structural brain abnormalities associated with this disorder were investigated using two morphometric methods of MRI analysis. A voxel-based morphometric method was used to compare the amounts of grey matter in the brains of three groups of subjects: the affected members of the KE family, the unaffected members and a group of age-matched controls. This method revealed a number of mainly motor- and speech-related brain regions in which the affected family members had significantly different amounts of grey matter compared with the unaffected and control groups, who did not differ from each other. Several of these regions were abnormal bilaterally, including the caudate nucleus, which was of particular interest because this structure was also found to show functional abnormality in a related PET study. We performed a more detailed volumetric analysis of this structure. The results confirmed that the volume of this nucleus was reduced bilaterally in the affected family members compared with both the unaffected members and the group of age-matched controls. This reduction in volume was most evident in the superior portion of the nucleus. The volume of the caudate nucleus was significantly correlated with the performance of affected family members on a test of oral praxis, a test of non-word repetition and the coding subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. These results thus provide further evidence of a relationship between the abnormal development of this nucleus and the impairments in oromotor control and articulation reported in the KE family.

For patients, pictures were classified as a function of the individual's naming ability to determine whether naming deficits reflected a failure to access a picture's name or reflected a deterioration of its semantic representation. As expected, DAT patients had significantly poorer naming performance than controls. For successfully named pictures, robust RT and ERP priming effects were obtained in both groups. In DAT patients, priming for unnamed pictures was heterogeneous. The results are discussed in terms of current hypotheses of semantic memory deficits in DAT. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Ninety-six participants formed a longitudinal cohort for a first study and 314 participants formed a cross-sectional cohort for a second study. Participants of each study were split into two age groups according to the age at the time of the lesion: (1) before 7 years, (2) 7 years or more. Results showed a significantly different recovery profile as a function of age in the longitudinal study. Older participants manifested recovery on VIQ and PIQ, while younger participants presented stable profiles. The longitudinal and cross-sectional studies revealed differing recovery profiles as a function of age. Results are discussed in the context of the Kennard principle and with regard to the methodological approaches. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The lesions were documented radiologically. The CHI patients were compared to 12 normal controls with a neuropsychological test battery and a realistic simulation of complex multitask ADL (planning and preparing a meal). Though the CHI patients were significantly slow on one test and subject to interference on an attention test. they manifested no basic executive or memory deficit on the paper-pencil tests. However, the CHI patients manifested marked anomalies in the organization of behavior in the meal preparation task. While small sequences of actions were easily produced, large action sets could not be correctly executed. An outstanding difficulty in strategic planning and prospective memory, particularly time-based more than event-based, appears to be an important underpinning of the impairment of ADL observed in the CHI patients with frontal lobe lesions.

One proposal maintains that these individuals are impaired in the selective access of ambiguous word meanings, while the other argues that they are impaired in the process of contextual selection. In the present study, nonfluent aphasic patients and elderly control subjects participated in a semantic priming experiment, in which ambiguous words were presented in different biasing contexts at both a 0- and 750-ms ISI. At both ISIs, control subjects showed context-selective access, in that only contextually appropriate meanings were activated. In contrast, at the 0-ms ISI. the nonfluent aphasic patients showed activation of both meanings of the ambiguous word regardless of context. Only at the 750-ms ISI did they exhibit context-selective access. These results are consistent with the proposal that left hemisphere damage causing nonfluent aphasia results in an impairment in rapidly integrating lexical-semantic information into context.

All of them were assessed at age 5 years 9 months and instructed to listen passively to two different pure tones (1000 vs 1200 Hz; 20 vs 80%) counterbalanced between ears. Rarity was thus defined by specific ear by tone combinations. The temporal N100 showed a clear contralateral functional organization of the central auditory pathway, especially for the left ear, but without group difference. By contrast, in full-term controls but not in premature children, the central N200 was specifically increased over frontal leads to rare stimuli as compared to frequent. Premature children demonstrated a lack of brain response when more complex processing integrating different informations was required. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Facial and vocal exemplars of six target emotions were elicited from four male and four female encoders and then prejudged by 10 young decoders to establish the category membership of each item at an acceptable consensus level. Representative stimuli were then presented to 16 additional decoders to gather indices of how category membership and encoder gender influenced recognition accuracy of emotional meanings in each nonverbal channel, Initial findings pointed to greater facility in recognizing target emotions from facial than vocal stimuli overall and revealed significant accuracy differences among the six emotions in both the vocal and facial channels. The gender of the encoder portraying emotional expressions was also a significant factor in how well decoders recognized specific emotions (disgust, neutral), but only in the facial condition.

The current study examined how the processing of parts and their configurations may be affected in visual agnosia due to brain damage. Both a visual agnosic patient (AR) and healthy Control subjects performed a visual search task in which they had to discriminate between targets and distractors that varied according to whether they shared their parts and/or their configuration. The results show that AR's visual search rates are disproportionally slow when targets and distractors share the same configuration than when they have different configurations. AR is also found to be disproportionately slow in discriminating targets and distractors that share identical parts when the targets and distractors share the same configuration. With differently configured targets and distractors, AR shows no part sharing effect. For controls, in contrast, the part and configuration sharing effects occur independently of one another. It is concluded that AR's object recognition deficit arises from difficulties in discriminating objects that share their configuration, and from an abnormal dependency of part information processing upon object configuration.

Many more patients have been described since Mesulam's description was published (see Westbury & Bub, 1997, for a review). However, the published literature is both unsystematic and incomplete, making it difficult to place the findings into a coherent theoretical framework. In addition, little previous work (see Mesulam, 1987) has specifically attempted to specify the difference between PPA and dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), although the two disorders are easily confused since many language deficits can masquerade on early presentation as memory or cognitive deficits. In this paper, the linguistic deficits of 11 PPA patients are analyzed, and contrasted with the linguistic deficits of a group of 11 DAT patients. Patients in both groups were tested using an extensive battery of language tests, the Psycholinguistic Assessment of Language Battery (Caplan Bub, 1990; Caplan, 1992). We consider seven linguistic Symptom clusters that differentiate the two groups, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

We tested this hypothesis by analyzing fast arm pointing movements involving the trunk made to targets located within the reach of the arm. In the first experiment, subjects pointed to a motionless target and, in the second experiment, to a target moving synchronously with the trunk. Vision of the arm and targets was prevented before movement onset. Each experiment started after three to five training trials. In randomly selected trials of both experiments, an electromagnet device unexpectedly prevented the trunk motion. When the trunk was arrested, the hand trajectory and velocity profile remained invariant in an FR associated with the experimental room in the first or in an FR moving with the trunk in the second experiment. Substantial changes in the arm interjoint coordination in response to the trunk arrest were observed in the first but not in the second experiment. The results demonstrate the ability of the nervous system to rapidly adapt behavior at the joint level to transform motor performance from a spatial FR associated with the environment to one associated with the body. A theoretical framework is suggested in which FRs are considered as pre-existing neurophysiological structures permitting switching between different FRs and guiding multiple joints and muscles without redundancy problems.

This study investigated the acoustic signal characteristics and best recording site of phonomyography at the corrugator supercilii muscle and compared phonomyography with acceleromyography. Methods. In 12 patients (group 1), after induction of anaesthesia and insertion of a laryngeal mask, a microphone (frequency range 2.5 Hz to 10 kHz) was placed on six different areas on the forehead and the peak-to-peak response after single-twitch stimulation of the facial nerve was measured. The microphone was placed where the response was largest and mivacurium 0.2 mg kg(-1) was administered. Fast Fourier transformation was applied to all signals to determine peak frequencies and the power-frequency relationship at different stages of neuromuscular block, In an additional 15 patients (group 11), the same microphone and an acceleromyographic probe were placed above the middle portion of the left and right eyebrows respectively. Onset and offset of neuromuscular block were determined after mivacurium 0.2 mg kg(-1). Results. In all seven women and all five men in group 1, the best response was obtained just above the middle portion of the eyebrow. Peak frequency was 4.1 (SD 0.9) Hz without neuromuscular block and did not change significantly during onset and offset of neuromuscular block. Ninety per cent of the total signal power was below 40 Hz. In group 11, mean onset time and maximum effect measured were 104 (20) s and 76 (10)% respectively using acceleromyography and 134 (30) s and 92 (4)% using phonomyography (P<0.04). Mean time to reach 25, 75 and 90% of control was 9.5 (2.8), 14 (5.1) and 15.1 (5.3) min respectively using acceleromyography and 6.9 (2.8), 12.5 (5.9) and 13.6 (4.9) min using phonomyography (P<0.04). Bland-Altman testing revealed significant bias (precision) for onset time, maximum effect and time to reach 25% of control (acceleromyography minus phonomyography) at -30 (38) s, -16 (11)% and 2.6 (2.8) min respectively. Conclusions. Phonomyography can be used to determine neuromuscular block at the corrugator supercilii muscle. In comparison with acceleromyography, phonomyography tends to measure a longer onset with more pronounced maximum effect and shorter recovery of neuromuscular block.

There is evidence that lamina V pyramidal neurons, and their basilar dendrites in particular, are affected by age-related decline. furthermore, layer V is the area where the greatest overall age-related losses in the total population of synaptic boutons and of cholinergic boutons are observed. Since both pyramidal neurons and cortical cholinergic input are characteristically compromised in aging, we investigated whether aging altered the pattern of cholinergic boutons in apposition to the soma, proximal and distal basal dendrites of intracellularly labeled lamina V large pyramidal neurons in the parietal cortex of young and aged rats. We observed a significant age-related decrease in the population of both total and cholinergic boutons apposed to proximal and distal dendrites of layer V large pyramidal neurons. However, the age-related decreases of cholinergic presynaptic boutons were higher than those in the total bouton population apposed to the pyramidal neurons. The average decrease in cholinergic boutons in aged rats was 3.7-fold more pronounced than the diminution in the overall number of presynaptic boutons. Our results add important new evidence in support of the concept that the age-related learning and memory deficits are attributable, at least partially, to a decline in the functional integrity of the forebrain cholinergic systems.

Design: Prospective, experimental animal study. Setting. Laboratory at a university hospital. Subjects: Sprague-Dawley rats. Interventions: Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide or saline and were studied in groups at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hrs. Measurements and Main Results: Significant differences were seen between nitrate concentrations in the heart, lung, kidney, liver, brain, aorta, diaphragm, spleen, thymus, testis or ovary, hind limb muscle, intestine, adipose tissue, bone, bladder, urine and plasma, which imply a nitrate gradient between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Lipopolysaccharide significantly increased nitrate concentration at 12 hrs in most tissues and organs, except in the brain, adipose tissue, and muscle. It increased more in plasma than in tissues. The lipopolysaccharide dose-dependent nitrate concentration was observed only in the aorta and lungs. The nitrate concentration change was paralleled by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as indicated by alterations of myeloperoxidase activity and by impaired histologic and cellular membrane integrity in tissues and organs. Mean arterial pressure was negatively correlated with nitrate concentration modifications in the aorta during 24 hrs of endotoxemia. Conclusions. These results collectively indicate that overaccumulated nitric oxide-derived nitrate anion in tissues or organs in vivo contributes to endotoxic shock and multiple organ injury/dysfunction during endotoxemia.

Cysteamine (CSH) accelerates the appearance of this senescent glial phenotype in situ and in primary rat astroglial cultures. Porphyrins have been implicated as the source of orange-red autofluorescence in these glial inclusions. Yet, CSH has been shown to suppress porphyrin-heme biosynthesis in cultured astroglia. To determine whether porphyrin biosynthesis or sequestration participates in the biogenesis of these glial inclusions, the porphyrin precursor, H-3-delta-aminolevulinic acid (H-3-ALA) was administered to CSH-exposed and control rat astroglial cultures followed by light and electron microscopic autoradiography. Control cultures exhibited faint orange-red autofluorescence, intense H-3-ALA labeling, numerous normal mitochondria and few cytoplasmic inclusions. In these cells, H-3-ALA labeling largely occurred over normal mitochondria. The CSH-treated astroglia exhibited diminished H-3-ALA labeling and contained numerous orange-red autofluorescent inclusions. The latter manifested internal compartments delimited by double membranes characteristic of damaged mitochondria. The complement of normal mitochondria in the CSH-exposed cells was markedly reduced. In the CSH-treated cells, H-3-ALA labeling predominated over the large multi-compartmental inclusions. CSH attenuates de novo porphyrin-heme biosynthesis in astroglia but may induce punctate orange-red autofluorescence in the cytoplasm of these cells by promoting large numbers of damaged, porphyrin-containing mitochondria to form tight aggregates within the nascent gliosomes.

The purpose of this study was to provide a quantitative review of previous studies on this issue. Methods: Based on conventional meta-analytic procedures, we identified 33 studies that assessed verbal and nonverbal memory performance before and after anterior temporal lobectomy. The Logical Memory and Visual Reproduction subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale were used. These studies were then subjected to two levels of analyses: (a) vote-counting procedure, and (b) effect-size calculations and comparisons. Results: Overall, the data confirmed previous findings that verbal memory tasks are sensitive to left hemisphere dysfunction. The efficacy of a "nonverbal" task for tapping function in the nondominant (right) hemisphere was not confirmed, although a trend supporting this speculation was observed. With regard to the comparison of changes in verbal and nonverbal memory before and after resection from a temporal lobe, a clear trend was observed for decline in verbal memory function after resection from the left, especially significant for immediate verbal recall. A trend for contralateral improvement on nonverbal memory also was observed. The pattern of memory change after resection from the right temporal lobe was less clear. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that side of epileptic seizure and surgical resection from a temporal lobe affect verbal memory functions. The relations between the laterality of epileptic seizure, surgical resection from the temporal lobe, and nonverbal memory are to be verified by further research.

However, the mechanisms by which such lesions affect motor control are not fully understood. Direct effects of the lesion may be partly compensated by both the system's redundancy and its plasticity. Indeed stroke patients with limited arm movement can reach objects placed within the reach of the arm by using a compensatory strategy involving trunk recruitment. A similar strategy is observed in healthy individuals reaching for objects placed beyond the reach of the arm. Determining the control mechanism(s) governing this compensatory strategy in stroke patients was the goal of this study. Kinematics of reaching movements in hemiparetic and healthy participants to targets placed within and beyond the length of the arm were analysed. Targets were placed sagittally in front of the midline of the body. Two targets (targets I and 2) were within reaching distance defined as the length of the stretched arm from axilla to wrist crease. Two others were beyond arm's reach so that one required a forward trunk inclination (target 3) and the other required body raising to a semi-standing position (target 4). Healthy participants used minimal trunk displacement for reaches to targets 1 and 2. For reaches to targets 3 and 4, trunk displacement increased with target distance. Whenever the trunk was involved, there was a stereotyped sequential recruitment of the arm and trunk in that the trunk began moving simultaneously with or before the hand and stopped moving after the end of hand movement. This suggested that the control system predicts that the trunk movement will be needed to extend the reach and includes the trunk, in an anticipatory way, into the reach. In contrast, most hemiparetic participants recruited their trunk for reaches to all four targets, even those placed close to the body. Similar to healthy individuals, the sequence of hand and trunk recruitment was stereotyped, suggesting that temporal planning aspects of the motor program underlying movement coordination were relatively unaffected. In contrast to healthy participants, the contribution of the trunk movement to the endpoint displacement was substantially higher in the hemiparetic group and occurred earlier in the reach. It is suggested that the target distance at which the trunk is integrated into the movement to extend the reach of the arm is attained around the limit of arm extension and that this limit is reduced in hemiparetic individuals.

As shown here, ammonia induces protein tyrosine nitration in cultured rat astrocytes, which is sensitive to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801. A similar pattern of nitrated proteins is produced by NMDA. Ammonia-induced tyrosine nitration depends on a rise in [Ca2+](i), IkappaB degradation, and NO synthase (iNOS) induction, which are prevented by MK-801 and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Moreover, the increase in tyrosine nitration is blunted by L-NMMA, 1400W, uric acid, Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase/catalase treatment, and methionine-sulfoximine, which indicate the involvement of reactive nitrogen intermediates and intracellular glutamine accumulation. Such reactive nitrogen intermediates additionally mediate ammonia-induced phosphorylation of the MAP-kinases Erk-1/Erk-2 and p38(MAPK). Among the proteins, which are tyrosine-nitrated by ammonia, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, Erk-1, and glutamine synthetase are identified. Ammonia-induced nitration of glutamine synthetase is associated with a loss of enzymatic activity. Astroglial protein tyrosine nitration is found in brains from rats after acute ammonia-intoxication or after portacaval anastomosis, indicating the in vivo relevance of the present findings. The production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and protein tyrosine nitration may alter astrocyte function and contribute to ammonia neurotoxicity.

In several experimental models of cardiac overload, however, BNP mRNA and plasma BNP peptide levels are normal, despite the persistent increase in blood pressure and ventricular hypertrophy. In this study, the role of transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of BNP gene expression were studied in angiotensin (Ang) II-induced hypertension by injecting DNA constructs containing the BNP promoter (-2200 to 75 bp of the transcriptional start site) linked to luciferase reporter into rat myocardium. Ang II was administered to conscious rats via intravenous infusion for 2 hours or by subcutaneous minipumps for 6 hours, 12 hours, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. Ang II increased blood pressure and cardiac mass and induced changes in diastolic function. The left ventricular BNP mRNA levels increased 2.2-fold (P < 0.001) at 2 hours and peaked at 12 hours (5.2-fold, P < 0.001). Thereafter, BNP mRNA levels decreased (1.8-fold induction at 3 days, P < 0.05) and returned to control levels at I week, despite persistent hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy. Left ventricular BNP peptide concentrations followed the changes in BNP mRNA levels. The BNP promoter was activated 2.7-fold (P < 0.05) at 2 hours and remained upregulated up to 2 weeks (2.8-fold, P < 0.05) during Ang II infusion, except at 12 hours. These results indicate that posttranscriptional control plays a major role in the regulation of ventricular BNP gene expression in Ang II-induced hypertension.

In the present study we used the olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) animal model of depression to assess the effects of the sigma(1) ligand igmesine on OBX-induced behaviour. Behavioural experiments demonstrated OBX (saline-treated) rats to have increased dizocilpine-induced behavioural modifications, including locomotor and circling activity as compared to Sham rats (saline-treated). A short-term (7 d) treatment with low doses of igmesine (50-200 mug/kg. d s.c.) had no effect on dizocilpine-induced behaviour while long-term treatments (14 d) with low doses of igmesine reversed the effect of the bulbectomy such that the treated 013X rats' behaviour was not significantly different from Sham-saline rats. Short-term treatments with high doses of igmesine (500-1000 mug/kg. d) also reversed the increased locomotor and circling behaviour seen in OBX rats (saline-treated) while long-term treatments with the same high doses did not. These results provide behavioural evidence for sigma ligand's potential to reverse some OBX-induced behaviours. Moreover, they support the notion of a bell-shaped dose-response curve previously reported for a ligands.

This was a nested case-control study set in community settings in Bordeaux area, France. The participants were a representative sample of 3,777 elderly persons (65 years of age and older) followed from 1989 to 1997. The main outcome measures were the use of benzodiazepines in incident cases of dementia versus nondemented controls. On the basis of medical and psychological data, 150 patients were diagnosed with dementia according to the criteria of the third revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Information on benzodiazepine use was obtained by face-to-face interview and visual assessment of patient's medicine chest by a trained neuropsychologist. After controlling for age, gender, education level, living alone, wine consumption, psychiatric history, and depressive symptomatology, ever use of benzodiazepines, was associated with a significantly increased risk of dementia [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.7 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.4]. Former use was associated with a significantly increased risk of dementia (adjusted OR. 2.3, 95% CI, 1.2-4.5). No association was found between dementia and the current use of benzodiazepines (adjusted OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.6). Our finding suggest that former use of benzodiazepines could be a risk factor for dementia, but more detailed investigation a-re needed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

During development, Id2 antagonizes differentiation mediated by the retinoblastoma protein, probably by scavenging downstream E-box basic helix-loop-helix proteins. Here, using differential display RT-PCR, we identify Id2 as an induced gene during serum and potassium deprivation-induced apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons. Consistent with a biological role for induced Id2 messenger RNA and protein expression in neuronal cell death, expression of Id2 antisense RNA, or targeted deletion of the Id2 gene in neurons from Id2 knockout mice, protect from apoptosis. Further, gene transfermediated overexpression of Id2 induces neuronal cell death both in high potassium and low potassium conditions. Thus, the present study defines a role for Id2 in the modulation of neuronal apoptosis.

In the acute treatment study, TFMPP (10 mg/kg) and CGS12066B (5 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 30 min before an alpha-MTrp injection. In an acute study TFMPP reduced overall brain 5-HT synthesis, in the dorsal and median raphe, and in almost all of their projection areas, with the exception of the parietal, sensory-motor, and frontal cortices, the accumbens nucleus, and the caudate. Acute CGS12066B treatment did not have overall significant effect, but the rates did decrease in the cell body areas of 5-HT neurons. In a 7-day treatment with TFMPP (10 mg/kg/day) or CGS12066B (5 mg/kg/day), the 5-HT synthesis rates (24 h after last dose) decrease, with both compounds, in almost all of the nerve terminal structures. TFMPP reduced the synthesis in the dorsal and median raphe, while CGS12066B reduced it only in the dorsal raphe. This data suggests that after a 7-day treatment with TFMPP and CGS12066B, the rate of 5-HT synthesis in the dorsal raphe is restored and is reduced in many projection areas. The observed effects in the 7-day treatment could also be related to actions through the postsynaptic 5-HT1B sites and/or other 5-HT receptors since this compounds have limited selectivity.

NGF rapidly induced the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in PC12 cells. This effect is mediated by high-affinity TrkA receptor as nerve growth factor (NGF) induced the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 only in TrkA expressing cells and not p75-expressing cells. Additional experiments with various kinase inhibitors, the transient expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative Akt, and in vitro kinase assay revealed that phosphatidylinositol-3 (Ptdlns3)/Akt kinase mediated the actions of NGF. Similar data were obtained for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in primary cortical cultured neurons. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the phosphorylation of the Forkhead family of transcription factors can be modulated by neurotrophins via Trk receptors and PtdIns3k/Akt kinase (but not MAP or S6p70 kinases) in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Moreover, survival assays with the PtdIns3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, active and dominant-negative forms of Akt indicate that the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 plays a role in neurotrophins-mediated cell survival.

The clinical results reported in patients who receive transplants have been limited and do not justify the use of neural transplantation as a routine therapeutic procedure for PD. Identifying the optimal target for transplantation may be one of the critical factors for optimizing clinical outcomes. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that simultaneous intrastriatal and intranigral grafts (double grafts) may produce a more complete functional recovery. The authors report the clinical and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning results in three patients enrolled in a safety and feasibility pilot study who received double grafts and who have been followed for up to 13 months posttransplantation. Patients included in the study had idiopathic PD. All patients underwent detailed assessments before and after surgery, in accordance with the Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantation. The patients received implants of fetal mesencephalic cell suspensions in the putamen and substantia nigra (SN) bilaterally. There were no intraoperative or perioperative complications. Follow-up PET scans demonstrated an increase in the mean fluorodopa uptake constant values in the putamen and SN 12 months postsurgery. Improvements were also noted in the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr, Schwab and England, and pronation/supination scores after transplantation. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of reinnervating the SN and striatum by using a double transplant strategy in humans.

Patients and Methods: Children with B-precursor ALL who did not achieve initial remission after 4 or 6 weeks of standard three or four-drug induction chemotherapy were entered on study. Therapy consisted of three doses at weekly intervals of methotrexate 1,000 mg/m(2) over 24 hours followed by 6-mercaptopurine 1,000 mg/m2 over 8 hours 20 minutes. Patients achieving a partial remission could receive two additional weekly courses of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. Initially, patients received weekly intrathecal chemotherapy, but the study was amended to include intrathecal therapy only at week 1. Results: Nineteen patients were entered on study. All were evaluable for toxicity and response. There were seven complete remissions, four partial remissions, six patients with no response. and two children with progressive disease, for an overall complete remission rate of 37%. One patient was removed from the study after the second course of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine because of renal failure. Two patients had neurologic toxicity resulting in a study amendment. No patients subsequently experienced neurologic toxicity. Conclusions: Intermediate-dose intravenous methotrexate and intravenous 6-mercaptopurine can induce remission in some patients with ALL who experience initial induction failure. Features predicting complete remission, however, could not be identified.

The main role of the thalamus is to relay these sensory inputs to the neocortex according to the regulations dictated by behavioural state. Intracellular recordings in urethane-anaesthetized rats show that whisker stimulation evokes EPSP-IPSP sequences in thalamic neurons. Both EPSPs and IPSPs depress with repetitive whisker stimulation at frequencies above 2 Hz. Single-unit recordings reveal that during quiescent states thalamic responses to repetitive whisker stimulation are suppressed at frequencies above 2 Hz, so that only low-frequency sensory stimulation is relayed to the neocortex. In contrast, during activated states, induced by stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation or application of acetylcholine in the thalamus, high-frequency whisker stimulation at up to 40 Hz is relayed to the neocortex. Sensory suppression is caused by the depression of lemniscal EPSPs in relatively hyperpolarized thalamocortical neurons. Sensory suppression is abolished during activated states because thalamocortical neurons depolarize and the depressed lemniscal EPSPs are able to reach firing threshold. Strong IPSPs may also contribute to sensory suppression by hyperpolarizing thalamocortical neurons, but during activated states IPSPs are strongly reduced altogether. The results indicate that the synaptic depression of lemniscal EPSPs and the level of depolarization of thalamocortical neurons work together in thalamic primary sensory pathways to suppress high-frequency sensory inputs during non-activated (quiescent) states while permitting the faithful relay of high-frequency sensory information during activated (processing) states.

To test these hypotheses, we were fortunate to be able to study the interesting and rare case of a woman with schizophrenia who experienced continuous AVH which disappeared when she listened to loud external speech. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure the patient's brain activity in the temporal and inferior frontal regions during the AVHs and while the she was listening to external speech. The brain activity of a matched control subject was also recorded under the same experimental conditions. AVHs were associated with increased metabolic activity in the left primary auditory cortex and the right middle temporal gyrus. Our results suggest a possible interaction between these areas during AVHs and also that the hypotheses of defective internal monitoring and aberrant activation are not mutually exclusive. Potential limitations to the generalization of our results are discussed.

It has been suggested that increased variability may be a specific attribute of frontal lobe pathology. This hypothesis was tested in 2 matched groups of demented subjects, 8 with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), 5 with frontal lobe dementia (FLD), compared with 10 elderly normal controls (ENC). A Stroop test and Reaction Time measures were administered weekly for 5 weeks to all subjects. Both measures contained three subtests varying in degree of complexity. The results from the Stroop task indicated that the FLD group showed significantly greater variability on measures of consistency (fluctuations over time) and diversity (between participant variability) regardless of the complexity of the subtest. For the Reaction Time Subtests, measures of consistency and diversity showed significantly greater variability in FLD, but were affected in a different pattern. Greater variability in terms of consistency of performance was manifested only in the more attentionally demanding of the Reaction Time subtests (Choice Reaction Time, CRT). On the measure of diversity, variable performance was found to be greater on the Simple Reaction Time (SRT) subtest than on the more effortful CRT. Dispersion (within participant variability) was only assessed on the reaction time subtests. The results indicate no significant evidence for an increase in dispersion for the FLD patients. The hypothesis that variability will be increased in frontal lobe dementia is thus confirmed, and the independence of the three forms of variability measurement is demonstrated in dementia subjects.

Rats also show an exploratory preference for objects in locations where they have not previously encountered objects (an index of place memory) and for familiar objects in contexts different from those in which the objects were originally encountered (an index of context memory). In this experiment, rats with cytotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation were tested on all three versions of the novelty-preference paradigm, with a 5-min retention interval between the familiarization and test phases. Rats with sham lesions displayed a novelty preference on all three trial types, whereas the rats with hippocampal lesions displayed a novelty preference on Object trials but did not discriminate between the objects on Place trials or Context trials. The findings indicate that hippocampal damage impairs memory for contextual or spatial aspects of an experience, whereas memory for objects that were part of the same experience are left relatively intact.

To obtain the information required to train and test the NN, an animal model of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) was developed, and nine pigs were investigated. During the experiments, the electrocardiogram, phonocardiogram and PAP were recorded. Subsequently, between 15 and 50 S2 heartsounds were isolated for each PAP stage and for each animal studied, A Coiflet wavelet decomposition and a pseudo smoothed Wigner-Ville distribution were used to extract features from the S2 sounds and train a one-hidden-layer NN using two-thirds of the data. The NN performance was tested on the remaining one-third of the data. NN estimates of the systolic and mean PAPs were obtained for each S2 and then ensemble averaged over the 15-50 S2 sounds selected for each PAP stage. The standard errors between the mean and systolic PAPs estimated by the NN and those measured with a catheter were 6.0 mmHg and 8.4 mmHg, respectively, and the correlation coefficients were 0.89 and 0.86, respectively. The classification accuracy, using 23 mmHg mean PAP and 30 mmHg systolic PAP thresholds between normal PAP and PHT, was 97% and 91%, respectively.

This study was undertaken to assess PTBR expression in relation to the presence of hippocampal sclerosis in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). For this purpose, hippocampal CA1 subfields were dissected from surgical samples from patients with therapy-refractive TLE with (n = 5) or without (n = 2) hippocampal sclerosis and from age-matched nonepileptic postmortem controls (n = 5). PTBR expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Receptor sites were evaluated using an in vitro binding assay and the selective PTBR ligand [H-3]PK11195. Epileptic patients with hippocampal sclerosis showed increases in PTBR binding sites, immunoreactivity, and mRNA expression compared to both nonsclerotic TLE patients and postmortem nonepileptic controls. Induction of PTBR expression and binding sites were directly correlated with the presence of hippocampal sclerosis and the accompanying reactive gliosis.

In particular, genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins are influenced by the thyroidal status. Thyroid hormone is involved in the normal downregulation of the Tall alpha-tubulin gene during postnatal growth. The action of T3 on Talpha1 tubulin expression is complex and is exerted at least at two levels. In cultured cells, T3 induces a transient and fast decrease of Tall mRNA concentration. This effect is enhanced when transcription is blocked by actinomycin D, suggesting that T3 increases mRNA degradation. In transgenic animals T3 affects the expression of beta-galactosidase under control of the Talpha1 promoter in the same way as the en, dogenous gene, supporting an effect mediated through the Talpha1 promoter. However, the Talpha1 promoter is not regulated by T3 in transfected cells and, therefore, the effects of the hormone in vivo are likely to be indirect. It is concluded that regulation of Tal alpha-tubulin by thyroid hormone is the result of multiple influences including effects on mRNA half life and indirect effects at the promoter level.

These peptide products have been implicated in diverse biological functions, including analgesia. We have cloned a newly identified family of 'orphan' G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and demonstrate that BAM22 and a number of its fragments bind to and activate these receptors with nanomolar affinities. This family of GPCRs is uniquely localized in the human and rat small sensory neuron, and we called this family the sensory neuron-specific G protein-coupled receptors (SNSRs). Receptors of the SNSR family are distinct from the traditional opioid receptors in their insensitivity to the classical opioid antagonist naloxone and poor activation by opioid ligands. The unique localization of SNSRs and their activation by proenkephalin A peptide fragments indicate a possible function for SNSRs in sensory neuron regulation and in the modulation of nociception.

Emerging evidence indicates that this highly organized response also takes place in the central nervous system. Through the recognition of neuronal fingerprints, the long-term induction of the innate immune response and its transition to an adaptive form might be central to the pathophysiology and aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Paradoxically, this response also protects neurons by favouring remyelination and trophic support afforded by glial cells.

Each system consists of a series of interconnected neural structures. The "central structures" of the three systems described are the hippocampus, the matrix compartment of the dorsal striatum (caudate-putamen), and the amygdala. Information, coded as neural signals, flows independently through each system. All systems have access to the same information from situations in which learning occurs, but each system is specialized to represent a different kind of relationship among the elements (stimulus events, responses, reinforcers) of the information that flows through it. The speed and accuracy with which a system forms a coherent representation of a learning situation depend on the correspondence between the specialization of the system and the relationship among the elements of the situation. The coherence of these stored representations determines the degree of control exerted by each system on behavior in the situation. Although they process information independently the systems interact in at least two ways: by simultaneous parallel influence on behavioral output and by directly influencing each other. These interactions can be cooperative (leading to similar behaviors) or competitive (leading to different behaviors). Experimental findings consistent with these ideas, mostly from experiments with rats, are reviewed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

J	Holahan, MR; White, NM				Holahan, MR; White, NM			Conditioned memory modulation, freezing, and avoidance as measures of amygdala-mediated conditioned fear	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article							POTENTIATED STARTLE PARADIGM; POST-TRAINING EPINEPHRINE; NMDA-INDUCED LESIONS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; CONTEXTUAL FEAR; TEMPORAL GRADIENT; RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; IMPAIR PERFORMANCE; CENTRAL NUCLEUS; RATS	Three conditioned aversive responses were used to infer the existence of an unobservable central state of "conditioned fear," and the roles of certain amygdala Subregions in producing these responses were investigated. Rats received tone-shock pairings in one compartment of a shuttle box and no tones or shocks in the other, distinctive, compartment. They were then trained to find food in one arm of a Y-maze. After the Final training trial they were exposed to different sets of stimuli in the shuttle box with no shock. Twenty-four hours later rats that had received immediate posttraining exposure to the conditioned stimuli (in the shock-paired compartment) made significantly more correct responses on the Y-maze than rats that had been exposed to the neutral stimuli (in the no-shock compartment) or rats that had received delayed posttraining exposure to the conditioned stimuli. This constitutes a demonstration of posttraining memory modulation by conditioned aversive stimuli. Freezing increased during posttraining exposure to the conditioned stimuli compared to the neutral stimuli. When subsequently allowed to move freely between the two compartments, the rats in all groups also showed significant conditioned avoidance of the compartment containing the conditioned stimuli. In a second experiment the effect,., of lesions confined to specific parts of the amygdala on the three conditioned responses (memory modulation, freezing, avoidance) were tested. Lesions of the central nucleus impaired all three conditioned responses; lesions of the media] nucleus impaired conditioned modulation and avoidance. These lesion, had no effect on freezing during the training trials. Lesions of the lateral and basolateral nuclei attenuated freezing during both training and testing. The findings suggest that the central and medial nuclei of the amygdala may be important parts of neural circuits mediating conditioned responses that constitute conditioned aversive states, but that conditioned freezing may be mediated independently.

J	Kabani, NJ; Sled, JG; Chertkow, H				Kabani, NJ; Sled, JG; Chertkow, H			Magnetization transfer ratio in mild cognitive impairment and dementia of Alzheimer's type	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; DISEASE; ATROPHY; DECLINE; MRI; PREDICTORS	Almost half of the elderly subjects that are diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) go on to develop dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) over a 5-year follow-up. MCI and DAT subjects show regional decreases in the volume of brain structures, which correlate with the cognitive decline among these groups. Volumetric changes are found more consistently in the DAT group than in the MCI group. Since not all MCI subjects demonstrate volumetric decline, we propose that the underlying changes in the structural integrity of the brain, measured using magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), may be used as an additional predictor for abnormal cognitive decline in the elderly. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained in 15 DAT, MCI, and elderly control subjects. Using automatic tissue classification, the brain region of each MR volume was segmented into gray matter and white matter. Mean and standard error of the mean MTR measured within the gray matter was found to be significantly lower in the MCI (30.77 +/- 0.29; P = 0.037) and the DAT (29.37 +/- 0.41; P = 0.000) group compared to the control group (32.11 +/- 0.20). The MTR of white matter was significantly lower only in the DAT group. The gray matter volume was significantly lower (P = 0.000) in the DAT (387.29 +/- 26.04 cm(3)) group compared to controls (532.93 +/- 20.53 cm(3)) and MCI (464.64 +/- 16.93 cm(3)). No significant differences were found in the white matter volume between the three groups. We conclude that changes in MTR are measurable even in the absence of detectable volumetric changes in gray and white matter in the MCI group. Furthermore, MTR changes may present a novel MRI measure for the early diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

We describe the pattern of [C-11]WAY-100635 binding in 61 healthy male brains and examine its variability. For all PET scans, binding potential (BP) values for [C-11]WAY-100635 in different regions were calculated using a simplified reference tissue model, with the cerebellum as reference region. Specifically we describe (1) region of interest and SPM databases of PET [C-11]WAY-100635 binding, including test-retest variability; (2) the sensitivity of [C-11]WAY-100635 binding to manipulations of endogenous 5-HT; and (3) correlations between [C-11]WAY-100635 binding and radiochemical, demographic, physiological, and behavioral variables. The regional distribution of C-11]WAY-100635 binding in healthy human brain was similar to that reported in vitro. The test-retest variability was similar to12% (range 9-16%) and was similar for all methods of regional sampling. The binding of [C-11]WAY-100635 was insensitive to changes in brain 5-HT induced by tryptophan infusion and depletion. Although BP values varied greatly across subjects (range 2.9-6.8), there were no significant correlations of regional and global BP with common radiochemical, demographic, physiological, and personality variables. Specifically, in contrast with two recent small studies, we found no decline of [C-11]WAY-100635 binding with age in our large cohort over the age range of 24 to 53 years. Assessment of 5-HT1A receptors in vivo using PET and [C-11]WAY-100635 gives reliable measures of 5-HT1A binding. The large between-subject variability observed could not be explained by common methodological, physiological, or behavioral factors and hence the biological basis of this variability remains to be clarified.

Blocking post-junctional CGRP receptors, mediators of trigeminal-induced vasodilation. has been suggested as a potential antimigraine strategy. In this study, we tested the ability of a new non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonist. BIBN4096BS, to inhibit the CGRP-induced dilation in human and/or bovine brain vessels and compared it to that of the antagonist alpha-CGRP(8-37). BIBN4096BS and alpha-CGRP(8-37) both blocked the alpha-CGRP-induced dilation in bovine middle artery segments with respective potency (pK(B) values) of 6.3 and 7.8. fit human pial vessels. BIBN4096BS was particularly potent. When tested at 10(-14)-10(-9) M concentrations, it induced a rightward shift in the alpha-CGRP concentration-response Curve and yielded a biphasic Schild Plot suggesting interaction with more than one receptor population, as wits also indicated by the significant best fit of the alpha-CGRP-induced dilation in human brain vessel,,, with a two receptor site interaction. Schild plot analysis in the linear portion of the BIBN4096BS inhibition curve revealed interaction with one high affinity site (pA(2) Value similar to14). lit bovine vessels, both alpha-CGRP(8-37) and BIBN4096BS concentration-dependently reversed a pre-established CGRP-induced dilation (similar to59 and 85%. respectively). BIBN4096BS being similar totenfold more potent than alpha-CGRP(8-37) (respective pIC(50) Values of 7.5 and 6.75). In human middle cerebral and middle meningeal arteries, BIBN4096BS reversed the alpha-CGRP-induced dilation (greater than or equal to70%) by interaction with two different receptor Populations: it exhibited a high affinity for one population (pIC(50) value similar to13) and a lower affinity for the other (pIC(50) value similar to8). The present data demonstrate that BIBN4096BS is a very potent antagonist that Could. depending on its bioavailability and in vivo affinity. be of potential benefit in the acute treatment of migraine headache by blocking and/or reversing the CGRP-mediated dilation of intracranial vessels induced by activation of trigeminovascular afferents.

Previously, temporal masking data have been used to estimate the properties and numbers of these temporal mechanisms in central vision for 1 cycle per degree (cpd) targets [Fredericksen and Hess (1998)]. The same methods have been used to explore how these properties change with stimulus energy [Fredericksen and Hess (1997)] and spatial frequency [Fredericksen and Hess (1999)]. We present here analyses of the properties of temporal mechanisms that detect temporal variations of luminance in peripheral vision. The results indicate that a two-filter model provides the best model for our masking data, but that no multiple filter model provides an acceptable fit across the range of parameters varied in this study. Single-filter modelling shows differences between processing mechanisms at 1 cpd in central vision and those that operate eccentrically. We find evidence that this change is because of differences in relative sensitivities of the mechanisms, and to differences in fundamental mechanism impulse responses.

Design: Observational case series. Participants: Six patients diagnosed and treated with SVS at the Montreal Children's Hospital between 1985 and 1999. Methods: Patients were included in this study if they had an appropriate ophthalmologic follow-up and if they fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of SVS based on intracranial pressure monitoring and neuroimaging studies. Main Outcome Measures: Features studied included patients' baseline ophthalmologic evaluation, visual outcome, and neurosurgical characteristics. Results: The follow-up ranged from 1 to 14 years. The average number of shunting procedures was 3.7. Ocular examination performed on the initial visit revealed a normal visual acuity in four patients, esotropia in three of six patients, and nystagmus in two of six patients. Cycloplegic refraction was normal in all the subjects. Initial funduscopic evaluation revealed optic atrophy in a 4-month-old infant, whereas two children developed optic atrophy later in the course of the disease. One child developed severe visual field defects. The two children with optic atrophy had moderate to severe loss of visual acuity associated with SVS. Conclusions: A prompt recognition of patients with SVS is crucial, because these individuals are at an increased risk for significant visual loss.

J	Prins, N; Kingdom, FAA				Prins, N; Kingdom, FAA			Orientation- and frequency-modulated textures at low depths of modulation are processed by off-orientation and off-frequency texture mechanisms	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						texture perception; second-order; adaptation; spatial-frequency discrimination	DISCRIMINATION; THRESHOLDS	Intuitively it may seem likely that orientation-modulated (OM) and frequency-modulated (FM) textures are processed utilizing the first-order channels that are most responsive to the first-order (luminance) information contained in the textures. This assumption would imply that the detection or segmentation of OM or FM textures is accomplished by second-order mechanisms that receive their first-order input from neurons tuned to either the center, or to the peaks in the orientation and spatial-frequency distribution of the texture. Here we show that at low depths of modulation this is not the case. Using an adaptation paradigm, we show that the first-order filters involved in the perception of OM and FM textures are those which maximize the differential response between the different texture regions. Our explanation of this result is similar to that made by Regan and Beverley [J. Opt. Sec. Am. 73 (1983) 1684; J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 2 (1985) 147] for simple grating stimuli. However, we show that whereas Regan and Beverley's results could be accounted for on the basis of the tuning functions of the putative mechanisms involved, our results can be explained in terms of the characteristics of the textures themselves. Some implications of our finding are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We have investigated how mutations in the components of the laminin-dystroglycan-dystrophin axis affect the organization and expression of dystrophin-associated proteins by comparing mice mutant for merosin (alpha(2)-laminin, dy), dystrophin (mdx), and dystroglycan (Dag1) using immunohistochemistry and immunoblots. We report that syntrophin and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase are depleted in muscle fibers lacking both dystrophin and dystroglycan. Some fibers deficient in dystroglycan, however, localize dystrophin at the cell surface at levels similar to that in wild-type muscle. Nevertheless, these fibers have signs of degeneration/regeneration including increased cell surface permeability and central nuclei. In these fibers, syntrophin and nitric-oxide synthase are also localized to the plasma membrane, whereas the sarcoglycan complex is disrupted. These results suggest a mechanism of membrane attachment for dystrophin independent of dystroglycan and that the interaction of sarcoglycans with dystrophin requires dystroglycan. The distribution of caveolin-3, a muscle-specific component of caveolae recently found to bind dystroglycan, was affected in dystroglycan- and dystrophin-deficient mice. We also examined alternative mechanisms of cell-extracellular matrix attachment to elucidate how the muscle basement membrane may subsist in the absence of dystroglycan, and we found the alpha(7B) splice variant of the alpha(7) integrin receptor subunit to be up-regulated. These results support the possibility that alpha(7B) integrin compensates in mediating cell-extracellular matrix attachment but cannot rescue the dystrophic phenotype.

In these tissues, eEF1A-2/S1 is the only type 1A elongation factor expressed in adulthood because a transition from eEF1A-1/EF-1alpha to eEF1A-2/S1 occurs in early postnatal development. In this article, we report that the expression of eEF1A-2/S1 protein is activated upon myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we show that upon serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, eEF1A-2/S1 protein disappears and is replaced by its homolog eEF1A-1/EF-1alpha in dying myotubes; cell death is characterized by the activation of caspase-3. In addition, we show that the continuous expression of eEF1A-2/S1 resulting from adenoviral gene transfer protects differentiated myotubes from apoptosis by delaying their death, thus suggesting a prosurvival function for eEF1A-2/S1 in skeletal muscle. In contrast, myotube death is accelerated by the introduction of the homologous gene, eEF1A-1/EF-1alpha, whereas cells transfected with antisense eEF1A-1/EF-1alpha are protected from apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the two sister genes, eEF1A-1/EF-1alpha and eFIA-2/S1, regulate myotube survival with the former exerting prodeath activity and the latter a prosurvival effect.

We have previously shown that apoD gene expression in cultured human fibroblasts is up-regulated when the cells undergo growth arrest. Here, we demonstrate that, starting around day 2 of growth arrest, both apoD and apoE mRNA levels increase between 1.5- and 27-fold in other cell types, including mouse primary fibroblasts and fibroblast-like and human astrocytoma cell lines. To understand the regulatory mechanisms of apoD expression, we have used apoD promoter-luciferase reporter constructs to compare gene expression in growing cells and in cells that have undergone growth arrest. Analysis of gene expression in cells transfected with constructs with deletions and mutations in the apoD promoter and constructs with artificial promoters demonstrated that the region between nucleotides -174 and -4 is fully responsible for the basal gene expression, whereas the region from -558 to -179 is implicated in the induction of apoD expression following growth arrest. Within this region, an alternating purine-pyrimidine stretch and a pair of serum-responsive elements (SRE) were found to be major determinants of growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression. Evidence is also presented that SREs in the apoE promoter may contribute to the up-regulation of apoE gene expression following growth arrest.

Subjects were scanned during learning (LRN) and baseline (ISO) on 3 d: day 1, after 5 d of practice (day 5) and after a 4 week delay (recall). Blood flow was compared across days of learning and between the LRN and ISO conditions. Overall, significant changes in activity were seen across days for the LRN condition, but not the ISO baseline. Day 1 results revealed extensive activation in the cerebellar cortex, particularly lobules III/IV and VI. Day 5 results showed increased activity in the basal ganglia (BG) and frontal lobe, with no significant cerebellar activity. At recall, significantly greater activity was seen in M1, premotor, and parietal cortex. Blood flow in the cerebellum decreased significantly between day 1 and recall. These results reveal a dynamic network of motor structures that are differentially active during different phases of learning and delayed recall. For the first time our findings show that recall of motor sequences in humans is mediated by a predominantly cortical network. Based on these results, we suggest that during early learning cerebellar mechanisms are involved in adjusting movement kinematics according to sensory input to produce accurate motor output. Thereafter, the cerebellar mechanisms required for early learning are no longer called into play. During late learning, the BG may be involved in automatization. At delayed recall, movement parameters appear to be encoded in a distributed representation mediated by M1, premotor, and parietal cortex.

Antidepressant drugs improve hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis feedback regulation and reduce plasma glucocorticoid levels. Decreasing the cumulative lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid excess by long-term exposure to antidepressants may prevent the emergence of cognitive impairments in aged rats. To test this hypothesis, we treated middle-aged male Lister hooded rats (16 months) with amitriptyline until they were 24 months of age, and their cognitive function was assessed in the water maze. Performance in the spatial learning task declined significantly with aging (p < 0.01), with 33% of aged controls showing poorer (<2.5 SD) probe test performance than young controls. Amitriptyline treatment from midlife preserved water maze performance with aging (p < 0.01 compared with aged controls) and significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the proportion of poor performers (7%). Measures of anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus-maze were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the aged rats after amitriptyline. Furthermore, evening plasma corticosterone levels were reduced (30% decrease; p < 0.01 compared with aged controls) after 6 months of amitriptyline. These data suggest that long-term treatment with amitriptyline decreases the prevalence of cognitive impairment in aged rats and that this may, in part, be a consequence of reduced plasma corticosterone levels and reduced anxiety.

The Oregonator model for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is used to model the chemical reactions. In particular, we investigate the dependence of wave front propagation failure on the mass exchange rate for the Ce4+ component between cells and on the amplitude of a perturbation employed to trigger a propagation of transition from an initially homogeneous state to final stationary patterns reached by the system. In the case of the Oregonator, there appear two critical mass transfer rates at which propagation failure occurs, in contrast to the cases of the cubic model or the sine-Gordon model reported in the literature. By following the evolution of the calortropy production accompanying wave propagation, we construct phase diagrams that provide valuable insights into the propagation failure phenomenon. The global calortropy production is shown to exhibit discontinuous changes with respect to the transfer rate when propagation failure occurs. When a complete propagation failure occurs, the global calortropy flux through the array vanishes, whereas it is nonvanishing when there is a partial or complete propagation of the wave front. When the calortropy flux vanishes, the wave front speed and the net mass flux between the cells also vanish.

As visualized and measured in single thin sections, and compared with those of unlabeled varicosities selected at random in the same photomicrographs, the ChAT-immunostained profiles displayed intrinsic and relational features very similar to those previously described in the same cortical area of adult rat (Umbriaco et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 348:351-373). At the three postnatal ages, the immunoreactive profiles were comparable in shape, size, and vesicular content in all cortical layers, but showed an increasing frequency of mitocliondria with age, reaching 44% at P32. Synaptic junctions were observed on 6.3 to 8.7% of these sectional profiles, indicating an average synaptic incidence of 17% for whole varicosities, again comparable to that in the adult (14%). As in adult, the junctions made by the rare synaptic ChAT-immunostained varicosities were always single, usually symmetrical, and more frequently found on dendritic branches than spines. Thus, cortical ACh varicosities displayed intrinsic and relational features similar to adult ones as soon as this innervation was installed, suggesting that a diffuse mode of transmission and ambient level of ACh could play a major role in the diverse effects of this neuromodulator during cortical development.

Studies have also demonstrated numerous functional hemispheric asymmetries within this brain area of the rat. The present study examines the effects of ibotenic acid or sham lesions targeting the left, right or bilateral infralimbic cortex, on a variety of behaviors. Lesions (which destroyed infralimbic and ventral prelimbic cortex) were without effect on acquisition or reversal of a spatial learning task in the Morris water maze. Similarly unaffected were spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and sensitization, and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. In contrast, lesions significantly affected behavior in the elevated plus maze, as right-lesioned animals spent more time exploring the open arms of the maze than shams or left-lesioned rats, while not differing in closed arm entries. As well, in a simple taste aversion paradigm, right-lesioned rats drank significantly more of a sweetened milk/quinine solution than shams and left-lesioned rats, despite not differing in consumption of sweetened milk alone. The anxiolytic effects of right, but not left lesions of ventral mPFC, parallel the asymmetrical suppression of physiological stress responses previously reported for similar lesions. It is suggested that the right ventral mPFC plays a primary role in optimizing cautious and adaptive behavior in potentially threatening situations, (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Two prolines (Pro(-9), Pro(-5)) located near the processing sites (Arg(-15) and Arg(-2)Lys(-1)) of human prosomatostatin were previously shown to be important for cleavage of the precursor into somatostatin-28 (S-28) and somatostatin-14 (S-14) [Gomez et al. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 2911-29161. In this study, the importance of the pentapeptide P-A-M-A-P sequence (P-(X)(3)-P pattern), located in the S-28(1-12) segment connecting the mono- and dibasic cleavage sites, was investigated by using site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of prosomatostatin-derived peptides produced by expression of mutated cDNA species in Neuro2A cells indicated that (i) deletion of PAMAP decreased S-14 production, (ii) deletion of the two Pro residues almost abolished the cleavage at the dibasic site, and (iii) Pro displacement generating the AMAPP motif resulted in a decrease of S-28 production. Moreover, both theoretical and spectroscopic studies of synthetic peptides reproducing the S-28(1-12) sequence bearing critical mutations showed that this sequence can organize as an alpha-helical structure. These observations demonstrate that NPAMAP constitutes an accurate alpha-helix nucleation motif allowing for the generation of equal amounts of S-28 and S-14 from their common precursor in Neuro2A cells. Moreover, they emphasize the importance of the S-28(1-12) segment joining Arg(-15) and Arg-(2)Lys(-1) cleavage sites whose conformational organization is essential for controlling their accessibility to the appropriate processing proteases.

Now, detection of intracellular neuronal Abeta(1-42) accumulation before extracellular Abeta deposits questions the relevance of intracellular peptides in AD. In the present study, we directly address whether intracellular Abeta is toxic to human neurons. Microinjections of Abeta(1-42) peptide or a cDNA-expressing cytosolic Abeta(1-42) rapidly induces cell death of primary human neurons. In contrast, Abeta(1-40), Abeta(40-1), or Abeta(42-1) peptides, and cDNAs expressing cytosolic Abeta(1-40) or secreted Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40), are not toxic. As little as a 1-pM concentration or 1500 molecules/cell of Abeta(1-12) peptides is neurotoxic. The nonfibrillized and fibrillized Abeta(1-42) peptides are equally toxic. in contrast, Abeta(1-42) peptides are not toxic to human primary astrocytes, neuronal, and nonneuronal cell lines. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis protects against Abeta(1-42) toxicity, indicating that programmed cell death is involved. Bcl-2, Bax-neutralizing antibodies, cDNA expression of a p53(R273H) dominant negative mutant, and caspase inhibitors prevent Abeta(1-42)-mediated human neuronal cell death. Taken together, our data directly demonstrate that intracellular Abeta(1-42) is selectively cytotoxic to human neurons through the p53-Bax cell death pathway.

The present study was designed to assess whether a relation exists between a behavioral variable such as maze learning ability and ethanol consumption. Sixty. male, Long-Evans rats. exposed to food and water ad libitum, were given a daily trial in a complex, 16-arm T-maze for 19 consecutive days. The number of errors and time to complete the maze were monitored. Individual maze variable scores were transformed and then combined to allot each animal with an index of overall maze performance, with a smaller maze index score denoting good performance. After completion of maze testing, animals were given alternate-day, free-choice presentations of water and ascending doses of ethanol solutions (2%-10%). followed by a 10-day maintenance period with 10% ethanol. Animals were subsequently separated into two groups of high and low drinkers to examine any relation between differential ethanol intake and maze performance. A significant negative correlation between maze index and ethanol intake for the high drinkers group indicated that a smaller maze index was related to increased ethanol intake. No significant correlation was obtained for the low drinkers group. These results seem to indicate that individual variation in learning ability seems to be related to increased ethanol intake, Thus. innate learning processes may be a relevant trait when one attempts to understand the behaviors related to ethanol intake and preference.

J	Schmitt, HJ; Hemmerling, TM				Schmitt, HJ; Hemmerling, TM			Venous air emboli occur during release of positive end-expiratory pressure and repositioning after sitting position surgery	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES; DOGS; PEEP; COMPRESSION; VENTILATION; PREVENTION; SHUNT	We studied the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) release and positioning on the occurrence of venous air embolism (VAE). Eighteen consecutive patients (8 women, 10 men; ASA grade I-III) undergoing neurosurgery in the sitting position were studied. After induction of anesthesia ventilation was controlled with a PEEP of 5 cm H2O in an oxygen-air gas mixture. A transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) probe was inserted. Preoperatively, a patent foramen ovale was excluded in all patients. TEE monitoring was performed during surgery, during PEEP release at the end of surgery with the patient still in the sitting position, and during change of the patient position into the supine position. The severity of VAE was differentiated as follows: grade 1 = only microbubbles; grade 2 = microbubbles and decrease of end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure PETCO2 by more than 1.5 mm Hg, and a decrease of mean arterial blood pressure by at least 20 mm Hg. During surgery, VAE with a grade of 1, 2 or 3 occurred in 7, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. After PEEP release, VAE of grades 1, 2, and 3 were observed in 7, 2, and 1 patients, respectively. During repositioning from sitting to supine position, VAE of grades 1, 2,and 3 was observed in 6, 1, and 1 patients, respectively. The patient with VAE grade 3 needed inotropic support until 2 h after surgery to maintain sufficient blood pressure. No patient showed any sign of paradoxical arterial embolism or cardiac dysfunction. We conclude that VAE occurs not only during surgery in the sitting position,but also with release of PEEP and during repositioning to the supine position.

The most common form of HSP is caused by mutations in the SPG4 gene, which codes for spastin, an adenosine triphosphatase with various cellular activities (AAA) protein family member. Objective: To investigate a large collection of predominantly North American patients with HSP for mutations in the spastin encoding gene, SPG4. Methods: DNA from 76 unrelated affected individuals was studied for mutations by single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Each new variant identified was then analyzed in 80 control subjects to determine whether the variant is a common polymorphism or a rare mutation. All DNA samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, followed by electrophoresis and auto radiography. Results: We identified 8 novel mutations and 5 previously reported mutations in 15 affected individuals. The novel mutations are 4 missense, 1 nonsense, 1 frame-shift, and 2 splice mutations. Two polymorphisms (one in an affected individual) were also identified. Conclusions: Our collection of families with HSP is different on a genetic level from those previously described. The percentage of our families, with a SPG4 mutation is 10% lower than the 40% estimate of families with autosomal dominant HSP noted to be linked to this locus, and splice mutations are not predominant in our collection. Interestingly, we also identified 2 recurring mutations in specific populations (R562Q and G559D), which may facilitate the development of future spastin diagnostic testing in these populations.

In the present study, a research effort has been made to document in detail the behavioural manifestations of congenital amusia. A group of 11 adults, fitting stringent criteria of musical disabilities, were examined in a series of tests originally designed to assess the presence and specificity of musical disorders in brain-damaged patients. The results show that congenital amusia is related to severe deficiencies in processing pitch variations. The deficit extends to impairments in music memory and recognition as well as in singing and the ability to tap in time to music. Interestingly, the disorder appears specific to the musical domain. Congenital amusical individuals process and recognize speech, including speech prosody common environmental sounds and human voices, as well as control subjects. Thus, the present study convincingly demonstrates the existence of congenital amusia as a new class of learning disabilities that affect musical abilities.

In contrast to speech perception, little is known about the neural bases of our ability to perceive these various types of paralinguistic vocal information. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified regions along the superior temporal sulcus (STS) that were not only sensitive, but also highly selective to vocal sounds. In the present study, we asked how neural activity in the voice areas was influenced by (i) the presence or not of linguistic information in the vocal input (speech vs. nonspeech) and (ii) frequency scrambling. Speech sounds were found to elicit greater responses than nonspeech vocalizations in most parts of auditory cortex, including primary auditory cortex (A1), on both sides of the brain. In contrast, response attenuation due to frequency scrambling was much more pronounced in anterior STS areas than at the level of A1. Importantly, only right anterior STS regions responded more strongly to nonspeech vocal sounds than to their scrambled version, suggesting that these regions could be specifically involved in paralinguistic aspects of voice perception.

Here, we examined whether dopamine (DA) and adjacent gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-synthesizing neurons are active in association with PS recovery as compared to PS deprivation or control conditions in different groups of rats by using c-Fos expression as a reflection of neural activity, combined with dual immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Numbers of TH+ /c-Fos(+) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) were not significantly different across groups, whereas those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were significantly different and greatest in PS recovery. Numbers of GAD(+) /c-Fos(+) neurons in both VTA and SN were greatest in PS recovery. Thus, DA neuronal activity does not appear to be suppressed by local GABAergic neuronal activity during PS but might be altered in pattern by this inhibitory as well as other excitatory, particularly cholinergic, inputs such as to allow DA VTA neurons to become maximally active during PS and thereby contribute to the unique physiological and cognitive aspects of that state.

Although some studies have examined skin afferent responses to stretch, relatively few investigations have examined the neural and perceptual correlates of shear forces applied tangentially to the skin. The present study assessed the ability of human subjects to scale different levels of tangential force applied to the distal pad of the index finger. Subjects were instructed to choose their own magnitude estimation scale. Seven force levels ranging from 0.15 to 0.70 N were delivered randomly at rates of 0.10 N/s, 0.15 N/s or 0.30 N/s. Tangential forces were produced with a smooth metal spatula coated with an adhesive to insure a shear force on the underlying skin without slip. The same procedures were also used to generate skin indentation with normal forces. The results showed that most human subjects were able to scale different magnitudes of both tangential and normal forces applied to the tip of the index finger. The rate of force change did not influence the perception of the applied forces. These results highlight the potentially important role of tangential forces in haptic perception.

However, little information is available on the functional regulation of the bRAS as a consequence of sodium deficit in the extracellular fluid compartments. We used a pharmacological model of acute Na+ depletion (furosemide injections) to investigate changes of a major component of the bRAS, the hypothalamic angiotensin type 1A (AT(1A)) receptors. Furosemide induced a rapid and long-lasting expression of the AT(1A) mRNA in the subfornical organ, the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), and the parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). Na+ depletion increased the number of cells expressing AT(1A) mRNA in the pPVN, but not in the MnPO. The enhancement of AT(1A) mRNA expression was associated with an increase in AT(1) binding sites in all the regions studied. It is of interest that in the paraventricular nucleus, the majority of the neurons expressing AT(1A) mRNA also showed an increase in metabolic activity (Fos-related antigen immunoreactivity [FRA-ir]). By contrast, in the MnPO, we observe two distinct cell populations. Our data demonstrated that an acute Na+ deficit induced a functional regulation of the hypothalamic AT(1A) receptors, indicating that these receptors are subject to plasticity in response to hydromineral perturbations.

Since viruses can infect any tissue of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS), it is logical that cells of the immune system should equally have access to all tissues. Nevertheless, the brain and spinal cord are noted for their lack of immune presence. Relative to other organ systems, the CNS appears immunologically privileged. Furthermore, when immune responses do occur in the CNS, they are frequently associated with deleterious effects such as inflammatory and/or demyelinating pathology. This article will review the molecular and cellular dynamics of immune responses in the CNS, with particular emphasis on autoimmune inflammation, as has been studied in the authors' laboratory.

The addition of neuron-conditioned medium induced an increase of both OTR binding and OTR mRNA level. This effect was enhanced after the medium was boiled or acidified. As it is known that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can be released from carrier proteins by acid or heat, TGF-beta1 and 2 were tested and found to induce an increase of OTR binding. Furthermore, TGF-beta antibody abolished the stimulatory effect of normal or acidified neuron-conditioned medium. Neurons added to cultured astrocytes without contact mimicked the stimulatory effect of the conditioned medium. In contrast, neurons added with contact, induced a decrease in OTR binding and an increase of mRNA level, whereas neuronal membranes induced a decrease of both OTR binding and mRNA levels. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that in vitro, neurons are able to modulate astrocytic OTR expression at the level of both protein and mRNA. They stimulate this expression through their release of TGF-beta and inhibit it by the action of unknown membrane components. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

To investigate the role that high levels of NPY might play in the prolongation of lactational infertility that typically accompanies a food restricted lactation we investigated the effects of chronic central infusions of NPY in ad libitum-fed lactating females. First, we compared the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of NPY from Days 12-19 postpartum at a dose of 14.4 mug/day with a similar treatment in nonlactating females. In subsequent experiments we examined the effects of NPY infusions into the lateral ventricle at doses of 6 or 20 mug/day or unilaterally into the media[ preoptic area at a dose of 1 mug/day from either Days 12-19 or 7-21 postpartum. Effects on food intake; female body weight; and, where appropriate, litter weight and length of lactational diestrus were compared between NPY and vehicle-treated females. As expected NPY infusion produced a robust increase in body weight and food intake in nonlactating females that was accompanied by a suppression of cyclicity. By contrast NPY treatment in lactating rats resulted in a marked decrease in litter growth and an earlier termination of lactational diestrus. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Due to its linear dependence upon parameters, a second-truncated Volterra nonlinear model is first used to characterize such systems. The versatile order-recursive estimation scheme is employed to determine the values of parameters in the Volterra model. The scheme also avoids separate determination of the model order; thus, the complexity of the search process is reduced. Next, it is shown that the estimated parameters, representing different states of the system, normal as well as faulty conditions, can be used to detect and isolate system faults in a geometric domain. Very promising results are exhibited via simulations as well as laboratory experiments. It is concluded that the developed parametric FD technique has potential to provide efficient condition monitoring and/or preventive maintenance in hydraulic actuator circuits.

REGISTRATION TECHNIQUES; MUTUAL INFORMATION; ASYMMETRY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISEASE	We present a new method to automatically compute, reorient, and recenter the mid-sagittal plane in anatomical and functional three-dimensional (3-D) brain images. This iterative approach is composed of two steps. At first, given an initial guess of the mid-sagittal plane (generally, the central plane of the image grid), the computation of local similarity measures between the two sides of the head allows to identify homologous anatomical structures or functional areas, by way of a block matching procedure. The output is a set of point-to-point correspondences: the centers of homologous blocks. Subsequently, we define the mid-sagittal plane as the one best superposing the points on one side and their counterparts on the other side by reflective symmetry. Practically, the computation of the parameters characterizing the plane is performed by a least trimmed squares estimation. Then, the estimated plane is aligned with the center of the image grid, and the whole process is iterated until convergence. The robust estimation technique we use allows normal or abnormal asymmetrical structures or areas to be treated as outliers, and the plane to be mainly computed from the underlying gross symmetry of the brain. The algorithm is fast and accurate, even for strongly tilted heads, and even in presence of high acquisition noise and bias field, as shown on a large set of synthetic data. The algorithm has also been visually evaluated on a large set of real magnetic resonance (MR) images. We present a few results on isotropic as well as anisotropic anatomical (MR and computed tomography) and functional (single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography) real images, for normal and pathological subjects.

J	Casoni, D				Casoni, D			'Never twice without thrice' - An outline for the understanding of traumatic neurosis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOANALYSIS			English	Article								Following the review of Freud's work on trauma (1916-17, 1920, 1926, 1933, 1939), this article proposes to view the traumatic scene as a screen which acts as an active process in the case of many victims who, like Mrs D, break down a few days after being assaulted. After a first attempt at denial, the ego is submerged with repressed content. Repetition is seen as a means of abreacting the trauma by seeking to bind the enormous quantity of excitations that cannot find discharge. Repetition because of its compulsive quality, fails. The victim remains in a state of helplessness against which she resorts to denial, splitting and projection (Freud. 1920, 1926). This strategy is seen, however; as maintaining the victim in a state of helplessness. Thus, 1 suggest that, overwhelmed, the ego finally resorts to a multi-levelled system of defence. On a first level, favation to the trauma, like in screen-memories, gives way to a first displacement. On a second level, the adoption of an identity built upon being a victim contributes to the strength of this displacement. On a third level, identification with the aggressor consolidates this defensive strategy by giving meaning to the hostility awakened by the sexual assault.

To determine the consequences of this pathology on the central noradrenergic (NA) system, NA contents were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 22 brain regions and spinal cord, while NA transporters, or uptake sites, were evaluated by quantitative ligand binding autoradiography, using [H-3]nisoxetine, in wild-type and dt(J)/dt(J) mutant mice. The only significant differences in NA contents between the two genotypes were increased levels in hypothalamus and mesencephalic dopaminergic regions A9/A10 of dt(J)/dt(J) mutants. The dt(J)/dt(J) spinal cord showed a similar result, but its NA content remained unchanged when taking into account its reduced volume. Binding to NA transporters revealed increased densities in sensory nuclei of cranial nerves, granular layer of the cerebellar cortex, as well as in cerebellar-related and basal ganglia structures, such as the lateral cuneate nucleus, pontine nuclei, substantia nigra, pontine reticular formation, median raphe nucleus and superior colliculus. Forebrain regions were relatively unaffected in the dt(J)/dt(J) mutants, although NA transporter densities were higher in piriform cortex, hippocampal subdivisions and ventro-anterior thalamic nucleus. In contrast, densities of NA transporters were decreased in hypothalamic subregions and in two ventrobasal thalamic nuclei. The results are discussed in relation to expression of the dystonin gene in normal brain, cellular defects resulting from the loss of gene transcription in the dt(J)/dt(J) mutation, functional circuits of the central nervous system and some of the phenotypical characteristics of dystonia musculorum mutants.

Numerous studies have been carried out at both the light and electron microscopy level to quantify dendritic spine densities in brain tissue in laboratory animals, Currently, such efforts using light microscopy have relied on manual counting of spines in confocal or two-photon optical slice images of tissue containing fluorescently labelled spines. This manual approach can be slow and tedious, especially for samples with high spine densities. We introduce an alternative way of performing spine counting that uses an applied image intensity threshold followed by spatial image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) analysis. We investigated the effect of particle sizes above the diffraction limit on the auto-correlation analysis as well as the influence of background fluorescence. Our results show that, for well labelled cerebellar tissue samples imaged with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 or greater, ICS-based spine counts can be conducted with the same 15 - 20% precision as manual counting, but much more rapidly.

In a first series of experiments, we characterized and compared head-restrained (HR) and -unrestrained (HU) pursuit responses to unpredictable, nonperiodic, constant velocity (20 -80degrees/s) stimuli. When the head was free to move, both monkeys used a combination of eye and head motion to initially fixate and then pursue the target. The pursuit responses (i.e., gaze responses) were highly stereotyped and nearly identical among the HR and HU conditions for a given step-ramp stimulus. In the HU condition, initial eye and initial head acceleration tended to increase as a function of target velocity but did not vary systematically with initial target eccentricity. In a second series of experiments, step-ramp stimuli (40degrees/s) were presented, and, similar to125 ms after pursuit onset, a constant retinal velocity error (RVE) was imposed for a duration of 300 ms. In each monkey, HR and HU gaze velocity was similarly affected by stabilizing the target with respect to the monkey's fovea (i.e., RVE = 0degrees/s) and by moving the target with constant retinal velocity errors (i.e., RVE = +/-10degrees/s). In the HU condition, changes in both eye and head velocity trajectories contributed to the observed gaze velocity responses to imposed RVEs. We conclude that eye and head movements are not independently controlled during HU pursuit but rather are controlled, at least in part, by a shared upstream controller within the pursuit pathways.

J	Castro-Alamancos, MA				Castro-Alamancos, MA			Properties of primary sensory (lemniscal) synapses in the ventrobasal thalamus and the relay of high-frequency sensory inputs	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VENTRAL POSTERIOR; BRAIN-STEM; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; RAT THALAMUS; NEURONS; CAT; RESPONSES	The main role of the thalamus is to relay sensory inputs to the neocortex. In the primary somatosensory thalamus (ventrobasal thalamus), sensory inputs deliver tactile information through the medial lemniscus tract. The transmission of sensory information through this pathway is affected by behavioral state. For instance, the relay of high-frequency somatosensory inputs through the thalamus is suppressed during anesthesia or quiescent states but allowed during behaviorally activated states. This change may be due to the effects of modulators on the efficacy of lemniscal synapses. Here I show that lemniscal synapses of adult rodents studied in vitro produce large amplitude-highly secure unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), which depress in response to repetitive stimulation at frequencies >2 Hz. Acetylcholine and norepinephrine, which are important thalamic modulators, have no effect on the efficacy of lemniscal EPSPs but reduce evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and corticothalamic EPSPs. Although acetylcholine and norepinephrine do not affect lemniscal synapses, the postsynaptic depolarization they produce on thalamocortical neurons serves to warrant the relay of lemniscal inputs at high-frequency rates by bringing the depressed lemniscal EPSPs close to firing threshold. In conclusion, acetylcholine and norepinephrine released during activated states selectively enhance sensory transmission through the lemniscal pathway by depolarizing thalamocortical neurons and simultaneously depressing the other afferent pathways.

The cellular and molecular processes underlying the rapid presynaptic inhibition of DA release by D2 receptors remain unclear. Using a culture system in which isolated DAergic neurons establish self-innervating synapses ("autapses") that release both DA and glutamate, we studied the mechanism by which presynaptic D2 receptors inhibit glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Action-potential evoked EPSCs were reversibly inhibited by quinpirole, a selective D2 receptor agonist. This inhibition was slightly reduced by the inward rectifier K+ channel blocker barium, largely prevented by the voltage-dependent K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine, and completely blocked by their combined application. The lack of a residual inhibition of EPSCs under these conditions argues against the implication of a direct inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ channels. To evaluate the possibility of a direct inhibition of the secretory process, spontaneous miniature EPSCs were evoked by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Ionomycin-evoked release was insensitive to cadmium and dramatically reduced by quinpirole, providing evidence for a direct inhibition of quantal release at a step downstream to Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Surprisingly, this effect of quinpirole on ionomycin-evoked release was blocked by 4-aminopyridine. These results suggest that D2 receptor activation decreases neurotransmitter release from DAergic neurons through a presynaptic mechanism in which K+ channels directly inhibit the secretory process.

A monkey performed a task in which the correct target for a reaching movement was specified during two consecutive instructed-delay periods. First, two potential targets were presented; and second, a nonspatial cue identified one of them as the correct movement target. During the first period, two directional signals coexisted in the activity of cells in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), oriented toward the two potential targets. During the second period, one of these disappeared and the remaining signal predicted the monkey's response choice. These results suggest that, when faced with multiple salient opportunities for reaching, the primate brain performs sensorimotor transformations in parallel to begin planning several reaching movements simultaneously before selecting one for overt execution.

One potential exception to this generalization is neuroblastoma (NB), a tumor derived from the sympathoadrenal lineage. NBs often express high levels of N-myc, a proto-oncogene that can potently activate key components of the cell cycle machinery. Here, we show that in postmitotic sympathetic neurons, N-myc can induce S-phase entry while protecting neurons from death caused by aberrant cell cycle reentry. Specifically, these experiments demonstrate that expression of N-myc at levels similar to those in NBs caused sympathetic neurons to reenter S-phase, as monitored by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, and rescued them from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of their obligate survival factor, nerve growth factor. The N-myc-induced cell cycle entry, but not enhanced survival, was inhibited by coexpression of a constitutively hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, suggesting that these two effects of N-myc are mediated by separate pathways. In contrast, N-myc did not cause S-phase entry in postmitotic cortical neurons. Thus, N-myc both selectively causes sympathetic neurons to reenter the cell cycle and protects them from apoptosis, potentially contributing to their transformation to NBs.

Physiological data demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic receptor stimulation activates intrinsic cellular currents in entorhinal neurons that could underlie the role of entorhinal cortex in performance of these tasks. Here we use a network biophysical simulation of the entorhinal cortex to demonstrate the potential role of this cellular mechanism in the behavioral tasks. Simulations demonstrate how the muscarinic-activated calcium-sensitive nonspecific cation current I-NCM could provide a cellular mechanism for features of the neuronal activity observed during performance of delayed matching tasks. In particular, I-NCM could underlie (1) the maintenance of sustained spiking activity during the delay period, (2) the enhancement of spiking activity during the matching period relative to the sample period, and (3) the resistance of sustained activity to distractors. Simulation of a larger entorhinal network with connectivity chosen randomly within constraints on number, distribution, and weight demonstrates appearance of other phenomena observed in unit recordings from awake animals, including match suppression, non-match enhancement, and non-match suppression.

Genetic analysis of familial ALS has yielded six loci and one disease gene (SOD1), initially suggesting a role for free radicals in the disease process, although the mechanisms through which the mutant exerts toxicity and results in selective motor neuron death remain uncertain. Numerous studies have focused on structural elements of the affected cell, emphasizing the role of neurofilaments and peripherin and their functional disruption in disease. Other topics examined include cellular homeostasis of copper and calcium, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and the processes of protein aggregation, glutamate excitotoxicity, and apoptosis. It has become evident that there is considerable interplay between these mechanisms and, as the role of each is established, a common picture may emerge, enabling the development of more targeted therapies. This study discusses the main areas of investigation and reviews the findings. (C) John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

In the present study, we examined the expression of the CGRP receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3) and receptor component protein (RCP) in human brain astrocytes (AST), cerebromicrovascular endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle (SMC) cells in culture. Further, we pharmacologically characterized CGRP receptors, in these cells by assessing the potency of the CGRP receptor antagonists h-alphaCGRP(8-37) and the new non-peptide Compound BIBN4096BS to block the production of cAMP elicited by CGRP(1) and CGRP(2) receptor agonists. 2. AST, EC and SMC all expressed mRNAs for RAMP1, RAMP2 and RCP. In contrast, message for RAMP3 was detected in AST, but not in SMC and in only one out of four preparations of EC. 3. h-alphaCGRP, h-betaCGRP and [Cys (Et)(2,7)]-h-alphaCGRP exerted concentration-dependent production of cAMP in all cultures, with a maximal effect at 25-50 nM (20-60-fold increase from basal levels). In contrast, 50 nM [Cys (1Acm)(2,7)]-h-alphaCGRP only induced a weak stimulatory effect on cAMP formation, especially in SMC and AST (1.5- and 5-fold increase above baseline, respectively), 4. h-alphaCGRP(8-37) and BIBN4096BS concentration-dependently inhibited cAMP formation evoked by CGRP receptor agonists. Depending on the agonists used, h-alphaCGRP(8-37) distinguished two different CGRP receptors for which it exhibited low (pIC(50)less than or equal to6.4) and high (pIC(50)similar to7.3) affinity, respectively. BIBN4096BS was much more potent (>2.5 orders of magnitude) than h-alphaCGRP(8-37). Further, BIBN4096BS was able to discriminate three different CGRP receptor sites for which it exhibited low (pIC(50)similar to9.3-9.9), intermediate (pIC(50)similar to10.9), and a very high (pIC(50)similar to13.7) affinity, respectively. Together, these results Suggest the presence of CGRP(1) and/or CGRP(2) receptors in human brain AST, EC and SMC, and of an additional population of CGRP receptors in AST, possibly associated to the combined expression of RAMP3 and RCP in these cells, for which BIBN4096BS exhibits an exquisitely high affinity.

The complexity of the CNS-immune system interactions after CNS trauma is now beginning to be better understood. Recent studies indicate that both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune responses can help in promoting axon regeneration after CNS injury. It is hoped that such advances will lead to the development of safe and effective vaccine and cytokine treatments for spinal cord injuries.

In this study, the non-peptide neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist. L-732,138 was chronically administered by intrathecal (i.t.) injection to rats with mono-neuropathy produced by sciatic nerve constriction. Rats exhibited tactile ministered i.t. prior to and for 3 consecutive days allodynia and cold hyperalgesia over a 16-day testing period. L-732,138 (5-200 nmol) administered i.t. prior to and for 3 consecutive days post-surgery attenuated the mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia on days 4 and 8 post-surgery. The effects of i.t. L-732,138 were also determined in rats with established nerve injury-induced neuropathy. The NK-1 receptor antagonist was injected for 4 consecutive days starting on day 8 post-sciatic nerve injury. Administration of L-731 138 (5-200 nmol) i.t. produced both anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects on day 12, but the effect was not permanent, as nociceptive thresholds were similar to controls by day 16. These results demonstrate that substance P is involved both in the induction and the maintenance of neuropathic pain and provides justification for the development and administration of substance P antagonists for the management of clinical neuropathic pain.

The medical records of 655 children 5-16 years of age referred to a single pediatric neurologist (M.S.) from January 1991 to December 1999 with school problems, behavior problems, or hyperactivity were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical criteria for attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder were satisfied in 476 of these children. An electroencephalogram was obtained from 347 patients and coded as epileptiform in 6.1 +/- 1.3%, which is significantly higher (chi-square test, P < 0.025) than the prevalence rate of 3.5 +/- 0.6% observed in a study of 3,726 normal school-aged children [1]. The epileptiform abnormality was present only with activation procedures in six of our patients (hyperventilation [n = 2] and photic stimulation [n = 41). Only three of the 21 children with epileptiform abnormalities developed a seizure disorder in our cohort. We conclude that the prevalence rate of epileptiform abnormalities is greater in children with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder compared with that observed in normal school-aged children when hyperventilation and photic stimulation are used. However, the clinical utility of routine electroencephalography in the diagnosis of a comorbid seizure disorder in children with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder is limited.

As a general rule, a greater quantal content was associated with a greater quantal size. Following a short depolarizing pulse (0.5-2 s; 100 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV), the mean value of quantal size increased by 54% over several seconds before gradually (over tens of seconds) returning toward the control value, whilst its variability rose by 62%. The changes observed following 30-s applications of high extracellular K+ (50 mM) were more modest. A rapid application of short depolarizing pulses (2 s every 10-20 s: 100 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV) also led, at least initially, to greater quantal content and quantal size. Mean quantal size rose initially by 68%, but decreased subsequently to 31% below pre-stimulation levels. In whole-clamped cells, the frequency of quantal release can rise abruptly, probably owing to a mechanical disturbance that makes the membrane leaky to Ca2+. In such cases, a marked rise in quantal content ()tenfold) was paralleled by an almost as dramatic (up to tenfold) rise in quantal size and an important, although less pronounced and slower, rise in its variability (up to fourfold). The return toward control values of mean quantal size occurred over several minutes, whilst its variability decayed more slowly. The release parameters were evaluated directly from the number of events to avoid a large and time-dependent contribution of the amplitude variability of spontaneous amperometric current spikes (minis). In general, the greater probability of release contributed more than the greater size of the immediately available store to the increase in quantal output. In conclusion, quantal size was found to be highly labile. Its change can alter strongly the facilitation and depression of evoked quantal output and probably occurs due to a preferential release of large vesicles that are more efficient barriers to Ca2+ diffusion when Ca2+ rises rapidly following a synchronous opening of several Ca2+ channels. When intracellular Ca2+ levels rise slowly to threshold levels for secretion, as during an asynchronous and generally spontaneous release, vesicles are less effective diffusion barriers and quantal size changes less.

Noninoculated (NON) potatoes served as the control. Volatile fingerprints varied among diseases. Within a disease, the fingerprints varied with time since inoculation and among blocks. In general, more volatiles were observed on the fourth and fifth day after inoculation than on the third day. The amount of volatile compounds produced (peak area) within a disease group increased with incubation time; however, the variation among blocks was much higher. The amount of volatiles produced, in general, was associated with disease severity. Disease-specific volatiles were observed. The F. sambucinum chromatogram had two unique peaks at retention time (RT) = 14.1 and 17.3 min. P. infestans produced few peaks and the profile was quite similar to NON. In contrast, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, and Pythium ultimum produced many peaks, and the P. ultimum was different from the bacteria, in that the chromatogram peaks at RT = 4.04 and 8.76 min were absent. Instead, it produced a distinct peak at RT = 1.71 min. E. carotovora subsp. carotovora and E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica couldn't be discriminated based on unique peaks; however, they varied in concentration of volatiles produced. E. carotovora subsp. carotovora produced more of RT = 2.0 min and less of RT = 2.3 and 2.44 min than E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica. A back-propagation network (using neural networks) was developed to classify volatile profiles into six disease-groups. Cross-validation classification probabilities were NON = 71, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora = 71, E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica = 71, P. ultimum = 67, Phytophthora infestans = 46, and F. sambucinum = 75%.

Design: The multi-phasic sleep/wake schedule (MPS) began at approximately midnight and ended when net sleep reached 7.5 hours. Participants were awakened after every 5 min of REM sleep to obtain a maximum number of SOREMPs. Upon each awakening, mentation reports and subjective measurements were collected. Performance tests were then assigned. Setting: Sleep lab, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neurosciences, Japan. Participants: Thirteen healthy Japanese students (10 males) with high self-reported frequencies of ISPs but no other narcolepsy-related symptoms. Interventions: NA Measurements and results: From 184 sleep interruptions, 8 ISP episodes were obtained. In within participant comparisons between episodes with and without ISPs, the vigilance task (VT) reaction times were elevated before SOREMPs with ISPs. In between analyses (ISP vs non-ISP), the ISP group showed poorer performance, more complaints of physical, mental, and neurotic symptoms, increased subjective fatigue and increased stage 1 throughout the entire schedule. VT hit rates remained constant in the non-ISP group, but dropped in the later part of schedule in the ISP group. Subjective sleepiness dropped over time in the non-ISP group while it slightly increased in the ISP group. Conclusions: ISP is likely to appear as a phenotype of REM dissociation during SOREMP when participants with low tolerance for disrupted sleep-wake rhythms are placed in this type of schedule.

Specific binding of these selective ligands to neurons naturally expressing mu (mu) and delta (delta) opioid receptors (OR), respectively, resulted in their internalization into neuronal somas and processes, as indicated by the persistence of fluorescent labeling following removal of cell surface binding by hypertonic acid wash. This internalization was receptor-specific, as the fluorescent signal was completely abolished when the cells were concomitantly incubated with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. It also was clathrin-dependent, as it was totally prevented by the endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide. Accordingly, internalized ligands were detected inside small, endosome-like vesicles. These labeled vesicles accumulated within nerve cell bodies between 5-30 min of incubation with the fluorescent ligands. This accumulation was abolished after treatment with the anti-tubular agent nocodazole, suggesting that it was due to a microtubule-dependent, retrograde transport of the internalized ligands from processes to the soma. By contrast, there was no change in the compartmentalization of internalized mu OR or delta OR, as assessed by immunocytochemistry, suggesting that the latter were recycled locally. The present results provide the first demonstration of receptor-mediated internalization of opioid peptides in cultured neurons. It is proposed that their retrograde transport into target cells might be involved in mediating some of the long-term, transcriptional effects of opioids. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Previously Dakin and Herbert [Proc. Roy. Soc. B, 265 (1397) (1998) 659] reported that the spatial integration region (IR) for mirror symmetry in bandpass noise is scale invariant because its dimensions scale with the inverse of peak spatial frequency. In bandpass noise. however. peak spatial frequency covaries with stimulus numerosity (i.e. the total number of information samples) and density (i.e. the total number of infrormation samples per unit area). In this study.,e report four experiments that decoupled properties of the retinal image affected by viewing distance-spatial frequency. numerosity.

We found the IR size has a 2:1 height-to-width aspect ratio and integrates information from approximate to8 microclements regardless of their spatial separation. Our results reveal that Stimulus density plays a central role in the visual system's implementation of scale invariance. Using and ideal-observer. we demonstrate that scale invariance reflects genuine neural scale selection rather than a physical limitation on the Stimulus' information Content. Our findings that jitter resistance and IR size vary with the inverse of density challenge Current models of spatial vision but can be reconciled with a model that Compares the output of bandpass non-Fourier mechanisms to select spatial scales that match stimulus density.

In this study, we investigated the effects of green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and their principal catechins on the function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is involved in the multidrug resistance phenotype of cancer cells. GTPs (30 mug/ml) inhibit the photolabeling of P-gp by 75% and increase the accumulation of rhodamine-123 (R-123) 3-fold in the multidrug-resistant cell line CH(R)C5, indicating that GTPs interact with P-gp and inhibit its transport activity. Moreover, the modulation of P-gp transport by GTPs was a reversible process. Among the catechins present in GTPs, EGCG, ECG and CG are responsible for inhibiting P-gp. In addition, EGCG potentiates the cytotoxicity of vinblastine (VBL) in CH(R)C5 cells. The inhibitory effect of EGCG on P-gp was also observed in human Caco-2 cells, which form an intestinal epithelial-like monolayer. Our results indicate that, in addition to their anti-cancer properties, GTPS and more particularly EGCG inhibit the binding and efflux of drugs by P-gp. Thus, GTPs or EGCG might be potential agents for modulating the bioavailability of P-gp substrates at the intestine and the multidrug resistance phenotype associated with expression of this transporter in cancer cells.

Experiments were also done using brain slices to assess whether any compensation phenomenon had taken place in key receptors known to control 5-HT and norepinephrine release. The mean firing rate of 5-HT neurons was nearly doubled in 5-HT1A mice, although 65% of the neurons were firing in their normal range. In preloaded brain slices, the 5-HT1D/B receptor agonist sumatriptan equally inhibited the electrically evoked release of [H-3]5-HT in mesencephalic slices (containing the dorsal and median raphe) from wildtype and 5-HT1A -/- mice. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP 93129 (1,4-dihydro-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-5H-pyrrol (3, 2-b) pyridin-5-one) and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK14,304 (5-bromo-N-(4, 5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine) produced the same inhibitory effect in both groups of mice in hippocampus and frontal cortex slices. No difference was observed on the UK14,304-mediated inhibition of [(3) H]norepinephrine from preloaded slices of the two latter structures between the two groups of mice. In conclusion, the loss of control of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor in 5-HT1A-/- mice lead to a significant enhancement of 5-HT neuronal firing, but it did not alter 5-HT or norepinephrine release in any of the brain structures examined. In addition, it was not associated with changes in the function of 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B autoreceptors and of alpha(2)-adrenergic heteroreceptors on 5-HT neurons, nor of that of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors on norepinephrine terminals.

Yet, the relative importance of the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei, as well as the nature of the dynamic functional changes occurring between these and other motor-related structures during learning, remains in dispute. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a motor sequence learning paradigm in humans, we found evidence of an experience-dependent shift of activation from the cerebellar cortex to the dentate nucleus during early learning, and from a cerebellar-cortical to a striatal-cortical network with extended practice. The results indicate that intrinsic modulation within the cerebellum, in concert with activation of motor-related cortical regions, serves to set up a procedurally acquired sequence of movements that is then maintained elsewhere in the brain.

Few studies show the existence of areas involved in the representation of egocentred space in healthy humans. We investigated with fMRI and a conjunction protocol, the overlap of activity between optokinetic stimulation and a task of midline computation. Results showed that the right posterior parietal and frontal cortices were involved in both tasks (p < 0.0001). The evidence presented in this study provides the neuroanatomical substrate involved in the recovery of neglect during vestibular stimulation. This last point is of clinical interest for the rehabilitation of hemineglect. NeuroReport 13:61-65 (C) 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

This disorder refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive deficits, socioaffective disturbance, or lack of environmental stimulation. This musical impairment Is diagnosed in a middle-aged woman, hereafter referred to as Monica, who lacks most basic musical abilities, including melodic discrimination and recognition, despite normal audiometry and above-average intellectual, memory, and language skills. The results of psychophysical tests show that Monica has severe difficulties with detecting pitch changes. The data suggest that music-processing difficulties may result from problems in fine-grained discrimination of pitch, much in the same way as many language-processing difficulties arise from deficiencies in auditory temporal resolution.

J	Forget, MA; Desrosiers, RR; Gingras, D; Beliveau, R				Forget, MA; Desrosiers, RR; Gingras, D; Beliveau, R			Phosphorylation states of Cdc42 and RhoA regulate their interactions with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor and their extraction from biological membranes	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ionic strength; rho; small GTP-binding proteins; GDI	GTP-BINDING PROTEINS; KINASE-A; NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; CYTOSKELETON; ACTIVATION; GTPASES; COMPLEX; FAMILY	The Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) regulates the activation-inactivation cycle of Rho small GTPases, such as Cdc42 and RhoA, by extracting them from the membrane. To study the roles of Mg2+, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), ionic strength and phosphorylation on the interactions of RhoGDI with Cdc42 and RhoA, we developed a new, efficient and reliable method to produce prenylated Rho proteins using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been previously reported that protein kinase A (PKA)-treatment of isolated membranes increased RhoA extraction from membranes by RhoGDI [Lang, Gesbert, Delespine-Carmagnat, Stancou, Pouchelet and Bertoglio (1996) EMBO J. 16, 510-519]. In the present study, we used an in vitro affinity chromatography system to show that phosphorylation of RhoA and Cdc42 significantly increased their interaction with RhoGDI under physiological conditions of ionic strength. This increase was independent of the nucleotide (GDP or guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) loaded on to the Rho proteins, as well as of Mg2+ and PIP2. Moreover, dephosphorylation of rat brain membranes by alkaline phosphatase significantly decreased the extraction of RhoA and Cdc42 by RhoGDI. Subsequent re-phosphorylation by PKA restored the extraction levels, indicating the reversibility of this process. These results clearly demonstrate that the phosphorylation states of Cdc42 and RhoA regulate their interactions with RhoGDI and, consequently, their extraction from rat brain membranes. We therefore suggest that phosphorylation is a mechanism of regulation of Cdc42 and RhoA activity that is independent or GDP GTP cycling.

Neuroleptic-responder (R; n = 36) and -nonresponder (NR; n = 39) schizophrenic patients were recruited according to a priori defined criteria of responsiveness to typical neuroleptics. Seven neuropsychological domains were assessed and compared between groups: attention-vigilance, abstraction-flexibility, spatial organization, visual-motor processing, visual memory, verbal abilities, and verbal memory and learning. All measures were standardized using the scores of 36 healthy volunteers. NR schizophrenic patients performed worse in all neuropsychological domains compared to normal controls and R schizophrenic patients. However, only performances on visual memory, verbal abilities, and verbal memory and learning were significantly poorer in NR compared to R patients. Only the latter domain significantly differentiated NR patients from the other two groups. R patients performed at an intermediate level in all domains. This report of differences in neuropsychological profile between neuroleptic-responder and -nonresponder schizophrenic patients adds to the growing evidence supporting the value of distinguishing schizophrenic patients on the basis of their therapeutic response to neuroleptics.

For example, long-term potentiation (LTIP) that endures for more than an hour requires both transcription and translation. The signal-transduction mechanisms that couple synaptic events to protein translational machinery during long-lasting synaptic plasticity, however, are not well understood. One signaling pathway that is stimulated by growth factors and results in the translation of specific mRNAs includes the rapamycin-sensitive kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP and RAFT-1). Several components of this translational signaling pathway, including mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor-4E-binding proteins 1 and 2, and eukaryotic initiation factor-4E, are present in the rat hippocampus as shown by Western blot analysis, and these proteins are detected in the cell bodies and dendrites in the hippocampal slices by immunostaining studies. in cultured hippocampal neurons, these proteins are present in dendrites and are often found near the presynaptic protein, synapsin I. At synaptic sites, their distribution completely overlaps with a postsynaptic protein, PSD-95. These observations suggest the postsynaptic localization of these proteins. Disruption of mTOR signaling by rapamycin results in a reduction of late-phase LTP expression induced by high-frequency stimulation; the early phase of LTIP is unaffected. Rapamycin also blocks the synaptic potentiation induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampal slices. These results demonstrate an essential role for rapamycin-sensitive signaling in the expression of two forms of synaptic plasticity that require new protein synthesis. The localization of this translational signaling pathway at postsynaptic sites may provide a mechanism that controls local protein synthesis at potentiated synapses.

Parkin functions as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase, coordinating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins and thereby targeting them for degradation by the proteasome. We now report that the extreme C terminus of parkin, which is selectively truncated by a Parkinson's disease-causing mutation, functions as a class II PDZ-binding motif that binds CASK the mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans Lin-2, but not other PDZ proteins in brain extracts. Importantly, parkin co-localizes with CASK at synapses in cultured cortical neurons as well as in postsynaptic densities and lipid rafts in brain. Further, parkin associates not only with CASK but also with other postsynaptic proteins in the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-signaling complex, in rat brain in vivo. Finally, despite exhibiting E2-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity, rat brain parkin does not ubiquitinate CASK, suggesting that CASK may function in targeting or scaffolding parkin within the postsynaptic complex rather than as a direct substrate for parkin-mediated ubiquitination. These data implicate for the first time a PDZ-mediated interaction between parkin and CASK in neurodegeneration and possibly in ubiquitination of proteins involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity.

For this purpose, Principal Components Analysis is performed on a set of normal subjects for the creation of a multi-dimensional space representative of a normal population. New data for normal and TLE subjects are projected in this space, under the assumption that the distributions of the projections are not identical and can be used for classification. It is shown that Linear Discriminant Analysis of the eigencoordinates of the projected data can be used to classify normals vs TLE with a 70% accuracy based on only 10 eigenvectors. This results can go up to 100% if all eigenvectors defining the grey-level space are used.

This removable shielding system, known as the "NeuroShield" consists of a "U" shaped lead plate attached to the removable head-rest with a plastic coupling piece. Bolus water activation studies, with injected activities ranging from 170 to. 750 MBq were performed before the NeuroShield was installed. Based on the known improvements at 370 Bq, and the way the dead time and random count rates change with activity the NEC was calculated with and without additional shielding. The glucose utilization studies were done on the same subjects first without, then with NeuroShield in place. Forty minutes after injection of 110 MBq F-18-FDG, subjects were scanned for one minute with the scanner's normal headrest. The subject then sat up to allow the NeuroShield to be installed, and a ten-minute emission followed by a ten-minute transmission scan were done in the same position. During the entire scan, a "rates" file recorded the prompt and delayed count-rates and live time every five seconds. Since the NeuroShield is not fixed in the gantry, its effectiveness at different axial positions was also measured. Count-rates from four subjects undergoing serial Raclopride studies were also evaluated as a function of shield position. The shielding was slightly more effective when placed forward of the field of view. The NEC improves by 24% in the early frames of the se studies. The percentage of random counts improved for the FDG studies from 17 to 12%/100 MBq of injected activity. The NEC in bolus water studies improves by up to 45% with additional shielding. Most of this improvement comes from a reduction in random counts(1).

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc			TRACKING; BRAIN	in magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the direction and magnitude of diffusion of water molecules is characterized by a diffusion tensor. In the central nervous system, the highly organized fibre structure of white matter fibre tracts causes the diffusion to be anisotropic. From the DTI data, one can calculate a vector field representing the preferred direction of diffusion at each imaging voxel, which corresponds to the orientation of white matter fibres. However, the reconstruction of continuous fibre tracts from such data remains a challenge because the measurements are dense and typically quite noisy. In this paper we introduce a geometric flow to address this problem. The key ideas are: 1) to locally extend the vector field in its orthogonal plane and 2) to model the fibres as very thin tubes, by introducing a constraint on the minimum cross-sectional curvature.

Considerable gains have been achieved in the classification performance by fusing and combining different classifiers. We experiment a new method for ship infrared imagery recognition based on the fusion of individual results in order to obtain a more reliable decision [1]. To optimize the results of every class of ship, we implemented individual classifiers using Dempster-Shafer(DS) method for each class i.e. an individual classifier returns if the ship belongs to the class or not. We compare the result of the DS classifier with the results of the individual classifier. The improvement recognition varies between 3% to 20% for a class. We then experiment a new method based on a fusion of a set of classifiers [2]. The objective of a good fuser is to perform at least as good as the best classifier in any situation. For this purpose, we consider three classifiers: DS classifier, Bayes classifier and nearest neighbor classifier and one fuser: feedforward neural network fuser. We compare the results of the best classifier with the results of the fusion of a combination of classifiers. The fuser gives a performance equal or superior to the best classifier.

We present different system architectures to extract features that are more invariant to non-speakers-related conditions such as handset types and channel effects: (a) the first approach uses a Dynamic Programming Vector Quantization (DPVQ) Algorithm. (b) The second approach uses a simple Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) network. (c) Finally the MLP uses DPVQ as an input to the network to maximize the separation between speakers by nonlinearly projecting a large set of acoustic features to a lower-dimensional feature set. The architecture proposed takes into account both the temporal changing of the speech signal and the powerful of the neural networks. The extracted features are optimized to discriminate between speakers and to be robust to mismatched training and testing conditions. The transformed features are used to train an HMM-based Speaker Identification system. The proposed architectures have been trained and tested over 60 speaker's Yoho corpus. The results have shown an average improvement of Speaker Identification performance by more than 18% compared to an HMM-Based reference system.

Despite intensive research the basic pathophysiology of ALS remains unclear. Although most cases are sporadic, similar to 10% of ALS cases are familial (FALS). Mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause similar to 20% of FALS. The gene(s) responsible for the remaining 80% of FALS remain to be found. Using a large European kindred without SOD1 mutation and with classic autosomal dominant adult-onset ALS, we have identified a novel locus by performing a genome scan and linkage analysis. The maximum LOD score is 4.5 at recombination fraction 0.0, for polymorphism D18S39. Haplotype analysis has identified a 7.5-cM, 8-Mb region of chromosome 18q21, flanked by markers D18S846 and D18S1109, as a novel FALS locus.

To study their potential to improve long-term results of endovascular treatment of aneurysms, we conducted experimental studies in canine aneurysm models. METHODS: Venous pouch carotid aneurysms were constructed in dogs. Results of coil embolization of lateral wall and bifurcation aneurysms were compared. A lateral wall model of embolization with gelatin sponges was used to study the effects of coating sponges with cyanoacrylate on angiographic results and neointima thickness at 3 and 12 weeks. These models were also used to investigate the control of endovascular cyanoacrylate deposition, alone or over a coil placed at the neck of the treated lesions. The results of endovascular cyanoacrylate embolization of bifurcation aneurysms were compared with those of coil embolization at 3 months. RESULTS: Bifurcation aneurysms treated with coils showed more frequent recurrences (P < .01) and thinner neointimas (P < .01) at 3 months than did lateral wall aneurysms. Cyanoacrylate-coated sponges improved angiographic results (P < .05) and led to thicker neointimas at 3 and 12 weeks (P < .05) as compared with uncoated sponges. Endovascular cyanoacrylate deposition with microcatheters led to stray emboli in all cases. Cyanoacrylate delivery was improved by a single coil positioned at the neck of the aneurysm, but parent vessel embolization still occurred in 25% of the animals. Cyanoacrylate embolization of bifurcation aneurysms improved angiographic results at 3 months as compared with coil embolization (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Cyanoacrylate embolization is currently difficult to control. It has the potential to decrease recurrences after endovacular treatment of aneurysms, but a safe method for endovascular delivery has yet to be developed.

Multiple factors may predict mortality including initial response to therapy, viral factors and host immune parameters. Due to the complexity of this problem, we developed Artificial Intelligence based tools/Neural Network (NN) to optimally evaluate outcomes of therapy and predict morbidity and mortality. To further validate the accuracy of these tools, we challenged their performance with that of Cox regression modeling (RM). Our study population involved 116 HIV+ individuals who consistently maintained CD4+ count < 50 cells/mL for over 6 months. All patients were treated with antiretrovirals. To assess clinical outcomes, we developed a feedforward backpropagation Neural Network. We then compared the performance of this network to a Cox regression model. The Neural Network outscored the Cox regression model in the ROC curve areas: 0.888 vs 0.760 (HIV+ first Seropositivity to AIDS), 0.901 vs 0.758 (HIV+ first Seropositivity to Last Assessment incl. death) and 0.832 vs 0.799 (AIDS to Last Assessment incl. death), for the NN & Cox, respectively. In patients with a history of AIDS defining events and with severe T-Cell depletion, mortality occurs despite therapy. Although Neural Networks and Cox modeling were successful in predicting mortality, the Neural Network was superior in assessing risk in this population.

Linkage analysis of the four microsatellite markers among the 19 NF1 families indicates that the four microsatellites are strongly linked with NF1 disease (LOD = 2.76-3.64). The four markers are associated (P = 0-0.077) except marker pair IVS26-2.3/IVS27AC33.1 (P = 0.18 or 0.17). However. perhaps due to the high mutation rate of the NF1 gene, no founder effect for NF1 was detected in the Quebec French Canadians. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

In particular, the possibility of image compression using Neural Networks (NNs) has been considered by many researchers in recent years, and several Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs) have been proposed with reported promising experimental results. Constructive One-Hidden-Layer Feedforward Neural Network (OHL-FNN) is one such architecture. At previous SPIE conferences, we have proposed a new constructive OHL-FNN using Hermite polynomials for regression and recognition problems, and good experimental results were demonstrated. In this paper, we first modify and then apply our proposed OHL-FNN to compress still and moving images and investigate its performance in terms of both training and generalization capabilities. Extensive experimental results for still images (Lena, Lake, and Girl) and moving images ("football game") are presented. It is revealed that the performance of the constructive OHL-FNN using Hermite polynomials is quite good for both still and moving image compression.

If ischemia is sustained, reperfusion with the needed oxygen can result in tissue injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) due to formation of reactive oxygen species. We are studying an oxygen-carrying solution with anitoxidant activity formed by cross-linking hemoglobin, superoxide dismutase, and catalase to form PolyHb-SOD-CAT. The present report studies its effect on the blood-brain barrier and cerebral edema when used in a transient global brain ischemia-reperfusion rat model. We compare this solution to sham-control, oxygenated saline, stroma-free hemoglobin (SF-Hb), polymerized hemoglobin (PolyHb), and a mixture of SF-Hb, SOD, and CAT in free solution. The results show that the cross-linked PolyHb-SOD-CAT solution, unlike the other solutions, can supply oxygen to ischemic tissues without causing reperfusion injury in the transient global brain ischemia-reperfusion model.

However, a disproportion in prevalence of brain damage between the sexes in childhood may be less suspected. Furthermore, sex-specific risk for other aetiologies of brain damage may be little known, whether in the pediatric or adult populations. Proposals of a sex difference in cognitive recovery from brain damage have also been controversial. Six hundred and thirty five "consecutive" cases with cortical focal lesions including cases of all ages and both sexes were reviewed. Aetiology of the lesion was determined for each case as was postlesion IQ. Risk was highly male prevalent in all age groups, with a predominance of cardiovascular aetiology explaining much of the adult male prevalence. However, several other aetiological categories were significantly male prevalent in juveniles (mitotic, traumatic,dysplasic) and adults (mitotic, traumatic). There was no sex difference in outcome (i.e., postlesion IQ) of these cortical brain lesions for the cohort as a whole, after statistical removal of the influence of lesion extent, aetiology and presence of epilepsy. Mechanisms potentially responsible for sex differences in prevalence, aetiology of brain damage, and recovery, are reviewed and discussed.

We previously demonstrated that, in cultured rat astroglia, cysteamine (CSH) upregulates heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promotes the transformation of normal mitochondria into CA-like inclusions. In the current study, primary cultures of neonatal rat astroglia were exposed to 880 muM CSH for three months in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, a suppressor of HO-1 gene transcription. Cells were double-labeled with periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS) and antisera against ubiquitin, HO-1, or a mitochondrial epitope. CA were quantified and their immunostaining characteristics analyzed using confocal microscopy. HO-1 immunofluorescence was more abundant in cultures exposed to CSH alone relative to untreated control cultures and cultures exposed to both CSH and dexamethasone. Mature CA appeared as large (5-50 muM), spherical or polygonal, intensely PAS-positive inclusions within glial cytoplasm or deposited extracellularly. The inclusions manifested intense rim and, less commonly, homogeneous or stippled patterns of immunoreactivity for ubiquitin, HO-1, and the mitochondrial marker. Monolayers exposed to CSH exhibited 660% more CA relative to untreated controls (P < 0.05). Numbers of CA in cultures exposed to CSH were diminished by co-administration of 50 &mu;g/ml dexamethasone (P < 0.05 relative to CSH alone) or 100 mug/ml dexamethasone (P < 0.05 relative to CSH alone).

In VSMC from the rat aorta, ouabain inhibited maximal Na/K pump activity measured as the rate of Rb-86 influx in Na+-loaded cells, with an ID50 of similar to20-30 muM without any differences between two strains of normotensive rats (WKY and BN.lx) and three substrains of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Half-maximal inhibition of the Na/K pump in REC from the rat inner medullary collecting duct was observed at similar to20 muM of ouabain. In contrast to rat cells, half-maximal inhibition of Rb-86 influx in VSMC from human coronary arteries and in REC from the Madin-Darby canine kidney was seen at similar to0.03 and 0.1 muM Ouabain. respectively. At concentrations lower than 100 muM. ouabain did not affect the intracellular content of exchangeable Na+ and K+ in rat VSMC, measured as the steady-state distribution of Na-22 and Rb-86. whereas in human VSMC, it increased the intracellular Na+/K+ ratio with an ID50 of similar to0.5 muM. Keeping in mind that the circulating level of administered digitalis and EO does not exceed 10(-9) M, Our results strongly suggest that the involvement of these compounds in the pathogenesis of hypertension in rats is not mediated by inhibition of the alpha1-isoform of the Na/K pump in VSMC and REC. Alternative mechanisms of the involvement of EO and ouabain-like factors in the development of hypertension are considered.

In order to study different stages of odour memory, recognition of a 'list' of odours was tested after a first exposure, again after four exposures and once more after a 24 h delay interval. Patients with resection from a temporal lobe performed significantly less well than control subjects on all trials, and no significant differences were noted as a function of side of resection, indicating that there is not a strong hemispheric superiority for this task. The PET data yielded different levels of activity in piriform cortex (primary olfactory cortex), in relation to the 'no-odour' baseline scan, depending on the type of processing: no increase in activity noted during odour encoding, a small increase bilaterally during short-term recognition and a larger increase bilaterally during long-term recognition. These findings, together with findings in animal studies, suggest that piriform cortex may have an active role in odour memory processing, not simply in odour perception. Taken together, the findings from the lesion study and functional brain imaging of healthy subjects suggest that olfactory memory requires input from left and right temporal lobe regions for optimal odour recognition, and that, unlike with verbal or non-verbal visual material, there is not a strong functional lateralization for olfactory memory.

We evaluated the contributions of these systems to saccade latencies, and used functional MRI to identify the neural substrates of these systems. We found that advance knowledge of the direction and the timing of an impending target movement had both overlapping and discrete effects on saccade latencies and on neural activation. Knowledge of either factor decreased regular saccade latencies. However, knowledge of target direction increased the number of predictive and express saccades while knowledge of target timing did not. The brain activation data showed that advance knowledge of the direction or the timing of the target movement activated primarily overlapping structures. The precentral gyrus, in the region of the frontal eye fields, was more active in conditions in which some aspect of the target movement was predictable than in saccade control and fixation conditions. In the basal ganglia, activation discriminated between advance knowledge of target timing and target direction. The lenticular nuclei were more active when only target timing was known in advance, while the caudate was more active when only target direction was known in advance. These data suggest that the neural structures supporting the 'where' and 'when' systems are highly overlapping, although there is some dissociation subcortically. Knowledge of target timing and target direction converge in precentral gyrus, a region where there is strong evidence of context-dependent modulation of neural activity.

Data acquired during activation with arterial CO2 levels stabilized to normal values suggest an invariant flow-metabolism coupling relationship, but CO2-related variations in cerebral blood flow combined additively with activation-related flow responses, with negligible interaction between focal and systemic effects. These findings are inconsistent with the existence of a strictly homeostatic feedback scheme for the regulation of cerebral blood flow, and support the existence of multiple independent pathways of cerebrovascular control.

This neurovascular coupling is achieved by several mechanisms that are still poorly understood but ionic, glial, metabolic, and neuronal factors have been involved. In the present investigation, we provide evidence that specific populations of cortical interneurons, which play a central role in integrating multiple incoming local and afferent synaptic and paracrine signals, could act as local integrators of the neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow. We suggest that different subpopulations of cortical gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) interneurons, which colocalize specific vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and neuropeptide Y (NPY), could serve as a functional relay in the neurovascular coupling that accompanies the activation of basal forebrain acetylcholine (ACh) and brainstem raphe nucleus serotonin (5-HT)-neurons. Thus, in addition to direct changes in the microvascular tone induced by ACh and 5-HT fibers projecting to cortical microvessels, these neurons also send projections to NO, VIP and/or NPY interneurons which, via their direct neurovascular projections, could affect the microvascular tone and therein adapt changes in perfusion to the local changes in neuronal activity. The results suggest that specific populations of GABA interneurons constitute a functional unit with their respective neuronal and vascular effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This activation is likely the result of the convergence of a number of factors, several of which could be attenuated with the use of an Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In order to assess this, rats had a myocardial infarction (MI) created by coronary artery ligation and were followed for 28 days without treatment to permit the development of CHF. At that time, the ACE inhibitor quinapril was started, or rats remained untreated and were followed a further 56 days for a total of 84 days. Half of the untreated rats had quinapril started 3 days prior to sacrifice, on day 81. Starting quinapril at either 28 or 81 days had little effect on cardiac hemodynamics, or ventricular remodeling. Quinapril did however attenuate the MI-induced rise in cardiac cytokine expression (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-1beta, -5 and -6). Thus, in CHF, ACE inhibitors attenuate the rise in cardiac cytokine expression. This study helps to identify a new mechanism by which ACE inhibitors may exert their beneficial effects in CHF.

Pigs were assigned to a normal control group and a MPTP-poisoned group, members of which received no further treatment, or which received bilateral grafts to the striatum of tissue blocks harvested from E28 fetal pig mesencephalon with and without immunosuppressive treatment after grafting, or with additional co-grafting with immortalized rat neural cells transfected to produce GDNF. In the baseline condition, and again at 3 and 6 months postsurgery, all animals were subjected to quantitative [F-18]fluorodopa PET scans and testing for motor impairment. At the end of 6 months, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons were counted in the grafts by stereological methods. The MPTP poisoning persistently reduced the magnitude of k(3)(D), the relative activity of DOPA decarboxylase in striatum, by 60%. Grafting restored the rate of [F-18]fluorodopa decarboxylation to the normal range, and normalized the scores in motor function. The biochemical and functional recovery was associated with survival of approximately 100,000 TH-positive graft neurons in each hemisphere. Immunosuppression did not impart a greater recovery of [F-18]fluorodopa uptake, nor were the number of TH-positive graft neurons or the volumes of the grafts increased in the immunosuppressed group. Contrary to expectation, co-grafting of transfected GDNF-expressing HiB5 cells, a rat-derived neural cell line, tended to impair the survival of the grafts with the lowest values for graft volumes, TH-positive cell numbers, behavioral scores, and relative DOPA decarboxylase activity. From the results we conclude that pig ventral mesencephalic allografts can restore functional dopamine innervation in adult MPTP-lesioned minipigs.

In support of this, we found previously basic FGF/FGF-2 can inhibit MB progression by inducing neuronal-like differentiation, slowing the growth, and triggering apoptosis of a MB cell line we established from a histopathologically classic tumor (R. L. Kenigsberg et al., Am. J. Pathol., 151: 867-881, 1997). In the present study, the usefulness of this approach is additionally investigated. We report that of the five FGFs found in the developing cerebellum, only two, FGF-2 and FGF-9, possess antitumoral activity for MB. This activity is only noted for cell lines that originate from classic (UM-MB1 and SYR) rather than desmoplastic (HSJ) tumors. Whereas these FGFs inhibit proliferation of both classic cell lines, they only advance neuronal differentiation and induce apoptosis of one, UM-MB1. Consistent with these responses, after FGF treatment, levels of neurofilaments and the proapoptotic modulator Bax only increase in UM-MB1, whereas the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1 (p27), which accumulates in cerebellar neuronal precursors before they exit the cell cycle, goes up in both UM-MB1 and SYR. Finally, although the histological variant of MB may help predict the sensitivity of MB to the FGFs, the selectivity, specificity, and type of response elicited may be dictated by, as evident by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, the expression of certain FGF receptor types.

The identification of molecular markers would offer a complementary tool for characterizing tumors with respect to their clinical behavior. In this study we determined the expression levels of 3 small GTP binding proteins (RhoA, RhoB and Rac1), of their inhibitor RhoGDI and of caveolin-1 in 24 human astrocytic tumors of grades I to IV. Our results demonstrated that the expression of RhoA and RhoB decreased significantly in all brain tumors studied and was inversely related with tumor of grade II to IV malignancy. The amount of caveolin-1 immunodetected was not significantly different from normal brain samples while the Rac1 expression level was diminished in astrocytic tumors of grades III and IV. Our finding that RhoA and RhoB expression levels are correlated to tumor malignancy suggests that they may serve as novel and efficient diagnostic markers for astrocytic brain tumors of histological grade II to IV and complement currently applied histopathological analysis.

Methods: We first measured the conductivity of the methacrylate used for cranioplasty. Then, we designed realistic boundary element method head models with a skull burr hole, a methacrylate plug or a temporal-lobe resection. We simulated the potentials that would be produced at 71 electrode locations (10/10 system) by dipoles located near the defects. Then, we fitted dipoles on these potentials using a defect-free head model. We also ran simulations in a noisy situation and with higher skull and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) conductivity. Results: The largest errors were found for burr holes, with a localization error up to 20 mm for a radial dipole located 30 mm below the hole and an amplification factor of 8. Methacrylate plugs lead to errors up to 5 mm and 0.5; the resection only lead to errors of 2 mm and 1.3. Results obtained with noise were consistent with those obtained without noise. Doubling the skull conductivity led to errors that were reduced by 10-20%, while doubling CSF conductivity increased the errors by up to 31%. Conclusions: We have shown that it is important to incorporate skull defects in realistic head models when sources are located near the defects and precision is sought. Brain cavities of the size of atypical anterior temporal lobe resection may be omitted without a significant impact on dipole localization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ICS is an imaging analog of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) optimized for measuring the aggregation state of fluorescently labeled macromolecules on the surface of biological cells. The ICS method entails spatial autocorrelation analysis of fluorescence fluctuations within an image sampled from an area of the sample as well as temporal autocorrelation analysis of fluorescence fluctuations through a time series of images. Together, the spatial/temporal autocorrelation analysis enables measurement of fluorophore concentration, aggregation state and transport properties. ICS was first implemented on a confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) using single photon excitation. More recently we have extended the method for two-photon ICS as well as image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS). ICCS allows measurement of co-localization of non-identical molecules labeled with fluorophores of different emission wavelengths. We present a variety of applications of the ICS and ICCS methods in cellular systems. We will discuss the measurement of the transport and clustering properties of membrane receptors by single photon ICS and two-photon ICCS. As well, we will describe how spatial ICS may be used to quantify the distribution of fluorescently labeled dendritic spines in neurons.

It reviews the two main classes of neural network models: the gradient-based neural networks such as the Hopfield network, and the deformable template approaches such as the elastic net method and self-organizing maps. In each class, the original model is presented, its limitations discussed, and subsequent developments and extensions are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on stochastic and chaotic variations on the neural network models designed to improve the optimization performance. Finally, the performance of these neural network models is compared and discussed relative to other heuristic approaches.

Most of these side effects are believed to be mediated by central opioid receptors; therefore, hydrophilic opioids, which don't cross the blood-brain barrier, may have advantages over morphine in some clinical applications. We recently synthesized several analogues of DALDA (Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2), a highly hydrophilic peptide derived from the endogenous opioid peptide dermorphin; all of them, particularly [Dmt(1)] DALDA (Dmt - 2',6'-dimethyl tyrosine), had high potency and selectivity at mu receptors, the target of morphine, in activity assays. Here we report the pharmacological characterization of [Dmt(1)] DALDA in the whole animal. [Dmt(1)]DALDA was 40 times more potent than morphine in inducing antinociception in mice when both drugs were given s.c., and 6-14 times more potent than DAMGO, a selective mu agonist, when both drugs were given it. However, [Dmt(1)]DALDA showed poor cross-tolerance to morphine; thus chronic morphine treatment of animals increased the antinociceptive AD(50) of systemic [Dmt(1)]DALDA two fold or less, as compared to an 8-9-fold increase for morphine and a 4-5-fold increase for DAMGO. The antinociceptive activity of [Dmt(1)]DALDA (i.t) was blocked by CTAP, a selective mu antagonist, but not by TIPPpsi, a selective delta antagonist, nor by nor-BNI, a selective K antagonist. [Dmt(1)]DALDA-induced antinociception was also blocked by naloxone methiodide, an antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, when agonist and antagonist were given i.t. or i.c.v., but not when they were given s.c. We conclude that [Dmt(1)] DALDA is a highly potent analgesic acting at mu receptors. Though it appears to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, it exhibits low cross-tolerance to morphine, suggesting that it may have advantages over the latter in certain clinical applications.

NTFs also regulate several other cell populations such as lymphoid, epithelial, oligoglia, and mast cells. Disregulation of the NTFs or their receptors plays a key role (etiological or upstream) in certain human pathologies. Hyperactivity may lead to inflammatory pain, or some forms of cancer by autocrine/paracrine growth. Loss of activity may lead to neurodegeneration, neuropathic pain, or some forms of cancer by absence of differentiation. Consequently the NTFs and their receptors are important therapeutic targets, and pharmacological modulation may have applications ranging from treatment of chronic or acute neurodegeneration, some forms of cancer, and chronic pain (with agonists); and some forms of cancer or acute pain (with antagonists).

Seventy-one SGA children, aged 7 to 9 years (gestational ages, 24-41 weeks) and 16 full-term appropriate-for-gestational-age control. children of comparable socioeconomic backgrounds and age at testing completed tests assessing intelligence, receptive language, working memory, problem solving, visual-motor integration, phonological awareness, reading, and spelling. SGA children were subdivided into head-growth pattern groups based on their head circumference at birth and at 9 months postterm. Analyses showed that SGA children with poor prenatal and postnatal head growth had the worst outcomes, followed by those with prenatal brain compromise, but good postnatal head growth. SGA children with preserved head growth in utero as well as good head growth after birth demonstrated the best outcomes, although spelling skills were deficient relative to full-term peers. The Verbal and Full Scale IQ ratings of the SGA children who had experienced brain compromise in utero declined significantly from 5 to 8 years of age. We conclude that mild intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has a minimal effect on the development of cognitive or academic abilities, providing that brain growth in utero is not affected. IUGR that slows brain growth in utero impairs the acquisition of some cognitive and academic abilities, even when followed by good catch-up head growth after birth, whereas poor brain growth in utero followed by little or no catch-up head growth results in widespread impairments. Findings highlight the limits to brain plasticity and emphasize the importance of optimal prenatal and postnatal brain growth.

These problems, however, appear to be related more to the combination of cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC) than to ITC alone. In this study, we evaluated a homogenous group of 19 girls between the ages of 7 and 11 years, 30 months after the completion of treatment. Nine received cranial radiation and chemotherapy and 10 were treated with chemotherapy alone. The patients were compared to 10 normal healthy controls. Neuropsychological tests included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III), the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C), and the Calculation and Passage Comprehension subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised. Results confirmed the presence of a verbal learning deficit in ALL girls treated with the combination of ITC and CRT. The ITC and CRT group scored significantly lower than the healthy controls on the Passage Comprehension subtest and on 5 of the 6 verbal subtests of the WISC-III. Furthermore, compared to nonirradiated patients and healthy normal controls, the ITC and CRT group was impaired on the Freedom from Distractibility index of the WISC-III, indicating an auditory-verbal attention deficit. On the CVLT-C, the ITC and CRT group was particularly impaired on the second half of the learning trials compared to the other two groups, showing a plateau in their performance. The ITC group was not different from the healthy control group, suggesting a less detrimental effect of the ITC alone on verbal abilities. Globally, these results indicate a deficit affecting auditory attention and verbal learning in girls who receive ITC and CRT, which may suggest the necessity for special educational assistance for these children.

We attempted to examine the long-term effect of seizures using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI), which can quantify neuronal loss or dysfunction based on reduced signals from the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA). We performed H-1-MRSI in 82 consecutive patients with medically intractable, non-foreign-tissue TLE to determine whether there was a correlation between seizure frequency, type or duration of epilepsy and NAA to creatine ratios (NAA/Cr). Spectroscopic resonance intensities were categorized as to whether they were measured from the temporal lobe ipsilateral or contralateral to the predominant EEG focus. lpsilateral and contralateral NAA/Cr was negatively correlated with duration of epilepsy. Furthermore, patients with frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures had lower NAA/Cr than patients with no or rare generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The results suggest that although an early injury may cause asymmetric temporal lobe damage that is present at the onset of epilepsy, generalized seizures may induce additional neuronal damage that progresses over the course of the disease.

Because estradiol (E) arises mainly from the conversion of T in men, the availability of E-2 also decreases with increasing age. In randomized clinical trials, E-2-replacement therapy has been shown to maintain aspects of cognition in postmenopausal Women, specifically on verbal memory. The present prospective, randomized, cross-over trial is being undertaken in order to determine whether E-2 will enhance verbal memory in men with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Men with MCI will randomly receive E-2 or placebo for the first 3 months of treatment and will then be crossed over to the other treatment for an additional 3 months. A battery of neuropsychological tests will be administered at pretreatment and, again, following each 3-month treatment phase. It is hypothesized that elderly men with MCI will perform better on tests of explicit memory when they are being treated with E-2. compared with their performance under placebo conditions. Evidence from epidemiological studies (Resnick, Metter, & Zonderman, 1997; Jacobs, Tang, Stein, et al., 1998; Halbreich, Lumley, Palter, et al., 1995) and prospective controlled studies of healthy elderly women (Sherwin,, 1988; Sherwin Phillips, 1990; Phillips & Sherwin,1992) has demonstrated that exogenous estrogen helps to maintain aspects of memory in aging women. There is also accumulating epidemiological evidence that postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy might lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women (Paganini-Hill & Henderson, 1994, 1996; Kawas, Resnick, Morrison, et al., 1997; Waring, Rocca, Peterson, & Kokmen, 1997) and/or might delay the onset of the disease (Tang, Jacobs, Stern, et al., 1996). Unlike in women, there is not a drastic decrease in testosterone (T) production in middle-aged men. However, the vast majority of studies have shown an age-associated decrease in T. It has been estimated that 50% of healthy men over the age of 50 years will have a BT level below the lowest level seen in 20- to 40-year-old healthy men (Morley, Kaiser, Perry, et al, 1997). Because some proportion of T is aromatized to estradiol (E-2), the decrease in the production of T also means that E-2 levels would decrease in men as they age. Despite our knowledge of these endocrine changes with normal aging, very little information is available to examine the possible influence of the diminishing levels of sex hormones on cognitive functioning in older men. There is a paucity of information on the possible effects of T on cognition in males. In male rats (Alexander, Packard, & Hines,1994), testosterone had rewarding affective properties and facilitated learning of associations using a place-preference task. However, intrahippocampal injections of E-2 enhanced spatial memory in intact male rats (Alexander, Packard, Nores, & Olson, 1994). This is consistent with the hypothesis that EZ aromatized from T determines sex differences in spatial functions in males. Correlational studies on sex hormones and cognition in young men have yielded inconsistent results. A positive, linear relationship between plasma levels of T and visuospatial ability and a negative linear relationship between T and verbal ability were found in European men (Christiansen & Knussman, 1987) and in African bushmen (Christiansen, 1993). Similarly, a positive relationship between T and visuospatial ability was also found in healthy but not in alcoholic men (Errico, Parson, Kling, & King, 1992). On the other hand, Kampen and Sherwin (1996) reported a positive correlation between plasma levels of E (2), but not T, and scores on tests of visual memory in healthy young men. Others have argued that a curvilinear relationship between T and spatial memory exists, such that both high and low plasma T levels dampen spatial abilities, while mid-level concentrations of T optimize them (Gouchle & Kimura, 1991). A second paradigm used to investigate effects of T on cognition involves testing hypogonadal men before and after treatment with T. Scores on tests of spatial ability were significantly lower in men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, compared with scores of healthy control men, but scores of those with acquired hypogonadism did not differ from those of the healthy controls (Hier & Crowley, 1982). When six of the hypogonadotropic hypogonadal men were treated with T for 3 months, their scores on tests of spatial ability failed to improve. These data, on a small number of Ss, suggest that the influence of androgens on spatial ability is exerted at or before puberty and does not wane with falling levels of androgens. In contradistinction, the administration of T to elderly hypogonadal men caused an increase in scores on the Block Design subtest of the WAIS-R, a test of visuospatial ability (Janowsky, Oviatt, & Orwoll, 1994), suggesting that spatial ability wanes with falling levels of T and can be restored by T administration. In a recent study of hypogonadal and eugonadal men who received exogenous T, no between-group differences on scores of visuospatial ability occurred (Alexander et al., 1998). However, in that study, plasma testosterone levels were in the hypogonadal range at the time of cognitive testing. Estradiol levels were not measured in that or in any other hormone replacement study of hypogonadal men. Neither were spatial abilities or visual memory tested. These methodological problems make these findings difficult to interpret. In a recent prospective study of hypogonadal men (mean age = 65 years), 15 participants randomly received placebo and 17 were given testosterone cypionate, 200 mg IM, every 14 to 17 days for 12 months (Sih et al., 1997). Testosterone improved bilateral grip strength and increased hemoglobin, but was not associated with significant changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) or with changes in lipoprotein lipid values. Neither were there changes on tests of verbal or visual memory or in verbal fluency. By chance, the T group had higher scores on these cognitive tests at baseline and their performance had not changed at posttreatment. However, a serious methodological problem concerns the fact that blood was sampled and cognitive testing was administered 14 to 17 days postinjection, at a time when Free T levels were at their nadir. Spatial skills were not tested in this study. Recently, we conducted a longitudinal study on a group of healthy elderly men, a group of women estrogen users, and a group of female estrogen nonusers, who were an average of 72 years of age. Most returned for a second test session 18 months to 2 years later, when they were approximately 74 years of age (Carlson & Sherwin, submitted). While plasma E-2 levels were significantly higher in the estrogen users than in the men and the estrogen-nonusers at both test times, plasma E-2 levels of the men were significantly higher than those of the women who did not use estrogen at both the 72- and the 74-year-old test times. Of course, plasma T levels were higher in the men, compared with both female groups, but their average T level fell within the lower third of the normal range of male values. Both the males and the female estrogen users also had higher scores on the Digit Span test, a measure of verbal memory, coincident with their higher E-2 levels. These findings show that, in absolute terms, 72- and 74-year-old healthy men had three times the concentration of E-2 in plasma and better scores on some tests of verbal memory, compared with age-matched women who did not use estrogen. Although these findings suggest that estrogen may be important for maintaining verbal memory in older men, as well as in older women, the correlational nature of this study precludes causal statements. In summary, while the evidence showing that estrogen maintains verbal memory in postmenopausal women is fairly consistent, the findings on the possible role of sex-steroid hormones on aspects of cognition in men are inconclusive. One explanation for the inconsistency between the male studies are the inherent methodological problems (failure to use a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests in any given study, failure to determine that T levels were in the physiological range during posttreatment testing, failure to measure all aspects of cognition). Another possible explanation, however, is the failure of these investigators to consider that T is aromatized to E-2, both peripherally and in brain tissue (Roof & Havens, 1992). Since the testicular production of its steroids decreases with increasing age but never ceases entirely, male brains have E-2 available lifelong. It is, therefore, possible that our 72- and 74-year-old men (Carlson & Sherwin, submitted) performed better on a test of verbal memory than age-matched women estrogen nonusers because of their higher levels of plasma E-2 and not because of their higher levels of plasma T. The finding that T replacement therapy given to hypogonadal men caused an increase in scores on a test of verbal fluency (Alexander et al., 1998) provides support for this hypothesis. Additional evidence comes from the positive relationship between E-2 levels and visual memory in young men (Kampen & Sherwin, 1996) and the enhancement of spatial memory by intrahippocampal injection of E-2 to male rats (Alexander et al., 1994). It may, therefore, be the case that it is E-2 aromatized from T, and not T itself, that maintains aspects of cognition in elderly men. None of the extant studies could address this possibility since they failed to measure E-2 levels or to administer E-2 to men. Interestingly, women with AD not taking estrogen replacement therapy performed significantly worse than men with AD on verbal fluency, when age and severity of dementia were controlled (Roof & Havens, 1992). Although plasma levels of E-2 were not measured in that study, we have reported that elderly men with AD also have higher E-2 levels than age-matched women estrogen nonusers with AD (Carlson & Sherwin, submitted).

The input data is processed first by a lexicon-driven word recognizer based on HMMs to generate a list of the candidate N-best-scoring word hypotheses as well as the segmentation of such word hypotheses into characters. An NN classifier is used to generate a score for each segmented character and in the end, the scores from the HMM and the NN classifiers are combined to optimize performance. Experimental results show that for an 80,000-word vocabulary, the hybrid HMM/NN system improves by about 10% the word recognition rate over the HMM system alone.

The system first segments implicitly a date image into sub-fields through the recognition process based on an HAIM-based approach. Afterwards, the three obligatory date sub-fields arc processed by the system (day, month and year). A neural approach has been adopted to work with strings of digits and a Markovian strategy to recognize and verify words. We also introduce the concept of meta-classes of digits, which is used to reduce the lexicon size of the day and year and improve the precision of their segmentation and recognition. Experiments show interesting results on date recognition.

A two-stage segmentation module has been proposed, namely the global segmentation stage and the local segmentation stage. At the global segmentation stage, a courtesy amount is coarsely segmented into sub-images according to the spatial relationships of the connected components. These sub-images are then verified by the recognition module and the rejected sub-images are sequentially split using contour analysis at the local segmentation stage. Two neural network classifiers are combined into a recognition module. The isolated digit classifier divides the input patterns into ten numeral classes ('0'-'9'), while the holistic double zeros classifier recognizes the cursive and touching double zeros. Experimental results show that the system reads 66.5% bank checks correctly at 0% misreading rate.

The neural network most referenced in the pattern recognition literature are the multi-layer perceptron, the Kohonen associative memory and the Capenter-Grossberg ART network. The Kohonen memory runs an unsupervised clustering algorithm. It is easily trained and has attractive properties such as topological ordering and good generalization. In this study an on-line system for the recognition of handwriting Arabic characters using a Kohonen network is investigated. The input of the neural network is a feature vector of elliptic Fourier coefficients extracted from the handwritten dynamic representation. Experimental results show that the network successfully recognizes both clearly and roughly written characters with good performance.

Both single-voxel and multivoxel H-1-MRS have high sensitivity for detecting low NAA, indicative of neuronal dysfunction in focal epilepsies. Decreases in NAA correlate strongly with EEG abnormalities and severity of cell loss, and may be a more sensitive measure than structural MRL However, the NAA decrease is often more widespread than the epileptogenic focus. The results of published MRS studies suggest that in patients with partial epilepsy, there is a metabolic abnormality throughout the brain, with patterns of asymmetry and focal accentuation that are useful for noninvasive localization of epileptogenic foci. A major limitation of current proton MRS studies in epilepsy is the inability to cover the entire brain in a single acquisition, thus leading to major sampling bias. The area of maximal abnormality may reside farther away, even when there is an abnormality inside of the volume of interest used for that particular examination. Decreased NAA ratios are present even in children at the onset of their epilepsy, and evidence points to a gradual and progressive course of further reduction in NAA values. Conversely, the relative NAA concentration can recover ipsilaterally and contralaterally after successful resection of a temporal lobe focus. These observations, together with the fact of the often widespread NAA abnormality, must be taken into account for the correct and adequate interpretation of proton MRS studies in the assessment of partial epilepsies.

In the present study, using auto radiographic, Western blotting and immunocytochemical methods, we provide the first report that IGF-II/M6P receptors are discretely distributed at all major segmental levels of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia of the adult rat. In the spinal cord, a high density of [I-125] IGF-II binding sites was evident in the ventral horn (lamina IX) and in areas around the central canal (lamina X), whereas intermediate grey matter and dorsal horn were associated with moderate receptor levels. The dorsal root ganglia exhibited rather high density of [I-125] IGF-II binding sites. Interestingly, meninges present around the spinal cord displayed highest density of [I-125] IGF-II binding compared to any given region of the spinal grey mater or the dorsal root ganglia. Western blot results indicated the presence of the IGF-II/M6P receptor at all major levels of spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, with little segmental variation, At the cellular level, spinal motorneurons demonstrated the most intense IGF-II/M6P receptor immunoreactivity, followed by interneurons in the intermediate region and deeper dorsal horn. Some scattered IGF-II/M6P immunoreactive fibers were found in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and dorsolateral funiculus. The meninges of the spinal cord also seemed to express IGF-II receptor immunoreactivity. In the dorsal root ganglia, receptor immunoreactivity was evident primarily in a subset of neurons of all diameters. These results, taken together, provide anatomical evidence of a role for the IGF-II/M6P receptor in general cellular functions such as transport of lysosomal enzymes and/or internalization followed by clearance of IGF-II in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia.

The dLGN ipsilateral to the lesion showed a 73% reduction in size, more than 99% neuronal cell loss, 50% increase in glial cell density, but a 50% reduction in the total number of glial cells. The total number of neural and glial cells estimated for the dLGN contralateral to the ablation did not differ from control values. Despite evidence for substantial degeneration of the ipsilateral dLGN. cytochrome oxidase histochemistry revealed a small population of surviving cells that exhibited features of neuronal cells. More surviving cells were found in the parvocellular than in the magnocellular layers, and surviving parvocellular cells had the same size-frequency distribution as Nissl-stained neurons in an intact animal. These findings suggest that the intrinsic geniculate circuitry may be able to sustain the residual interneurons that can, in turn, contribute to maintaining retinal and brainstem afferents. The remaining neurons in the dLGN following hemispherectomy appear to be insufficient in number to be importantly implicated in the residual visual functions that have been reported in some hemispherectomized patients.

Animals which received 50 Gy whole-body gamma-irradiation showed virtually complete inhibition of the proliferative burst usually seen after optic nerve section. These animals did, however, show a robust hyperplastic response in the optic tract that we believe represents the migration of nearby microglial cells into the affected tract. When only the postcephalic body was irradiated, proliferating cells in the major hematopoietic organs of the fish, the kidney and pronephros, were substantially inhibited. Despite this, the Wallerian cellular response in the visual paths was essentially normal. Thus, there is no obligate requirement for peripheral proliferative cells to participate in central Wallerian degeneration in the fish. However, when only the head was irradiated, and the hematopoietic organs were spared, there was a proliferative response in the visual system. We believe this represents the invasion of the visual pathways by peripheral blood cells through the optic nerve lesion and blood vessels in the nerve itself. This invasion, however, is not sufficient to generate substantial hyperplasia. In summary, although we find evidence for a small contribution by exogenous cells, the major source of reactive cells during central Wallerian degeneration in the fish is the endogenous microglia. Our data underscore the importance of elucidating the mechanisms by which microglial cells are activated and the role that they play in regeneration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science.

We are studying ways in which cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune responses can be harnessed to neutralize these inhibitors to promote long distance axon regeneration in the injured spinal cord. In this context the cell-mediated immune response is directed particularly at stimulating rapid phagocytosis of myelin from areas of the central nervous system undergoing Wallerian degeneration. While the work on the antibody-mediated effects are directed at developing a vaccine approach to block axon growth inhibitor associated with myelin.

Despite concerns regarding air entrainment from the right atrium, cerebral microemboli of air and neurological complications, VAVD was used in patients who underwent valvular surgery throughout the last two years in our institution. Methods: We compared the rate of neurological complications in patients who underwent surgery with and without VAVD from June 1997 to July 2001. VAVD was added to solid venous reservoirs with membrane oxygenators and arterial filters. Clinical results were prospectively entered in our valve database and were used for the analysis. Results: Eight hundred twenty-two consecutive patients averaging 65 +/- 11 years of age underwent aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve replacements including 40 redos (40/822, 5%) and 265 associated CABG (265/822, 32%) with VAVD in 1999 to 2001 compared to 723 patients averaging 63 +/- 11 years of age (p = 0.01) who underwent the same procedures with 79 redos (79/723, 11%) and 177 CABG (177/723, 24%) without VAVD in 1997 to 1999. CPB time averaged 117 +/- 50 minutes in VAVD patients compared to 108 43 minutes in those without VAVD (p = 0.001). Thirty-day mortality averaged 5% (39/822) in patients with VAVD and 4% (30/723) in those without VAVD (p = 0.6). Seven patients of the VAVD group (7/822, 1%) and 11 patients without VAVD (11/723, 1.5%, p = 0.2) suffered from temporary or permanent neurological deficit. Conclusion: VAVD is a useful adjunct to modern cardiopulmonary bypass systems. When used with appropriate care, VAVD, does not appear to significantly increase air microemboli and is not associated with an increased neurological risk following valvular surgery.

We also determined whether the involvement of the PPA in recognition of previously studied scenes is specific to a particular-type of scene information. We found that, like the PPA, anterior hippocampal regions showed a novelty response (higher activation for novel than repeated scenes) and a stimulus-related response (higher activation for-scenes than objects) during learning, indicating that MTL structures other than the PPA contribute to the encoding of novel stimulus relationships in scenes. However, these anterior hippocampal regions showed no involvement during recognition of either spatial or nonspatial information contained in scenes. The PPA, by contrast, was consistently involved in recognition of all types of scene details, presumably through interactions with co-activated parietal and occipito-temporal cortices. We suggest that MTL contributions from the PPA are sufficient to support recognition of scenes, when the task can be based on a perceptually based familiarity process. Hippocampus 2002;12:718-723.

The hierarchical evaluation consists in assessing the student's state of knowledge at several levels of granularity. The relevance of the method is justified by the need for a precise and flexible diagnosis of the learner's skills in a given domain. For that purpose, we shall model the propagation of the evaluation from a specific level of knowledge content to more general levels, using Bayesian inferences and neural networks classifications.

Three groups of volunteers, current, new, and former volunteers, participated. Participants were assessed four times on standardized measures of personality, health, motivation, and well-being: before and after a wait period, after volunteering, and at one year follow-up. There were no differences between pre, post and follow-up well-being. Regression analysis indicated that health, personality traits and motivation predicted well-being at pre-intervention. In contrast, after the intervention, regression analysis indicated that the interaction of higher neuroticism and greater motivation scores predicted lower well-being compared to other volunteers. One year follow-up results indicated that personality traits and health predicted well-being and that higher initial motivation predicted drop-outs while those continuing to volunteer increased their motivation scores.

Women in these countries, particularly in the agricultural sector, are increasingly exposed. Since they are concentrated in the most marginal positions in the formal and informal workforces, and production is organized in a gender-specific way, opportunities for women to control their exposures are limited. Data front developing countries show that: 1) women's exposures to pesticides are significantly higher than is recognized; 2) poisonings and other pesticide-related injuries are greatly underestimated for women; 3) for a given adverse outcome from exposure, the experience of that outcome is gender-discriminatory; 4) erroneous risk perception increases women's exposures. The hiatus in knowledge of gender-specific exposures and effects is related to gender biases in the nature of epidemiologic inquiry and in the literature, and the gendered nature of health workers' practices and surveillance. Recommendations are made for strong, independent organizations that provide opportunities for women to control their environments, and the factors affecting their health, as well as gender-sensitive research to address the particularities of women's pesticide exposures.

In this article, we report that caspase-3 protein is absent from rat and mouse adult skeletal muscles, despite the abundant presence of its mRNA. During skeletal muscle development, caspase-3 protein is present in neonatal animals, but its expression gradually decreases, and disappears completely by I month of age, when there is still abundant caspase-3 mRNA. This discordance between caspase-3 message and protein expression is unique to skeletal muscle, as in all other analyzed tissues the protein presence correlates with the presence of the mRNA. The only circumstance in which caspase-3 protein appears in adults is in regenerating muscles; once regeneration is complete, however, it again becomes undetectable in repaired muscles. We conclude that caspase-3 protein in skeletal muscle is uniquely regulated at the post-transcriptional level, unseen in other tissues such as brain, heart, lung, kidney, thymus, spleen, liver, or testis. The post-transcriptional regulation of caspase-3 might serve as a fail-safe mechanism to avoid accidental cell death. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Recently, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) has been described as a coreceptor of KDR which potentiates VEGF-A activity. However, the role of NRP-1 in numerous VEGF-A activities remains unclear. To assess the contribution of NRP-1 to VEGF-A mediated EC proliferation, migration, and PAF synthesis, we used porcine aortic EC (PAEC) recombinantly expressing Fit-1, NRP-1, KDR or KDR and NRP-1. Cells were stimulated with VEGF-A, which binds to Flt-1, KDR and NRP-1, and VEGF-C, which binds to KDR only. VEGF-A was 12.4-fold more potent than VEGF-C in inducing KDR phosphorylation in PAEC-KDR. VEGF-A and VEGF-C showed similar potency to mediate PAEC-KDR proliferation, migration, and PAF synthesis. On PAEC-KDR/NRP-1, VEGF-A was 28.6-fold more potent than VEGF-C in inducing KDR phosphorylation and PAEC-KDR/NRP-1 proliferation ((1.3-fold), migration (1.7-fold), and PAF synthesis (4.6-fold). These results suggest that cooperative binding of VEGF-A to KDR and NRP-1 enhances KDR phosphorylation and its biological activities. Similar results were obtained with bovine aortic EC that endogenously express both KDR and NRP-1 receptors. In contrast, stimulation of PAEC-Flt-1 and PAEC-NRP-1 with VEGF-A or VEGF-C did not induce proliferation, migration, or PAF synthesis. In conclusion, the presence of NRP-1 on EC preferentially increases KDR activation by VEGF-A as well as KDR-mediated biological activities, and may elicit novel intracellular events. On the other hand, VEGF-A and VEGF-C have equipotent biological activities on EC in absence of NRP-1.

However, tannins are known as digestibility reducers, hence deleterious to caterpillar development, and as deterrents as well. Previous work demonstrated that larvae of the polyphagous oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, performed better when reared on a control + 0.5% tannic acid diet than on the standard control diet and that larvae reared on a control + 5% glucose diet had slower development and reduced survival. This study was designed to elucidate the behavioral and neurophysiological components of the larval responses to tannic acid and glucose. C. rosaceana larvae were reared individually from the first to the sixth instar on one of four different artificial diets: (1) control; (2) control + 5% glucose; (3) control + 0.5% tannic acid; (4) control + 5% glucose + 0.5% tannic acid. After 14 days, larvae reared on the control + 5% glucose diet had not developed past the fourth instar, whereas a considerable proportion of larvae reared on the control + 0.5% tannic acid diet had already attained the pupal stage, Insects reared on the control or the control + 5% glucose + 0.5% tannic acid diet had intermediate development, with most larvae in the fifth instar. In addition, once the mid-sixth, instar was reached, the feeding preferences to 25 and 300 mM glucose, 25 MM tannic acid, and 25 mM glucose + 25 mM tannic acid over water were assessed in two-choice tests. Feeding affected preference. Control-reared insects prefer-red feeding on treatments containing glucose and were not deterred by tannic acid. However, larvae that had been exposed to tannic acid during their development were deterred by tannic acid and their glucose discrimination was impaired. The sensitivity to glucose was also examined from neurophysiological recordings by stimulating the sugar-sensitive cell (cell 1) on the lateral styloconic sensillum of the maxillary galea with increasing concentrations of glucose (1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mM). We also determined whether tannic acid was phagostimulatory, since insects develop relatively quickly on a diet containing this compound, by testing I mM tannic acid, I mM tannic acid + 300 mM glucose, and 300 mM glucose on the lateral styloconic sensilla. The traces indicated that 1 mM tannic acid was not detected by any of the four chemosensory cells in these sensilla. The combination of tannic acid and glucose produced no spikes from the sugar-sensitive cell, whereas a prominent spike activity resulted with 300 mM glucose. We concluded that, although C. rosaceana larvae develop faster on a tannic acid diet, this compound is not a phagostimulant. The converse is true for glucose; i.e., it stimulates the sugar-sensitive cell in the lateral styloconica in a concentration-dependent fashion. Previous dietary experience changes the sensory and behavioral responses of C rosaceana to glucose. Our findings imply that not all compounds that are phagostimulatory are necessarily beneficial to an insect's fitness. Therefore, developmental studies should be interpreted in conjunction with behavioral and physiological data.

Eight patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease were studied. A group of 24 elderly subjects, of similar age to the patient group and slightly higher education, served as controls. The severity of the cognitive decline of each patient was measured with a standard neuropsychological battery. All subjects were administered a copying task and tasks measuring visual exploration, judgment of spatial relations and graphical planning. Group and individual results were analyzed. The group results suggested that visuoconstructional apraxia in patients with Alzheimer's type dementia is characterized by impaired visual exploration and judgment of spatial relations. Individual results revealed between-patient variability related to the severity of cognitive decline. Given the small number of patients, these observations need to be replicated with a larger-scaled study.

The first study compared the driving habits of 90 older accident-free drivers with 90 drivers having a history of accidents. The second study, on a subgroup of 60 of the original 180 subjects (30 accident-free and 30 having accidents), compared cognitive function, with particular emphasis on executive functions as measured by neuropsychological tests, and attitude and self-reported driving behaviour. The results show that elderly drivers having a history of accidents, compared to the control group: (1) have poorer performance on the four cognitive measurements of executive functions; (2) report to have more prudent behaviour on the road (e.g., reducing their speed); and (3) have the intention to adopt less risky driving behaviour. This study suggests that a subgroup of the older driver population has cognitive problems and driving disabilities that cannot be compensated by apparently more careful behaviour on the road. The results confirm the importance of proper assessment of cognitive processes and underscore the potential of measuring executive functions for the evaluation of driving competence of elderly persons.

Those AD (N = 6) and NC (N = 7) subjects who were able to initially perform the basic mirror tracing task did not differ significantly in initial level of performance, learning over trials, retention of the skill over a 30-min delay interval, and generalization of the skill to a new figure or to the opposite direction of tracing. The AD patients who were unable to initially perform the mirror tracing task were significantly worse than those who could perform the task on several neuropsychological measures sensitive to deficits in problem solving and executive functions, but not on tests of global cognitive decline, memory, language, or visuoperceptual functioning. These results indicate that acquisition and retention of a complex visuomotor skill can proceed normally in the early stages of AD in those individuals who can initially perform the basic task, and that inability to perform the basic task may be related to the frontal lobe dysfunction that is often prominent in the disorder.

The disorders included childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Age-appropriate tests were administered to assess sustained attention, encoding and verbal memory, executive and focused attention and attentional flexibility/impulsivity. CAE probands attained lower scores than other probands in visual sustained attention and the ability to focus on and execute a visual-motor task. Scores of the unaffected relatives tended to fall between those of the probands and the controls. JME relatives had lower scores than other relatives in tests of visual and auditory sustained attention and attentional flexibility, and showed greater variability in response time. Behavioral information of this type may aid in the specification and differentiation of genetic linkages in affected families.

Patients and Methods: Two separate cohorts of patients (pts) with solid tumors were studied: (A) pts with refractory or recurrent disease and (B) pts with no prior myelosuppressive therapy or newly diagnosed tumors for which there was no standard chemotherapy. CARBO was given on day 1 at an area under the curve of 6.5, followed by TOPO as a continuous infusion for 3 days; the starting dose of TOPO was 0.50 mg/m(2)/d. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. G-CSF was given at a dose of 5 mug/kg/d starting on day 4. Results: Forty-eight of 51 pts were assessable for toxicity. In group A, dose-limiting myelosuppression persisted despite de-escalation of TOPO to 0.3 mg/m(2)/d and use of G-CSF. In group B, the maximum-tolerated dose of TOPO was 0.5 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days, and 0.6 m/m(2)/d for 3 days with G-CSF. No significant nonhematologic toxicities were observed. Among 46 pts assessable for response, one had complete response, five had partial response, and 18 had stable disease. Conclusion: Although this combination possesses antineoplastic activity in pediatric solid tumors, hematologic toxicity precluded any meaningful TOPO dose escalation. The addition of G-CSF did not alter this. The potential for preservation of activity and diminution of toxicity with alternative sequences and schedules of administration (topoisomerase followed by alkylating or platinating agents) should be evaluated.

Experimental studies of these affective disorders to date have largely focused on the neurotransmitter pathways with well-established pathophysiologic roles, such as serotonergic, noradrenergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic systems; agents modulating the activity of these pathways are known to be clinically effective. More recently, the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its receptor (the neurokinin-1 receptor [NK1R]) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders, including depression. Earlier preclinical and clinical studies, though, did not provide a clear consensus on the role of SP in the regulation of affective behavior and related pathologic conditions. Recent studies in mice clearly demonstrate that both the genetic disruption and acute pharmacologic blockade of the NK1R result in marked reduction in anxiety-like behavior and stress-related responses. In parallel with these behavioral effects, physiologic changes, such as an increased firing rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei and a desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT1A inhibitory autoreceptors, were observed. These findings provide further evidence for the regulatory role of the SP-NK1R system in modulation of affective behavior and indicate that its effects are mediated, at least in part, via the serotonergic system. Future studies will attempt to delineate the interaction between the SP-NK1R system and various neurotransmitter pathways in greater detail and to address the specific role(s) of this system in different brain regions.

One patient with a severe, congenital form of type 2 sialidosis was a compound heterozygote for 239C-to-T (P80L) and 718T-to-C (W240R). The other patient with a mild juvenile-onset phenotype (type 1) was a homozygote for the base substitution of 946C-to-T (P316S). None of these mutant cDNA products showed enzymatic activity toward an artificial substrate when coexpressed in galactosialidosis fibroblastic cells together with protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA). All mutants showed a reticular immunofluorescence distribution when coexpressed with the PPCA gene in COS-1 cells, suggesting that the gene products were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi area or rapidly degraded in the lysosomes. Homology modeling of the structural changes introduced by the mutations predicted that the P80L and P316S transversions cause large conformational changes including the active site residues responsible for binding the sialic acid carboxylate group. The W240R substitution was deduced to influence the molecular surface structure of a limited region of the constructed models, which was also influenced by previously identified V217M and G243R transversions.

Included is evidence from experimental studies of normal pain processing and pain modulation by psychological state. Also reviewed is evidence from studies of patients with chronic pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain, central pain, and fibromyalgia, that may involve aberrant forebrain processing of nociceptive information. Findings: Both positron emission tomography and functional magnetic. resonance imaging studies of experimental pain in normal subjects reveal a complex network of neural activity in the cerebral cortex that likely underlies the conscious appreciation of pain. The totality of sensory and emotional experience associated with pain varies among individuals and circumstances, and these dissimilarities are reflected in variations in patterns of neural activation observed among studies. However, striking commonalities are observed among studies, including the activation of sensory regions, such as primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and limbic areas such as anterior cingulate cortex and insular cortex. Studies of cognitive modulation of pain show that the degree of activation of these regions is dependent on cognitive factors, such as attentional state, that alter our perception of pain. Finally, imaging studies of patients with chronic pain states often reveal abnormalities of pain processing that result in the "cortical pain network" being activated by normally nonpainful stimuli, thus providing a neural basis for perceptual phenomena such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. Conclusions: There is a common network of cortical and subcortical structures that subserves the pain experience. Whether this network is activated by tissue-damaging stimuli in a "normal" situation, or by non-noxious stimuli such as a light brush or cool breeze on the skin in pathological conditions, the final experience associated with its activation is pain. Finally, activity in this network can be modulated by cognitive state, as well as by pharmacological treatments, leading to an alteration of the pain experience. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in earlier trials. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, patients were injected intravenously with placebo or 30 mL Cere five days per week for four weeks. Effects on cognition and global function were evaluated with the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Clinicians Interview-based Impression of Change with Caregiver Input scale (CIBIC+) 4, 12, 24 weeks after the beginning of the injections. 192 patients were enrolled, 95 were randomized to placebo, and 97 to Cere. At baseline, there was a significant difference between groups for age, age of onset of dementia, and the number of patients with hallucinations. At week 12 there was a significant difference on the CIBIC+ (p = 0.033) in favor of Cere. The number of CIBIC+ responders (score less than or equal to 4), was significantly higher (p = 0.007), with 68 (76%) in the Cere group and 51 (57%) in the placebo group. Trends were noted in the Disability Assessment in Dementia scale and the Cornell Depression Scale. Adverse events were recorded in 73% of placebo and 64% of Cere patients. Most common adverse events were headaches, dizziness, weight loss and anxiety. Conclusions: Cere treatment was well tolerated and resulted in significant improvements in the global score two months after the end of active treatment.

We have investigated the role of calcium in agrin signaling through the MuSK receptor tyrosine kinase and in the intracellular signaling cascade that leads to AChR phosphorylation and clustering. We find that agrin- and neuramindase-induced MuSK activation in cultured myotubes is completely blocked by removal of extracellular calcium, but only slightly reduced by clamping of intracellular calcium transients with BAPTA. Following agrin's activation of MuSK, we find that the downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR beta -subunit was inhibited by BAPTA but not by a slower acting chelator, EGTA. Similarly, agrin-induced clustering of the AChR was blocked by BAPTA but not EGTA. These findings indicate that extracellular calcium is required for the formation of a MuSK signaling complex, and that intracellular calcium regulates phosphorylation and clustering of the AChR in the postsynaptic membrane.

The diversity of serotonin actions is due to the existence of several different receptor subtypes. In this study we report the cloning of a full-length cDNA, coding for a novel serotonin receptor (5-HTap2). The receptor protein bears the characteristics of G protein-coupled receptors. It shares 68% and 34% of its amino acid sequence identity with the 5-HTlym receptor from Lymnaea stagnalis and the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor, respectively. When transfected in HEK 293 cells, 5-HTap2 was negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. Ligand binding analysis indicated that the order of potencies of various drugs for the inhibition of [H-3]LSD binding was: methiothepin > metergoline > 5-CT > PAPP > 5-HT > ketanserin > NAN-190 > 8-OH-DPAT > clozapine. RT-PCR amplification of RNA isolated from different tissues indicated that this receptor is expressed in the CNS and in bag cells. The expression of 5-HTap2 restricted to the CNS suggests an important role for this receptor in the modulation of neuronal functions in Aplysia. Moreover, the high expression of 5-HTap2 in the bag cells, associated with its pharmacological profile, suggests that this receptor may be implicated in modulating the afterdischarge during the egg-laying behavior.

Nevertheless, these saccades are consistently accompanied by transient vergence eye movements. Here we have investigated whether the dynamics of these vergence movements depend on the trajectory of the coincident conjugate movement, and whether moving the head during eye-head gaze shifts modifies vergence dynamics. In agreement with previous reports, saccades with more symmetric (i.e., "bell-shaped") conjugate velocity profiles were accompanied by stereotyped biphasic vergence transients (i.e., a divergence phase immediately followed by a convergence phase). However, we found that saccades with more asymmetric, oscillatory-like dynamics (characterized by a typical conjugate reacceleration of the eyes following the initial peak velocity) were systematically accompanied by more complex vergence movements that also exhibited oscillatory-like dynamics. These findings could be extended to conditions where the head was free to move: comparable conjugate and vergence oscillations were observed during head-restrained saccades and combined eye-head gaze shifts. The duration of the vergence oscillation increased with gaze shift amplitude, such that as many as four vergence phases (divergence-convergence-divergence-convergence) were recorded during 55degrees gaze shifts (approximate to240 ms). To quantify these observations, we first determined whether conjugate and vergence peak velocities were systematically correlated. Conjugate peak velocity was linearly related to the peak velocity of the initial divergence phase for saccades and gaze shifts of all amplitudes, regardless of their dynamics. However, for more asymmetric saccades and gaze shifts, the subsequent convergence and divergence peak velocities were not correlated with either the initial peak conjugate velocity or the peak velocity of the conjugate reacceleration. Next, we determined that the duration of the different conjugate and vergence oscillation phases remained relatively constant across all saccades and gaze shifts, and that the conjugate and vergence profiles oscillated together at approximately 7.5-10 Hz. Using computer simulations, we show that a classic feed-forward model is unable to reproduce vergence oscillations based solely on peripheral mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that small modifications to the gain and delay of a simple feedback model for saccade generation can generate conjugate oscillations, and propose that such changes reflect the influence of lowered alertness on the tecto-reticular pathways. We conclude that peripheral mechanisms can only account for the initial divergence that accompanies all saccades, and that the conjugate and vergence oscillations observed during asymmetric movements arise centrally from an integrative binocular controller.

Neuronal damage in limbic areas, such as CA3 and dentate hilus, occurs in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and in animal models (e.g., pilocarpine- or kainate-treated rodents) mimicking this epileptic disorder. Hence, hippocampal damage in epileptic mice may lead to decreased CA3 output function that in turn would allow EC networks to generate ictal-like events. Here we tested this hypothesis and found that CA3-driven interictal discharges induced by 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 muM) in hippocampus-EC slices from mice injected with pilocarpine 13-22 days earlier have a lower frequency than in age-matched control slices. Moreover, EC-driven ictal-like discharges in pilocarpine- treated slices occur throughout the experiment (less than or equal to6 h) and spread to the CA1/subicular area via the temporoammonic path; in contrast, they disappear in control slices within 2 h of 4AP application and propagate via the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. Thus, different network interactions within the hippocampus-EC loop characterize control and pilocarpine-treated slices maintained in vitro. We propose that these functional changes, which are presumably caused by seizure-induced cell damage, lead to seizures in vivo. This process is facilitated by a decreased control of EC excitability by hippocampal outputs and possibly sustained by the reverberant activity between EC and CA1/subiculum networks that are excited via the temporoammonic path.

In situ brain perfusion in wild-type and mdr lalpha(-/-) P-gp-deficient mice was utilized to investigate potential P-gp-mediated transport of novel nonpeptidic delta agonists (AR-M delta compounds). Because radioactive compounds were not available for this series, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric detection (LCMS) was the assay methodology of choice. Verapamil in the perfusion buffer (0.5 muM) served as a positive control for P-gp-mediated efflux and as an experimental internal standard for P-gp modulation by AR-M delta compounds. LC-MS provided excellent assay sensitivity with no significant interferences. In P-gp-competent mice, the brain extraction of AR-M delta compounds ranged from 1.1 to 96%. The ratio of initial brain uptake clearances (Cl-up) in P-gp-deficient and wild-type mice (P-gp effect) ranged from 0.96 to 4.91. Some compounds increased the Cl-up of verapamil in P-gp-competent mice, consistent with P-gp inhibition. These results demonstrate that LC-MS is an appropriate assay methodology for mouse brain perfusion samples, that AR-M delta compounds may interact with P-gp in the BBB, and that the internal strategy can provide useful information concerning P-gp modulation by compounds of interest.

However, due to the lack of a consistent association between brain volume and cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), volumetric measures are not a reliable predictor for the progression of the disease. In our study, we hypothesized that changes in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) may reflect underlying brain pathology in the absence of quantifiable volumetric changes. Such a measure may be used as a predictor for abnormal cognitive decline in elderly subjects. The study was carried out on 15 normal elderly controls, 11 subjects with DAT, and 12 subjects with MCI. We used MTRs with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect tissue changes in the four lobes of each hemisphere, and compared that to the volumetric changes in the same regions. Our results indicate that the MTR of both temporal lobes is significantly reduced in subjects with MCI in the absence of significant volumetric changes. In comparison, DAT subjects have significantly reduced temporal lobe volumes and MTR. We conclude that changes in MTR have the potential to mark the progression of MCI to DAT, before volumetric changes are detected on conventional MRI scans. Magn Reson Med 47:143-148, 2002.

By using CT simulation and three-dimensional planning, we have developed a simple but accurate method of producing customized blocks for the cranial fields in the treatment of medulloblastoma. We compare here the margins and the volume of normal tissues included in the treatment volume with those obtained using blocks generated manually. Procedure. Customized blocks for the whole brain field are generated using CT planning and autoblock function. The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the whole cerebrospinal fluid pathway, and the whole brain and spinal cord are contoured, A margin of 1.1 cm is generated using the autoblock-function to account for set-up errors (3-5 mm) and penumbra (approximately 7 mm). A separate set of blocks was generated manually without the knowledge of the ones generated by the CT-simulator. These 2 sets of blocks were compared for a cohort of 7 consecutive patients. Results. Overall, the manual blocks and the computer-generated blocks were quite similar. Those generated manually had more variations; they were always tighter (median of 6 mm tighter, range: 3-7 mm) at the level of the cribriform plate and in 5/7 patients were more generous (median of 6 mm more generous, range: 0-6 mm) at the temporal lobes. Dosimetric analysis showed that both methods provide adequate coverage of the CTV, with 100% of the CTV receiving >95% of the prescribed dose for both. Conclusions. The customized block method for whole brain fields is simple to use and ensures adequate coverage of the target volume. 0 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The procedure uses feature space proximity measures, and does not make any assumptions about the tissue intensity distributions. As opposed to existing methods, which are often sensitive to anatomical variability and pathology (such as atrophy), the proposed procedure is robust against morphological deviations from the model. Starting from a set of samples generated from prior tissue probability maps (the "model") in a standard, brain-based coordinate system ("stereotaxic space"), the method reduces the fraction of incorrectly labeled samples in this set from 25% down to 5%. The corrected set of samples is then used by a supervised classifier for classifying the entire 3D image. Validation experiments were performed on both real and simulated MRI data; the Kappa similarity measure increased from 0.83 to 0.94.

At the amino acid level, the parasite receptor (SmGPCR) shared about the same level of sequence homology (approximate to 30%) with all major types or amine GPCRs and could not be identified on the basis of sequence. SmGPCR exhibited several nonconservative substitutions at key GPCR positions, including an unusual asparagine substitution (Asn(111)) for the highly conserved aspartate of transmembrane (TM) 3. The full-length SmGPCR cDNA was double-tagged with N-terminal FLAG and C-terminal hexahistidine epitopes, and was codon-optimized for expression in cultured HEK293 and COS7 cells. In situ immunofluorescence analyses targeting the two N- and C-terminal epitopes demonstrated that the modified SmGPCR was expressed at high level in mammalian cells and assumed a typical GPCR topology, the N-terminus being extracellular and the C-terminus intracellular. Functional activity assays revealed that SmGPCR was responsive to histamine, which caused a dose-dependent elevation in intracellular Ca2+ (EC50 = 0.54 +/- 0.05 muM). An Asn(111)-->Asp mutation had no effect on the responsiveness to histamine, suggesting that SmGPCR does not require the TM3 aspartate for agonist activation, in contrast to most amine GPCRs. None of the other monoamines tested had any significant effect on receptor activity, using assays that measured both Ca2+- and cAMP-mediated signaling. The results suggest that SmGPCR is a novel structural class of histamine receptor that may be unique to flatworms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Several membrane forms of the enzyme have been identified up to now. Some of them serve as receptors for the natriuretic peptides, a family of peptides which includes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), three peptides known to play important roles in renal and cardiovascular physiology. These are transmembrane proteins composed of a single transmembrane domain, a variable extracellular natriuretic peptide-binding domain, and a more conserved intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD) and catalytic domain. GC-A, the receptor for ANP and BNP, also named natriuretic peptide receptor-A or -1 (NPR-A or NPR-1), has been studied widely. Its mode of activation by peptide ligands and mechanisms of regulation serve as prototypes for understanding the function of other particulate GC. Activation of this enzyme by its ligand is a complex process requiring oligomerization, ligand binding, KHD phosphorylation and ATP binding. Gene knockout and genetic segregation studies have provided strong evidence for the importance of GC-A in the regulation of blood pressure and heart and renal functions. GC-B is the main receptor for CNP, the latter having a more paracrine role at the vascular and venous levels. The structure and regulation of GC-B is similar to that of GC-A. This chapter reviews the structure and roles of GC-A and GC-B in blood pressure regulation and cardiac and renal pathophysiology.

They form transcription repression complexes with members of several DNA-binding protein families and participate in the regulation of the expression of numerous genes. Despite their pleiotropic roles, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the functions of Gro/TLE proteins. It is shown here that Gro/TLEs become hyperphosphorylated in response to neural cell differentiation and interaction with the DNA-binding cofactor Hairy/Enhancer of split 1 (Hes1). Hyperphosphorylation of Gro/TLEs is correlated with a tight association with the nuclear compartment through interaction with chromatin, suggesting that hyperphosphorylated Gro/TLEs may mediate transcriptional repression via chromatin remodeling mechanisms. Pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase CK2 reduces the Hes1-induced hyperphosphorylation of Gro/TLEs and causes a decrease in the chromatin association of the latter. Moreover, the transcription repression activity of Gro/TLEs is reduced by protein kinase CK2 inhibition. Consistent with these observations, Gro/TLEs are phosphorylated in vitro by purified protein kinase CK2. Taken together, these results implicate protein kinase CK2 in Gro/TLE functions. They suggest further that this kinase is involved in a hyperphosphorylation mechanism activated by Hes1 that promotes the transcription repression functions of Hes1-Gro/TLE protein complexes.

J	Shekarabi, M; Kennedy, TE				Shekarabi, M; Kennedy, TE			The netrin-1 receptor DCC pro motes filopodia formation and cell spreading by activating Cdc42 and Rac1	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GROWTH CONE GUIDANCE; GTP-BINDING PROTEIN; ACTIN STRESS FIBERS; COLORECTAL CANCERS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; GENE-PRODUCT; CYCLIC-AMP; EXPRESSION; NEUROBLASTOMA; DYNAMICS	Netrins are a family of secreted proteins that function as tropic cues directing cell and axon migration during neural development. We show that the netrin-1 receptor, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), is present at filopodia tips in growth cones of embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. To further investigate DCC function, we characterized the expression of netrins and netrin receptors in HEK293T cells and NG108-15 cells and found that they express netrin-1 but do not express DCC. Ectopic expression of DCC produced a netrin-1-dependent increase in the number of filopodia and in cell surface area. Coexpression of DCC and dominant negative Cdc42 or dominant negative Racl blocked the increase in filopodia number and cell surface area, respectively. Furthermore addition of netrin-1 to cells expressing DCC caused a persistent activation of Cdc42 and Racl. These findings suggest that netrin-1, via DCC, influences cellular motility by regulating actin-based membrane extension through the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1.

In spite of intensive investigations, these mechanisms are not well understood. In this review, basic hypotheses are summarized, and a new hypothesis is proposed, which holds that desensitization of AMPA receptros plays a major role in shaping the time course of fast mEPSCs. According to the new hypothesis, desensitization shortens the time course of mEPSCs largely by reducing the buffering of glutamate molecules by AMPA receptors. The hypothesis accounts for numerous findings on fast mEPSCs and is expected to be equally fruitful as a framework for further experimental and theoretical investigations.

Recent analysis with a wide range of stimuli suggests that her comprehension deficit also extends to a subset of musical and non-verbal environmental sounds. The perceptual demands of the different auditory stimuli appear to account for part of the apparent material specificity. Additionally, over the years, the presumed temporal lobe cortical pathology has been supplemented by a mild to moderate, peripheral low-frequency hearing loss and evidence of dysfunction in lower level auditory processing pathways. The current peripheral dysfunction closely resembles cases recently labeled as auditory neuropathy. The diagnosis of pure word deafness should not be based on a limited set of auditory stimuli; additionally, a careful assessment using modern audiological techniques should be performed to evaluate peripheral auditory functions.

Similar patterns of cerebral blood flow were observed across all three languages (French, Spanish and English), when synonym generation was compared with a silent resting baseline. In particular, several regions in the right inferior frontal cortex were activated. These foci are in locations corresponding to those observed in the left hemisphere in normal right-handed volunteers with presumed left-hemisphere dominance, and in patients known to be left-hemisphere dominant for speech. The lack of anatomical separation of the three languages within the same individual, who acquired two languages early and one language later in life, suggests that at least at this single-word level of analysis, age of acquisition was not a significant factor in the determining of functional organization in the brain.

NEUROIMMUNOMODULATION			English	Review						chronic fatigue syndrome; autonomic nervous system; orthostatic hypotension; neuroendocrine system; immune system		Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a serious health concern affecting over 800,000 Americans of all ages, races and socioeconomic groups and both genders. The etiology and pathophysiology of CFS are unknown, yet studies have suggested an involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). A symposium was organized in December 2000 to explore the possibility of an association between ANS dysfunction and CFS, with special emphasis on the interactions between ANS dysfunction and other abnormalities noted in the immune and endocrine systems of individuals with CFS. This paper represents the consensus of the panel of experts who participated in this meeting. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

B	Barbeau, H; Rossignol, S		Battistin, L; Dam, M; Tonin, P		Barbeau, H; Rossignol, S			The role of serotonin on the modulation of locomotion and reflexes in mammals, primates and in humans with spinal cord injury	NEUROLOGICAL REHABILITATION, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd World Congress in Neurological Rehabilitation	APR 02-06, 2002	VENICE, ITALY				CHRONIC TRANSECTION; PLATEAU POTENTIALS; ADULT-RATS; RECOVERY; CAT; NEURONS; TRANSPLANTATION; CYPROHEPTADINE; ACTIVATION; SPASTICITY	This review briefly reports the effects of serotonergic (5-HT) drugs on spinal reflexes as well as on the locomotor pattern in adult spinal animals of different species. In addition, this review also addresses the issue of serotonergic blockade on certain manifestations of spasticity at rest, during simple movement and during locomotion in human subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). Several weeks or months following spinal transection in rats, injection of serotonergic drugs at rest markedly increased the spontaneous electromyographic (EMG) activity of the flexor and extensor muscles of the hindlimbs with torsion of the trunk, spasms and clonus. After transplant of embryonic 5-HT cells or i.p. injection of 5-HT agonists, rats can also express hindlimb locomotion on a treadmill. In spinal cats, 5-HT does not initiate locomotion in the early post-spinal period. However, when the cats can walk spontaneously, the 5-HT precursor 5-HTP or different agonists increased the EMG burst amplitude of the flexors, extensors and axial muscles resulting in an excellent weight support of the hindquarter. There is also an increase in general excitability so that spasms and clonus can interfere with locomotion. Moreover, serotonergic drugs increased the excitability of reflex responses in both the cutaneous and phasic stretch pathways. Cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, partially or completely blocked the effect of serotonergic agonist, decrease the EMG amplitude of lower limb and axial muscles during locomotion as well as on cutaneous and stretch reflexes, thus reducing the spastic features of complete spinal cats. In partial spinal cats, 5-HT agonists markedly improved the locomotor pattern. In SCI subjects, cyproheptadine, at a daily dose of 12 to 24 mg per day, markedly reduced such manifestations of spasticity (spasms, clonus). However, cyproheptadine also decreased the clonus during voluntary flexion of knee as well as during locomotion. During locomotion, cyproheptadine improved the coordination between the agonist and antagonist groups of muscles, which was associated with an improvement in joint angular displacement. Functionally, the SCI subjects gained the ability to walk at higher speeds on the treadmill and overground with walking aids. These results indicate that serotonergic drugs may modulate spinal locomotion and excitability of different spinal reflexes. They also suggest that cyproheptadine may have an important therapeutic role in SCI subjects by reducing manifestations of spasticity leading to the enhancement locomotor function. The possible implications of various mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed.

However, because it is unclear whether 5-HT manipulations directly affect BDNF expression, we examined BDNF mRNA levels in C6 glioma cells following incubation with 5-HT using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analysis. Incubation of C6 glioma cells with 5-HT increased the BDNF mRNA expression approx twofold. The effect of 5-HT (100 PM) was inhibited by a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist (ketanserin; 1 muM). The RNA synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin D; 10 mug/mL), but not a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide; 0.5 mug/mL) blocked the effect of 5-HT. Furthermore, incubation of C6 glioma cells with EGTA (I MM), a protein kinase inhibitor (staurosporine; 1 muM), the Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (1 W), or a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor (KN 62; 1 muM) inhibited the response to 5-HT. Our data show that 5-HT increases de novo BDNF mRNA synthesis following direct activation of the 5-HT2A receptor, via a calcium-dependent and protein kinase-dependent pathway.

We used positron emission tomography to examine cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in response to a picture naming task that varied on two dimensions: familiarity (or difficulty: hard vs easy) and category (tools vs animals). Results show that although familiarity effects are present in the frontal and left lateral posterior temporal cortex, they are absent from the fusiform gyrus. This provides strong evidence that the processing carried out in the fusiform gyrus relates to an object's structure, not to its meaning, and that the left posterior middle temporal gyrus instantiates in part the semantic network that represents the object's meaning.

However. very few studies have attempted to assess these functions in children suffering from frontal lobe epilepsy. The aim of the present study was to determine whether some or all of the components of the frontal lobe syndrome are present in children with this disorder. For this purpose, a neuropsychological test battery was administered to 32 unresected epileptic children, aged 8-16 years: 16 with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), eight with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and eight with generalized epilepsy whose principal manifestations were typical absences (GEA). The performances of the three epileptic groups were further compared to normative data derived from 200 French-speaking. healthy children aged 7-16 years, except for standardized tests for which the norms provided in the manual were used. The three epilepsy groups did not differ with respect to conceptual shift and recency memory. However, the FLE children showed deficits in planning and impulse control. Furthermore, they had significantly more coordination problems and exhibited greater rigidity than the other epilepsy groups on the motor tests. These problems were more marked in younger FLE children (8 - 12 years). The latter were also more impaired on verbal fluency measures. No differences were observed with respect to gender, localization of the epileptic abnormality (unilateral versus bilateral) or medication (monotherapy versus polytherapy). The findings reveal similarities between the neuro psychological profiles of FLE children and adults with frontal lobe lesions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Face perception and memory in patients with selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						anterior temporal lobectomy; epilepsy; hippocampus; Mooney Closure Faces Test; recognition memory; right medial temporal lobe	TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; FRONTAL-LOBE; BRAIN; RESECTION; LOBECTOMY; EXCISION; DESIGNS; RECALL	In 1968. Milner (Neuropsychologia 6 (1968) 191) demonstrated a face-memory impairment in patients with right, but not left, temporal-lobe excisions. Because all the removals included lateral and inferior temporal neocortex together with amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus and varying amounts of hippocampus, a combined-lesion effect could not be ruled out. We therefore examined the contribution of right temporal structures to recognition of previously unfamiliar faces by repeating Milner's original study, testing patients who had undergone selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy (AH), in addition to those with anterior temporal-lobectomy (TL). The paradigm involved selecting 12 previously studied faces from an array of 25 photographs. The Mooney Closure Faces Test was also administered. Subjects included 29 AH patients (14 left (LAH) and 15 right (RAH)) and 59 TL patients (30 L and 29 R) who were categorized further based on extensive (18 LTH and 21 RTH) or minimal (12 LTh and 8 RTh) hippocampal encroachment. Twenty age- and education-matched normal control subjects (NC) were also tested. For the face-memory task, one-way ANOVA revealed a strong group effect (P < 0.001), and post-hoc tests confirmed that both the RTH and RAH groups recognized fewer faces than the NC and LAH groups; the RAH group also differed from the LTh, LTH and RTh groups. No group differences were found for the closure test. Our Findings suggest that right medial temporal-lobe structures are critically involved in the retention, but probably not in the perception, of new faces. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Participants made rapid elbow flexion movements to a 6(-) wide target and were instructed to correct movement errors as quickly as possible when a spring-like load v. as unexpectedly introduced. Angular positions and torques before correction Were used to identify error patterns. Results showed that participants with mild hemiparesis minimized movement errors within three trials, as did healthy participants. In contrast, severely affected individuals needed more trials to diminish errors and their movements were inconsistent, Participants with a moderate motor disability used both typical and atypical correction strategies. The differences in correction behaviors likely reflect deficits in arm motor function (r = 0.79) and executive function (r = 0.58) rather than levels of intellectual function (IQ ratings). Results indicate that the deficits that individuals with stroke experience when adapting their movements to changed load conditions may be due to difficulty in rapidly integrating visual and proprioceptive information. Deficits in executive function could also contribute to problems in producing accurate and consistent movements from trial to trial. Taken together. these results imply that all hemiparetic individuals would not benefit equally from the same motor re-training approaches. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neurosci. 18 (16) (1998) 6388]. Seven normal subjects were trained to detect deviant sounds presented with a slightly longer duration than a 300 ms long standard harmonic sound, using a Go/No Go paradigm. Individual psychometric curves were assessed using a three-step psychoacoustic procedure. Subjects were then scanned while passively listening to the standard sound, and while discriminating changes in sound duration at four different performance levels (d' = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5). Analysis of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data outlined activation, during the discrimination conditions, of a right hemispheric fronto-parietal network very similar to the one previously observed for intensity discrimination, as well as additional activation in the right prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area (BA) 10), bilateral basal ganglia and cerebellar hemispheres. These findings suggest that discrimination of sound duration, as for discrimination of sound intensity, involves two cerebral networks: a supramodal right fronto-parietal cortical network responsible for allocation of sensory attentional resources, and a network of regions such as the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and right prefrontal cortex, more specifically involved in the temporal aspects of the discrimination task.

It was reported by our group that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like immunoreactivity (IR) was increased in the spinal dorsal horn during morphine tolerance [Menard et al. (1996) J. Neurosci. 16, 2342-2351]. More recently, we observed that it was possible to mimic these results in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons allowing for more detailed mechanistic studies [Ma et al. (2000) Neuroscience 99, 529-539]. The aim of the present series of experiments was to further validate the DRG cell culture model b establishing which subtypes of opioid receptors are involved in the induction of CGRP in cultured rat DRG neurons. and to examine the signaling pathway possibly invoked in the induction of CGRP-like IR following repeated opiate treatments. Other neuropeptides known to be expressed in DRG neurons, such as substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin, were investigated to assess specificity. Following treatment with any of the three opioid agonists (mu, DAMGO: delta. DPDPE: kappa, U50488H), the number of CGRP- and SP-IR cultured DRG neurons increased significantly, and in a concentration-dependent manner. with the effects of kappa agonist being less pronounced. NPY and galanin were not affected. Double-immunofluoreseence staining showed that the three opioid receptors were co-localized with both CGRP- and SP-like IR. Protein kinase C (PKC)-like IR was found to be significantly increased following a repetitive treatment with DAMGO. Double-immunofluorescence staining showed the co-localization of PKCalpha with CGRP- and SP-IR in cultured DRG neurons. Moreover, a combined treatment with DAMGO and a PKC inhibitor (chelerythrine chloride or G6 6976) was able to block the effects of the opioid on increased CGRP-like IR. These data suggest that the three opioid receptors may be involved in the induction of CGRP and SP observed following chronic exposure to opiates, and that PKC probably plays a role in the signaling pathway leading to the up-regulation of these neuropeptides. These findings further validate the DRG cell culture as a suitable model to study intracellular pathways that govern changes seen following repeated opioid treatments possibly leading to opioid tolerance.

Apart from its trophic effects, IGF-I has also been implicated in the regulation of brain neurotransmitter release thus indicating a neuromodulatory role for this growth factor in the central nervous system, Using in vitro slice preparations, we have earlier reported that IGF-I potently inhibits K- -evoked endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release from the adult rat hippocampus and cortex but not from the striatum. The effects of IGF-I on hippocampal ACh release was sensitise to the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin. suggesting that IGF-I might act indirectly via the release of other transmitters/modulators. In the present study. we have characterized the possible involvement of GABA in IGF-I-mediated inhibition of ACh release and measured the effects of this growth factor on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and high-affinity choline uptake in the hippocampus of the adult rat brain. Prototypical agonists of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors (i.e. 10 muM muscimol and 10 muM baclofen) inhibited, whereas the antagonists of the respective receptors (i.e, 10 muM bicuculline and 10muM phaclofen) potentiated K(+ -)evoked ACh release from rat hippocampal slices. IGF-I (10 nM) inhibited K+ - as well as veratridine-evoked ACh release from rat hippocampal slices and the effect is possibly mediated via the activation of a typical IGF-I receptor and the Subsequent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). The inhibitors effects of IGF-I on hippocampal ACh release ere not additive to those of either muscimol or baclofen, but ere attenuated by GABA antagonists, bicuculline and phaclofen. Additionally, in contrast to ACh release, IGF-I did not alter either the activity of the enzyme ChAT or the uptake of choline in the hippocampus. These results, taken together, indicate that IGF-I, under acute conditions. can decrease hippocampal ACh release by acting on the typical IGF-I/IPS receptor complex while having no direct effect on ChAT activity or the uptake of choline, Furthermore, the evidence that effects of IGF-I could be modulated, at least in part, by GABA antagonists suggest that the release of GABA and the activation of it, receptors may possibly be involved in mediating the inhibitory effects of IGF-I on hippocampal ACh release.

We examined the development of SI in genetic mouse models in which the levels of serotonin and/or dopamine and noradrenaline are drastically reduced. Mice lacking the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2 KO) are hypomorphic with rare pups surviving until postnatal day (P) 6. Serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline are almost undetectable in the brain. In S1 we find that the segregation of thalamocortical axons into whisker patterns is delayed by 1 day and that layer IV granular neurons fail to form normal barrels. Moreover, the growth of cortical layers II-IV is reduced. Despite severe malnutrition, we show that these alterations are not caused by increased cell death in the thalamus or S1. Moreover, the maturation of cortical neurons is not altered as reflected by calcium-binding protein immunolabeling. Mice lacking both VMAT2 and monoamine oxidase type A (MAOA) were generated. VMAT2-MAOA DKO mice are hypomorphic but survive until P13. Increased levels of scrotonin but profoundly reduced dopamine and noradrenaline levels are found in the brains. In SI, alterations are similar to those observed in MAOA KO mice: thalamocortical axons and granular neurons failed to form barrels. In addition there is a severe reduction in the thickness of the upper cortical layers as in the VMAT2 KO mice. These results show that monoamines have no instructive effect per se on the formation of thalamocortical patterning in S1. However, monoamines appear to be essential for the normal cytoarchitectonic maturation of the granular (IV) and supragranular cortical layers (II-III). Since developmental cell death and chemoarchitectonic differentiation of these neurons are not modified, it is possible that these alterations result from migration defects and/or from altered synaptic maturation.

To address these questions, 6-OHDA or vehicle was infused into either the ventral or dorsal striatum or into the medial forebrain bundle, under conditions of brain normothermia or hypothermia. Two weeks post-surgery, tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell bodies were counted in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra. In addition, autoradiographic labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase protein and dopamine transporter was quantified in dopamine terminal fields and cell body areas. Overall, DA cell bodies in the VTA were substantially less susceptible than those in the substantia nigra to depletion of dopaminergic markers. Hypothermia provided two types of neuroprotection. The first occurred when 6-OHDA was administered into the dorsal striatum, and was associated with a 30-50% increase in residual dopaminergic markers in the lateral portion of the VTA. The second neuroprotective effect of hypothermia occurred when 6-OHDA was given into the medial forebrain bundle. This was associated with a 200-300% increase in residual dopaminergic markers in the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal terminal fields; no significant protection occurred in the cell body regions. Collectively, these findings show that (1) the dopaminergic, somata in the substantia nigra are more susceptible than those in the VTA to 6-OHDA-induced denervation, and (2) hypothermia can provide anatomically selective neuroprotection within the substantia nigra-VTA cell population. The continued survival of mesolimbic dopamine cell bodies after a 6-OHDA lesion may have functional implications relating to drugs of abuse, as somatodendritic release of dopamine in the VTA has been shown to play a role in the effectiveness of cocaine reward.

The estrogen deficiency causes marked defects in the female reproductive system, obesity, and skeletal abnormalities. In light of estrogen's known pleio-tropic effects in the nervous system, our study examined the effects of genetically induced estrogen-testosterone imbalance on this system in female FORKO mice. Circulating concentrations of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in FORKO mice are significantly decreased (FORKO -/-: 1.13 +/- 0.34 pg/ml; wild-type +/+: 17.6 +/- 3.5 pg/ml, P < 0.0001, n = 32-41); in contrast, testosterone levels are increased (-/-: 37.7 +/- 2.3 pg/ml; wild-type +/+: 3.9 +/- 1.7 pg/ml, P < 0.005, n = 25-33). The focus was on the activities of key enzymes in the central cholinergic and peripheral nervous systems, on dorsal root ganglia (DRGS) capacity for neurite outgrowth, and on the phosphorylation state of structural neurofilament (NF) proteins. Choline acetyltransferase activity was decreased in several central cholinergic structures (striatum 50 +/- 3%, hippocampus 24 +/- 2%, cortex 12 +/- 3%) and in DRGs (11 +/- 6%). Moreover, we observed aberrations in the enzymatic activities of mitogenactivated protein kinases (extracellular-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase) in the hippocampus, DRGs, and sciatic nerves. Hippocampal and sensory ganglia samples from FORKO mice contained hyper-phosphorylated NFs, Finally, explanted ganglia of FORKO mice displayed decreased neurite outgrowth (20-50%) under non-treated conditions and when treated with E2 (10 nM). Our results demonstrate that genetic depletion of circulating estrogen leads to biochemical and morphological changes in central and peripheral neurons, and underlie the importance of estrogen in the normal development and functioning of the nervous system. In particular, the Endings suggest that an early and persisting absence of the steroid leads to neurodegenerative changes and identify several key enzymes that may contribute to the process. This model provides a system to explore the consequences of circulating estrogen deprivation and other hormonal imbalances in the nervous system. (C) 2002 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The profile of activity of the cholinergic neurons may be determined by noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons that are active during waking and silent during paradoxical sleep. Indeed, a permissive role of the noradrenergic neurons in paradoxical sleep has been proposed based upon an inhibitory action of noradrenaline through alpha(2) adrenergic receptors on the cholinergic cells. Yet some 'possibly' cholinergic neurons are purportedly maximally active during waking and excited by noradrenaline through alpha(1) receptors. In the present study, we examined by fluorescent dual-immunostaining in the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei of the rat whether choline acetyltransferase-immunopositive neurons are stained for alpha(2A) or alpha(1A) adrenergic receptors. For comparison, we examined immunostaining for these receptors on tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive locus coeruleus neurons, which are known to bear alpha(2A) autoreceptors. Whereas virtually all the noradrenergic neurons were labeled for the alpha(2A) and none for the alpha(1A), approximately half the cholinergic neurons were labeled for the alpha(2A) and one third for the alpha(1A) adrenergic receptors in adjacent sections. These results suggest that different groups of cholinergic neurons bear alpha(2) versus alpha(1) adrenergic receptors and would accordingly have different sleep-wake state activities and roles. The alpha(2)-bearing group would be inhibited by noradrenaline during waking to become disinhibited and maximally active while promoting paradoxical sleep, whereas the alpha(1)-bearing group would be excited by noradrenaline during waking to become maximally active while promoting features of that state.

Excitable cells express multiple alpha subtypes, designated Na(v)1.1-Na(v)1.9, and three beta subunits, designated beta1, beta2 and beta3. Understanding how the different a, subtypes, in combination with the various beta subunits, determine sodium channel behavior is important for elucidating the molecular basis of sodium channel functional diversity. In this study, we used whole-cell electrophysiological recording to examine the properties of the human Na(v)1.3 alpha subtype, stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and to investigate modulation of Na(v)1.3 function by beta1, beta2 and beta3 subunits. In the absence of beta subunits, human Na(v)1.3 formed channels that inactivated rapidly (tau(inactivation) approximate to 0. 5 ms at 0 mV) and almost completely by the end of 190-ms-long depolarizations. Using an intracellular solution with aspartate as the main anion, the midpoint for channel activation was similar to -12 mV. The midpoint for inactivation, determined using 100-ms conditioning pulses, was similar to -47 mV. The time constant for reprinting of inactivated channels at -80 mV was similar to6 ms. Coexpression of beta1 or beta3 did not affect inactivation time course or the voltage dependence of activation, but shifted the inactivation curve similar to10 mV negative, and slowed the repriming rate ca. three-fold. 2 did not affect channel properties, either by itself or in combination with betaI or beta3. Na(v)1.3 expression is increased in damaged nociceptive peripheral afferents. This change in channel expression levels is correlated with the emergence of a rapidly inactivating and rapidly repriming sodium current, which has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. The results of this study support the hypothesis that Na(v)1.3 may mediate this fast sodium current. (C) 2002 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In experiments on slices kept in 10 or 4 mM glucose (at 33degreesC), hypoxia was applied until the pre-synaptic afferent volley disappeared - after 12-13 min in most slices, but much earlier (5 +/- 0.8 min) in diabetic slices kept in 4 mM glucose. When oxygenation was resumed, the afferent volley returned in all slices, for an overall mean recovery of 86.5% (+/-8.8%). Field post-synaptic potentials were fully blocked within 2 3 min of the onset of hypoxia. After the end of hypoxia, they failed to reappear in some slices: overall, their recovery varied between 62 and 68% in control slices, as well as in diabetic slices kept in 10 mM glucose; but recovery was very, poor in diabetic slices kept in 4 mM glucose (only 15 +/- 0.94%). In the latter, hypoxic injury discharges occurred earlier (4.2 +/- 0.68 min vs. 6.5-8 min for other groups). We conclude that diabetes appears to make hippocampal slices more prone to irreversible loss of synaptic function and early block of axonal conduction when temporary hypoxia is combined with moderate hypoglycemia.

This localization is particularly striking in the pyramidal cells of cerebral cortex, the dendrites of which are intensely immunoreactive, but without my labeling of their spines. In view of recent yeast two-hybrid and biochemical results suggesting an association of 5-HT2A receptors with the cytoskeletal microtubule-associated protein MAP1A, the respective subcellular distributions of the receptors and of MAP1A were compared by quantitative electron microscopic immunocytochemistry in dendrites of adult rat frontoparietal cortex. Counts of silver-intensified immunogold particles revealed a higher density of 5-HT2A receptors in smaller rather than larger dendrites, and an apportionment between pre-defined compartments representing the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm that was proportional to the relative surface area of these compartments. MAP1A immunoreactivity also predominated in smaller versus larger dendrites, but with a slightly lower proportion of labeling in the plasma membrane versus cytoplasmic compartment. The co-localization of 5-HT2A receptors and MAP1A protein in the same dendrites could be demonstrated in double immunolabeling experiments. These results confirmed the predominantly somato-dendritic, intracellular localization of 5-HT2A receptors in cerebral cortex, showed their higher concentration in distal as opposed to proximal dendrites, and suggested their potential association to the cytoskeleton in cortical neurons in vivo. Such a distribution of 5-HT2A receptors reinforces our earlier hypothesis that 5-HT2A receptors participate in intra-neuronal signaling processes involving the cytoskeleton, and raises the possibility that their activation could be dependent upon that of another co-localized, plasma membrane-bound, 5-HT receptor.

This molecule has also been implicated in neurotoxicity due to its oxidative properties. Previous experiments from our laboratories have demonstrated elevated hippocampal and cortical neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA levels in aged cognitively unimpaired and impaired Long-Evans rats, which could represent either increased neuronal NOS activity thereby leading to NO-mediated neurotoxicity, or a compensatory response by aged neurones to maintain physiological nitric oxide output. The current study measured the protein expression and activity levels of neuronal and inducible NOS in young adult (6 months) and aged (24-26 months) Long-Evans rats by means of western blotting and NOS activity assay. Aged animals were assigned as either cognitively unimpaired or aged with moderate cognitive impairments based on their performances in the Morris water maze behavioural task. Our results showed that hippocampal and cortical neuronal NOS expressions were significantly decreased in aged animals. These aged animals also exhibited increased hippocampal and cortical inducible NOS expressions. Between the two aged animal groups, cognitively impaired rats showed significantly lower hippocampal and cortical neuronal but higher hippocampal inducible NOS expressions. Young adult rats exhibited significantly higher hippocampal and cortical NOS activities than the aged animals. Aged animals with cognitive deficits showed significantly lower hippocampal NOS activity than cognitively unimpaired aged rats. Our data indicate that aging is associated with a decline in neuronal but elevated inducible NOS functioning in brain areas involved in learning and memory. These phenomena could contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in a subpopulation of aged animals. (C) 2002 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

These transgenic mice were compared to their respective controls on two background strains (C3H and FVB) in several sensorimotor tests. NFH-LacZ mice were deficient in tests requiring balance and equilibrium in a manner generally independent of genetic background. In particular, NFH-LacZ mice fell more quickly than controls from two stationary beams and had fewer rears in an open-field. The transgenic mice were also impaired during the initial trials of sensorimotor learning on the rotorod. We conclude that despite the absence of overt signs of sensorimotor weakness in their home cage, the disruption of the NTH gene, causing neurofilament accumulations in the cell body and diminished axonal calibers of motoneurons, is sufficient to cause motor deficits that resemble the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

These pathways can be modulated by Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factors, (GEF) which activate Ras proteins by catalysing the exchange of GDP for GTP. Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP), a recently discovered Ras GEF, that links diacylglycerol and probably calcium to Ras signaling pathways, is expressed in brain as well as in T-cells. Here, we have used a highly selective monoclonal antibody against RasGRP to localize this protein within the striatum and related forebrain structures of developing and adult rats. RasGRP immunolabeling was found to be widespread in the mature and developing rat forebrain, Most notably, it presented a prominent patchy distribution throughout the striatum at birth and at all postnatal ages examined. These patches were found to correspond with the striosomal compartment of the striatum, as identified by mu-opioid receptor labeling in the adult. RasGRP-immunoreactivity was also observed in the matrix-like compartment surrounding these patches/striosomes but appeared later in development and was always weaker than in the patches, In both striatal compartments, RasGRP was exclusively expressed by medium-sized spiny neurons and showed no preference for neurons that project either directly or indirectly to the substantia nigra. At the ultrastructural level immunogold labeling of RasGRP was confined to the cell bodies and dendritic shafts of these output neurons. We conclude that the prominent expression of RasGRP in striosomes may be of significance for diacylglycerol signaling in the striatum, and could be of importance for the processing of limbic-related activity within the basal ganglia.

Although indirect evidence suggests that some neurotensin receptors may be localised on the nerve terminals of dopaminergic neurotics in the striatum and thus locally regulate dopamine release, a clear demonstration of such a mechanism is lacking and a number of indirect sites of action are possible, We have taken advantage of a simplified preparation in which cultured rat ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurones establish nerve terminals that co-release glutamate to determine whether neurotensin can act at presynaptic sites. We recorded glutamate-mediated synaptic currents that were generated by dopaminergic nerve terminals as an index of presynaptic function. The neurotensin receptor agonist NT(8-13) caused an inward current and an enhancement of the firing rate of dopaminergic neurones together with an increase in the frequency of spontaneous glutamate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Incompatible with a direct excitatory action on nerve terminals, NIT(8-13) failed to change the amplitude of individual action potential-evoked EPSCs or the frequency of miniature EPSCs recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin. However, NT(8-13) reduced the ability of terminal D2 dopamine receptors to inhibit action potential-evoked EPSCs in isolated dopaminergic neurotics. Taken together, our results suggest that in addition to its well-known somatodendritic excitatory effect leading to an increase in firing rate, neurotensin also acts on nerve terminals. The main effect of neurotensin on nerve terminals is not to produce a direct excitation, but rather to decrease the effectiveness of D2 receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition. (C) 2002 IBRO.

However, it remains unclear whether binocular cells in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area rely upon phase or positional offsets between their receptive fields in order to code binocular disparity. The present study aims at clarifying more precisely the neural mechanisms underlying stereoperception with two objectives in mind. First, to determine whether cells in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area code phase disparities. Secondly, to examine whether the cells sensitive to phase disparity are the same as those which code for position disparities or whether each group represent a different sub-population of disparity-sensitive neurons. We investigated this by testing both types of disparities on single neurons in this area. The results show that the vast majority of cells (74%), in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area, are sensitive to relative interocular phase disparities. These cells showed mostly facilitation (95%) and a few (5%) summation interactions. Moreover, most cells (81%) were sensitive to both position and phase disparities. The results of this study show that most binocular cells in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area are sensitive to both positional and phase offsets which demonstrate the importance of this area in stereopsis.

These cut-off scores should discriminate between patients having poor, moderate, or good quality of life (QoL) secondary to their incontinence problems. Data from two prospectively completed QoL questionnaires, the IIQ (n = 237) and the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (n = 237), were analyzed using NN and conventional statistical tools. Kohonen networks identified three distinct clusters of IIQ scores,The three clusters represent the full spectrum of possible scores on the IIQ. We interpreted these clusters as reflecting good, moderate, and poor QoL. We estimated that a score of less than 50 on the IIQ would be representative of good QoL, between 50 and 70 would be moderate QoL, and greater than 70 would be indicative of poor QoL. Validation with the SF-36 data confirmed these categories. The present study, demonstrated that the NN approach is opening new areas in the interpretation and clinical usefulness of QoL questionnaires. NN allowed the identification of three levels of QoL and should be useful in clinical decision making. (C) 2002Wiley-Liss.Inc.

J	Oh, IS; Suen, CY				Oh, IS; Suen, CY			A class-modular feedforward neural network for handwriting recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						character recognition; feedforward neural network; class modularity; large-set classification	CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; NUMERALS; NUMBER	Since the conventional feedforward neural networks for character recognition have been deigned to classify a large number of classes with one large network structure, inevitably it poses the very complex problem of determining the optimal decision boundaries for all the classes involved in a high-dimensional feature space. Limitations also exist in several aspects of the training and recognition processes. This paper introduces the class modularity concept to the feedforward neural network classifier to overcome such limitations. In the class-modular concept, the original K-classification problem is decomposed into K 2-classification subproblems. A modular architecture is adopted which consists of K subnetworks. each responsible for discriminating a class from the other K-1 classes. The primary purpose of this paper is to prove the effectiveness of class-modular neural networks in terms of their convergence and recognition power. Several cases have been studied, including the recognition of handwritten numerals (10 classes), English capital letters (26 classes). touching numeral pairs (100 classes), and Korean characters in postal addresses (352 classes). The test results confirmed the superiority of the class-modular neural network and the interesting aspects on further investigations of the class modularity paradigm.

Firstly a variety of stable and reliable global features are defined and extracted based on the character geometric structures, a novel floating detector is then proposed to detect segments along the left and right profiles of a character image used as local features. The recognition system consists of a hierarchical coarse classification and fine classification. For the coarse classifier: a three-layer feed forward neural network with back propagation learning algorithm is employed to distinguish six subsets {0}, {6}, {8}, {1,7}, {2, 3,5}, {4,9} based on the feature similarity of characters extracted. Three character classes namely {0}, {6} and {8} are directly recognized from artificial neural network (ANN). For each of characters in the latter three subsets, a decision tree classifier is built for further fine classification as follows: Firstly, the specific feature-class relationship is heuristically and empirically deduced between the feature primitives and corresponding semantic class. Then, an iterative growing and pruning algorithm is used to form a tree classifier.

J	Quach, C; Tapiero, B; Noya, F				Quach, C; Tapiero, B; Noya, F			Group A streptococcus spinal epidural abscess during varicella	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						varicella; spinal epidural abscess; group A streptococcus	CHILDREN; MANAGEMENT	Multiple complications of varicella have been described. Musculoskeletal complications (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis) as well as neurologic complications (ataxia, encephalitis, and transverse myelitis) are well-known. We describe the cases of 2 children, ages 18 months and 5 years, who were admitted recently to 2 pediatric hospitals in Montreal with a resolving varicella, abdominal and lumbar pain, and a refusal to walk and in whom a diagnosis of epidural abscess caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) was established. No previous case of epidural abscess caused by GAS in the context of varicella has been reported. Epidural abscesses are rare in pediatrics and are caused mainly by hematogenous spread of Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnosis in pediatrics is challenging because it is rare and does not present as classically as in adults. The prognosis is related to the presence of neurologic deficits before surgery and to the rapidity with which the diagnosis and the intervention are made. These cases highlight a new clinical association in children of epidural abscess caused by GAS and varicella. An early clinical diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion when back or abdominal pain with or without neurologic signs and symptoms occurs during or soon after varicella.

Results obtained from control subjects, patients with selective thermo-coagulation lesions to the medial temporal lobe and results from non-human primates and rodents are discussed. The tests involve memory for spatial locations acquired by moving around in a room, memory for objects subjects interacted with, or memory for objects and their locations. Two of the spatial memory tasks were designed specifically as analogs of the Morris water task and the 8-arm radial-maze tasks used with rats. The Morris water task was modeled by hiding a sensor under the carpet of a room (Invisible Sensor Task). Subjects had to learn its location by using an array of visual cues available in the room. A path integration task was developed in order to study the non-visual acquisition of a cognitive representation of the spatial location of objects. In the non-visual spatial memory task, we blindfolded subjects and led them to a room where they had to find 3 objects and remember their locations. We designed an object location task by placing 4 objects in a room that subjects observed for later recall of their locations. A recognition task, and a novelty detection task were given subsequent to the recall task. An 8-arm radial-maze was recreated by placing stands at equal distance from each other around the room, and asking subjects to visit each stand once, from a central point. A non-spatial working memory task was designed to be the non-spatial equivalent of the radial maze. Search paths recorded on the first trial of the Invisible Sensor Task, when subjects search for the target by trial and error are reported. An analysis of the search paths revealed that patients with lesions to the right or left hippocampus or parahippocampal cortex employed the same type of search strategies as normal controls did, showing similarities and differences to the search behavior recorded in rats. Interestingly, patients with lesions that included the right parahippocampal cortex were impaired relative to patients with lesions to the right hippocampus that spared the parahippocampal cortex, when recall of the sensor was tested after a 30 min delay (Bohbot et al. 1998). No differences were obtained between control subjects and patients with selective thermal lesions to the medial temporal lobe, when tested on the radial-maze, the non-spatial analogue to the radial-maze and the path integration tasks. Differences in methodological procedures, learning strategies and lesion location could account for some of the discrepant results between humans and non-human species. Patients with lesions to the right hippocampus, irrespective of whether the right parahippocampal cortex was spared or damaged, had difficulties remembering the particular configuration and identity of objects in the novelty detection of the object location task. This supports the role of the human right hippocampus for spatial memory, in this case, involving memory for the location of elements in the room; learning known to require the hippocampus in the rat.

The system first segments implicitly a date image into sub-fields through the recognition process based on an HMM approach. Afterwards, a recognition and verification strategy is proposed to recognize the three obligatory date sub-fields (day, month and year) using different classifiers. Markovian and neural approaches have been adopted to recognize and verify words and strings of digits respectively. We also introduce the concept of meta-classes of digits, which is used to reduce the lexicon size of the day and year and improve the precision of their segmentation and recognition. Experiments show interesting results on date recognition.

Simultaneously, the identified model is used in the design of an adaptive control to suppress the limit cycle oscillation. Hysteresis is difficult to model or identify. The ensemble average concept based on the properties of the Preisach hysteresis model is used in the design of the neural networks during the network training phase. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks employ two separate adaptation schemes where RBF's centers and width are adjusted by Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), while the outer layer weights are updated using Lyapunov stability analysis to ensure the stable closed loop control. The effectiveness of the proposed dynamic neural control methodology is demonstrated through simulations to suppress the wing rock in AFTI/F-16 test-bed aircraft having delta wing configuration.

The stochastic approximation algorithms require computation of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameter that characterizes the randomized policy. This is computed by novel simulation based gradient estimation schemes involving weak derivatives. Similar to neuro-dynamic programming algorithms (e.g. Q-learning; or Temporal Difference methods), the algorithms proposed in this paper are simulation based and do not require explicit knowledge of the underlying parameters such as transition probabilities. However, unlike neuro-dynamic programming methods, the algorithms proposed here can handle constraints and time varying parameters. The multiplier based constrained stochastic gradient algorithm proposed here is also of independent interest in stochastic approximation.

Considerable gains have been achieved in the classification performance by fusing and combining different classifiers. We experiment a new method for ship infrared imagery recognition based on the fusion of individual results in order to obtain a more reliable decision [1]. To optimize the results of every class of ship, we implemented individual classifiers using Dempster-Shafer(DS) method for each class i.e. an individual classifier returns if the ship belongs to the class or not. We compare the result of the DS classifier with the results of the individual classifier. The improvement recognition varies between 3% to 20% for a class. We then experiment a new method based on a fusion of a set of classifiers [2]. The objective of a good fuser is to perform at least as good as the best classifier in any situation. For this purpose, we consider three classifiers: DS classifier, Bayes classifier and nearest neighbor classifier and one fuser: feedforward neural network fuser. We compare the results of the best classifier with the results of the fusion of a combination of classifiers. The fuser gives a performance equal or superior to the best classifier.

The most prevalent limited proteolysis occurs at single or paired basic residues, and is achieved by one or more of the seven subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (PCs); Furin, PC1, PC2, PACE4 (paired basic amino acid converting enzyme 4), PC4, PC5 and PC7. Other types of cleavages occur at hydophobic residues, some of which are performed by subtilisin/kexin-like isozyme-1 (SKI-1), which is also known as site-1 protease. Together, the PCs and SKI-1 regulate the activity of a large variety of cellular proteins, including growth factors, neuropeptides, receptors, enzymes and even toxins and glycoproteins from infectious retroviruses. These processing events are exquisitely regulated by multiple zymogen-activation steps, as well as by specific subcellular localization signals. The above mentioned convertases are implicated in a number of pathologies such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, endocrine disorders and inflammation. Recently, it was recognized that the metalloendopeptidase N-arginine dibasic convertase (NRDc; nardilysin), which cleaves at the N-terminus side of basic residues in dibasic pairs, is localized both in the cytosol and at the cell surface or in the extracellular milieu. While NRDc binds heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) at the cell surface and potentiates its physiological effect, HB-EGF potently inhibits the NRDc's activity. NRDc could represent the equivalent of the PCs in the cytosol or the extracellular space.

As adults, maternal separation animals showed increased sensitivity to the effects of cocaine on locomotor activity and greater sensitivity to stress-induced sensitization to the effects of amphetamine on locomotor activity. These findings raise the possibility that in addition to effects on stress reactivity, early life events might dispose individuals to illness in later life through effects on very specific neuro transmitter systems.

In a knockout mouse model of Sandhoff disease, which lacks the beta-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A, alphabeta subunits) and B (Hex B, subunits), the mutant homozygous mice (Hexb(-/-)) are healthy until 15 weeks of age when they develop neurodegenerative symptoms. This study was designed to analyse the fertility profile of male and female Hexb(-/-) mice. Mating behaviour of Hexb(-/-) mice was assessed at different ages. The ovarian function of Hexb(-/-) females was determined by superovulation studies. The quality of spermatozoa and ova was assessed by an in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure. Hexb(-/-) mice were fertile at a young age. Males were fertile up to the age of 69.3 +/- 6.3 days (mean +/- SD) and females were fertile up to the age of 56-63 days. Since both the Hexb-/- sexes showed fertility, the results indicate that Hex A and Hex B (major isozymes of beta-hexosaminidase) may not be required for sperm-ovum interactions, in contrast to the widely accepted belief. On the other hand, young adult Hexb(-/-) males showed a reduction in mating behaviour at the age of 84.8 +/- 2.2 days and an absence of mating behaviour at 94.2 +/- 2.0 days. Spermatozoa from Hexb(-/-) mice (aged 109.2 +/- 1.8 days) showed a lower IVF rate. Among Hexb(-/-) females aged 85.6 +/- 2.1 days, no mice became pregnant although they were positive for a vaginal plug when caged with fertile males. The number of ova recovered from Hexb-/- females (aged 111.0 +/- 3.1 days) and the IVF rate of ova were lower than those of controls. In conclusion, Hex A and Hex B may not be required for sperm-ovum interactions. Mice lacking Hex A and Hex B activities develop infertility at a young adult age in an age-dependent manner.

The personalized biomechanical model includes elements representing the osseo-ligamentous structures of the spine, rib cage and pelvis. It also integrates the principal agonistic muscles necessary for trunk movement and a neural control model based on the Equilibrium Point hypothesis (2, model of Feldman). Muscle recruitment patterns of normal and scoliotic subjects obtained from the simulation of lateral bending movements were qualitatively compared. The generation process of motor control variables was studied by analysing the relationships between central commands and spine segment mobility. Differences in recruitment patterns between normal and scoliotic subjects were observed, especially for paraspinal fascicles crossing the thoracic curve segment. The generation of central commands for normal subjects was strongly correlated with the amplitude of bending, but this relation was weaker for scoliotic subjects and this difference was worst at the apex vertebra. These results show that neuromuscular disorders could occur at a local level. The proposed approach should provide a simulation tool to study the multifactorial origin of scoliosis, and to investigate the implication of muscles and central commands in spinal dysfunctions.

Aim and scope of the conference	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material						quality of life; consensus conference; multiple injuries	OF-LIFE; SURGERY	From September 29 until October 2, 1999, a group of international experts met in Wermelskirchen, Germany, for a consensus conference on "Quality of Life after Multiple Trauma". The meeting was initiated and sponsored by the German Ministry of Education and Research. It was the aim of the group to develop evidence-based guidelines for the systematic evaluation and application of Quality of Life (QoL) measures in patients with severe trauma. The present paper describes the format of the meeting, the selection of the participants, the time schedule, and the proceeding, in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results. The work was structured according to the different types of injury: traumatic brain injury (TBI), multiple injuries without TBI, spinal cord injury, and children with TBI. For each injury group, a specific task force group with 9-13 members was established, consisting of methodologists as well as clinicians from different disciplines. The conference was organised as an altenate sequence of plenary sessions and small working group meetings. The work itself was structured according to the following five questions which have been agreed on and distributed to the participants in advance: 1. What is the major problem (ranking) of the patient at different time points after the accident? 2. Which domains of QoL are affected in the sequelae of trauma? 3. Which instruments are useful to evaluate QoL in trauma patients? 4. Which studies have assessed QoL aspects with which instruments? 5. What instruments should be used in which patient group at what time? The moderators of each task force group summarised the respective results and tried to give recommendations for future application of QoL assessment in trauma patients. As far as possible, the statements should be based on the existing evidence. Furthermore, the groups should recommend QoL measures for use across different patient groups and time points.

Four working groups represented the following patients: children with traumatic brain injury (TBI); adults with TBI, adults with multiple injuries (but without TBI), and adults with spinal cord injury. According to predefined questions, the groups tried to identify the relevant problems of the patients, at different time points after the traumatic event. A review of the existing instruments for quality of life assessment and the evidence of their application in trauma patients in the scientific literature was performed by each group. Based on the results of these literature reviews it was concluded that there are not enough data to establish "evidence-based" guidelines for QoL assessments in these patients. Nevertheless, the groups comprised of experts clinicians and methodologists, agreed on the Glasgow Outcome Scale and the SF-36 as generic tools for QoL assessment across all trauma patients. It was further recommended to use these generic tools in combination with condition-specific instruments to better reflect the specific problems of the patients. Finally, the whole group suggested that it was not appropriate to view this conference as a "final report" about QoL assessment in trauma patients, but rather it should be seen as a starting point for increased efforts to initiate clinical research projects using QoL as an outcome, to develop better instruments, and to include QoL assessments into daily routines.

REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			French	Article							MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEMENTIA; AGE; PREDICTORS; POPULATION; DECLINE; DYSFUNCTION; PREVALENCE; PATTERNS	The aging of the population leads to increased awareness of problems associated with age-related degenerative dementias. Given that these dementias are progressive in onset, many clinicians and researchers have proposed criteria that allow for the identification of older subjects manifesting cognitive impairment, but not responding to the criteria for dementia. Our knowledge of subjects with mild cognitive impairment is limited; it is, however, established that they present a high risk of developing dementia in the future. Although it is essential to increase our comprehension of their cognitive and functional decline, the study of subjects presenting mild cognitive impairment is compromised due to the existence of numerous non-converging classifications. The goal of the present article is to conduct a critical review of the different classifications of mild cognitive impairment in the elderly in order to attempt to identify the optimal criteria, allowing for a distinction to be made between subjects with mild cognitive impairment, who remain in a stable state and those whose condition evolves to a dementia. These criteria may enable us to describe a homogeonous group of individuals presenting with different rates of dementia risk factors. We present the classifications most frequently used in clinical and research settings. After listing them according to categorial, clinical or dimensional approaches, we performed a critical analysis for each one. Depending on the diagnostic criteria applied, major variations are revealed for the prevalence of cognitive impairment and the incidence of dementia. They are explained by methodological and theoretical shortcomings that we point out and discuss (e.g., reference group, lack of diagnostic criteria or exclusion criteria, high level of subjectivity). Beyond these criticisms, we discuss the challenges to be met in order to reach the optimal identification criteria. Notably, the impact of mild cognitive impairment on daily living activities should be tested with the use of more specific questionnaires/tasks. The goal of the objective definition of cognitive impairment should be to minimize subjectivity in the diagnosis. It is also suggested that sensitive cognitive measures would be used on all aspects of cognition, while recognizing and taking into account all confounding factors (e.g., age, education level). Given the nature and consequences of mild cognitive impairment, an inter-disciplinary approach is suggested (e.g., neurobiological, psychiatric, and genetic cues). A consensus on optimal diagnostic criteria is essential to propose cognitive and phamarcological treatments for the effective prevention of dementia.

This interest is justified by the strong association observed between these diseases and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). In the first section of this paper, a critical review of the literature on the presence of REM sleep disorders in PD is presented. Studies that show an association between PD and RBD are reviewed. Studies that report the presence of other REM sleep disorders in PD (short latency, abnormal length and/or proportion of REM sleep, increasing occurrence of hallucinations) are then discussed. Limitations of the criteria proposed by Rechtschaffen et Kales (1968) for the quantification of REM sleep are also presented. Some authors believe that dopaminergic (DA) agents used in the treatment of PD (levodopa, bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole and selegiline) could be a responsable factor for the occurence of REM sleep disorders observed in this disease. The literature concerning the impact of these DA agents on human REM sleep is therefore critically reviewed. It is concluded that DA agents cannot explain on their own the presence of REM sleep disorders in PD. Other causes, among which the disturbance of some neurochemical systems linked to the neuropathological process of the disease, must be considered in order to explain these REM sleep disorders. in the second section of this paper, we present the different pathophysiological hypotheses proposed to explain REM sleep disorders in PD, such as a dysfunction of the cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic or GABAergic neurons. Emphasis is placed on the role of cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, structures shown to be particularly impaired in PD. Neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological studies demonstrate that these neurons are strongly implicated in the different REM sleep parameters (muscular atonia, electroencephalographic desynchronisation, ponto-geniculo-occipital spikes). Finally, future research directions are proposed.

They are bifunctional cues, attracting some cell types and repelling others. Netrins function as either short- or long-range cues, in some circumstances acting close to the surface of the cells that produce them and in other cases at a distance. Two classes of receptors mediate the response to netrin-1, the deleted in colorectal cancer family and the UNC-5 homolog family. Although netrin function has been extensively studied in the embryonic nervous system, netrin-1 is expressed in the adult mammalian spinal cord at a level similar to that in the embryonic CNS. In the adult and embryonic CNS, the majority of netrin-1 protein is not freely soluble but is associated with membranes and extracellular matrix. This distribution is consistent with netrin-1 acting as a short-range cue. Here we present a model whereby netrin-1 in the embryonic neural epithelium could act as a membrane-associated long-range cue. Netrin-1 is expressed in the adult by multiple types of neurons and by myelinating glia: oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS. In the white matter of the adult CNS, netrin-1 protein is absent from compact myelin but enriched in periaxonal myelin at the interface between axons and oligodendrocytes. This distribution suggests that in the adult nervous system netrin-1 may function to mediate cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, netrin receptor expression persists in neurons following injury, raising the possibility that netrin-1 may influence axonal regeneration.

We argue that the auditory cortices in the two hemispheres are relatively specialized, such that temporal resolution is better in left auditory cortical areas and spectral resolution is better in right auditory cortical areas. We propose that cortical asymmetries might have developed as a general solution to the need to optimize processing of the acoustic environment in both temporal and frequency domains.

Experiments in acutely isolated supraoptic MNCs have shown that these responses are due to in part to the cell volume-dependent modulation of gadolinium-sensitive 33 pS stretch-inactivated cation (SIC) channels. Previous studies in vivo have shown that the slope (i.e. gain) of the 'osmosensory' relation between VP release and plasma osmolality can be increased or decreased under various physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we review recent work that shows how changes in external [Na] and excitatory neuropeptides such as angiotensin II (Ang II). cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin (NT), may influence osmosensory gain in acutely isolated MNCs. Whole-cell and single-channel recording experiments have revealed that changes in external Na cause proportional changes in osmosensory gain as a result of modified SIC channel permeability and not by affecting mechanotransduction. In contrast, Ang 11, CCK, or NT appear to convergently, and directly. stimulate the osmosensory cation conductance in MNCs. Preliminary analysis in current clamp further suggests that osmosensory gain may be increased upon exposure to these excitatory peptides. Whether such mechanisms contribute to the modulation of osmosensory gain in vivo remains to be established.

J	Beaudot, WHA				Beaudot, WHA			Role of onset asynchrony in contour integration	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Vision-Sciences-Society	MAY, 2001	SARASOTA, FLORIDA	Vis Sci Soc		contour integration; onset asynchrony; dynamics; figure-ground segregation	VISUAL-SYSTEM; SEGMENTATION; LUMINANCE; BINDING; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; VISION; FIELD; COLOR	Evidence that visual grouping is facilitated when elements comprising a foreground figure are presented simultaneously, and are temporally separated from elements comprising the background, has suggested cortical synchronous oscillations as a possible neural substrate. Supporting this theory, Usher and Donnelly (Nature 394 (1998) 179) showed in one of their experiments that contour integration is facilitated when path and background elements alternate with an asynchrony below the integration time of the visual system, suggesting that these flickering stimuli interact with this hypothetical binding mechanism. I replicated this experiment and report that the effect depends in fact on the order of asynchrony between path and background elements in the first cycle of stimuli presented for more than 100 ms: facilitation in visual grouping only occurs when path elements are presented before background elements. A second experiment, exploring the effect of onset delays between path and background elements, demonstrates a strong priming effect of path elements. I conclude that Usher and Donnelly's result is likely due to the high sensitivity of the visual system to stimulus onset, and that simple flickering stimuli are inadequate for revealing the neural code for binding in figure-ground segregation without controlling for the effect of stimulus onset.

J	Mullen, KT; Kingdom, FAA				Mullen, KT; Kingdom, FAA			Differential distributions of red-green and blue-yellow cone opponency across the visual field	VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						color vision; cones; cone opponency; periphery; isoluminance; blue-yellow	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; HUMAN COLOR-VISION; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; PRIMATE RETINA; DETECTION MECHANISMS; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; STRIATE CORTEX; CHROMATIC SENSITIVITY; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEY	The color vision of Old World primates and humans uses two cone-opponent systems; one differences the outputs of L and M cones forming a red-green (RG) system, and the other differences S cones with a combination of L and M cones forming a blue-yellow (BY) system. In this paper, we show that in human vision these two systems have a differential distribution across the visual field. Cone contrast sensitivities for sine-wave grating stimuli (smoothly enveloped in space and time) were measured for the two color systems (RG & BY) and the achromatic (Ach) system at a range of eccentricities in the nasal field (0-25 deg). We spatially scaled our Stimuli independently for each system (RG, BY, & Ach) in order to activate that system optimally at each eccentricity. This controlled for any differential variations in spatial scale with eccentricity and provided a comparison between the three systems under equivalent conditions. We find that while red-green cone opponency has a steep decline away from the fovea, the loss in blue-yellow cone opponency is more gradual, showing a similar loss to that found for achromatic vision. Thus only red-green opponency, and not blue-yellow opponency, can be considered a foveal specialization of primate vision with an overrepresentation at the fovea. In addition, statistical calculations of the level of chance cone opponency in the two systems indicate that selective S cone connections to postreceptoral neurons are essential to maintain peripheral blue-yellow sensitivity in human vision. In the red-green system, an assumption of cone selectivity is not required to account for losses in peripheral sensitivity. Overall, these results provide behavioral evidence for functionally distinct neuro-architectural origins of the two color systems in human vision, supporting recent physiological results in primates.

We show that the optimal call admission policy can be computed via a stochastic gradient algorithm. Similar to neuro-dynamic programming algorithms the algorithms proposed in this paper are s simulation based and do not require explicit knowledge of the underlying parameters such as transition probabilities (or equivalently invariant distributions). However unlike Q-learning or Temporal Difference methods, the algorithms proposed here straightforwardly can handle constraints.

A key question is whether p75NTR promotes apoptosis by directly inhibiting or modulating TrkA activity, or by stimulating cell death independently of TrkA. Here we provide evidence for the latter model. Specifically, experiments presented here demonstrate that the presence or absence of p75NTR does not alter Trk activity or NGF- and NT-3-mediated downstream survival signaling in primary neurons. Crosses of p75NTR(-/-) and TrkA(-/-) mice indicate that the coincident absence of p75NTR substantially rescues TrkA(-/-) sympathetic neurons from developmental death in vivo. Thus, p75NTR induces death regardless of the presence or absence of TrkA expression. These data therefore support a model where developing sympathetic neurons are "destined to die" by an ongoing p75NTR-mediated apoptotic signal and one of the major ways that TrkA promotes neuronal survival is by silencing this ongoing death signal.

Two common polymorphisms of the human enzyme have been identified: 677C >T, which leads to the substitution of Ala-222 by valine, and 1298A >C, which leads to the replacement of Glu-429 by alanine; the former polymorphism is the most frequent genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. By using a baculovirus expression system, recombinant human MTHFR has been expressed at high levels and purified to homogeneity in quantities suitable for biochemical characterization. The Glu429Ala protein has biochemical properties that are indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme. The Ala222Val MTHFR, however, has an enhanced propensity to dissociate into monomers and to lose its FAD cofactor on dilution; the resulting loss of activity is slowed in the presence of methyltetrahydrofolate or adenosylmethionine. This biochemical phenotype is in good agreement with predictions made on the basis of studies comparing wild-type Escherichia coli MTHFR with a mutant, Ala177Val, homologous to the Ala222Val mutant human enzyme.

AptKv3.3 expression was brain specific, with the highest level of expression in the cerebellum and 56% relative expression in the ELL. In situ hybridization revealed that AptKv3.3 mRNA was present in virtually all cell classes in the ELL as well as in the cerebellar lobes eminentia granularis pars posterior (EGp) and corpus cerebellum (CCb). Immunocytochemistry indicated a distribution of AptKv3.3 channels over the entire soma-dendritic axis of ELL pyramidal, granule, and polymorphic cells and over the soma and at least proximal dendrites (100 mum) of multipolar cells and neurons of the ventral molecular layer. AptKv3.3 immunolabel was present at the soma of cerebellar granule, golgi, eurydendroid, and CCb Purkinje cells, with an equally intense label throughout the dendrites of CCb Purkinje cells and EGp eurydendroid cells. Immunolabel was virtually absent in afferent or efferent axon tracts of the ELL but was detected on climbing fiber axons and on the axons and putative terminal boutons of CCb Purkinje cells. These data reveal a prominent somadendritic distribution of AptKv3.3 K+ channels in both principal output and local circuit neurons, a pattern that is distinct from the soma-axonal distribution that characterizes all other Kv3 K+ channels examined to date. The widespread distribution of AptKv3.3 immunolabel in electrosensory cells implies an important role in several aspects of signal processing. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Using in vivo extracellular unitary recordings performed in anesthetized rats, iontophoretic applications of the excitatory amino acid antagonist kynurenate attenuated the enhancement in firing produced by glutamate and kainate. In contrast, GABA applications decreased the firing activity of NE neurons which was attenuated by the enhancement produced by glutamate and kainate. In contrast, GABA applications decreased the firing activity of NE neurons which was attenuated by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. 8-OH-DPAT (10-60 mug kg(-1), i.v.) produced a dose-dependent enhancement in the firing activity of NE neurons that was abolished in the presence of kynurenate application. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 (100 mug kg(-1), i.v.) suppressed NE firing which was reversed by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist MDL 100,907 (200 mug kg(-1), i.v.). In the presence of bicuculline, the inhibitory effect of WAY 100,635 was blunted. These results suggest that WAY 100,635 mainly attenuates NE neuron firing by blocking inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors on glutamatergic neurons, thereby enhancing glutamate release and activating excitatory amino acid receptors, possibly of the kainate subtype, on 5-HT terminals. The ensuing increased 5-HT release would then act on excitatory 5-HT(2)A receptors on GABA neurons that would ultimately mediate the inhibition of NE neurons. The prevention of the excitatory action of 8-OH-DPAT on NE neuron firing by kynurenate is also consistent with this neurocircuitry. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

To evaluate other deficits, ionotropic glutamate receptors sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainic acid (KA) were examined by autoradiography with [H-3] MK-801, [H-3] AMPA, and [H-3] KA. These surveys were carried out in selected areas of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and related limbic regions, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum from heterozygous (wv/+) and homozygous (wv/wv) weaver mutants, and compared to wild-type (+/+) mice. In wv/+ and wv/wv mutants, NMDA receptor levels were lower in cortical areas, septum, hippocampus, subiculum, neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, superior colliculus, and in the cerebellar granular layer. Densities of KA receptors were lower in cortical areas, hippocampus, limbic system structures, neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and hypothalamus, superior and inferior colliculi, and cerebellar cortex of wv/wv mutants. Levels of AMPA receptors in the weaver were higher than in +/+ mice, particularly in somatosensory and piriform cortices and periaqueductal gray of wv/+, and in somatosensory cortex, CA1 field of Ammon's horn and cerebellar granular layer of wv/wv. Abnormal developmental signals, aberrant cellular responses, or a distorted balance between neurotransmitter interactions may underlie such widespread and reciprocal glutamate receptor alterations, while in the case of cerebellar cortex, NMDA receptors are lacking due to a massive disappearance of cerebellar granule cells and some loss of Purkinje neurons.

J	Mumby, DG				Mumby, DG			Perspectives on object-recognition memory following hippocampal damage: lessons from studies in rats	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						hippocampus; fornix; medial temporal lobe; object recognition; amnesia; ischemia	MATCHING-TO-SAMPLE; NONSPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; FORNIX TRANSECTION; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEYS; BRAIN-DAMAGE; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; AMNESIC SUBJECTS; FIMBRIA-FORNIX	One of the routine memory abilities impaired in amnesic patients with temporal-lobe damage is object-recognition memory-the ability to discriminate the familiarity of previously encountered objects. Reproducing this impairment has played a central role in animal models of amnesia during the past two decades, and until recent years most of the emphasis was on describing how hippocampal damage could impair object recognition. Today most investigators are looking outside the hippocampus to explain the impairment. This paper reviews studies of object-recognition memory in rats with hippocampal damage produced by ablation, fornix transection, or forebrain ischemia. Some new perspectives on previous findings reinforce the conclusion that damage to the hippocampus has little if any impact on the ability to recognize objects, while damage in some areas outside the hippocampus is far more effective. The few circumstances in which hippocampal damage can impair performance on object-recognition tasks are situations where ancillary abilities are likely to play a significant role in supporting task performance. Some of the factors that contributed to the origins and persistence of the hippocampalcentric view of object-recognition are considered, including lesion confounds, failure to distinguish between impaired task performance and impairment of a memory ability, and disproportionate attention to a few lesion studies in monkeys, even though the hypothesis was tested far more times in rats, under a greater variety of conditions, and rejected on nearly every occasion.

J	Szabo, ST; Blier, P				Szabo, ST; Blier, P			Functional and pharmacological characterization of the modulatory role of serotonin on the firing activity of locus coeruleus norepinephrine neurons	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						5-HT1A receptor; 5-HT2A receptor; alpha(2)-adrenoceptor; antidepressant; anxiety disorder; firing activity	GLUTAMATE-EVOKED ACTIVATION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NORADRENERGIC NEURONS; PANIC DISORDER; RAT-BRAIN; 5-HT2A RECEPTORS; RAPHE DORSALIS; NUCLEUS; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE; INVOLVEMENT	Previous studies, using in vivo extracellular unitary recordings in anaesthetized rats, have shown that the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 suppressed the firing rate of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons and that this effect was abolished by lesioning 5-HT neurons. In the present experiments, the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL 100,907, while having no effect on the spontaneous firing activity of LC neurons in controls, was able to restore NE neuronal discharges following the injection of WAY 100,635. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the firing activity of NE neurons and this action was entirely dependent on intact 5-HT neurons, unlike the inhibitory effect of the 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI. Taken together, these data indicate that 5-HT2A but not 5-HT1A receptors controlling LC firing activity are postsynaptic to 5-HT neurons. Prolonged, but not subacute, administration of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) produces a decrease in the spontaneous firing activity of LC NE neurons. MDL 100,907 partially reversed this suppressed firing activity of LC neurons in paroxetine-treated rats. Although the alpha (2)-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan also enhanced the firing activity of NE neurons in paroxetine-treated rats, this increase was similar to that obtained in controls. In conclusion, prolonged SSRI treatment enhances a tonic inhibitory influence by 5-HT on LC neurons through postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors that are not located on NE neurons. A speculative neuronal circuitry accounting for these phenomena on LC NE activity is proposed. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Inherited deficiency of sialidase results in sialidosis or galactosialidosis, both severe metabolic disorders associated with lysosomal storage of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides. Sialidase also plays an important role in cellular signaling and is specifically required for the production of cytokine interleukin-4 by activated T lymphocytes. In these cells, neu-1-encoded sialidase activity is increased on the cell surface, suggesting that a specific mechanism regulates sorting of this enzyme to the plasma membrane. We investigated that mechanism by first showing that sialidase contains the internalization signal found in lysosomal membrane proteins targeted to endosomes via clathrin-coated pits. The signal consists of a C-terminal tetrapeptide (412)YGTL(415), with Tyr(412) and Leu(415) essential for endocytosis of the enzyme. We further demonstrated that redistribution of sialidase from lysosomes to the cell surface of activated lymphocytes is accompanied by increased reactivity of the enzyme with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. We speculate that phosphorylation of Tyr(412) results in inhibition of sialidase internalization in activated lymphocytes.

The activated Trk receptors then stimulate local effects at nerve terminals, and retrograde effects at neuronal cell bodies that often reside at considerable distances from the terminals. However, the nature of the retrograde signal has been mysterious. Recent experiments suggest that the major retrograde signal required for survival and gene expression consists of activated Trk itself. Remarkably, signaling by Trk may differ at the terminal versus the neuronal cell body as a consequence of the retrograde transport mechanism, thereby allowing NGF to not only promote growth locally, but to specifically support survival and gene expression retrogradely.

J	Worsley, KJ				Worsley, KJ			Testing for signals with unknown location and scale in a chi(2) random field, with an application to fMRI	ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY			English	Article						Euler characteristic; differential topology; integral geometry; image analysis; wavelet thresholding; adaptive filtering; multiscale; multiresoiution	EXCURSION SETS; SENSORY STIMULATION; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; GEOMETRY	Siegmund and Worsley (1995) considered the problem of testing for signals with unknown location and scale in a Gaussian random field defined on RN. The test statistic was the maximum of a Gaussian random field in an N + 1 dimensional 'scale space', N dimensions for location and I dimension for the scale of a smoothing filter. Scale space is identical to a continuous wavelet transform with a kernel smoother as the wavelet, though the emphasis here is on signal detection rather than image compression or enhancement. Two methods were used to derive an approximate null distribution for N = 2 and N = 3: one based on the method of volumes of tubes, the other based on the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to show how the latter method can be extended to higher dimensions, and to apply this more general result to chi(2) fields. The result of Siegmund and Worsley (1995) then follows as a special case. In this paper the results are applied to the problem of searching for activation in brain images obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Background The Healing and Afterload Reducing Therapy (HEART) trial has shown that early use of ramipril improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and attenuates IV remodeling when initiated soon after MI. This neurohumoral substudy of HEART investigates the changes in vasoconstrictive and natriuretic peptides and their relationship with IV remodeling. Methods One hundred twenty-two patients had blood drawn for the measurement of catecholamines, endothelin-1, angiotensin II, Nt-proANP and BNP, and prostacyclins within 24 hours of an MI, and at 3, 14, and 90 days after the MI. Quantitative echocardiograms were performed at baseline and at 14 days. Results All neurohormones except angiotensin. II (P = .12) and prostaglandins were significant. ly elevated at baseline. Vasoconstrictive neurohormones decreased significantly over time but remained elevated at 14 days. Both Nt-proANP and BNP were elevated within the First 14 days. BNP decreased significantly by 90 days, whereas Nt-proANP exhibited no change between 14 and 90 days. Ramipril decreased plasma levels of angiotensin II at 3 days but had no effect on the other neurohormones. Conclusions Neurohumoral activation occurs and persists in patients with anterior MI and overall preserved LV function. Ramipril had only a modest impact on neurohormones despite its significant benefits on LV remodeling soon after MI.

To map genes that may play a role in the vulnerability to RLS, a genomewide scan was conducted in a large French-Canadian family. Significant linkage was established on chromosome 12q, for a series of adjacent microsatellite markers with a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.42 (recombination fraction .05; P=6 x 10(-4); autosomal recessive mode of inheritance), whereas multipoint linkage calculations yielded a LOD score of 3.59. Haplotype analysis refined the genetic interval, positioning the RLS- predisposing gene in a 14.71-cM region between D12S1044 and D12S78. These findings represent the first mapping of a locus conferring susceptibility to RLS.

Genotype analysis indicated families 7610 and 7473 bear deletions. In Family 7610 the deletion removed the entire NF1 gene except exons 1 to 4b. The breakpoint of the deletion is located between exons 4a and 4b. The deletion 7473 was derived from the maternal chromosome and exons 1 to 5 were deleted. The breakpoint of the deletion is located between exons 7 and 13. Their phenotypes are reported. The allele frequencies of microsatellites IVS27AC28.4 and IVS38GT 53.0 are compared to previously reported data from Caucasians, including Spanish and Italians.

However, it is unknown whether the (progressive) loss of tissue affects the brain globally or whether tissue loss is more prominent in some areas than in others. Methods: Magnetic resonance whole brain images were acquired from 159 patients with schizophrenia or a schizophreniform disorder and 158 healthy subjects across a 55-year age span. Gray matter density maps were made and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. Results: Compared with healthy subjects, decreases in gray matter density were found in the left amygdala; left hippocampus; right supramarginal gyrus; thalamus; (orbito) frontal, (superior) temporal, occipitotemporal, precuneate, posterior cingulate, and insular cortices bilaterally in patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. Compared with healthy subjects, increases in gray matter density were exclusively found in the right caudate and globus pallidus in patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. A group-by-age interaction for density was found in the left amygdala, owing to a negative regression slope of gray matter density on age in the left amygdala in patients compared with healthy subjects. Conclusions: Gray matter density is decreased in distinct focal areas in the brains of patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder, The decreased density in the left amygdala is more pronounced in older patients with schizophrenia.

Design: Consecutive sample. Setting: Internal medicine practice. Participants: Thirty-six male patients (age range, 17-72yr) from an internal medicine practice. Intervention: Subjects performed 20 consecutive footfall impacts onto a force platform while barefoot and while wearing shoes. Main Outcome Measures: Ground reaction forces were recorded for each footfall. Results: Impact is positively related to age both when barefoot (r =.84, p < .001) and when wearing shoes (r = .71, p < .001). Impact remains constant until age 50, after which it increases by 13.3% for barefoot subjects. Barefoot impact was significantly lower and less variable than impact when shod (barefoot = 1.18 body weight [BW]; shod = 1.22 BW; F-1.5 = 169.91, p < .001). Conclusion: An increase in impact force during locomotion was identified that occurs in late middle age, when stability declines and idiopathic weight-bearing joint osteoarthritis develops. Because impact is negatively related to stability, the impact rise is probably caused by postural adjustments to instability resulting from irreversible neurologic decline. This heightened impact may account for the accelerated rate of weight-bearing joint osteoarthritis that begins in late-middle age.

In the first series of experiments, an acute intraperitoneal injection of paroxetine (10 mg/kg) produced a significant reduction in 5-HT synthesis in brain structures containing serotonergic cell bodies (the dorsal, median, and pallidum raphe nuclei), as well as in most projection areas: the ventral tegmental area, median forebrain bundle, hippocampus CA3 region, and nigrostriatal structures (substantia nigra, lateral and medial caudate nuclei). The reductions in the projection areas were greater (between 25 and 53%) than in those areas containing serotonergic cell bodies (between 18 and 23%). In the cerebral cortex, 5-HT synthesis rates were not modified by acute paroxetine treatment. In a second series of experiments, rats were treated with paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day, s.c., delivered by osmotic minipumps) for 14 days. There was a marked decrease (39-69%) in 5-HT synthesis in every structure examined. In conclusion, the present data suggest that the effects of paroxetine on 5-HT synthesis in the cerebral cortex are different from its effects in the cell body area of the brainstem.

Subjects included left-hemisphere-damaged (LHD) and right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD) patients and nonneurological controls. They were instructed to read sentences containing double-stressed target words in the presence of a clause boundary or its absence. Whereas all three groups of subjects were capable of manipulating the acoustic parameters that signal a shift in,tress, there were Some differences between the performance of the patient groups and that of die normal controls. Further. stress production deficits were more severe in LHD aphasic patients than in RHD patient, LHD speakers exhibited deficits in the control of both temporal and F-o cues. Their F-o disturbance appears to be secondary to a primary deficit in temporal control at the phase or sentence level, as an increased number of continuation rises found for the LHD patient seemed to arise front lengthy pauses within sentences. Findings are highlighted to address the nature of breakdown in speech prosody and the competing views of prosodic lateralization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.

Rest tremor in subjects with Parkinson's disease receiving HF-DBS was recorded continuously throughout switching the deep brain stimulator on (at an effective frequency) and off. These data suggest that the stimulation induces a qualitative change in the dynamics, called a Hopf bifurcation, so that the stable oscillations are destabilized. We hypothesize that the periodic stimulation modifies a parameter affecting the oscillation in a time dependent way and thereby induces a Hopf bifurcation. We explore this hypothesis using a schematic network model of an oscillator interacting with periodic stimulation. The mechanism of time-dependent change of a control parameter in the model captures two aspects of the dynamics observed in the data: (1) a gradual increase in tremor amplitude when the stimulation is switched off and a gradual decrease in tremor amplitude when the stimulation is switched on and (2) a time delay in the onset and offset of the oscillations. This mechanism is consistent with these rest tremor transition data and with the idea that HF-DBS acts via the gradual change of a network property. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.

J	Beland, R; Mimouni, Z				Beland, R; Mimouni, Z			Deep dyslexia in the two languages of an Arabic/French bilingual patient	COGNITION			English	Article						deep dyslexia; bilingualism; Arabic; French; connectionism	SEMANTIC PARALEXIAS; APHASIA; SPANISH; ALEXIA; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; RECOGNITION; LESION; MEMORY; ERRORS; WORDS	We present a single case study of an Arabic/French bilingual patient, ZT, who, at the age of 32, suffered a cerebral vascular accident that resulted in a massive infarct in the left perisylvian region. ZT's reading displays the characteristics of the deep dyslexia syndrome in both languages, that is, production of semantic, visual, and morphological errors, and concreteness effect in reading aloud and impossibility of reading nonwords. In the first part of this paper, using a three-route model of reading, we account for the patient's performance by positing functional lesions, which affect the non-lexical, the semantic lexical and the non-semantic lexical routes of reading. Phonological priming observed in a cross-language visual lexical decision task indicates that implicit assembled phonological recoding is possible. The above lesions and implicit nonword reading characterize the output form of deep dyslexia. However, error distribution reveals dissociations across languages (e.g. the semantic error rate is higher in French whereas translations are more frequent in the Arabic testing) that cannot be accounted for within a three-route model. In the second part, extensions to Plant and Shallice's connectionist model (Cognitive Neuropsychology, 10 (5) (1993) 377) are proposed to account for the translinguistic errors observed. ZT's error distribution is compared to that obtained by Plant and Shallice after lesions had been applied at different locations through the 40-60 network. The overall syndrome of deep dyslexia found in both languages is explained as resulting from lesions along the direct (O --> I) and output (S --> Ip, Ip --> P) pathways of reading. Lesions along the output pathway mostly affecting S --> Ip connections in French and Ip --> P connections in Arabic account for discrepancies in ZT's error pattern across tasks and languages. This case study demonstrates the superiority of a connectionist approach for predicting the error pattern in deep dyslexia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Enhancement of the recovery process could be achieved with new rehabilitation approaches alone or in combination with pharmacological intervention. These new approaches have evolved from fundamental advances in both animal and human studies. To date few randomized clinical trials have addressed the efficacy or effectiveness of these new approaches. In this paper, important quantitative studies will be reviewed and discussed in relation to the important mechanisms of locomotor control and plasticity that take place following lesions of the central nervous system.

Methods: Six patients with small high attenuation foci in the ventricular drain tract seen on CT after removal of the drain were retrospectively identified. The CT studies before, during, and after ventricular drainage were reviewed for the size, shape, location, and time of appearance of these foci. Results: In all patients, the high attenuation foci in the drain's tract were identified on CT done within 24 h from removal of the drain. In one patient, the high attenuation focus was seen adjacent to the drain on the CT obtained while the drain was in place. The high attenuation foci maintained constant size and shape on serial follow-up CT, and had variable location along the drain's tract. None of the patients developed symptoms related to these foci. Conclusion: Small bone pieces from the calvarium. after drilling for external ventricular drain can inadvertently be pushed into the brain parenchyma during drain insertion. Early identification of these pieces on CT after removal of the drain and their constant size and shape are the clues for their nature. Temporal evolution of CT findings does not support the possibility of calcification in a small infarction or hematoma in the tract of the drain, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Although MHC class II molecules are frequently detected on MG cells, suggesting that they may be capable of antigen (Ag) presentation to CD4(+) T cells, deficiencies in CD4(+) T-cell activation are associated with these nonimmunogenic tumors. We evaluated regulation of the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), the key intermediate that controls class II expression, in MG cells and tested whether MG cells could process native Ag. After interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulation, MG cells upregulated CIITA and class II molecules. IFN-gamma -inducible CIITA expression in MG cells, as well as primary human astrocytes, was directed by two CIITA promoters, pIV, the promoter for IFN-gamma -inducible CIITA expression in nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells (APC), and pIII, the promoter that directs constitutive CIITA expression in B cells. Both pIII and pIV directed CIITA transcription in vivo in MGs and ex vivo in IFN-gamma -activated primary MG cultures. We also demonstrate for the first time that MG cells can process native Ag for presentation to CD4(+) MHC class II-restricted Th1 cells, indicating that MG cells can serve as nonprofessional A-PC. CIITA may be a key target to modulate MHC class II expression, which could augment immunogenicity, Ag presentation, and CD4(+) T-cell activation in MG therapy. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Su, ZH; Khorasani, K				Su, ZH; Khorasani, K			A neural-network-based controller for a single-link flexible manipulator using the inverse dynamics approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						flexible-link manipulators; inverse control; neural networks; nonlinear control; online training	TRAJECTORY CONTROL; ARM	This paper presents an intelligent-based control strategy for tip position tracking control of a single-link flexible manipulator. Motivated by the well-known inverse dynamics control strategy for rigid-link manipulators, two feedforward neural networks (NNs) are proposed to learn the nonlinearities of the flexible arm associated with the inverse dynamics controller. The redefined output approach is used by feeding back this output to guarantee the minimum phase behavior of the resulting closed-loop system. No a priori knowledge about the nonlinearities of the system is needed and the payload mass is also assumed to be unknown. The network weights are adjusted using a modified online error backpropagation algorithm that is based on the propagation of output tracking error, derivative of that error and the tip deflection of the manipulator. The real-time controller is implemented on an experimental test bed. The results achieved by the proposed NN-based controller are compared experimentally with conventional proportional-plus-derivative-type and standard inverse dynamics controls to substantiate and verify the advantages of our proposed scheme and its promising potential in identification and control of nonlinear systems.

Hypothetically, people with chronic liver disease may be more sensitive to the adverse neurotoxic effects of Mn. In this work, bioaccumulation of Mn, as well as histopathology and neurobehavioral damage, in end-to-side portacaval anastomosis ( PCA) rats exposed to Mn phosphate via inhalation was investigated. During the week before the PCA operation, 4 wk after the PCA operation, and at the end of exposure, the rats were subjected to a locomotor evaluation ( day-night activities) using a computerized autotrack system. Then a group of 6 PCA rats ( EXP) was exposed to 3050 mug m(-3) ( Mn phosphate) for 8 h/day, 5 days/wk for 4 consecutive weeks and compared to a control group ( CON), 7 PCA rats exposed to 0.03 mug m(-3). After exposure, the rats were euthanized and Mn content in tissues and organs was determined by neutron activation analysis. The manganese concentrations in blood (0.05 mug/g vs. 0.02 mug/g), lung (1.32 mug/g vs. 0.24 mug/g), cerebellum (0.85 mug/g vs. 0.64 mug/g), frontal cortex (0.87 mug/g vs. 0.61 mug/g), and globus pallidus (3.56 mug/g vs. 1.33 mug/g) were significantly higher in the exposed group compared to the control group (p < .05). No difference was observed in liver, kidney, testes, and caudate putamen between the two groups. Neuronal cell loss was assessed by neuronal cell counts. The loss of cells in globus pallidus and caudate putamen as well as in frontal cortex was significantly higher (p < .05) for the EXP group. Assessment of the locomotor activities did not reveal any significant difference. This study constitutes a first step toward our understanding of the potential adverse effects of Mn in sensitive populations.

Properties of natural rewards are mimicked by electrical stimulation of certain brain regions. The rewarding effect produced by stimulating the perifornical region of the hypothalamus is modulated by body weight and is attenuated both by leptin and insulin. Research is reviewed concerning the dependence of the rewarding effect of perifornical stimulation on long-term energy stores and the effects of two neuropeptides implicated in the regulation of energy balance, neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing hormone. It is proposed that the potentiating effect of weight loss on perifornical self-stimulation is not tied to an increased propensity to eat or to an enhancement of food reward per se, but resembles the influence of long-term energy stores on non-ingestive behaviors that defend body weight, such as hoarding.

Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and cerebral blood velocity (CBV) (transcranial Doppler) were recorded at rest and during 80 degrees head-up tilt (HUT). Static cerebral autoregulation as assessed from the change in cerebrovascular resistance during HUT was the same in NMS and controls. Properties of dynamic cerebral autoregulation were inferred from transfer gain, coherence, and phase of the relationship between BP and CBV estimated from filtered data segments (0.02-0.8 Hz). During the 3 min preceding syncope, dynamic cerebral autoregulation of subjects with NMS did not differ from that of controls nor did it change over the course of HUT in patients with NMS or in control subjects. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation was also unaffected by the degree of orthostatic intolerance as inferred from latency to onset of syncope. We conclude that cerebral autoregulation in patients with recurrent syncope does not differ from that of normal control subjects.

J	Gjedde, T; Marrett, S				Gjedde, T; Marrett, S			Glycolysis in neurons, not astrocytes, delays oxidative metabolism of human visual cortex during sustained checkerboard stimulation in vivo	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						astrocytes; lactate; neurons; oxygen; stimulation	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; LACTATE-DEHYDROGENASE ISOENZYMES; POSITRON EMITTING OXYGEN; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; VIBROTACTILE STIMULATION; GLUCOSE CONSUMPTION; SINGLE INHALATION; ACTIVATION; TRANSPORT; FLOW	The regulation of brain energy metabolism during neuronal activation is poorly understood. Specifically, the extent to which oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis supplies the additional ATP necessary to sustain neuronal activation is in doubt. A recent hypothesis claims that astrocytes generate lactate with the muscle-type lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme LD(5). Lactate from astrocytes then undergoes oxidation in neurons after reconversion to pyruvate by the LDH subtype LD(1). On the basis of this hypothesis, the authors predicted that the time course of an excitatory increase of the oxidative metabolism of brain tissue must depend on the degree to which astrocytes provide neurons with pyruvate in the form of lactate. From the known properties of the LDH subtypes, the authors predicted two time courses for the changes of oxygen consumption in response to neuronal stimulation: one reflecting the properties of the neuronal LDH subtype LD(1), and the other reflecting the astrocytic LDH subtype LD(5). Measuring oxygen consumption (CMRo(2)) with positron emission tomography, the authors demonstrated increased CMRo(2) during sustained stimulation of visual cortex with a complex stimulus. The CMRo(2) increased 20.5% after 3 minutes and 27.5% after 8 minutes of stimulation, consistent with a steady-state oxygen-glucose metabolism ratio of 5.3, which is closest to the index predicted for the LD(1) subtype. The index is equal to the oxygen-glucose metabolism ratio of 5.5 calculated at baseline, indicating that pyruvate is converted to lactate in a cellular compartment with an LDH reaction closest to that of LD(1), whether at rest or during stimulation of the visual cortex with the current stimulus. The findings are consistent with a claim that neurons increase their oxidative metabolism in parallel with an increase of pyruvate, the latter generated by neuronal rather than astrocytic glycolysis.

Both are known to have anesthetic properties, as do a number of other ring A-reduced progesterone metabolites. The possible significance of these steroids with respect to the mood changes that are common in pregnancy and in the puerperium has not been explored. In this study, pregnenolone, progesterone, and five neuroactive progesterone metabolites: the 5 alpha and 5 beta dihydroprogesterones (DHP), and three tetrahydroprogesterones (THP)-3 alpha ,5 alpha -THP, 3 beta ,5 beta -THP, and 3 beta ,5 alpha -THP-were studied at various stages of pregnancy and in the early postpartum period. Levels of all of the steroids rose greatly during pregnancy (P < 0.001), being highest for progesterone (562-fold the follicular level), 5 alpha -DHP (161-fold), 3 beta ,5 alpha -THP (56-fold), 3 alpha ,5 alpha -THP (37-fold), pregnenolone (30-fold), 5 beta -DHP (16-fold) and 3 beta ,5 beta -THP (16-fold) at 37 wk of gestation. During the period 2-7 d postpartum, the level of progesterone fell precipitously, whereas those of pregnenolone and the metabolites fell more slowly and mean levels were still elevated compared with follicular levels 2 wk after delivery. By 7 wk postpartum, only 3 alpha ,5 alpha -tetrahydroprogesterone and 3 beta ,5 beta -tetrahydroprogesterone remained slightly elevated (P less than or equal to 0.012 and 0.007, respectively). Mean levels of the progesterone metabolites tended to be higher in depressed patients compared with controls, and this difference reached significance for 5 alpha -dihydroprogesterone both at 27 wk (P = 0.04) and at 37 wk (P = 0.02) of gestation (combined, P = 0.003). These results show that all five of these metabolites rise markedly during pregnancy and suggest that alterations in progesterone metabolites may be involved in the mood changes of pregnancy and the puerperium.

Materials and Metho :To record VTE prophylaxis prescribed for surgical patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) within the first postoperative week. We conducted a prospective observational cross-sectional study of Canadian university affiliated ICUs. Result : Of 29 ICU Directors approached, 28 (96.6%) participated, representing 34 ICUs and 589 ICU beds across Canada. Among 89 patients, surgical procedures were 32 abdominal (36.0%), 19 vascular (21.3%), 10 orthopedic (11.2%), 9 trauma (10.1%), 8 neurologic (9.0%), 5 thoracic (5.6%), 5 gynecologic (5.6%), and 1 for necrotizing fasclitis (1.1%). VTE prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and intermittent pneumatic compression was used in 35 of 89 (39.3%), 8 of 89 (9.0%), and 9 of 89 (10.1%) patients, respectively, whereas 8 of 89 (9.0%) patients were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Two methods of VTE prophylaxis were prescribed for 20 of 89 (22.5%) patients. Prophylaxis with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin was significantly less likely to be prescribed for postoperative ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation compared with those weaned from mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR] 0.36, P = .03). The use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices was significantly associated with current hemorrhage (OR 13.5, P = .02), and risk for future hemorrhage (OR 19.3, P = .001). Conclusions:VTE prevention for surgical ICU patients within the first postoperative week appear to be individualized, and influenced by current and future risks of thrombosis and bleeding.

Design: A prospective design was used to document balance 5 days before injury and 1, 4, and 12 weeks after injury. Outcome Measures: The assessments used were the balance subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, the Pediatric Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction for Balance, and the Postural Stress Test. Results: One week after the trauma, balance deficits were observed in the three tests. The deficits improved 4 weeks after the injury and performance remained stable over the following 2 months for two of the evaluations except for the Postural Stress Test performance, which failed to improve in the 3-month period after trauma. Conclusions: The good recovery of balance skills observed over the first month after injury seems to validate the current activity restrictions imposed on children after a mild head injury. However, the persistence of poor performance in the area of reactions to external perturbations indicates that some deficits may persist beyond what is expected with this population.

We have used an in vitro assay of lymphocyte migration across monolayers of human adult brain endothelial cells (HBEC) as a model of lymphocyte migration across the BBB. We found that human allogeneic or MBP-reactive Th2-polarized lymphocytes mi.-rate more avidly than Th1-polarized lymphocytes. Migration of Th2 but not Th1 cells across brain endothelium was inhibited by antibodies directed at MCP-1, a chemokine produced by HBECs. We could detect CCR2, a chemokine receptor that recognizes MCP-1 on Th2 but not Th1 lymphocytes. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 molecules were expressed on the surface of HBECs under basal conditions and were upregulated by Th1 but not Th2 cell-derived supernatants. Migration of both lymphocyte subsets was dependent on LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions. Blocking VLA-4/VCAM-1 binding did not influence actual trans-endothelial mi.-ration. These results suggest that HBECs composing the BBB favor the mi.-ration of Th2 cells. We postulate that this selectivity may help prevent activated Th1 lymphocytes, the putative CNS autoimmune disease initiating cells, from reaching the CNS parenchyma and favor entry of Th2 cells, a putative means to induce bystander suppression in the CNS.

To identify the bases for these changes we compared, in embryos and larvae, the properties and distributions of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (AChRs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as well as the ultrastructure of the developing neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). To mimic synaptic release, patches of muscle membrane were exposed briefly (for 1 ms) to a saturating concentration (10 mM) of ACh. The AChR deactivation kinetics were twice as slow in embryos compared with larvae. In both embryos and larvae, AChRs demonstrated open channel block by millimolar ACh, and this was detected during mEPCs, indicating that a high concentration of ACh is released at immature and mature NMJs. AChR and AChE distributions were compared using the selective fluorescently conjugated labels alpha -bungarotoxin and fasciculin 2, respectively. In larvae, punctate AChR clusters were detected whereas junctional AChE staining was less intense than that found at adult NMJs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed immature nerve endings in embryos that were closely juxtaposed to the surrounding muscle cells, whereas mature larval NMJs had a wider synaptic cleft with a conspicuous basal lamina over a limited region of synaptic contact. Our results indicate that ACh is released at high concentrations at immature NMJs, but its clearance is prolonged and the AChRs are dispersed, resulting in a slow mEPC time course until a mature cleft appears with densely packed faster AChRs and abundant AChE.

The physiological function of the purine nucleotide cycle in the brain is unknown. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical studies were performed to identify the regional and cellular expression of AMPD in rat brain with the goal of elucidating the neural function of the purine nucleotide cycle. AMPD messenger RNA was detected in ventricular ependymal cells and cells of the choroid plexus and in neurons of distinct brain areas. Although only low antibody titers were obtained by immunization with the purified sheep brain AMPD, immunization of mice with synthetic lipopeptide vaccines containing oligopeptides derived from a known partial complementary DNA sequence of the enzyme yielded an antiserum suitable for immunocytochemistry. Immunostaining of cells in culture showed that neurons but not astroglial cells express appreciable amounts of the enzyme. Results of immunocytochemical staining performed on rat brain slices were in accord with the localization of AMPD messenger RNA, thus confirming the expression of AMPD in neurons of the brain stem, hippocampus, cerebellar nuclei and mesencephalic nuclei, as well as in ventricular ependymal cells and their cilia.

Brain herniation caused by increased intracranial pressure as a result of cell swelling is the major cause of death in this condition. Evidence available currently suggests that the rapid accumulation of ammonia by the brain is the major cause of the central nervous system complications of acute liver failure. Increased brain ammonia may cause cell swelling via the osmotic effects of an increase in astrocytic glutamine concentrations or by inhibition of glutamate removal from brain extracellular space. Acute liver failure results in altered expression of several genes in brain, some of which code for important proteins involved in CNS function such as the glucose (GLUT-1) and glutamate (GLT-1) transporters, the astrocytic structural protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) the "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) and the water channel protein, aquaporin IV. Loss of expression of GLT-1 results in increased extracellular brain glutamate in acute liver failure. Experimental acute liver failure also results in post-translational modifications of the serotonin and noradrenaline transporters resulting in increased extracellular concentrations of these monoamines Therapeutic measures currently used to prevent an treat brain edema and encephalopathy in patients with acute liver failure include mild hypothermia and the ammonia-lowering agent L-ornithine-L-aspartate.

Methods: Twenty subjects were included in this study; half of them had polysomnographically confirmed oromotor values above the cutoff points for sleep bruxism. For all participants, 26 standard occlusal measures were recorded clinically and from dental study casts. In addition, 25 standard angular and linear measures were taken from standardized cephalometric films, and variables were derived to evaluate dental and skeletal relationships. Fourteen of the 20 participants had also participated in a previous study that included iodine-123-iodobenzamide (I-123-IBZM) and single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT). For them, the sine-to-side difference in striatal D2 receptor binding was determined as the neurochemical outcome measure. Results: Following the classical Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing, no morphologic differences were found between the sleep bruxers and the non-bruxers. In addition, none of the morphologic variables were significantly associated with the neuroimaging data. Conclusion: Taking into account the low power of this retrospective, exploratory study, the results suggest that the orofacial morphology of sleep bruxers does not differ from that of non-bruxers.

J	Lock, M				Lock, M			The tempering of medical anthropology: Troubling natural categories	MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY			English	Article						formation of medical anthropology; medicalization; resistance; local biologies; moral economy of science	SOCIAL-CONTROL; MENOPAUSE	This article reviews an approach in medical anthropology that commenced in the early 1980s and that continues to the present day in which biomedical knowledge and practices are systematically incorporated into anthropological analyses. Discussion then focuses on contributions made by feminists and medical anthropologists to the literature on medicalization and resistance, illustrating how the ethnographic approach has been crucial in critically reconceptualizing and situating these concepts historically and cross-culturally. The concept of local biologies is introduced in the third section of the article in creating the argument that the coproduction of biologies and cultures contributes to embodied experience, which, in turn, shapes discourse about the body. Subjective reporting at menopause provides an illustrative case study of local biologies in action. The final part of the article takes up the question of the moral economy of scientific knowledge. Comparative ethnographic work in intensive care units in Japan and North America reveals how a moral economy is put into practice in connection with brain-dead bodies and the procurement of organs from them. Medical anthropological contributions to policy making about biomedical technologies is briefly considered in closing.

Neuroimaging was negative for an intracranial mass. An initial lumbar puncture showed elevated intracranial pressure, but normal cerebrospinal fluid contents. A diagnosis of 'idiopathic intracranial hypertension' was made. Ophthalmoscopy subsequently disclosed bilateral optic disc edema and multifocal retinal hemorrhages with white centers (Roth spots). Complete blood count and bone marrow examination confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in patients should be suspect in patients who do not fit the typical profile (e.g., thin, elderly, or male patients or patients with unusual fundus findings).

However, this association is potentially confounded by the linkage disequilibrium of H2 with the epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles of apoE and of H1 with the epsilon3 allele. To establish plausibility for a direct role for apoC-I in AD, we compared apoC-I and apoE protein and mRNA levels in postmortem specimens of frontal cortex and hippocampus from AD patients with levels in nondemented controls. In H2-allelic individuals (usually also e4 carriers), apoC-I mRNA levels were strikingly lower with AD (by 65%, P<0.05), but apoC-I protein levels in AD were significantly higher (by 34%, P<0.05). The opposite direction of the apoC-I mRNA and apoC-I protein level changes in AD in the epsilon4/H2 genotype may reflect decreased clearance of CNS lipoproteins associated with apoE4. In H1/H1 (usually epsilon3/epsilon3) individuals, both apoC-I protein and mRNA were lower in AD. ApoC-I protein levels in hippocampus were nearly twice those in frontal cortex. Immunohistochemistry of hippocampus revealed colocalization of apoC-I protein with the astrocytic marker GFAP. In addition, cultured human astrocytes expressed the mRNA for apoC-I. This study confirms apoC-I expression in the CNS and identifies astrocytes as the source of apoC-1. In addition, it has revealed differences in apoC-I expression based on site, genotype, and disease status that may reflect a role for apoC-I in the pathogenesis of AD. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.

With field potential recordings the stimulus-induced responses had duration = 35 +/-6.3 s mean +/- SEM, n=7 slices) and characteristics resembling electrographic seizures. IOS changes reflecting an increase in light transmittance occurred in the EC and hippocampus following similar stimuli (n=45). IOSs increased progressively to reach peak values 20-30 s after the stimulus and returned slowly to prestimulus values within 100 s, thus outlasting the field potential discharge. IOS changes initiated in the medial EC, near to the stimulation site, and spread to the lateral EC, the dentate, and the CA3/CA1 areas. IOS spread from EC to hippocampus was not seen after perforant path cut (n=5). Moreover, field potential and IOS responses were markedly decreased by excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists (n=12). The antiepileptic drugs topiramate (10-100 muM, n=16) or lamotrigine (100-400 muM, n=12) reduced the IOS changes in the EC and their spread to distant areas. These effects were reversible and dose-dependent (IC50 = 48 muM and 210 muM for topiramate and lamotrigine, respectively). Thus, in 4AP-treated hippocampus-EC slices, IOS changes accompany and outlast the field potential epileptiform responses, depend on glutamatergic transmission and are characterized by temporal and spatial distributions consistent with propagation through established anatomical pathways. We also propose that loss may represent a reliable tool for screening the effects of neuroactive compounds such as antiepileptic drugs. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.

The optical flow display was made out of dots moving radially away from or toward the center of the display monitor. In the Control condition, the dots' motion was randomized in order to remove any sensation of radial motion. In the Expansion condition, several loci of activation were observed: visual areas V2-V3 and the superior parietal lobule (BA 7), predominantly in the right hemisphere. In the Contraction condition activation sites were found in the same visual areas (V2 and V3) in the right hemisphere but the increase in rCBF in these regions was much lower than in the Expansion condition. BA 7 was activated in both hemispheres. When the motion component of the stimulus was isolated by subtracting the static condition from the incoherent motion condition, we obtained activations of areas V2, V3, and MT (putative V5). These results indicate that the detection of radial motion derived from an optic flow stimulus is mediated by structures forming the dorsal part of the visual cortical system and confirm that area MT is not specifically involved in flow analysis.

Cumulative injections of reboxetine (1-4 mg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently increased the recovery time of the firing of these neurons following iontophoretic applications of NE, but not 5-HT. In rats treated with reboxetine for 2.5 mg/kg/day for 21 days, a robust increase in the recovery time following NE applications was observed, and a small but significant prolongation occurred following 5-HT applications. In controls and reboxetine-treated rats, 1 and 5 Hz stimulations of the afferent 5-HT bundle to the hippocampus, which allows determination of terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor sensitivity, produced similar frequency-dependent decreases in pyramidal neuron firing in both groups. However, after low and high doses of clonidine (10 and 400 mug/kg, i.v.), which assesses alpha (2)-adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptor sensitivity, respectively, only the effect of the high dose of clonidine was attenuated. Interestingly, administration of the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 induced a 140% increase in basal pyramidal neuron firing in reboxetine as compared to saline-treated rats. This increase in tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors might be attributable in part to a desensitization of alpha (2)-adrenergic heteroreceptors, presumably resulting from sustained NE reuptake inhibition. These results indicate that even a selective NE reuptake inhibitor can modulate 5-HT transmission. [Neuropsychopharmacology 25:845-857,2001 (C) 2001 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Outcome studies have primarily focused on delineating developmental impairments; however, the impact on function and family burden has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of functional limitations and burden of care of young children with congenital heart defects (CHD) after OHS. Study Design. One hundred thirty-one eligible infants with CHD undergoing their first OHS were recruited prospectively. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively, and again 12 to 18 months after surgery. Functional assessments included the WeeFIM (Functional Independence Measure) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Results. For the WeeFIM, mean quotients were 84.3 +/- 23.8 (self-care), 77.2 +/- 30.0 (mobility), and 92.4 +/- 27.8 (cognition), with an overall quotient of 83.8 +/- 23.4. Only 21% of the cohort was functioning within their expected age range. Moderate disability was noted in 37%, while only 6% demonstrated a severe disability. For the Vineland scale, mean score for daily living skills was 84.4 +/- 17.6, and 80.3 +/- 15.9 for socialization. Functional difficulties in daily living skills were documented in 40%, whereas >1/2 had poor socialization skills. Factors enhancing risk for functional disabilities included perioperative neurodevelopmental status, microcephaly, length of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, length of stay in the intensive care unit, age at surgery, and maternal education. Conclusions. The high prevalence of functional limitations and dependence in activities of daily living is currently underappreciated in the clinical setting, and deserves additional attention by pediatricians and developmental specialists.

Sc. administration induced a decreased food and lipid intakes from 24 months of age and a transient stimulation of protein intake in 19-month-old and older low protein eaters (<10% protein/total intake). Icv. administration induced decreased food and lipid intakes in all age groups. These results suggest that GHRH may regulate feeding through pituitary and/or hypothalamic GHRH receptor mechanisms.

Freud produced two versions of this memory, the final version in the 1920s. A revolutionary nosology (DSM-III), adopted in 1980, promised to extirpate Freud and the concept of neurosis from American psychiatry. However, it made a tacit exception for Freud's concept of traumatic neurosis, renaming it "posttraumatic stress disorder." The following decades have been a period of intense clinical and scientific interest in this disorder. An influential research program has investigated traumatic neurosis and its brain through variations in cortisol excretion. I describe the history of this program and examine its distinctive knowledge product: its running narrative of its achievements. The narrative's structure is analyzed and found to resemble a crossword puzzle constructed from heterogeneous kinds of inference, recalling The Interpretation of Dreams. My conclusion is that, far from extirpating Freud's neurosis, biological research has secured a place for it in today's post-Freudian psychiatry.

[D-Tyr(11)]neurotensin, but not neurotensin, decreased reward threshold in F344 rats while it increased thresholds in LEW rats. Both peptides suppressed maximal rates of responding; this effect was of greater magnitude and longer lasting in LEW than in F344 rats. These findings show that F344 and LEW rat strains are differentially sensitive to activation of central neurotensin receptors that modulate reward-relevant circuitry. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we show that normal upregulation of the stress defense protein manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) fails to occur in FRDA fibroblasts exposed to iron. This impaired induction was observed at iron levels in which increased activation of the redox-sensitive factor NF-kappaB was absent. Furthermore, MnSOD induction could only be partially suppressed by antioxidants. We conclude that an NF-kappaB-independent pathway that may not require free radical signaling is responsible for the reduction of MnSOD induction. This impairment could constitute both a novel defense mechanism against iron-mediated oxidative stress in cells with mitochondrial iron overload and conversely, an alternative source of free radicals that could contribute to the disease pathology.

The causal survival motor neuron (SMN) gene maps to a complex region of chromosome 5q13 harbouring an inverted duplication, Thus, there are two SMN genes, SMN1 and DIN2, but SMN1-deficiency alone causes SMA. In this study we demonstrate, for the first time, down-regulation of SMN promoter activity during cellular differentiation. Specifically, the minimal SMN promoter is four times more active in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma P19 cells compared to cells treated with retinoic acid (RA) to initiate neuronal differentiation. This effect is mediated by sequences contained within the minimal core promoter that we have confined to the 257 nucleotides upstream of exon 1. We have identified seven regions that are highly conserved between the mouse and human SMN core promoters and this region contains the consensus sequence for a number of transcription factors. Most notably, AhR, HNF-3 and N-Oct3 have already been shown to respond to RA treatment of EC cells, while E47, HNF-3, MAZ, N-Oct3 and Pit-1a have been implicated in embryonic, muscle or neural development. In addition, we have mapped two strong transcription initiation sites upstream of SMN exon 1. The novel -79 site identified in this study is preferentially utilized during human foetal development. Furthermore, analysis of RNA from SMA patients with deletions of the entire SMN1 gene or chimpanzees that lack SMN2 suggests that the level of transcription initiation at these sites may be different for the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. Taken together, this work provides the first demonstration of transcriptional regulation of these genes during cellular differentiation and development. Deciphering the underlying mechanisms responsible for regulating SMN transcription may provide important clues towards enhancing SMN2 gene expression, one target for the treatment of SMA.

The adult-children differences in pharmacokinetics arise from age-related changes in the physiological, biochemical, and physicochemical determinants of uptake and disposition of chemicals. The objectives of this study were to review the published literature to assemble data on the human body weight and organ weights as a function of age (specifically between birth and 18 yr old) and to analyze these data, in order to develop regression equations for calculating body weight and organ weights of children using age as the dependent function. The specific organs/tissues for which the data on age-related weight were obtained and analyzed include blood, adipose tissues, liver, lungs, brains, heart, kidneys, spleen, the reproductive organs (male: prostate gland, seminal vesicle, testes, and epididymis; female: ovaries, uterus, and uterine tubes), glands (adrenal, pituitary, thymus, pancreas, and thyroid), bone marrow (total and red), intestinal tract, stomach, muscle, skin (epidermis and dermis), and skeleton, In both male and female children, the sum of these organs is systematically lower than the body weight, and this discrepancy may be resolved with the additional availability and consideration of data on hypodermis weight. The equations and data on body weight and organ weights presented in this article should be useful for constructing age-specific, physiologically based pharmacokinetic models for children.

J	Zhou, GM; Strom, RC; Giguere, V; Williams, RW				Zhou, GM; Strom, RC; Giguere, V; Williams, RW			Modulation of retinal cell populations and eye size in retinoic acid receptor knockout mice	MOLECULAR VISION			English	Article							OLFACTORY PATHWAY FORMATION; MUTANT MICE; NEURON NUMBER; MOUSE; GENE; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; INDUCTION; LENS; IDENTIFICATION	Purpose: The retinoic acid receptors are expressed from early stages of development in the diverse tissues that make up the vertebrate eye. Their loss has subtle effects on eye development. We adapted sensitive quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods to assess consequences of inactivating alleles of the alpha and beta receptors, Rara and Rarb, on eye and retinal development. Rara is of particular interest because this gene is a candidate for Nnc1, a QTL that controls retinal ganglion cell proliferation. Methods: We studied lines of mice in which expression of the a1 isoform of Rara or all isoforms of Rarb had been disrupted by gene targeting. We measured eye weight, lens weight, retinal area, and retinal ganglion cell number in each of six genotypes (Rara and Rarb -/-, +/-, +/+; 10-25 cases/genotype). Results: Loss of either protein is associated with a small but significant loss of eye weight and retinal area. However, only the Rarb knockout has a significant effect on the ganglion cell population and the loss of both wildtype alleles leads to an 8,000 cell deficit. Surprisingly, loss of the Rara a1 isoform that is expressed in this cell population from early stages has no effect on number. Null alleles of both genes have little if any effect on lens growth. Conclusions: Despite its expression in embryonic retina, Rara is unlikely to be the Nnc1 QTL. In contrast, Rarb, a gene that maps to Chr 14 and which is not an Nnc1 candidate gene, has a significant effect on cell number and is therefore a QTL controlling this key population. This raises the intriguing possibility that normal allelic variants of Rarb modulate the ganglion cell population in other vertebrates, including humans.

Using an in vitro intracellular recording technique the effect of two galanin receptor agonists on LC neurons was investigated. Bath application of [Sar(1), D-Ala(12)] gal(1-16)-NH2 (AR-M961), an agonist both at galanin RI and R2 (GALR1, GALR2) receptors, evoked a reversible membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of spike discharge in all LC neurons tested (n = 42). The action of AR-M961 was blocked by tetraethylammonium chloride. Hyperpolarizing responses induced by AR-M961 were retained in the presence of tetrodotoxin and high Mg-2(+)/low Ca2+ media. The selective GALR2 agonist Gal(2-11)-NH2 (AR-M1896) only caused inhibition of spike discharge and a slight hyperpolarization in 26 of 34 LC neurons tested, and was on a molar basis much weaker than AR-M961. These results suggest that it mainly is the GALR1 receptor that mediates hyperpolarization of LC neurons. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, vital statistical data on stillbirths, live births, and infant deaths were used to examine secular trends in gestational age-specific and category-specific fetal and infant mortality due to congenital anomalies in Canada (excluding Ontario and Newfoundland) from 1985-1996. Comparisons of the rates between 1985-1987 and 1994-1996 were made using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The overall fetal mortality rate due to congenital anomalies increased significantly, from 68.0 per 100,000 total births in 1985-1987 to 78.6 per 100,000 total births in 1994-1996, while the overall infant mortality rate due to congenital anomalies decreased significantly over the same period, from 2.47 to 1.79 per 1,000 live births. The fetal death rate due to congenital anomalies at 20-21 weeks of gestation increased approximately five-fold (relative risk [RR] = 4.83, 95% CI=3.28-7.11) from 4.5 to 21.5 per 100,000 fetuses at risk, while the rate at 37-41 weeks decreased by 30% (RR=0.70, 95% CI=0.50-0.97). Fetal death rates among pregnancies at 20-25 weeks of gestation increased in all categories of congenital anomaly except anencephaly and respiratory system anomalies. Congenital anomaly-related fetal and infant deaths have increased at early gestation but declined at later gestation in Canada. These changes suggest an increase in prenatal diagnosis and selective termination of pregnancies with congenital anomalies in recent years. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We examined the problem-solving performance of 27 patients with focal frontal lobe damage on the Water Jug task. The Water jug task has never been used to assess problem-solving ability in neurologically impaired patients nor in functional neuroimaging studies, despite sharing structural similarities Both other tasks sensitive to prefrontal cortex function, including the Tower of Hanoi, Tower of London, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), Our results demonstrate that the Water jug task invokes a unique combination of problem-solving and planning strategies, allowing a more precise identification of frontal lobe lesion patients' cognitive deficits. All participants (patients and matched controls) appear to be utilizing a hill-climbing strategy that does not require sophisticated planning; however, frontal lobe lesion patients (FLLs) struggled to make required "counterintuitive moves" not predicted by this strategy and found within both solution paths. Left and bilateral FLLs were more impaired than right FLLs. Analysis of the left hemisphere brain regions encompassed by the lesions of these patients found chat poor performance was linked to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex damage, We propose that patients with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lesions have difficulty making a decision requiring the conceptual comparison of nonverbal stimuli, manipulation of select representations of potential solutions, and are unable to appropriately inhibit a response in keeping with the final goal.

However, it has been shown that in pathologic conditions the tracer may reflect the activation of kynurenine metabolism. Increased levels of serotonin and quinolinic acid have been described in resected epileptogenic cortex, raising the possibility that alpha -MTrp can localize seizure foci in patients with intractable partial epilepsy. The authors assessed the uptake of alpha -MTrp in 18 patients (11 men, mean +/- SD age 27.1 +/- 10.1 years, range 13 to 54) with intractable partial epilepsy to correlate the PET findings with the epileptogenic area defined by electroclinical and neuroimaging data. Method: Seven patients with cortical dysplasia (CD) and 11 with partial epilepsy in which conventional MRI and fluorine-18-deoxyglucose ((18)FDG)-PET studies failed to detect any abnormality were studied. All underwent scalp EEG monitoring during the PET scan to exclude ictal events and estimate the interictal epileptic activity. Results: In seven patients (39%; CD four and cryptogenic partial epilepsy three), PET showed focal increased uptake of alpha -MTrp corresponding to the epileptogenic area. alpha -MTrp uptake in the epileptic focus correlated with the frequency of interictal spikes (r = 0.7, p < 0.05). Conclusions: alpha -MTrp-PET may be of value in the localization of the epileptogenic area not only in patients with visible dysplastic lesions, but also in those with cryptogenic partial epilepsy.

The pattern of brain AT(1) mRNA expression during fetal and neonatal development is currently unknown. We used radiolabeled cRNA probes for in situ hybridization histochemistry to determine the ontogenic development of the two AT(1) subtypes (AT(1a) and AT(1b)) mRNA in rat brain, from 11 days of gestation (E11) to 28 days after birth (P28). No AT(1b) mRNA was detected in the developing brain, whereas AT(1a) mRNA was first detected at E19. The age at which AT(1a) mRNA is first detected varied among different brain areas and expression predominates in areas involved in fluid homeostasis, pituitary hormone release, and cardiovascular regulation, where it persists until P28. AT(1a) mRNA expression is present from E19 onward in the median preoptic nucleus, the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, the paraventricular nucleus, the periaqueductal gray, the nucleus raphe pallidus, the motor facial nucleus, and very weakly in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the ambiguus nucleus, and at E21 in the subfornical organ, the anterior olfactory nucleus and the piriform cortex. AT(1a) mRNA expression is present after birth in many regions, including the preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas, the area postrema and medullary reticular nuclei. In conclusion, during brain development, expression of AT(1a) mRNA, appears in late gestation at E19, predominantly in forebrain areas involved in fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation. In contrast, AT(1a) mRNA expression is absent or present only in very small amounts until after birth in many medullary nuclei, known to play an important role in cardiovascular modulation. Our results suggest that, in perinatal life, AT(1a) is involved in fluid and perhaps cardiovascular homeostasis and that the role of Ang 11 in modulating medullary cardiovascular centers matures later in postnatal life.

MnSOD and nitrotyrosine immune reactivity in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion under acute hyperglycemic or normoglycemic conditions followed by either 3- or 24-h recovery. We found that the macroscopic labeling pattern for all three antibodies colocalized with the ischemic core and penumbra which was determined by cresyl violet histological evaluation in adjacent sections. Hyperglycemia induced prior to ischemia resulted in earlier infarction which correlated with increased immunoreactivity for iNOS, MnSOD and nitrotyrosine. In the penumbral region of the frontal cortex. labeling of specific cell structures was largely limited to cortical neurons near the corpus callosum and was apparent earlier in the hyperglycemic rats. Increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion in blood vessels was observed at 24 h in the hyperglycemic group. At both of the recovery times studied. we observed only minor vascular staining for nitrotyrosine and none for iNOS. Our results are consistent with hyperglycemia resulting in an early and concomitant increase in both superoxide and nitric oxide production which can lead to peroxynitrite formation that then nitrates tyrosine residues. It would appear that hyperglycemic ischemia contributes to the early induction of key enzymes involved in nitric oxide bioavailability. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The pseudoproline ring in these compounds was either unsubstituted (R-1, R-2 = H) or dimethylated (R-1, R-2 = CH3) at the 2-C position. 2-C-dimethylated pseudoprolines are known to be quantitative or nearly quantitative inducers of the Cis conformation around the Xaa(i-1)-Xaa(i)[Psi (CH3,CH3)pro] imide bond. All dihydropseudoproline-containing analogues (R1, R2 = H) showed goody opioid agonist potency in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) assay, high mu receptor binding affinity in the rat brain membrane binding assay, and, like their parent peptides, excellent mu receptor binding selectivity. H-1 NMR spectroscopic analysis of the Cys[Psi (H,H)pro](2)- and Ser[Psi (H,H)pro](2)-containing analogues in DMSO-d(6) revealed that they existed in a conformational equilibrium around the Tyr-Xaa[Psi (H,H)pro] peptide bond with cis/trans ratios of 40:60 and 45:55, respectively. The dimethylated thiazolidine- and oxazolidine-containing [D-Phe3]morphiceptin- and endomorphin-2 analogues (R-1, R-2 = CH3) all retained full mu agonist potency in the GPI assay and displayed mu receptor binding affinities in the nanomolar range and high mu receptor selectivity. As expected, no conformers of the latter analogues with a trans conformation around the Tyr-Xaa[Psi (CH3,CH3)pro] imide bond were detected by H-1 NMR spectral analysis, indicating that in these compounds the cis conformation is highly predominant (> 98%). These results represent the most direct evidence obtained so far to indicate that morphiceptin and endomorphin-2 have the cis conformation around the Tyr-Pro peptide bond in their bioactive conformations.

However, no general consensus has emerged with regards to the localization of this receptor due to inconsistencies in the immunohistochemical literature. In the present study, we analyzed the cellular and subcellular distribution of immunoreactive delta OR in the rat CNS using two different antibodies (directed against a sequence in the C-terminus or N-terminus of the rat delta OR). By using Western blotting, these two antibodies recognized similar forms of the delta OR in COS-7 cells transfected with this receptor, but distinct forms in membranes from the rat spinal cord. By using light microscopic immunohistochemistry, both antibodies recognized identical populations of nerve cell bodies throughout the CNS; the distribution of these cell bodies conformed to that of delta OR mRNA-expressing cells detected by in situ hybridization. However, whereas the C-terminus-directed antibody recognized predominantly perikarya and proximal dendrites, the N-terminus-directed antibody also labeled extensively dendritic and terminal arbors. Furthermore, by using electron microscopy, the two antibodies were found not only to label differentially somatodendritic versus axonal compartments, but also plasma membrane versus cytoplasmic ones, suggesting that distinct immunological forms of the receptor are being targeted preferentially to different cellular and subcellular domains.

They play a role in the response of the vasculature to adjustments in perfusion pressure and oxygen and carbon dioxide tension, and they mediate the actions of numerous factors. The role of prostanoids in governing circulation of the perinate is suggested to surpass that in the adult. Prostanoids are abundantly generated in the perinate. They have been implicated in autoregulation of blood flow as studied in brain and eyes. Prostaglandins are also dominant regulators of ductus arteriosus tone. The effects of these autacoids are mediated through specific G protein-coupled receptors. In addition to the pharmacological characterization of the prostanoid receptors, important advances in understanding the biology of these receptors have been made in the last decade. Their cloning and the development of animals with disrupted genes of these receptors have been very informative. The involvement of prostanoid receptors in the developing subject, especially on brain and ocular vasculature and on ductus arteriosus, has also begun to be investigated; the expression of these receptors changes with development. Some but not all of the ontogenic changes in these receptors are attributed to homologous regulation. Interestingly, in the process of elucidating their effects, functional perinuclear prostaglandin E-2 receptors have been uncovered. This article reviews prostanoid receptors and addresses implications on the developing subject with attention to vascular physiology.

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of scalp block for decreasing postoperative pain in brain surgery. Thirty patients scheduled for supratentorial craniotomy were enrolled. They were randomly divided into two groups: Ropivacaine (scalp block with 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.75%) and Saline (scalp block with 20 mL of saline 0.9%). Anesthesia was standardized. The scalp block was performed after skin closure and before awakening. Postoperative pain was assessed at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 48 h by using a 10-cm. visual analog scale. Analgesia was provided with sub-cutaneous codeine as requested by the patient. Average visual analog scale scores were higher in the Saline group as compared with Ropivacaine (3.7 +/- 2.4 vs 2.0 +/- 1.6; P = 0.036). The total dose of codeine did not differ, nor did the duration of time before the first dose of codeine was required in the Ropivacaine (571 +/- 765 min) versus Saline (319 +/- 409 min; P = 0.17) group. In conclusion, we found that postoperative scalp block decreases the severity of pain after craniotomy and that this effect is long lasting, possibly through a preemptive mechanism.

J	Nguyen, MD; Julien, JP; Rivest, S				Nguyen, MD; Julien, JP; Rivest, S			Induction of pro inflammatory molecules in mice with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: No requirement for proapoptotic interleukin-1 beta in neurodegeneration	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NF-KAPPA-B; MOTOR-NEURON DEATH; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; DISEASE; SOD1; ALS; APOPTOSIS; SYSTEM; BLOOD	Recent studies have demonstrated the activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3 in mice expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Caspase-1 converts the prointerleukin-1 beta into a potent proinflammatory molecule involved in the innate immune response and in neurodegenerative diseases. We report on the chronic expression of interleukin-1 beta mRNA in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) mice, together with robust mRNA expression for the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor I kappaB alpha, for other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and for the toll-like receptor TLR2 involved in innate immunity. To further assess the interleukin-1 beta contribution to neurodegeneration, we generated mice expressing SOD1(G37R) to a context of interleukin-1 beta gene knockout. Surprisingly, the absence of interleukin-1 beta had no. effect on the life span of SOD1(G37R) mice, nor on the extent of motor axon degeneration at age 7 and 10 months. Whereas neither compensatory induction of the interleukin-1 alpha, mRNA nor increases in mRNA levels for I kappaB alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 occurred as a result of interleukin-1 beta gene disruption, enhanced levels of TLR2 mRNA were detected in SOD1(G37R) mice lacking interleukin-1 beta. We conclude that interleukin-1 beta does not directly contribute to motor neuron degeneration in SOD1(G37R) mice, but it may act as a modulator of the innate immune response.

This study evaluates whether systemic steroid pretreatment enhances neuroprotection during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) compared with steroid in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) prime. Methods. Four-week-old piglets randomly placed into two groups (n = 5 per group) were given methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) into the pump prime (group PP), or pretreated intravenously 4 hours before CPB (group PT). All animals underwent 100 minutes of DHCA (15 degreesC), were weaned off CPB, and were sacrificed 6 hours later. Postoperative changes in body weight, bioimpedance, and colloid oncotic pressure (COP) were measured. Cerebral trypan blue content, immunohistochemical evaluation of transforming growth factor-beta (1) (TGF-beta (1)) expression, and caspase-3 activity were performed. Results. Percentage weight gain (group PP 25.0% +/- 10.4% versus group PT 12.5% +/- 4.0%; p = 0.036), and percentage decrease in bioimpedance (PP 37.2% +/- 14.5% versus PT 15.6% +/- 7.9%; p = 0.019) were significantly lower, whereas postoperative COP was significantly higher in group PT versus group PP (PT 15.3 +/- 1.8 min Hg versus PP 11.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; p = 0.003). Cerebral trypan blue (ng/g dry tissue) was significantly lower in group PT (PT 5.6 X 10(-3) +/- 1.1 X 10(-3) versus PP 9.1 X 10(-3) +/- 5.7 X 10(-4); p = 0.001). Increased TGF-beta (1) expression and decreased caspase-3 activity were shown in group PT. Conclusions. Systemic steroid pretreatment significantly reduced total body edema and cerebral vascular leak and was associated with better immunohistochemical indices of neuroprotection after DHCA.

Aortic arch reconstruction in neonates routinely requires deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. We reviewed our experience with techniques of continuous low-flow cerebral perfusion (LFCP) avoiding direct arch vessel cannulation. Methods. Eighteen patients, with a median age of 11 days (range 1 to 85 days) and a mean weight of 3.2 +/- 0.8 kg, underwent aortic arch reconstruction with LFCP. Seven had biventricular repairs with arch reconstruction, 9 underwent the Norwood operation and 2 had isolated arch repairs. In 1 Norwood and 7 biventricular repair patients, LFCP was maintained by advancing the cannula from the distal ascending aorta into the innominate artery. In 8 of 9 Norwood patients, LFCP was maintained by directing the arterial cannula into the pulmonary artery confluence and perfusing the innominate artery through the right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt fully constructed before cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. In 2 patients requiring isolated arch reconstruction, the ascending aorta was cannulated and the cross-clamp was applied just distal to the innominate artery. Results. LFCP was maintained at 0.6 +/- 0.2 L (.) min(-1) m(-2) for 41.0 +/- 13.9 minutes at 18.5 degreesC +/- 1.1 degreesC. In 10 of the 18 patients, blood pressure during LFCP was 15 +/- 8 mm Hg remote from the innominate artery (left radial, umbilical or femoral arteries). In 8 of the 18 patients, right radial pressure during LFCP was 24 +/- 10 mm Hg. The mean mixed-venous saturation was 79.8% +/- 10% during LFCP. Two patients had preoperative seizures, whereas none had seizures postoperatively. One patient died. Conclusions. Neonatal aortic arch reconstruction is possible without circulatory arrest or direct arch vessel cannulation. These techniques maintained adequate mixed-venous oxygen saturations with no associated adverse neurologic outcomes. (C) 2001 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

Despite similar neuropathological characteristics, the behavioral phenotype of Lurcher is less severe than that of staggerer, possibly caused by the slower onset of their neuronal degeneration. Although fewer cerebellar cells degenerate in hot-foot than in Lurcher, their motor deficits are more severe, indicating the presence of dysfunctional cells. CO activity in the deep cerebellar nuclei was increased in Lurcher and staggerer but unchanged in hot-foot, probably due to the severe loss of GABAergic input from Purkinje cells in the first two mutants but not the third. Altered CO activity in cerebellar-related pathways was linearly correlated with motor performance, indicating that the activity of this enzyme is associated not only with neuronal activity but also with motor performance.

Moreover, rats from the Nijmegen low-responder line that initiated self-administration came to do so compulsively and to the same degree as did the Nijmegen high-responder rats. Thus the differences between both sets of genotypes appeared to reflect differences in reactions to the testing situation more than differences in reaction to the reinforcing drug per se.

Underlying this scaling method is the assumption that the mean rate of responding during operant bouts (the response 'ternpo') is fixed and does not vary with the rate of reinforcement. The validity of this account was assessed by testing the constant-tempo assumption via a survivor analysis of the distributions of inter-response times at different variable-intervals (VIs) in rats responding for rewarding electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus. Contrary to the constant-tempo assumption, response tempo was not fixed but rather decreased as the VI was lengthened. This demonstration challenges Herrnstein's account of single-operant matching and suggests that the reinforcement rate that supports a half-maximal rate of responding on a single VI schedule may not provide a valid scale for the value of brain stimulation. Possible remedies are discussed. Although the conclusions of the study are restricted to experiments on brain stimulation reward in rats, the inter-response time analysis employed can provide the basis for testing the validity of the constant-tempo assumption in other species and for other reinforcers.

The modulatory effect of corticosteroids on 5-HT1A receptor number and function has been repeatedly demonstrated in preclinical studies suggesting that raised corticosteroid levels decrease 5-HT1A receptor number and function in the hippocampus. Methods: We used positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify the number of 5-HT1A receptors in two studies, the first in normal subjects given a single dose of hydrocortisone using a random-order, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and second in patients treated long-term with corticosteroids. Results: We did not find that exposure to elevated levels of corticosteroids in either the short or long term alters 5-HT1A receptor binding in the hippocampus or other brain regions examined. Conclusions: This study does not support the hypothesis that corticosteroids exert a major inhibitory regulatory control over the 5-HT1A receptor binding in the human brain.

Recent case studies suggest that its use as an analgesic could be extended to non-cancer pain, especially neuropathic pain. The present case study reports, for the first time, the efficacy of methadone in a burn patient experiencing neuropathic pain in his heated wounds. The patient sustained extensive (55% total body surface area) chemical burns and developed chronic burning sensations, particularly in the lower limbs where skin grafting had been performed. Conventional pharmacotherapies against neuropathic pain were attempted to control pain for over 5 years. The agents used included long- and short-acting opioids, amitriptyline, clonazepam, and gabapentin, but they all failed to relieve the pain. When methadone (5 mg every 12 h) was introduced, it significantly alleviated the patient's pain within a few days of administration. The patient has now been taking methadone (15 mg every 12 h) for 10 months and reports that the opioid caused 70% pain relief and a 55% amelioration in his quality of life. Although these results are based on a case report, they suggest that a switch to methadone might be useful in some burn patients who have developed chronic neuropathic pain unrelieved by conventional pharmacotherapies. Methadone, however, needs to be titrated with vigilance and thus should be administered by a physician experienced with its use in the treatment of chronic pain.

Classical clinical presentations have been described, such as bilateral facial palsy, but often the disease presents insidiously with varied signs and symptoms. We present a patient who required biopsy of a lumbar nerve root for diagnosis of chronic, progressive neurosarcoidosis and review the literature with an emphasis on diagnosis. Methods: We have reviewed a patient who presented with signs and symptoms related to infiltration of her meninges and nerve roots by sarcoidosis. All pertinent history and physical information was taken from interviews with the patient and review of her chart. Laboratory, radiographic, and pathological investigations are presented. Results and conclusions: A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is useful but the findings are often nonspecific, and there should be a low threshold for biopsy whenever the diagnosis is considered.

Tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline) exhibited no effect in the lower range (0.06 to 2 muM) of drug concentrations, and a concentration-dependent inhibition of calcium uptake in the upper range (6 to 200 muM). A concentration-dependent inhibition was observed for atypical antidepressants (mianserin, desmethylmianserin, venlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine, fluoxetine) in both the lower and the upper range of drug concentrations. Since no stimulation of calcium uptake was observed in either concentration range, it appears that the tricyclic and atypical antidepressants tested are not capable of normalizing, through their effect on the endoplasmic reticulum, an overactive calcium signal, which is possibly implicated in the etiology of affective disorders. Also, although only marginal inhibition of calcium uptake is expected at brain concentrations of tricyclics and mianserin-desmethylmianserin that are likely to be encountered during clinical use, a more substantial inhibition could occur with fluoxetine.

Drosophila has a single gro gene, whose loss of function affects processes ranging from sex determination to embryonic patterning and neuroblast specification. We have characterized a function of Gro in imaginal development, namely the repression of hedgehog (hh) in anterior wing pouch cells. hh encodes a secreted morphogen with potent patterning activities. In Drosophila thoracic appendages (legs, wings, halteres), hh is expressed in posterior compartments and induces the anteroposterior (AP) pattern organizer in the cells across the AP boundary. hh is repressed in anterior compartments at least partly via Ci[rep], a form of the multifunctional transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). We show that cells in the wing primordium close to the AP boundary need gro activity to maintain repression of hh transcription, whereas in more anterior cells gro is dispensable. This repressive function of Gro does not appear to be mediated by Ci[rep]. Analysis of mutant gro transgenes has revealed that the Q and WD40 domains are both necessary for hh repression. Yet, deletion of the WD40 repeats does not always abolish Gro activity. Our findings provide new insights both into the mechanisms of AP patterning of the wing and into the function of Gro.

In the present study, we determined how elimination of hepatic IGF-I modifies the hypothalamic-pituitary GH axis to enhance GH secretion. The pituitary mRNA levels of GH releasing factor (GHRF) receptor and GH secretagogue (GHS) receptor were increased in LI-IGF-I-/- mice, and in line with this, their GH response to ip injections of GHRF and GHS was increased. Expression of mRNA for pituitary somatostatin receptors, hypothalamic GHRF, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y was not altered in LI-IGF-I-/- mice, whereas hypothalamic IGF-I expression was increased. Changes in hepatic expression of major urinary protein and the PRL receptor in male LI-IGF-I-/- mice indicated an altered GH release pattern most consistent with enhanced GH trough levels. Liver weight was enhanced in LI-IGF-I-/- mice of both genders. In conclusion, loss of liver-derived IGF-I enhances GH release by increasing expression of pituitary GHRF and GHS receptors. The enhanced GH release in turn affects several liver parameters, in line with the existence of a pituitary-liver axis.

The avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in this population is potentially beneficial. We examined our initial experience with off-pump multivessel coronary artery revascularization in patients aged 70 years and older. Methods: In a consecutive series of 300 off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) operations performed by a single surgeon between 1996 and 1999, 98 patients were aged 70 years and older. These patients were compared with a consecutive cohort of 497 patients aged 70 years and older operated on with CPB in the same institution from 1995 to 1996, period where OPCAB surgery was not performed in our institution. Results: Patients in the beating heart group were older (75 +/- 4 vs. 74 +/- 3 years; P = 0.001). Gender distribution and other preoperative risk factors were comparable for the two groups. On average, 3.0 +/- 0.8 and 2.8 +/- 0.7 grafts per patient were completed in the OPCAB and the CPB groups, respectively (P = 0.007). Perioperative mortality rates (OPCAB group, 3.1%; CPB group, 3.6%), perioperative myocardial infarction (OPCAB, 2.0%; CPB, 5.1%) and neurologic events (OPCAB, 1.0%; CPB, 3.2%) were comparable for the two groups. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was lower in the OPCAB group (42 vs. 54%; P = 0.05). The need for allogenic blood transfusions was significantly less in the OPCAB group (53 vs. 82%; P = 0.001). Conclusions: In patients aged 70 years and older, multivessel OPCAB surgery is associated with lower rates of postoperative atrial fibrillation and reduced transfusion requirements. Multivessel OPCAB in the elderly patient is an acceptable alternative to procedures performed with CPB. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

However, properties of the synchronization, which occurs on a time scale of approximate to 1-5 ms, are still poorly understood. We have tested the modulation of synchronization by manipulating the contextual targets introduced in the surround of the receptive field. Experiments were carried out on anaesthetized cats prepared for multiunit and single-cell recordings in area 17. Initially, a patch of sine-wave drifting grating was positioned over the overlapping receptive fields of several neurons. If this coherent motion produced a significant synchronization in cross-correlograms, contextual targets were added. The first contextual stimuli were two sine-wave patches placed above and below the central compound receptive field. Only the contrast of contextual targets changed. Results show that the larger the differential contrast the higher the synchronization. The second contextual stimulus was a lateral shift of a sinewave patch. Data show that the wider the distance between the central and peripheral patches the better the synchronization. Furthermore, results suggest that the synchrony pattern computed by cross correlating multiunit recordings from two sites differs when the cross correlation is carried out between individual units belonging to each multiunit recording. Together with our previous results it appears that synchronization is stimulus dependent and its strength increases with larger disparities included in the whole stimulating image.

The questions of how and where these brain peptides act to maintain wakefulness remain unresolved. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the orexins could directly affect hypothalamic histaminergic neurons, which are known to contribute to the state of wakefulness by their diffuse projections through the brain. Using brain slices, we recorded in the ventral tuberomammillary nuclei from neurons identified as histaminergic on the basis of their previously described morphological and electrophysiological characteristics and found that they were depolarized and excited by the orexins through a direct postsynaptic action. We then compared the depolarizing effect of orexin A and B and found that they were equally effective upon these cells. This latter finding suggests that the effect of orexins is mediated by orexin type 2 receptors, which are those lacking in narcoleptic dogs. Our results therefore show that the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nuclei represent an important target for the orexin system in the maintenance of wakefulness.

Neurons in medial reticular nuclei on the right side of the brainstem between the trigeminal and hypoglossal motor nuclei were recorded in anaesthetized and paralysed rabbits during two types of masticatory-like motor patterns induced by electrical stimulation of the left (contralateral) or right (Ipsilateral) cortical masticatory areas. Sixty-seven neurons in nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (nPontc), nucleus reticularis parvocellularis (nParv), and nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (Rgc) were studied. These were classified as phasic or tonic depending on their firing pattern during the fictive jaw movement cycle. Phasic neurons located in the dorsal part of nPontc were active during the jaw opening phase, whilst those in dorsal nParv tended to fire during the closing phase. In most neurons, burst duration and firing frequency changed between the two motor patterns, but there was little change in phase of firing. Tonic units were mainly recorded in the ventral half of nPontc, and at the junction between Rgc and caudal nParv. Cortical inputs with short latency from the contralateral masticatory area were more frequent in phasic (82%) than tonic (44%) neurons, whilst inputs from the ipsilateral cortex were equal in the two subgroups (57% and 56%). Phasic neurons had significantly shorter mean contralateral than ipsilateral cortical latencies, whilst there was no difference among tonic neurons. Intra- and perioral primary afferent inputs activated both types of neurons at oligo-synaptic latencies. Our results show that subpopulations of neurons in medial reticular nuclei extending from the caudal part of the trigeminal motor nucleus to the rostral third of the hypoglossal motor nucleus are active during the fictive masticatory motor behaviour. Unlike masticatory neurons in the lateral tegmentum, the medial subpopulations are spatially organized according to discharge pattern.

Two separate genes, NPC1 and NPC2, have been linked to NP-C. NPC1 encodes a polytopic membrane-bound protein with a putative sterol-sensing domain. NPC2 has been recently identified as epididymal secretory glycoprotein 1. The NPC1 protein functions in the vesicular redistribution of endocytosed lysosomal cargo, but how its inactivation leads to neurodegeneration is not known. The neurological symptoms of NP-C typically appear after a period of normal early development and reflect progressive degeneration of widespread brain regions. Here we have delineated the pattern of neurodegeneration in NP-C mice. whose genetic defect has been shown to be an inactivating mutation of the mouse NPC1 gene. The results reveal a spatially and temporally specific pattern of degeneration of nerve fibers followed by degeneration of neuronal cell bodies be-inning as early as day 9 and continuing throughout life. We have recently showed that in the primate brain, the NPC1 protein is localized predominantly within perisynaptic astrocytic processes. The present observations suggest that a functional disturbance in NPC1 could disrupt vesicular transport of cholesterol, glycolipids and possibly other endocytic cargo in alia. which is critical for maintaining the integrity of neurons.

A substantial body of evidence indicates that the hippocampus processes pain-related information, that some hippocampal neurons respond exclusively to painful stimulation, and that long-term anatomical changes occur in dentate gyrus neurons, following noxious physical stimulation. NMDA receptor antagonist drugs administered to the hippocampus interfere with long-term potentiation, learning, and memory; these same drugs, when applied to the spinal cord, prevent the long-term neurophysiological changes caused by noxious physical stimulation. This experiment tested whether blocking NMDA receptors in the hippocampal formation reduces nociceptive behaviors in an animal model of persistent human pain. The competitive NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 was injected into the dentate gyrus of alert, unrestrained rats either 5 min before or 15 min following the administration of a subcutaneous injection of formalin irritant. Pain behaviors in both acute and tonic phases of the formalin test were significantly reduced by AP5 treatments. These results support the hypothesis that the hippocampal formation is involved in pain-related neural processing and that NMDA receptor-sensitive mechanisms in the hippocampus are involved in pain perception and/or the expression of pain-related behaviors.

One hundred and ninety four (89%) wounds underwent primary uneventful healing. Twenty-four wounds (11%) required local wound care. One deep Infection occurred In a neuropathic foot that required below-knee amputation. No free-tissue transfers, local tissue flaps or skin grafts were needed In patients who presented Initially with a closed fracture. Ninety-five fractures (43.5%) required subsequent surgical procedures (hardware removal-88/95 [93% of secondary procedures]). Six patients (2.8%) had postoperative sural nerve findings. Seventeen procedures other than hardware removal were performed. There were five subtalar fusions Including two subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodeses. There were seven claw toe correction procedures, four calcaneal valgus osteotomies for varus malunions and one subtalar arthrolysis at the time of hardware removal. These results suggest Internal fixation of displaced Intra-articular calcaneus fractures using a single lateral approach Is a safe, reliable method of treatment.

Astrocytes and microglia are resident cells of the CNS that contribute to the formation of the BBB. In this article, we consider the influence of these glial cells on the immune regulatory functions of the microvascular endothelium, with special emphasis on the human BBB. A series of in vitro studies demonstrate that soluble factors produced by glial cells, under basal culture conditions, help restrict development of inflammation within the CNS. These soluble factor effects include upregulating expression of molecules including HT7, UEA-1 lectin-binding sites, and angiotensin receptors that help define the phenotype of endothelial cells. These factors also induce tight junction formation between brain endothelial cells, contributing to the restricted permeability of the BBB. In contrast, these factors have little effect on expression of molecules by ECs that either promote lymphocyte migration, such as chemokines and adhesion molecules or molecules that are required for competent antigen presentation, such as MHC and co-stimulatory molecules. Glial cells that become activated in response to signals derived from the immune system or generated within the CNS, produce an array of inflammatory molecules that increase permeability and promote lymphocyte trafficking and persistence. These observations emphasize the bidirectional nature of neural-immune interactions; this dynamic system should. be amenable to therapeutic interventions. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In humans, two nearly identical copies of SMN exist and differ only by a single non-polymorphic C -->T nucleotide transition in exon 7. SMN1 contains a 'C' nucleotide at the +6 position of exon 7 and produces primarily full-length SMN transcripts, whereas SMN2 contains a 'T' nucleotide and produces high levels of a transcript that lacks exon 7 and a low level of full-length SMN transcripts. All SMA patients lack a functional SMN1 gene but retain at least one copy of SMN2, suggesting that the low level of full-length protein produced from SMN2 is sufficient for all cell types except motor neurons. The murine Smn gene is not duplicated or alternatively spliced. It resembles SMN1 in that the critical exon 7 +6 'C' nucleotide is conserved. We have generated Smn minigenes containing either wild-type Smn exon 7 or an altered exon 7 containing the C -->T nucleotide transition to mimic SMN2. When expressed in cultured cells or transgenic mice, the wild-type minigene produced only full-length transcripts whereas the modified minigene alternatively spliced exon 7. Furthermore, Smn exon 7 contains a critical AG-rich exonic splice enhancer sequence (ESE) analogous to the human ESE within SMN exon 7, and subtle mutations within the mESE caused a variation in Smn transcript levels. In summary, we show for the first time that the murine Smnlocus can be induced to alternatively splice exon 7. These results demonstrate that SMN protein levels can be varied in the mouse by the introduction of specific mutations at the endogenous Smn locus and thereby lay the foundation for developing animals that closely 'resemble' SMA patients.

Despite many publications identifying possible predictors of outcome in this population of interest, little is known of the long-term developmental outcome of asphyxiated term neonates. Observational studies have largely focused on short-term outcomes, with an emphasis on significant neurologic sequelae and intellectual impairments. This article reviews the literature that has described the developmental outcome of asphyxiated term newborns. As part of this review, we have also highlighted the evolution of the definition of asphyxia and delineated appropriate markers that should be used in future research on this population.

However, the mechanisms of action of this drug are incompletely understood and effects of interferon beta -1b on axonal injury are not known. A measure of axonal injury can be obtained in vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the resonance intensity of the neuronal marker, N-acetylas-partate (NAA). In a small pilot study, we performed combined magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging on 10 patients with relapsing-remitting MS before and 1 year after starting treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta -1b. Resonance intensities of NAA relative to creatine (Cr) were measured in a large, central brain volume. These measurements were compared with those made in a group of 6 untreated patients selected to have a similar range of scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale and mean NAA/Cr at baseline. NAA/Cr in the treated group [2.74 (0.16), mean (SD)] showed an increase of 5.5 % 12 months after the start of therapy [2.89 (0.24), p = 0.05], while NAA/Cr in the untreated group decreased, but not significantly [2.76 (0.1) at baseline, 2.65 (0.14) at 12 months,p > 0.1]. NAA/Cr had become significantly higher in the treated group at 12 months than in the untreated group (p = 0.03). Our data suggest that, in addition to losing axons, patients with chronic multiple sclerosis suffer from chronic, sublethal axonal injury that is at least partially reversible with interferon beta -1b therapy.

Methods-A consecutive series of patients sustaining severe closed head injury were evacuated to one of 11 large regional North American trauma centres and entered into a randomised, phase III, multicentre clinical trial investigating the therapeutic use of moderate hypothermia. Acute care personnel were blinded to outcome and outcome personnel were blinded to treatment condition. The Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included the disability rating scale (DRS) and the NRS-R. Results-Exploratory factor analysis of NRS-R data collected at 6 months after injury (n=210) resulted in a five factor model including: (1) executive/cognition, (2) positive symptoms, (3) negative symptoms, (4) mood/affect, and (5) oral/motor. These factors showed acceptable internal consistency (0.62 to 0.88), low to moderate interfactor correlations (0.19 to 0.61), and discriminated well between GOS defined groups. Factor validity was demonstrated by significant correlations with specific neuropsychological domains. Significant change was measured from 3 to 6 months after injury for the total score (sum of all 29 item ratings) and all factor scores except mood/affect and positive symptoms. The total score and all factor scores correlated significantly with concurrent GOS and DRS scores. Conclusions-The NRS-R is weld suited as a secondary outcome measure for clinical trials as its completion rate exceeds that of neuropsychological assessment and it provides important neurobehavioural information complementary to that provided by global outcome and neuropsychological measures.

To better understand the mechanism(s) involved, we studied ethanol effects on glycine-activated responses of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons isolated from the newborn rat, using whole cell and gramicidin perforated patch-clamp techniques. Previously we reported that 0.1-40 mM ethanol enhances glycine-induced responses of 35% of VTA neurons (Ye et al. 2001). We now direct our attention to the inhibitory effects of ethanol observed in 45% (312 of 694) of neonatal VTA neurons. Under current-clamp conditions, 1 mM ethanol had no effect on the membrane potential of these cells, but it decreased glycine-induced membrane depolarization and the frequency of spontaneous action potentials. Under voltage-clamp conditions, 0.1-10 mM ethanol did not elicit a current but depressed the glycine-induced currents. The ethanol-induced inhibition of glycine current was independent of membrane potential (between -60 and +60 mV). Likewise, ethanol did not alter the reversal potential of the glycine-activated currents. Ethanol-mediated inhibition of glycine current depended on the glycine concentration. While ethanol strongly depressed currents activated by 30 muM glycine, it had no appreciable effect on maximal currents activated by 1 mM glycine. In the presence of ethanol (1 mM), the EC50 for glycine increased from 32 +/- 5 to 60 +/- 3 muM. Thus ethanol may decrease the agonist affinity of glycine receptors. A kinetic analysis indicated that ethanol shortens the time constant of glycine current deactivation but has no effect on activation. In conclusion, by altering VTA neuronal function, ethanol-induced changes in glycine receptors may contribute to neurobehavioral manifestations of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

J	Bourque, MJ; Kolta, A				Bourque, MJ; Kolta, A			Properties and interconnections of trigeminal interneurons of the lateral pontine reticular formation in the rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MOTONEURONS IN-VITRO; MOTOR NUCLEUS; BRAIN-STEM; GUINEA-PIG; PREMOTOR NEURONS; FICTIVE MASTICATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; COMMISSURAL INTERNEURONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; SUPRATRIGEMINAL REGION	Numerous evidence suggests that interneurons located in the lateral tegmentum at the level of the trigeminal motor nucleus contribute importantly to the circuitry involved in mastication. However, the question of whether these neurons participate actively to genesis of the rhythmic motor pattern or simply relay it to trigeminal motoneurons remains open. To answer this question, intracellular recordings were performed in an in vitro slice preparation comprising interneurons of the peritrigeminal area (PeriV) surrounding the trigeminal motor nucleus (NVmt) and the parvocellular reticular formation ventral and caudal to it (PCRt). Intracellular and extracellular injections of anterograde tracers were also used to examine the local connections established by these neurons. In 97% of recordings, electrical stimulation of adjacent areas evoked a postsynaptic potential (PSP). These PSPs were primarily excitatory, but inhibitory and biphasic responses were also induced. Most occurred at latencies longer than those required for monosynaptic transmission and were considered to involve oligosynaptic pathways. Both the anatomical and physiological findings show that all divisions of PeriV and PCRt are extensively interconnected. Most responses followed high-frequency stimulation (50 Hz) and showed little variability in latency indicating that the network reliably distributes inputs across all areas. In all neurons but one, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were also elicited by stimulation of NVmt, suggesting the existence of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within the motor nucleus. In a number of cases, these PSPs were reproduced by local injection of glutamate in lieu of the electrical stimulation. All EPSPs induced by stimulation of PeriV, PCRt, or NVmt were sensitive to ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-dinitroquinoxaline and D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, while IPSPs were blocked by bicuculline and strychnine, antagonists of GABAA and glycine receptors. Examination of PeriV and PCRt intrinsic properties indicate that they form a fairly uniform network. Three types of neurons were identified on the basis of their firing adaptation properties. These types were not associated with particular regions. Only 5% of all neurons showed bursting behavior. Our results do not support the hypothesis that neurons of PeriV and PCRt participate actively to rhythm generation, but suggest instead that they are driven by rhythmical synaptic inputs. The organization of the network allows for rapid distribution of this rhythmic input across premotoneuron groups.

In nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD) and hippocampus (CA3), the selective 5-HT1A agonist (+)-8-hydroxy- 2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) reduces the firing activity of serotoninergic (5-HT) and pyramidal neurons, respectively. When located on 5-HT (autoreceptors), but not on non-5-HT (heteroreceptors) neurons, 5-HT1A receptors are known to be subject to desensitization. Using quantitative electron microscopy after pre-embedding immunogold labeling with specific antibodies, we examined the subcellular distribution of these receptors after acute administration of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). Silver-intensified immunogold particles associated with the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm were counted in somata and dendrites within the NRD, 15 min, 1 hr and 24 hr after 8-OH-DPAT injection, and in hippocampal dendrites 1 hr after the same treatment. Significant decrease in the density of membrane labeling and concomitant increase of cytoplasmic labeling were demonstrated in the NRD, 15 min and 1 hr after 8-OH-DPAT administration, with a return to baseline level at 24 hr. Internalization was blocked by previous administration of the 5-HT1A antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- 1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY 100635), which, by itself, was without apparent effect. In hippocampus (CA3), there were no apparent changes in the distribution of the receptor after 8-OH-DPAT administration. These findings are in line with earlier results showing a desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors but not heteroreceptors after treatment with 5-HT1A receptor agonist. They suggest that this desensitization is the result of autoreceptor internalization.

ANNs are dynamic computer systems able to learn the relations between input and output data. We developed ANN models to infer pH from fossil diatom assemblages using a calibration data set of 76 lakes in Quebec. We evaluated the predictive power of these models in comparison with the two most commonly methods used in paleolimnology: Weighted Averaging (WA) and Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares (WA-PLS). Results show that the relationship between species assemblages and environmental variables of interest can be modelled by a 3-layer back-propagation network, with apparent R-2 and RMSE of 0.9 and 0.24 pH units, respectively. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to access the reliabilities of the WA, WA-PLS and ANN models. Validation results show that the ANN model (R-jackknife(2) = 0.63, RMSEjackknife = 0.45, mean bias = 0.14, maximum bias = 1.13) gives a better predictive power than the WA model (R-jackknife(2) = 0.56, RMSEjackknife = 0.5, mean bias = -0.09, maximum bias = -1.07) or WA-PLS model (R-jackknife(2) = 0.58, RMSEjackknife = 0.48, mean bias = -0.15, maximum bias = -1.08). We also evaluated whether the removal of certain taxa according to their tolerance changed the performance of the models. Overall, we found that the removal of taxa with high tolerances for pH improved the predictive power of WA-PLS models whereas the removal of low tolerance taxa lowered its performance. However, ANN models were generally much less affected by the removal of taxa of either low or high pH tolerance. Moreover, the best model was obtained by averaging the predictions of WA-PLS and ANN models. This implies that the two modelling approaches capture and extract complementary information from diatom assemblages. We suggest that future modelling efforts might achieve better results using analogous multi-model strategies.

Bath application of 3-5 mm Cs(+) provoked reversible membrane depolarisation and increased firing rate in all of the neurones tested. Voltage-current analysis revealed an increase in membrane resistance between - 120 and -55 mV. The increase in resistance was greater below -85 mV than at more positive potentials. 3. Voltage-clamp analysis showed that external Cs' blocked the hyperpolarisation-activated inward current, I(H). Under current clamp, application of ZD 7288, a selective blocker of I(H), caused an increase in membrane resistance at voltages less than or equal to -65 mV. Voltage-current analysis further revealed that blockade of I(H) caused hyperpolarisation when the initial voltage was < -60 mV but had no effect at more positive values. 4. Current- and voltage-clamp analysis of the effects of Cs(+) in the presence of ZD 7288, or ZD 7288 and tetraethyl ammonium (TEA), revealed an increase in membrane resistance throughout the range of voltages tested (-120 to -45 mV). The current blocked by Cs+ in the absence of I(H) was essentially voltage independent and reversed at -100 mV. The reversal potential shifted by +22.7 mV when external [K(+)] was increased from 3 to 9 mm. We conclude that, in addition to blocking I(H), external Cs(+) blocks a leakage K+ current that contributes significantly to the resting potential of rat magnocellular neurosecretory cells.

Differing theories as to the cause and progression of schizophrenia, as well as the heterogeneity of clinical symptoms, have made it difficult to develop a coherent framework suitable for animal modelling. However, a number of limited animal models have been developed to explore various causative theories and to test specific mechanistic hypotheses. Historically, these models have been based on the manipulation of neurotransmitter systems believed to be involved in schizophrenia. In recent years, the emphasis has shifted to targeting relevant brain regions in an attempt to explore potential etiologic hypotheses. The specific animal models developed within these frameworks are described in this review. Emphasis is placed on the critical evaluation of currently available models because these models help to shape the direction of future research.

This morphogenetic switching has been implicated in the development of pathogenicity. We have cloned the CaCDC35 gene encoding C. albicans adenylyl cyclase by functional complementation of the conditional growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with mutations in Ras1p and Ras2p. It has previously been shown that these Ras homologues regulate adenylyl cyclase in yeast. The C. albicans adenylyl cyclase is highly homologous to other fungal adenylyl cyclases but has less sequence similarity with the mammalian enzymes. mammalian enzymes. C. albicans cells deleted for both alleles of CaCDC35 had no detectable cAMP levels, suggesting that this gene encodes the only adenylyl cyclase in C. albicans. The homozygous mutant cells were viable but grew more slowly than wild-type cells and were unable to switch from the yeast to the hyphal form under all environmental conditions that we analyzed in vitro. Moreover, this morphogenetic switch was completely blocked in mutant cells undergoing phagocytosis by macrophages. However, morphogenetic switching was restored by exogenous cAMP. On the basis of epistasis experiments, we propose that CaCdc35p acts downstream of the Ras homologue CaRas1p. These epistasis experiments also suggest that the putative transcription factor Efg1p and components of the hyphal-inducing MA-P kinase pathway depend on the function of CaCdc35p in their ability to induce morphogenetic switching. Homozygous cacdc35 Delta cells were unable to establish vaginal infection in a mucosal membrane mouse model and were avirulent in a mouse model for systemic infections. These findings suggest that fungal adenylyl cyclases and other regulators of the cAMP signaling pathway may be useful targets for antifungal drugs.

Many reports have documented that very low levels of nNOS protein exist in muscle fibers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. In this study we investigated the functional significance of PIN (protein inhibitor of nNOS) in targeting of nNOS to the sarcolemma and the association between nNOS and the dystrophin complex in normal and dystrophic muscle fibers. Northern blotting for PIN mRNA in normal mouse muscles and muscles of mdx mice (an animal model of DMD) revealed a significant rise in PIN mRNA in dystrophic muscles compared with normal muscles. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that, in normal mouse muscle fibers, PIN expression was localized at the sarcolemma, peripheral nuclei, and the sarcoplasm. By comparison, PIN protein in muscles from mdx mice was more concentrated around the sarcolemma and central nuclei. The presence of PIN protein expression in muscles from mdx mice was evident despite the significant reduction in nNOS and dystrophin protein expressions in these fibers. In muscle sections of DMD patients, the absence of nNOS protein expression was accompanied by maintained PIN expression. Prominent PIN expression was also detectable in macrophages infiltrating dystrophic muscle fibers both in mdx mice and DMD patients. These results suggest that PIN expression in muscles from mdx mice and DMD patients is controlled by factors different from those involved in the regulation of nNOS and dystrophin.

J	Feng, CH; Plamondon, R				Feng, CH; Plamondon, R			On the stability analysis of delayed neural networks systems	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						neural networks; Liapunov functional; time delays; global asymptotical stability	TRANSMISSION DELAYS	In this paper, the problems of stability of delayed neural networks are investigated, including the stability of discrete and distributed delayed neural networks. Under the generalization of dropping the Lipschitzian hypotheses for output functions, some stability criteria are obtained by using the Liapunov functional method. We do not assume the symmetry of the connection matrix and we establish that the system admits a unique equilibrium point in which the output functions do not satisfy the Lipschitz conditions and do not require them to be differential or strictly monotonously increasing. These criteria can be used to analyze the dynamics of biological neural systems or to design globally stable artificial neural networks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fisher, TE; Bourque, CW				Fisher, TE; Bourque, CW			The function of C2(+) channel subtypes in exocytotic secretion: new perspectives from synaptic and non-synaptic release	PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Review						exocytosis; neurotransmission; neurohypophysis; pancreatic beta cells; auditory hair cells	PANCREATIC BETA-CELLS; PRESYNAPTIC CALCIUM CHANNELS; GATED CA2+ CHANNELS; SACCULAR HAIR-CELLS; FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC MIGRAINE; PEPTIDERGIC NERVE-TERMINALS; CEREBELLAR PURKINJE-CELLS; RETINAL BIPOLAR NEURONS; OMEGA-CONOTOXIN GVIA; SQUID GIANT SYNAPSE	By mediating the Ca2+ influx that triggers exocytotic fusion, Ca2+ channels play a central role in a wide range of secretory processes. Ca2+ channels consist of a complex of protein subunits, including anal subunit that constitutes the voltage-dependent Ca2+-selective membrane pore, and a group of auxiliary subunits, including beta, gamma, and alpha(2)-delta subunits, which modulate channel properties such as inactivation and channel targeting. Subtypes of Ca2+ channels are constituted by different combinations of alpha(1) subunits (of which 10 have been identified) and auxiliary subunits, particularly beta (of which 4 have been identified). Activity-secretion coupling is determined not only by the biophysical properties of the channels involved, but also by the relationship between channels and the exocytotic apparatus, which may differ between fast and slow types of secretion. Colocalization of Ca2+ channels at sites of fast release may depend on biochemical interactions between channels and exocytotic proteins. The aim of this article is to review recent work on Ca2+ channel structure and function in exocytotic secretion. We discuss Ca2+ channel involvement in selected types of secretion, including central neurotransmission, endocrine and neuroendocrine secretion, and transmission at graded potential synapses. Several different Ca2+ channel subtypes are involved in these types of secretion, and their function is likely to involve a variety of relationships with the exocytotic apparatus. Elucidating the relationship between Ca2+ channel structure and function is central to our understanding of the fundamental process of exocytotic secretion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Considering the evidence of NMDA receptors involvement in depression, the present study was undertaken in order to investigate the time-course effects of OBX on the NMDA receptor function. Following bilateral olfactory bulbectomy, rats display an increase in locomotor activity and changes in other types of behavior in a novel environment. Autoradiographic experiments using the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist [I-125]-iodo-MK-801 as the labeling agent showed that this increase in behavioral activities corresponds to a decrease in [I-125]-iodo-MK-801 binding in a number of brain regions. In most regions, this reduction reached significance by the third week following OBX. However, in some cortical areas-a nucleus of the thalamus (AV) and one of the amygdala (LA)-this reduction was already significant in the first or second week following OBX and lasted throughout the 4 weeks of the study. We also compared the behavioral modifications induced by a challenge injection of MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) in OBX and sham-operated rats. This challenge is known to induce hyperlocomotion and a number of stereotypies in naive rats. These effects were drastically reduced in OBX as compared to sham-operated rats. These data are consistent with the above-mentioned decrease in cerebral binding of MK-801 to NMDA receptors. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We now test the effects on several kinetic parameters of automatic procedures for volume of interest (VOI) selection. We also tested the sensitivity of the estimates to dynamic frame sequence duration, and produced a standard method for minimizing the variations in physiological estimates for FDOPA kinetics in minipig brain. We used minipigs because our previous work has shown them to provide an appropriate animal model for study normal and pathological cerebral DOPA metabolism using PET. Time-activity curves in striatum of adult minipigs were acquired in VOIs defined manually on MR-images, or alternatively on the basis of the radioactivity concentration based on the most radioactive voxel in the last scan frame. For all frame sequences, the relative decarboxylase activity (k(3)(D)) declined significantly (P < 0.006) as the VOI threshold declined from 95 to 70% of the most radioactive voxel. Irrespective of VOI size, the magnitude of k(3)(D) declined significantly (P < 0.001) from 0.074 +/- 0.008 to 0.045 +/- 0.005 per min (mean +/- S.E.M.) as total sequence length increased from 60 to 120 min circulation. The method of VOI selection had no significant effect on the striatum decarboxylation index of FDOPA calculated relative to the radioactivity in cerebellum (k(3)(S)). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; FOLLOW-UP; RISK; PROGESTIN; COHORT; USERS; PREVENTION	Background: Observational studies have suggested that estrogen-replacement therapy may reduce a woman's risk of stroke and death. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of estrogen therapy (1 mg of estradiol-17 beta per day) in 664 postmenopausal women (mean age, 71 years) who had recently had an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Women were recruited from 21 hospitals in the United States and were followed for the occurrence of stroke or death. Results: During a mean follow-up period of 2.8 years, there were 99 strokes or deaths among the women in the estradiol group, and 93 among those in the placebo group (relative risk in the estradiol group, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.4). Estrogen therapy did not reduce the risk of death alone (relative risk, 1.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.8) or the risk of nonfatal stroke (relative risk, 1.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.4). The women who were randomly assigned to receive estrogen therapy had a higher risk of fatal stroke (relative risk, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 9.0), and their nonfatal strokes were associated with slightly worse neurologic and functional deficits. Conclusions: Estradiol does not reduce mortality or the recurrence of stroke in postmenopausal women with cerebrovascular disease. This therapy should not be prescribed for the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease.

The patients all had a homozygous missense mutation in SCO2. Background: SCO2 encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, thought to function as a copper transporter to cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain. Mutations in SCO2 have been described in patients with severe COX deficiency and early onset fatal infantile hypertrophic cardioencephalomyopathy. All patients so far reported are compound heterozygotes for a missense mutation (E140K) near the predicted CxxxC metal binding motif; however, recent functional studies of the homologous mutation in yeast failed to demonstrate an effect on respiration. Methods: Here we present clinical, biochemical, morphologic, functional, MRI, and MRS data in two infants, and a short report in an additional patient, all carrying a homozygous G1541A transition (E140K). Results: The disease onset and symptoms differed significantly from those in compound heterozygotes. MRI and muscle morphology demonstrated an age-dependent progression of disease with predominant involvement of white matter, late appearance of basal ganglia lesions, and neurogenic muscular atrophy in addition to the relatively late onset of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The copper uptake of cultured fibroblasts was significantly increased. Conclusions: The clinical spectrum of SCO2 deficiency includes the delayed development of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and severe neurogenic muscular atrophy. There is increased copper uptake in patients' fibroblasts indicating that the G1541A mutation effects cellular copper metabolism.

We found that the induction of maternal behavior in virgin females through constant exposure to pups (pup sensitization) was significantly shorter in the offspring of High compared with Low licking/grooming mothers, suggesting differences in maternal responsivity. In randomly selected females screened for individual differences in maternal responsivity and subsequently mated, there was a significant and negative correlation (r = -0.73) between the latency to exhibit maternal behavior in the pup sensitization paradigm and the frequency of pup licking/grooming during lactation. Females that were more maternally responsive to pups and that showed increased levels of pup licking/grooming also showed significantly higher oxytocin receptor levels in the medial preoptic area, the lateral septum, the central nucleus (n.) of the amygdala, the paraventricular n. of the hypothalamus, and the bed n. of the stria terminalis. Intracerebroventricular administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist to mothers on postpartum day 3 completely eliminated the differences in pup licking/grooming, suggesting that differences in oxytocin receptor levels are functionally related to maternal behavior. Finally, estrogen treatment of virgin females significantly increased oxytocin receptor binding in the medial preoptic area and lateral septum of female offspring of High, but not Low, licking/grooming mothers. These findings suggest that maternal licking/grooming influences the development of estrogen sensitivity in brain regions that regulate maternal behavior, providing a potential mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of individual differences in maternal behavior.

These short-lived peptides, including bradykinin, kallidin and T-kinin, are generated during tissue injury and noxious stimulation. However, emerging evidence also suggests that kinins are stored in neuronal elements of the central nervous system (CNS) where they are thought to play a role as neuromediators in various cerebral functions, particularly in the control of nociceptive information. Kinins exert their biological effects through the activation of two transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors, denoted bradykinin B-1 and B-2 Whereas the B-2 receptor is constitutive and activated by the parent molecules, the B-1 receptor is generally underexpressed in normal tissues and is activated by kinins deprived of the C-terminal Arg (des-Arg(9)-kinins). The induction and increased expression of B-1 receptor occur following tissue injury or after treatment with bacterial endotoxins or cytokines such as interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This review summarizes the most recent data from various animal models which convey support for a role of B-2 receptors in the acute phase of the inflammatory and pain response, and for a role of B-1 receptors in the chronic phase of the response. The B-1 receptor may exert a strategic role in inflammatory diseases with an immune component (diabetes, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis). New information is provided regarding the role of sensory mechanisms subserving spinal hyperalgesia and intrapleural neutrophil migration that occur upon B-1 receptor activation in streptozotocin-treated rats, a model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in which the B-1 receptor seems to be rapidly overexpressed. Although it is widely accepted that the blockade of kinin receptors with specific antagonists could be of benefit in the treatment of somatic and visceral inflammation and pain, recent molecular and functional evidence suggests that the activation of B-1 receptors with an agonist may afford a novel therapeutic approach in the CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorder encountered in multiple sclerosis by reducing immune cell infiltration (T-lymphocytes) into the brain. Hence, the B-1 receptor may exert either a protective or detrimental effect depending on the inflammatory disease. This dual function of the B-1 receptor deserves to be investigated further.

Deletion of four octapeptide repeats of PrP (PrP Delta OR) and familial D178N and T183A PrP mutations completely or partially eliminate the neuroprotective effect of PrP. PrP remains anti-apoptotic despite truncation of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal peptide, indicating that the neuroprotective form of PrP does not require the abundant cell surface GPI-anchored PrP. Our results implicate PrP as a potent and novel anti-apoptotic protein against Bax-mediated cell death.

This mutation influences the interaction of huntingtin with different proteins, including huntingtin-interacting protein I (HIP(), in which affinity to bind to mutant huntingtin is profoundly reduced. Here we demonstrate that HIP( colocalizes with markers of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neuronal cells and is highly enriched on clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) purified from brain homogenates. HIP( binds to the clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP2) and the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain, predominantly through a small fragment encompassing amino acids 276-335. This region, which contains consensus clathrin- and AP2-binding sites, functions in conjunction with the coiled-coil domain to target HIP( to CCVs. Expression of various HIP1 fragments leads to a potent block of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our findings demonstrate that HIP1 is a novel component of the endocytic machinery.

To further clarify the selectivity and mechanism of peripherin-induced neuronal death, we analyzed the effects of peripherin overexpression in primary neuronal cultures. Peripherin overexpression led to the formation of cytoplasmic protein aggregates and caused the death not only of motor neurons, but also of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that were cultured from dissociated spinal cords of peripherin transgenic embryos. Apoptosis of DRG neurons containing peripherin aggregates was dependent on the proinflammatory central nervous system environment of spinal cultures, rich in activated microglia, and required TNF-alpha. This synergistic proapoptotic effect may contribute to neuronal selectivity in ALS.

Although inhibitory control in this region has a crucial impact on pain transmission, the respective contribution of GABA and glycine to this inhibition remains elusive. We have previously documented co-release of GABA and glycine at the same inhibitory synapse in spinal laminas I-II of adult rats [older than postnatal day 30 (P30)]. However, despite this co-release, individual miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were mediated by either glycine receptors (GlyR) or GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R), yet never by the two together. In contrast, recent studies of ventral horn immature inhibitory synapses (less than or equal to P21) reported individual mIPSCs that were mediated by both GABA(A)Rs and GlyRs. This raises the question of whether mixed mIPSCs are present in immature lamina I-II neurons yet are lost through a maturation-dependent synaptic specialization. To test this, we recorded mIPSCs using patch-clamp techniques in lamina I-II neurons in spinal slices taken at different stages of development. We found that, in neurons younger than P23, both GlyR-only and GABA(A)R-only mIPSCs could be recorded, in addition to mixed GABA(A)R-GlyR mIPSCs. With maturation however, both lamina I-II neurons gradually discontinued exhibiting mixed mIPSCs, although with differing patterns of specialization. Yet, at all developmental stages, benzodiazepine administration could unmask mixed mIPSCs. Together, these findings indicate that, although GABA and glycine are continually co-released throughout development, junctional codetection ceases by adulthood. This indicates an age-dependent postsynaptic tuning of inhibitory synapses that occurs in a region-specific manner.

Here we find that 17-beta -estradiol but not 17-alpha -estradiol prevents caspase-6-mediated neuronal cell death. 17-beta -estradiol-treated neuronal extracts directly inhibit recombinant active caspase-6, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-8 in vitro. We conclude that 17-beta -estradiol induces a caspase inhibitory factor (CIF) that is preventing neuronal apoptosis. The induction of CIF occurs within 10 min of 17-beta -estradiol exposure to neurons, does not require de novo protein synthesis, and involves mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. The effect is antagonized by the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. In contrast, 17-beta -estradiol does not induce CIF or prevent caspase-mediated cell death in cultured astrocytes. CIF does not act through oxidation of the caspase active site. CIF activity copurifies with proteins of between 12 and 14 kDa in size. Our results indicate that 17-beta -estradiol induces an inhibitor of active caspases through a receptor-mediated nongenomic pathway and provide an additional mechanism for the neuroprotective action of 17-beta -estradiol that is likely highly relevant to the understanding of the role of estrogen against Alzheimer's disease.

The role of parasympathetic neural activity in lowering HR is unresolved, and its influence on Q and oxygen transport at high altitude has never been studied. Methods and Results-HR, Q, oxygen uptake, mean arterial pressure, and leg blood flow were determined at rest and during cycle exercise with and without vagal blockade with glycopyrrolate in 7 healthy lowlanders after 9 weeks' residence at greater than or equal to 5260 m (ALT). At ALT, glycopyrrolate increased resting HR by 80 bpm (73 +/-4 to 153 +/-4 bpm) compared with 53 bpm (61 +/-3 to 114 +/-6 bpm) at sea level (SL). During exercise at ALT, glycopyrrolate increased HR by approximate to 40 bpm both at submaximal (127 +/-4 to 170 +/-3 bpm; 118 W) and maximal (141 +/-6 to 180 +/-2 bpm) exercise, whereas at SL, the increase was only by 16 bpm (137 +/-6 to 153 +/-4 bpm) at 118 W. with no effect at maximal exercise (181 +/-2 bpm). Despite restoration of maximal IIR to SL values, glycopyrrolate had no influence on Q, which was reduced at ALT. Breathing FIO2=0.55 at peak exercise restored Q and power output to SL values. Conclusions-Enhanced parasympathetic neural activity accounts for the lowering of HR during exercise at ALT without influencing Q. The abrupt restoration of peak exercise Q in chronic hypoxia to maximal SL values when arterial PO2 and SO2 are similarly increased suggests hypoxia-mediated attenuation of Q.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the NC/OP4 system in stress-induced analgesia (SIA). The tail-withdrawal assay was performed in mice stressed by forced swimming in water at 15 degreesC (high severity swims) or 32 degreesC (low severity swims). High severity swims produced a naloxone-insensitive antinociceptive effect which was blocked by supraspinal NC (I nmol). The selective OP4 receptor antagonist, [Nphe(1)]]NC(-13)NH2 (30 nmol), was inactive by itself, but prevented the effect of NC. Low severity swims produced a milder analgesic effect that was partially antagonized by naloxone, completely blocked by NC and potentiated by [Nphe(1)]NC(- 13)NH2. These findings confirm the anti-analgesic role of supraspinal NC and suggest that endogenous NC signaling counteracts the opioid component of SIA.

We further observed that human cerebral microvessels in nonmalignant CNS tissues immunoreacted with NG2. NG2 protein was detected using both a rabbit antibody raised against the rodent NG2 and a monoclonal antibody raised against the human NG2 (9.2.27).

MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; FOLLOW-UP; BRAIN; CORTICOSTEROIDS; MRI; CRITERIA; LESIONS	PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of treatment with interferon beta -1a (Avonex) initiated at the time of a first episode of optic neuritis in patients at high risk for multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial METHODS: Prospective. SETTING: Fifty clinical centers throughout the US and Canada. STUDY POPULATION: After the onset of a first episode of optic neuritis treated with intravenous and oral corticosteroids, 192 patients with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of subclinical demyelination were randomly assigned to receive weekly intramuscular injections of 30 mug interferon beta -1a or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The study outcomes were the development of clinically definite MS within 3 years of follow,up and brain MRI changes at 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULTS: The rates of clinically definite MS and of a combined MS/MRI outcome were lower in the interferon beta -1a group than in the placebo group (adjusted rate ratios 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 1.00; and 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.73, respectively). Compared with the placebo group, on the 18,month brain MRI the interferon beta -1a group had a smaller change from baseline in T2 lesion volume (P = .02), fewer new or enlarging T2 lesions (P < .001), and a lower frequency of Gd-enhancing lesions (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The clinical and brain MRI results of this trial support initiating interferon beta -1a treatment at the time of a first episode of optic neuritis occurring in patients at high risk for MS based on the presence of subclinical brain MRI lesions.

It is suggested in the literature that postoperative radiotherapy may decrease local recurrence and improve overall survival. The purpose of this retrospective review was to determine our experience and review the literature on this aggressive malignancy. Charts of ten patients with MCC seen between 1985 and 1997 were reviewed to obtain clinicopathological data. Eight patients were male with a mean age of 72 years (range 49-90). The head and neck was the most common site, affecting 50 per cent of patients. All patients had primary excisions with documented negative margins. Pathological size ranged from 10 to 40 mm. Initial pathological diagnosis was lymphoma in three cases requiring immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin and neuron-specific enolase for definitive diagnosis. Lymphatic invasion was noted in three patients but only one of these patients had clinical lymph node involvement. The mean follow-up was 54 months (range 6-114) with an 80 per cent one-year survival and 30 per cent 2-year survival. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered to five patients. Of these three died with evidence of both local and distant recurrence. This small retrospective review highlights important points in the management of MCC including pathological diagnosis and benefits of adjuvant radiation therapy.

In the presence of 10 mM Ba2+, the CEEE chimera (Repeat I+part of the I-II linker from Ca(V)1.2) displayed inactivation properties similar to Ca(V)1.2 despite being more than 90% homologous to Ca(V)2.3. The transmembrane segments of Repeat I did not appear to be crucial as inactivation of EC(ISI-6)EEE was not significantly different than Ca(V)2.3. In contrast, EC(AID)EEE, with the P-subunit binding domain from Ca(V)1.2, tended to behave like Ca(V)1.2 in terms of inactivation kinetics and voltage dependence. A detailed kinetic analysis revealed nonetheless that CEEE and EC(AID)EEE retained the fast inactivation time constant (tau (fast) approximate to 20-30 ms) that is a distinctive feature of Ca(V)2.3. Altogether, these data suggest that the region surrounding the AID binding site plays a pivotal albeit not exclusive role in determining the inactivation properties of Ca(V)2.3.

One mechanism by which polyGin-expanded proteins are believed to cause neuronotoxicity is through aberrant interaction(s) with, and possible sequestration of, critical cellular protein(s). Our goal was to confirm and further characterize the interaction between hAR and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb (COXVb), a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein. We initially isolated COXVb as an AR-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify candidate proteins that interacted with normal and polyGin-expanded AR. Using the mammalian two-hybrid system, we confirm that COXVb interacts with normal and mutant AR and demonstrated that the COXVb-normal AR interaction is stimulated by heat shock protein 70. In addition, blue fluorescent protein-tagged AR specifically co-localized with cytoplasmic aggregates formed by green fluorescent protein-labeled polyGin-expanded AR in androgen-treated cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction may precede neuropathological findings in polyGin-expanded disorders and may thus represent an early event in neuronotoxicity. Interaction of COXVb and hAR, with subsequent sequestration of COXVb, may provide a mechanism for putative mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Although the endogenous ligand is yet to be elucidated, the sigma, receptor has recently been cloned. 2 Behavioural models used to test potential antidepressants have shown sigma ligands to produce antidepressant effects but their mechanism of action is unknown. 3 The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of various sigma, ligands on the firing activity of serotonin (5-HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) using extracellular in vivo recordings in anaesthetized rats. 4 The sigma(1) ligands (+)-pentazoeine and 4-(N-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-4-iodobenzamide (4-IBP) (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) increased markedly 5-HT firing activity after 2 days of treatment and maintained the same increased firing rate after long-term (21 days) treatments. Furthermore, the increased firing rate produced by 2 and 21 day treatments with (+)-pentazocine was prevented by the coadministration of N,N-dipropyl-2-(4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)phenyl)-thylamine (NE-100) (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) a selective sigma(1) antagonist, confirming the sigma, receptor's modulation of these effects. In contrast, the sigma(1) ligands (+)-N-cyclopropylmethyl-N-methyl-1,4-diphenyl-1-1-ethyl-but-3-en-1-ylamine hydrochloride (JO-1784) and 2-(4-morpholinoethyl 1-phenyl-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride (PRE-084) had no effect. 5 Following a 21-day treatment with (+)-pentazoeine there was a marked reduction in the number of neurons found per track. This decrease was not seen after chronic treatment with 4-IBP and may represent a depolarization block. 6 These results suggest a modulation of serotonergic neurotransmission by some sigma receptors and provide a potential mechanism for the 'antidepressant effects' reported and provide evidence toward sigma(1) ligands as potential antidepressants with a rapid onset of action.

Muscle contraction itself causes changes in many factors that could affect noradrenaline spillover. For instance, it has been reported that bradykinin is synthesized in skeletal muscle areas during contraction. Because the B-2 bradykinin receptor facilitates noradrenaline spillover, it may be involved in the increase associated with contraction. In this experiment, we studied the effect of bradykinin on noradrenaline spillover in the in situ canine gracilis muscle, using the specific B-2 antagonist HOE 140. The drug did not modify noradrenaline spillover at rest, but did cause a significant decrease during muscle contraction, from 558 to 181 pg.min(-1). As reported previously in the literature, fractional extraction of noradrenaline decreased during muscle contraction. This effect was independent of HOE 140 treatment. In light of our results, it seems that bradykinin formation during muscle contraction may play an important part in the observed increase in noradrenaline spillover but does not affect fractional extraction.

We have used a recently developed technique that exploits the differential time course of zif268 mRNA versus protein induction in neurons after sensory stimulation. Adult male rats were visually and acoustically deprived and then exposed to one of the following stimulation sequences: (i) no sensory stimulation; (ii) 2 h visual stimulation followed by 30 min auditory stimulation; (iii) 2 h auditory stimulation followed 30 min of visual stimulation; and (iv) 2 h compound visual and auditory stimulation. The neocortex and superior colliculus (SC) were then processed for fluorescent immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization for staining of Zif268 protein and mRNA products. We have found that activity patterns in primary visual and auditory cortices were in accord with the sequence of the compound stimulus. We also show that SC superficial layers contained a pool of exclusively unimodal neurons, similar to that of visual cortex. Activity patterns of deep SC layers contained multimodal neurons with varying degrees of visual and auditory convergence.

J	Brosseau-Lachaine, O; Faubert, J; Casanova, C				Brosseau-Lachaine, O; Faubert, J; Casanova, C			Functional sub-regions for optic flow processing in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex of the cat	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article							SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; CLARE-BISHOP NEURONS; LARGE-FIELD STIMULI; VISUAL-CORTEX; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; EXPANSION CONTRACTION; RESPONSE SELECTIVITY; SINGLE NEURONS; ROTATION CELLS	During locomotion, an observer sees a large and complex pattern of visual motion called optic flow. This phenomenon is characterized by elements in the environment accelerating and expanding as they move peripherally. In cats, previous studies have indicated that the posteromedial part of the lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) cortex may be involved in the processing of optic flow fields. We further addressed this issue by studying the importance of specific parameters of the optic flow patterns and investigating whether cell responses to these stimuli depend OR receptive field (RF) location in the visual field. Results can be summarized as follows: approximately two-thirds of PMLS cells responded to optic flow fields and a subset of these (84/153) showed a clear direction selectivity for motion along the frontal axis. Of these units, the majority responded preferentially to expansion rather than contraction of the pattern. Cells' responses depend on RF location in the visual field. For centrally located RFs, tested both when the origin of motion was within the RF or at the area centralis, responses were generally comparable whether or not size or speed gradients were removed from the optic flow pattern. A different tendency was observed for peripherally located RFs. In general, these cells exhibited a preferred direction almost exclusively when the origin of motion was placed at the area centralis, and neuronal discharges and direction selectivity for many of them were reduced when the optic flow cues were removed from the pattern. The results of this study suggest that there may be functional differences in response properties between PMLS cells located in the central and peripheral parts of the visual field that may reflect a specialization of the PMLS cortex in optic flow processing.

Recent studies have shown that developmental events can affect these processes. Pathways required for the induction of the ventral midline of the hypothalamus or for the differentiation of specific hypothalamic lineages have the potential of causing endocrine and metabolic disorders, including obesity. Also, some genes with paternal monoallelic expression are involved in the development of hypothalamic centers that are critical physiological regulators. Developmental defects affecting the hypothalamus might represent a more frequent cause of clinical disorders than previously suspected.

Design: Retrospective survey. Participants: 60 football and 70 soccer players reporting to 1998 fall training camp. Of these, 44 football and 52 soccer players returned a completed questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures: Based on self-reported symptoms, calculations were made to determine the number of concussions experienced during the previous season, the duration of symptoms, the time for return to play and any associated risk factors for concussions. Results: Of all the athletes who returned completed questionnaires, 34.1% of the football players and 46.2% of the soccer players had experienced symptoms of a concussion during the previous season. Only 16.7% of the concussed football players and 29.2% of the concussed soccer players realized they had suffered a concussion. All of the concussed football players and 75.0% of the concussed soccer players experienced more than one concussion during the season. The symptoms from the concussion lasted for at least 1 day in 28.6% of the football players and 18.1% of the soccer players. Variables that increased the odds of suffering a concussion during the previous season for football and soccer players included a past history of a recognized concussion. Conclusion: More university soccer players than football players may be experiencing sport related concussions. Variables that seem to increase the odds of suffering a concussion during the previous season for football and soccer players include a history of a recognized concussion. Despite being relatively common, many players may not recognize the symptoms of a concussion.

Although the mechanisms are unclear, overactivity of pro-nociceptive systems has been proposed to contribute to this phenomenon. We have reported that the development of morphine tolerance significantly increased calcitonin-gene-related-peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR) in primary sensory afferents of the spinal dorsal horn, suggesting that changes in pain-related neuropeptides in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons may be involved (Menard et al, 1996, J. Neurosci., 16, 2342-2351). Recently, we have shown that repeated morphine treatments induced increases in CGRP- and substance P (SP)-IR in cultured DRG, mimicking the in vivo effects (Ma et al., 2000, Neuroscience, 99, 529-539). In this study, we investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathways possibly involved in morphine-induced increases in CGRP- and SP-IR in DRG neurons. Repeated morphine exposure (10-20 muM) for 6 days increased the number of neurons expressing phosphorylated (p) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, Including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK) and P38 (pP38 MAPK). The number of neurons expressing phosphorylated cAMP responsive element binding protein (pCREB) was also markedly increased in morphine-exposed cultured DRG neurons. pERK-, pP38-, pJNK- and pCREB-IR were colocalized with CGRP-IR in cultured DRG neurons. Naloxone effectively blocked these actions of morphine, whereas a selective MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited the morphine-induced increase in the phosphorylation of ERK and CREB, and the expression of CGRP and SID. Moreover, in morphine-tolerant rats, the number of pCREB-, CGRP- and SP-IR neurons in the lumbar DRG was also significantly increased. These in vitro and in vivo data suggest that the phosphorylation of MAP kinases and CREB plays a role in the morphine-induced increase in spinal CGRP and SP levels in primary sensory afferents, contributing to the development of tolerance to opioid-induced analgesia.

Ten healthy subjects were scanned while they performed a task that required retrieval of specific aspects of visual information. In order to examine brain activity specifically associated with retrieval, we designed a task that had retrieval and control conditions that were perfectly matched in terms of depth of encoding, decision making and postretrieval monitoring and differed only in terms of whether retrieval was required. In the retrieval condition, based on an instructional cue, the subjects had to retrieve either the particular stimulus that was previously presented or its location. In the control condition, the cue did not instruct retrieval but shared with the instructional cues the function of alerting the subjects of the impending test phase. The comparison of activity between the retrieval and control conditions demonstrated a significant and selective increase in activity related to retrieval processes within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortical region, more specifically within area 47/12. These activity increases were bilateral but stronger in the right hemisphere. The present study by strictly controlling the level of encoding, postretrieval monitoring, and decision making has demonstrated a specific increase in the ventrolateral prefrontal region that could be clearly related to active retrieval processing, i.e. the active selection of particular stored visual representations.

This possibility was tested by applying rTMS to the left mid-dorso lateral frontal cortex (MDL-FC) and subsequently measuring functional connectivity of this region with positron emission tomography (PET) and TMS. The results showed a strong rTMS-related modulation of brain activity in the fronto-cingulate circuit. These results were confirmed in a parallel experiment in the rat using electrical stimulation and field-potential recordings. Future studies are needed to provide a direct link between the rTMS-induced modulation of cortical connectivity and its effects on specific behaviours.

The spine is the second most commonly affected site with PD. About one-third of patients with spinal involvement exhibit symptoms of clinical stenosis. In only 12-24% of patients with PD of the spine is back pain attributed solely to PD, while in the majority of patients back pain is either arthritic in nature or a combination of a pagetic process and coexisting arthritis. Neural element dysfunction may be attributed to compressive myelopathy by pagetic bone overgrowth, pagetic intraspinal soft tissue overgrowth, ossification of epidural fat, platybasia, spontaneous bleeding, sarcomatous degeneration and vertebral fracture or subluxation. Neural dysfunction can also result from spinal ischemia, when blood is diverted by the so-called "arterial steal syndrome". Because the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment for pagetic spinal stenosis has been clearly demonstrated, surgical decompression should only be instituted after failure of antipagetic medical treatment. Surgery is indicated as a primary treatment when neural compression is secondary to pathologic fractures, dislocations, spontaneous epidural hematoma, syringomyelia, platybasia, or sarcomatous transformation. Since, in the majority of cases with pagetic spinal involvement, there are also coexisting osteoarthritic changes, antipagetic medical treatment alone may be disappointing. Therefore, one must be careful before attributing low back pain to PD alone. Five classes of drugs are available for the treatment of PD: bisphosphonates, calcitonins, mithramycin (plicamycin), gallium nitrate, and ipriflavone. Bisphosphonates are the most popular, and several forms have been investigated, but only the following forms have been approved for clinical use: disodium etidronate, clodronate, aledronate, risedronate, neridronate, pamidronate, tiludronate, ibadronate, aminohydroxylbutylidene bisphosphonate, olpadronate, and zoledronate. Several of these forms are still under investigation.

Neuropeptides feature prominently in afferents underlying the central regulation of the V-P-releasing magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs). Although little is yet known of the circumstances under which peptides are released onto MNCs, previous studies have shown that a common response profile to exogenous peptide application is a slow excitation that seems to result from the activation of a nonselective cation conductance. In this paper we review the basis for the excitatory effects of angiotensin H, cholecystokinin, and neurotensin in MNCs acutely isolated from the supraoptic nucleus of adult rats. Saturating concentrations of these three peptides evoked nonadditive increases in macroscopic cation conductance. During single-channel recordings Ang II, CCK, and NT caused kinetically identical increases in the probability of opening of 35-pS nonselective cation channels. Patches containing only one channel further revealed that the activity of single channels could be regulated by separate applications of all three peptides. Peptide-stimulated channels were also found to be inactivated by increases in membrane stretch and to he blocked by low concentrations of gadolinium (Gd3+). It is concluded that many excitatory peptides depolarize MNCs by stimulating the stretch-inactivated cation channels underlying osmoreception. Convergent regulation of these channels provides a potentially powerful mechanism for integrating signals derived from the various afferents involved in the regulation of MNCs.

Mice have a single structural locus (named Eef1b2) spanning six exons, which is ubiquitously expressed and maps close to Casp8 on mouse chromosome 1, and a processed pseudogene. Humans have a single intron-containing locus, EEF1B2, which maps to 2q33, and an intronless paralogue expressed only in brain and muscle (EEF1B3). Another locus described previously, EEF1B1, is actually a processed pseudogene on chromosome 15 corresponding to an alternative splice form of EEF1B2. Our study illustrates the value of comparative mapping in distinguishing between processed pseudogenes and intronless paralogues.

Concentration of dopamine and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats. Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with erectile dysfunction in rats and may serve as a model to study erectile dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

In newborn pigs (1-2 days old), RBF (measured by microsphere) is autoregulated over a narrow range of perfusion pressure, whereas ChBF is not autoregulated. N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or specific nNOS inhibitors 7-nitroindazole, 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole, and 1-(2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)imidazole as well as ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, unveiled a ChBF autoregulation as observed in juvenile (4- to 6-wk old) animals, whereas autoregulation of RBF in the newborn was only enhanced by L-NAME. All NOS inhibitors and hexamethonium prevented the hypertension-induced increase, in NO mediator cGMP in the choroid. nNOS mRNA expression and activity were three- to fourfold higher in the choroid of newborn pigs than in tissues of juvenile pigs. It is concluded that increased production of NO from nNOS curtails ChBF autoregulation in the newborn and suggests a role for the autonomic nervous system in this important hemodynamic function, whereas, for RBF autoregulation, endothelial NOS seems to exert a more important contribution in limiting autoregulation.

To gain insight into the functional role of these two enzymes in the central nervous system, we examined their cellular and subcellular distribution in rat brain by using electron microscopic immunogold labeling. In all areas examined, EP24.15 and EP24.16 immunoreactivity were observed in selective subpopulations of neuronal and glial cells. Subcellular localization of EP24.15 in neurons revealed that this enzyme was predominantly concentrated in the nucleus, whereas EP24.16 was almost exclusively cytoplasmic. The amount of EP24.15 found in the nucleus was inversely correlated with that found in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the enzyme could be mobilized from one compartment to the other. Within the cytoplasm, EP24.15 and EP24.16 immunoreactivity showed comparable distributional patterns. Both enzymes were detected throughout perikarya and dendrites, as well as within axons and axon terminals. In all neuronal compartments, EP24.15 and EP24.16 showed a major association with membranes of neurosecretory elements, including Golgi cisternae, tubulovesicular organelles, synaptic vesicles, and endosomes. However, whereas EP24.15 always faced the cytoplasmic face of the membranes, EP24.16 was observed on both cytoplasmic and luminal sides, suggesting that the latter was more likely to contribute to the processing of peptides or to the degradation of internalized ligands. Taken together, the present results suggest that EP24.15 could play a major role in the hydrolysis of intranuclear substrates, whereas EP24.16 would be predominantly involved in the processing and inactivation of signaling peptides.

J	Breton, C; Di Scala-Guenot, D; Zingg, HH				Breton, C; Di Scala-Guenot, D; Zingg, HH			Oxytocin receptor gene expression in rat mammary gland: structural characterization and regulation	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID; STEROID TREATMENT; PITUITARY-GLAND; MILK EJECTION; LACTATING RAT; PARTURITION; MOUSE; LOCALIZATION; RELEASE; UTERUS	The differential, tissue-specific regulation of oxytocin (OT) binding sites allows the neurohypophysial nonapeptide OT to fulfill a dual role: to induce uterine contractions at parturition and to mediate milk ejection during lactation. Whereas uterine OT binding sites are up-regulated prior to parturition and are rapidly down-regulated thereafter, mammary gland OT binding sites gradually throughout gestation and remain up-regulated during the ensuing lactation period. Here, we structurally characterized OT receptor (OTR) mRNA in mammary gland and analyzed its expression during gestation and lactation and in response to steroid treatment. In mammary gland tissues, we found a 6.7 and a 5.4kb OTR mRNA species, and both species were further analyzed by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The 6.7 kb mRNA was found to be common to mammary gland and uterus and to extend 618 nucleotides beyond the published sequence of the rat OTR gene. The 5.4 kb mRNA species is unique to the mammary gland and terminates at a mammary gland-specific polyadenylation site that is not preceded by a classical polyadenylation signal. RT-PCR analysis did not provide any evidence for differences in the coding regions, suggesting that both uterine and mammary gland OTR mRNAs encode the same receptor protein. Furthermore, primer extension experiments showed that no differences exist in the specific transcriptional initiation sites of the OTR gene in the two tissues. During pregnancy, OTR mRNA per mammary gland increased approximately 150-fold and remained high during lactation, consistent with the previously identified regulation of OT binding sites and the role of OT during lactation. Whereas estrogen administration strongly induced the uterine OTR mRNA levels (>5-fold), mammary gland remained unaffected by steroid treatment. Moreover, tamoxifen had no effect on the mammary gland OTR mRNA level. In summary, our data demonstrate a differential control of OTR expression in uterus versus mammary gland and a mammary gland-specific OTR mRNA polyadenylation site. However, this differential control apparently does not involve the expression of different receptor genes nor the utilization of tissue-specific transcriptional initiation sites.
