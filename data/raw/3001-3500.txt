In MS, the exact role of microglia remains unknown. On one hand, they can present antigens, skew T cell responses, and upregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules. On the other hand, microglia may express anti-inflammatory molecules and inhibit inflammation. Microglia express a wide variety of immune receptors such as nod-like receptors (NLRs). NLRs are intracellular receptors capable of regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Among NLRs, Nlrp12 is largely expressed in cells of myeloid origins. It plays a role in immune inflammatory responses by negatively regulating the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that Nlrp12 suppresses inflammation and ameliorates the course of MS. Methods: We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a well-characterized mouse model of MS. EAE was induced in wild-type (WT) and Nlrp12(-/-) mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG): complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA). The spinal cords of healthy and immunized mice were extracted for immunofluorescence and pro-inflammatory gene analysis. Primary murine cortical microglia cell cultures of WT and Nlrp12(-/-) were prepared with cortices of 1-day-old pups. The cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and analyzed for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes as well as pro-inflammatory molecule secretions. Results: Over the course of 9 weeks, the Nlrp12(-/-) mice demonstrated increased severity in the disease state, where they developed the disease earlier and reached significantly higher clinical scores compared to the WT mice. The spinal cords of immunized WT mice relative to healthy WT mice revealed a significant increase in Nlrp12 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression at 1, 3, and 5 weeks post injection. A significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes Ccr5, Cox2, and IL-1 beta was found in the spinal cords of the Nlrp12(-/-) mice relative to the WT mice (P < 0.05). A significant increase in the level of gliosis was observed in the spinal cords of the Nlrp12(-/-) mice compared to the WT mice after 9 weeks of disease (P < 0.05). Primary Nlrp12(-/-) microglia cells demonstrated a significant increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression (P < 0.05) and secreted significantly (P < 0.05) more tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nitric oxide (NO). Conclusion: Nlrp12 plays a protective role by suppressing inflammation during the development of EAE. The absence of Nlrp12 results in an increased inflammatory response.

How native-like can you possibly get: fMRI evidence for processing accent	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						accent; bilingual; second language acquisition; brain; insula	FOREIGN ACCENT; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SPEECH PRODUCTION; LANGUAGE CONTROL; 2ND-LANGUAGE; INSULA; BRAIN; MEMORY; DISCRIMINATION; IDENTIFICATION	Introduction: If ever attained, adopting native-like accent is achieved late in the learning process. Resemblance between L2 and mother tongue can facilitate L2 learning. In particular, cognates (phonologically and semantically similar words across languages), offer the opportunity to examine the issue of foreign accent in quite a unique manner. Methods: Twelve Spanish speaking (L1) adults learnt French (L2) cognates and practiced their native-like pronunciation by means of a computerized method. After consolidation, they were tested on L1 and L2 oral picture- naming during fMRI scanning. Results and Discussion: The results of the present study show that there is a specific impact of accent on brain activation, even if L2 words are cognates, and belong to a pair of closely related languages. Results point that the insula is a key component of accent processing, which is in line with reports from patients with foreign accent syndrome following damage to the insula (e.g., Katz et al., 2012; Moreno-Torres et al., 2013; Tomasino et at, 2013), and healthy L2 learners (Ghee et al., 2004). Thus, the left insula has been consistently related to the integration of attentional and working memory abilities, together with fine-tuning of motor programming to achieve optimal articulation.

The effect of sung speech on socio-communicative responsiveness in children with autism spectrum disorders	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism; socio-communicative responsiveness; song; joint attention; eye contact	SINGLE-SUBJECT RESEARCH; MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; JOINT ATTENTION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; MUSIC-THERAPY; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; INTERVENTION; IMITATION; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS	There is emerging evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of music based interventions for improving social functioning in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). While this evidence lends some support in favor of using song over spoken directives in facilitating engagement and receptive intervention in ASD, there has been little research that has investigated the efficacy of such stimuli on socio-communicative responsiveness measures. Here, we present preliminary results from a pilot study which tested whether sung instruction, as compared to spoken directives, could elicit greater number of socio-communicative behaviors in young children with ASD. Using an adapted single-subject design, three children between the ages of 3 and 4 years, participated in a programme consisting of 18 sessions, of which 9 were delivered with spoken directives and 9 with sung. Sessions were counterbalanced and randomized for three play activities - block matching, picture matching and clay play. All sessions were video-recorded for post-hoc observational coding of three behavioral metrics which included performance, frequency of social gesture and eye contact. Analysis of the videos by two independent raters indicated increased socio-communicative responsiveness in terms of frequency of social gesture as well as eye contact during sung compared to spoken conditions, across all participants. Our findings suggest that sung directives may play a useful role in engaging children with ASD and also serve as an effective interventional medium to enhance socio-communicative responsiveness.

J	Kang, JI; Huppe-Gourgues, F; Vaucher, E				Kang, Jun-Il; Huppe-Gourgues, Frederic; Vaucher, Elvire			Pharmacological Mechanisms of Cortical Enhancement Induced by the Repetitive Pairing of Visual/Cholinergic Stimulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX	Repetitive visual training paired with electrical activation of cholinergic projections to the primary visual cortex (V1) induces long-term enhancement of cortical processing in response to the visual training stimulus. To better determine the receptor subtypes mediating this effect the selective pharmacological blockade of V1 nicotinic (nAChR), M1 and M2 muscarinic (mAChR) or GABAergic A (GABAAR) receptors was performed during the training session and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded before and after training. The training session consisted of the exposure of awake, adult rats to an orientation-specific 0.12 CPD grating paired with an electrical stimulation of the basal forebrain for a duration of 1 week for 10 minutes per day. Pharmacological agents were infused intracortically during this period. The post-training VEP amplitude was significantly increased compared to the pre-training values for the trained spatial frequency and to adjacent spatial frequencies up to 0.3 CPD, suggesting a long-term increase of V1 sensitivity. This increase was totally blocked by the nAChR antagonist as well as by an M2 mAChR subtype and GABAAR antagonist. Moreover, administration of the M2 mAChR antagonist also significantly decreased the amplitude of the control VEPs, suggesting a suppressive effect on cortical responsiveness. However, the M1 mAChR antagonist blocked the increase of the VEP amplitude only for the high spatial frequency (0.3 CPD), suggesting that M1 role was limited to the spread of the enhancement effect to a higher spatial frequency. More generally, all the drugs used did block the VEP increase at 0.3 CPD. Further, use of each of the aforementioned receptor antagonists blocked training-induced changes in gamma and beta band oscillations. These findings demonstrate that visual training coupled with cholinergic stimulation improved perceptual sensitivity by enhancing cortical responsiveness in V1. This enhancement is mainly mediated by nAChRs, M2 mAChRs and GABA(A)Rs. The M1 mAChR subtype appears to be involved in spreading the enhancement of V1 cortical responsiveness to adjacent neurons.

This explains why gait analysis is important and increasingly used nowadays for the diagnosis of many different types (neurological, muscular, orthopedic, etc.) of diseases. This paper introduces a novel method to quickly visualize the different parts of the body related to an asymmetric movement in the human gait of a patient for daily clinical usage. The proposed gait analysis algorithm relies on the fact that the healthy walk has (temporally shift-invariant) symmetry properties in the coronal plane. The goal is to provide an inexpensive and easy-to-use method, exploiting an affordable consumer depth sensor, the Kinect, to measure the gait asymmetry and display results in a perceptual way. Method: We propose a multi-dimensional scaling mapping using a temporally shift invariant distance, allowing us to efficiently visualize (in terms of perceptual color difference) the asymmetric body parts of the gait cycle of a subject. We also propose an index computed from this map and which quantifies locally and globally the degree of asymmetry. Results: The proposed index is proved to be statistically significant and this new, inexpensive, marker-less, non-invasive, easy to set up, gait analysis system offers a readable and flexible tool for clinicians to analyze gait characteristics and to provide a fast diagnostic. Conclusion: This system, which estimates a perceptual color map providing a quick overview of asymmetry existing in the gait cycle of a subject, can be easily exploited for disease progression, recovery cues from post-operative surgery (e.g., to check the healing process or the effect of a treatment or a prosthesis) or might be used for other pathologies where gait asymmetry might be a symptom.

Soluble A beta 42 oligomers are highly toxic and contribute to progressive neuronal dysfunction, loss of synaptic spine density, and affect long-term potentiation (LTP). We have characterized a short, L-amino acid A beta-oligomer Interacting Peptide (AIP) that targets a relatively well-defined population of low-n A beta 42 oligomers, rather than simply inhibiting the aggregation of A beta monomers into oligomers. Our data show that AIP diminishes the loss of A beta 42-induced synaptic spine density and rescues LTP in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Notably, the AIP enantiomer (comprised of D-amino acids) attenuated the rough-eye phenotype in a transgenic A beta 42 fly model and significantly improved the function of photoreceptors of these flies in electroretinography tests. Overall, our results indicate that specifically "trapping" low-n oligomers provides a novel strategy for toxic A beta 42-oligomer recognition and removal.

MACROPHAGE AND MICROGLIAL PLASTICITY IN THE INJURED SPINAL CORD	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						microglia; macrophage; spinal cord injury; macrophage activation; phagocytosis; tumor necrosis factor	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; ADULT-MOUSE BRAIN; PROTEIN-KINASE 2; RESIDENT MICROGLIA; IN-VIVO; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SECONDARY DAMAGE; CONTUSION INJURY; ANALYSIS REVEALS	Macrophages in the injured spinal cord arise from resident microglia and from infiltrating peripheral myeloid cells. Microglia respond within minutes after central nervous system (CNS) injury and along with other CNS cells signal the influx of their peripheral counterpart. Although some of the functions they carry out are similar, they appear to be specialized to perform particular roles after CNS injury. Microglia and macrophages are very plastic cells that can change their phenotype drastically in response to in vitro and in vivo conditions. They can change from proinflammatory, cytotoxic cells to anti-inflammatory, prorepair phenotypes. The microenvironment of the injured CNS importantly influences macrophage plasticity. This review discusses the phagocytosis and cytokine-mediated effects on macrophage plasticity in the context of spinal cord injury. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This development is particularly evident for the cerebral cortical areas and the transformation of the use of the upper limbs from a purely locomotor function to one including, or restricted to, reaching and grasping. This study addresses the issue of whether the control of reaching has involved the development of new cortical circuits or whether the same neurons are used to control both locomotion and reaching. We recorded the activity of pyramidal tract neurons in the motor cortex of the cat both during voluntary gait modifications and during reaching. All cells showed generally similar patterns of activity in both tasks. More specifically, we showed that, in many cases, cells maintained a constant temporal relationship to the activity of synergistic muscle groups in each task. In addition, in some cells the relationship between the intensity of the cell discharge activity and the magnitude of the EMG activity was equally constant during gait modifications and reaching. As such, the results are compatible with the hypothesis that the corticospinal circuits used to control reaching evolved from those used to precisely modify gait.

Asymmetric Interhemispheric Transfer in the Auditory Network: Evidence from TMS, Resting-State fMRI, and Diffusion Imaging	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						callosal auditory fibers; interleaved silent steady state; probabilistic tractography; resting-state fMRI; theta burst stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; HUMAN BRAIN	Hemispheric asymmetries in human auditory cortical function and structure are still highly debated. Brain stimulation approaches can complement correlational techniques by uncovering causal influences. Previous studies have shown asymmetrical effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on task performance, but it is unclear whether these effects are task-specific or reflect intrinsic network properties. To test how modulation of auditory cortex (AC) influences functional networks and whether this influence is asymmetrical, the present study measured resting-state fMRI connectivity networks in 17 healthy volunteers before and immediately after TMS (continuous theta burst stimulation) to the left or right AC, and the vertex as a control. We also examined the relationship between TMS-induced interhemispheric signal propagation and anatomical properties of callosal auditory fibers as measured with diffusion-weighted MRI. We found that TMS to the right AC, but not the left, resulted in widespread connectivity decreases in auditory-and motor-related networks in the resting state. Individual differences in the degree of change in functional connectivity between auditory cortices after TMS applied over the right AC were negatively related to the volume of callosal auditory fibers. The findings show that TMS-induced network modulation occurs, even in the absence of an explicit task, and that the magnitude of the effect differs across individuals as a function of callosal structure, supporting a role for the corpus callosum in mediating functional asymmetry. The findings support theoretical models emphasizing hemispheric differences in network organization and are of practical significance in showing that brain stimulation studies need to take network-level effects into account.

Maternal sensitivity, infant limbic structure volume and functional connectivity: a preliminary study	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; PARENTAL BONDING INSTRUMENT; ADULT ATTACHMENT INTERVIEW; EARLY-LIFE STRESS; CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; INSECURE ATTACHMENT; EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR; SALIVARY CORTISOL	Mechanisms underlying the profound parental effects on cognitive, emotional and social development in humans remain poorly understood. Studies with nonhuman models suggest variations in parental care affect the limbic system, influential to learning, autobiography and emotional regulation. In some research, nonoptimal care relates to decreases in neurogenesis, although other work suggests early-postnatal social adversity accelerates the maturation of limbic structures associated with emotional learning. We explored whether maternal sensitivity predicts human limbic system development and functional connectivity patterns in a small sample of human infants. When infants were 6 months of age, 20 mother-infant dyads attended a laboratory-based observational session and the infants underwent neuroimaging at the same age. After considering age at imaging, household income and postnatal maternal anxiety, regression analyses demonstrated significant indirect associations between maternal sensitivity and bilateral hippocampal volume at six months, with the majority of associations between sensitivity and the amygdala demonstrating similar indirect, but not significant results. Moreover, functional analyses revealed direct associations between maternal sensitivity and connectivity between the hippocampus and areas important for emotional regulation and socio-emotional functioning. Sensitivity additionally predicted indirect associations between limbic structures and regions related to autobiographical memory. Our volumetric results are consistent with research indicating accelerated limbic development in response to early social adversity, and in combination with our functional results, if replicated in a larger sample, may suggest that subtle, but important, variations in maternal care influence neuroanatomical trajectories important to future cognitive and emotional functioning.

Indeed, their position within the lateral motor columns (LMC) correlates with axonal trajectories and identity of target limb muscles. The mechanisms by which this topographic distribution is established remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we assessed the role of ephrinB2 in MN topographic organization in the developing mouse spinal cord. Results: First, we used a reporter mouse line to establish the spatio-temporal expression pattern of EfnB2 in the developing LMC. We show that early in LMC development, ephrinB2 is differentially expressed in MN of the lateral versus medial LMC, suggesting a possible role in MN sorting and/or migration. We demonstrate that while MN-specific excision of EfnB2 did not perturb specification or migration of MN, conditional loss of ephrinB2 led to the blurring of the LMC divisional boundary and to errors in the selection of LMC axon trajectory in the limb. Conclusions: Altogether, our study uncovered a novel cell autonomous role for ephrinB2 in LMC MN thus emphasizing the prevalent role of this ephrin member in maintaining cell population boundaries.

Effects of social context and individual empathic ability on ambiguity resolution during utterance comprehension	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						social status; pragmatics; referential ambiguity; directly-quoted utterance; pronoun resolution; ERP	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PRAGMATIC CONSTRAINTS; FUNCTIONING AUTISM; TRAIT INFERENCES; PERSPECTIVE; ERP; DOMAINS; SPEAKER	Verbal communication is often ambiguous. By employing the event related potential (ERP) technique, this study investigated how a comprehender resolves referential ambiguity by using information concerning the social status of communicators. Participants read a conversational scenario which included a minimal conversational context describing a speaker and two other persons of the same or different social status and a directly quoted utterance. A singular, second-person pronoun in the respectful form (nin/nin-de in Chinese) in the utterance could be ambiguous with respect to which of the two persons was the addressee (the "Ambiguous condition"). Alternatively, the pronoun was not ambiguous either because one of the two persons was of higher social status and hence should be the addressee according to social convention (the "Status condition") or because a word referring to the status of a person was additionally inserted before the pronoun to help indicate the referent of the pronoun (the "Referent condition"). Results showed that the perceived ambiguity decreased over the Ambiguous, Status, and Referent conditions. Electrophysiologically, the pronoun elicited an increased N400 in the Referent than in the Status and the Ambiguous conditions, reflecting an increased integration demand due to the necessity of linking the pronoun to both its antecedent and the status word. Relative to the Referent condition, a late, sustained positivity was elicited for the Status condition starting from 600 ms, while a more delayed, anterior negativity was elicited for the Ambiguous condition. Moreover, the N400 effect was modulated by individuals' sensitivity to the social status information, while the late positivity effect was modulated by individuals' empathic ability. These findings highlight the neurocognitive flexibility of contextual bias in referential processing during utterance comprehension.

Since their discovery in 1999, over 120 proteins have been described to be localized to these structures (in 154 publications). Most of these components are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or are involved in RNA metabolism and translation. SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or the rate of disease progression. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS. We propose that TDP-43 and FUS serve as an interface between genetic susceptibility and environmental stress exposure in disease pathogenesis. Here, we will discuss the role of TDP-43 and FUS in SG dynamics and how disease-linked mutations affect this process.

The experimental power of in vitro neuronal cultures to assay this process and its molecular mechanisms is well established, however, a method to rapidly find and quantify multiple morphological aspects of GCs is lacking. To this end, we have developed a free, easy to use, and fully automated Fiji macro, Conographer, which accurately identifies and measures many morphological parameters of GCs in 2D explant culture images. These measurements are then subjected to principle component analysis and k-means clustering to mathematically classify the GCs as "collapsed" or "extended". The morphological parameters measured for each GC are found to be significantly different between collapsed and extended GCs, and are sufficient to classify GCs as such with the same level of accuracy as human observers. Application of a known collapse-inducing ligand results in significant changes in all parameters, resulting in an increase in 'collapsed' GCs determined by k-means clustering, as expected. Our strategy provides a powerful tool for exploring the relationship between GC morphology and guidance cue signaling, which in particular will greatly facilitate high-throughput studies of the effects of drugs, gene silencing or overexpression, or any other experimental manipulation in the context of an in vitro axon guidance assay.

However, side effects associated with medication or studying psychiatric groups may confound the relationship between dopamine and cognitive control. To circumvent such possibilities, we utilized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design wherein participants were administered a nutritionally-balanced amino acid mixture (BAL) and an amino acid mixture deficient in the dopamine precursors tyrosine (TYR) and phenylalanine (PHE) on two separate occasions. Order of sessions was randomly assigned. Cognitive control and performance monitoring were assessed using response times (RT), error rates, the N450, an event-related potential (ERP) index of conflict monitoring, the conflict slow potential (conflict SP), an ERP index of conflict resolution, and the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe), ERPs associated with performance monitoring. Participants were twelve males who completed a Stroop color-word task while ERPs were collected four hours following acute PHE and TYR depletion (APTD) or balanced (BAL) mixture ingestion in two separate sessions. N450 and conflict SP ERP amplitudes significantly differentiated congruent from incongruent trials, but did not differ as a function of APTD or BAL mixture ingestion. Similarly, ERN and Pe amplitudes showed significant differences between error and correct trials that were not different between APTD and BAL conditions. Findings indicate that acute dopamine precursor depletion does not significantly alter cognitive control and performance monitoring ERPs. Current results do not preclude the role of dopamine in these processes, but suggest that multiple methods for dopamine-related hypothesis testing are needed.

Parallel sparse and dense information coding streams in the electrosensory midbrain	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Weakly electric fish; Midbrain; Sparseness; Neural code	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; DIRECTIONAL SELECTIVITY; TORUS SEMICIRCULARIS; IN-VIVO; NEURONS; ENVELOPES; PERSPECTIVES; INHIBITION; PERCEPTION	Efficient processing of incoming sensory information is critical for an organism's survival. It has been widely observed across systems and species that the representation of sensory information changes across successive brain areas. Indeed, peripheral sensory neurons tend to respond densely to a broad range of sensory stimuli while more central neurons tend to instead respond sparsely to a narrow range of stimuli. Such a transition might be advantageous as sparse neural codes are thought to be metabolically efficient and optimize coding efficiency. Here we investigated whether the neural code transitions from dense to sparse within the midbrain Torus semicircularis (TS) of weakly electric fish. Confirming previous results, we found both dense and sparse coding neurons. However, subsequent histological classification revealed that most dense neurons projected to higher brain areas. Our results thus provide strong evidence against the hypothesis that the neural code transitions from dense to sparse in the electrosensory system. Rather, they support the alternative hypothesis that higher brain areas receive parallel streams of dense and sparse coded information from the electrosensory midbrain. We discuss the implications and possible advantages of such a coding strategy and argue that it is a general feature of sensory processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We present a patient with recurrent GBM who achieved a prolonged response to treatment with afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, plus temozolomide. A 58-year-old female patient was diagnosed with multifocal primary GBM. After surgical resection, first-line therapy comprised radiotherapy and temozolomide. Following disease progression after 3 temozolomide cycles, the patient entered a phase I/II clinical trial of afatinib (20-40 mg daily for 28 days) plus temozolomide (50 mg/m(2) every 21/28 days). Next-generation sequencing analysis of the brain tumor specimen was performed. At the last assessment, 63 treatment cycles had been completed and the patient had survived for similar to 5 years since recurrence. Significant disease regression was observed after 5 cycles and was maintained during long-term follow-up. Adverse events were consistent with the known tolerability profile of afatinib and were managed by treatment interruption/dose reduction. The patient had several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) aberrations, including gene amplification and EGFRvIII positivity. Three somatic mutations were identified, including an unprecedented extracellular-domain substitution (D247Y). The patient has survived similar to 6-fold longer than normally expected in patients with recurrent GBM. The complex EGFR genotype may underlie sustained response to afatinib plus temozolomide.

While mounting evidence indicates altered peripheral and central inflammatory profiles in depressed patients and suicide completers, little is known about how peripheral and central inflammation might be linked in these contexts. The choroid plexus (ChP), a highly vascularized tissue that produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lacks a blood brain barrier, is an interface between peripheral and central immune responses. In the present study, we investigated the cellular and molecular inflammatory profile of the ChP of the lateral ventricle in depressed suicides and psychiatrically healthy controls. Gene expression of macrophages, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and various factors implicated in immune cell trafficking were measured; and density of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 -positive (lba1+) macrophages associated with the ChP epithelial cell layer (ECL) was examined. Significant downregulations of the genes encoding interleukin 1 beta (1L1 beta), a pro-inflammatory acute-phase protein; intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), a protein implicated in immune cell trafficking in the ChP; and IBA- 1, a monocyte/macrophage marker; were detected in depressed suicides as compared to controls. No difference in the density of lba1+ macrophages associated with the ChP ECL was observed. While interpretation of these findings is challenging in the absence of corroborating data from the CSF, peripheral blood, or brain parenchyma of the present cohort, we hypothesize that the present findings reflect a ChP compensatory mechanism that attenuates the detrimental effects of chronically altered pro inflammatory signaling caused by elevated levels of pro inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 beta, peripherally and/or centrally. Together, these findings further implicate neuroimmune processes in the etiology of depression and suicide.

Design, Synthesis, and Properties of Phosphoramidate 2 ',5 '-Linked Branched RNA: Toward the Rational Design of Inhibitors of the RNA Lariat Debranching Enzyme	JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; TDP-43; OLIGORIBONUCLEOTIDES; SPLICEOSOME; DISEASE; ANALOGS	Two RNA fragments linked by means of a 2',5' phosphodiester bridge (2' hydroxyl of one fragment connected to the 5' hydroxyl of the other) constitute a class of nucleic acids known as branched RNAs (bRNAs). In this report we show that bRNA analogues containing 2',5' phosphoramidate linkages (bN-RNAs) inhibit the lariat debranching enzyme, a 2',5'-phosphodiesterase that has recently been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. bN-RNAs were efficiently generated using automated solid-phase synthesis and suitably protected branchpoint building blocks. Two orthogonally removable groups, namely the 4-monomethoxytrityl (MMTr) group and the fluorenylmethyl-oxycarbonyl (Fmoc) groups, were evaluated as protecting groups of the 2' amino functionality. The 2'-N-Fmoc methodology was found to successfully produce bN-RNAs on solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. The synthesized bN-RNAs resisted hydrolysis by the lariat debranching enzyme (Dbr1) and, in addition, were shown to attenuate the Dbr1-mediated hydrolysis of native bRNA.

Despite significant advances in understanding the pathology, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immune-mediated neuropathies remain elusive. T lymphocytes definitely play an important role in disease pathogenesis and CD4(+) T cells have been the main area of research for decades. This is partly due to the fact that the most frequent animal model to study autoimmune peripheral neuropathy is experimental allergic neuritis (FAN). As it is induced commonly by immunization with peripheral nerve proteins, FAN is driven mainly by CD4(+) T cells. However, similarly to what has been reported for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, a significant body of evidence indicates that CD8(+) T cells may play a pathogenic role in GBS and CIDP disease development and/or progression. Here, we summarize clinical studies pertaining to the presence and potential role of CD8(+) T cells in autoimmune peripheral neuropathies. We also discuss the findings from our most recent studies using a transgenic mouse line (L31 mice) in which the T cell co-stimulator molecule B7.2 (CD86) is constitutively expressed in antigen presenting cells of the nervous tissues. L31 mice spontaneously develop peripheral neuropathy, and CD8(+) T cells are found accumulating in peripheral nerves of symptomatic animals. Interestingly, depletion of CD4(+) T cells accelerates disease onset and increases disease prevalence. Finally, we point out some unanswered questions for future research to dissect the critical roles of CD8(+) T cells in autoimmune peripheral neuropathies.

Most meQTLs influence methylation of a few CpG dinucleotides within short genomic regions (<3 kb). Here, we identified a layered genetic control of DNA methylation at numerous CpGs across a long 300 kb genomic region. This control involved a single long-range meQTL and multiple local meQTLs. The long-range meQTL explained up to 75% of variance in methylation of CpGs located over extended areas of the 300 kb region. The meQTL was identified in four samples (P = 2.8 x 10(-17), 3.1 x 10(-31), 4.0 x 10(-71) and 5.2 x 10(-199)), comprising a total of 2796 individuals. The long-range meQTL was strongly associated not only with DNA methylation but also with mRNA expression of several genes within the 300 kb region (P = 7.1 x 10(-18)-1.0 x 10(-123)). The associations of the meQTL with gene expression became attenuated when adjusted for DNA methylation (causal inference test: P = 2.4 x 10(-13)-7.1 x 10(-20)), indicating coordinated regulation of DNA methylation and gene expression. Further, the long-range meQTL was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with the most replicated locus of multiple sclerosis, a disease affecting primarily the brain white matter. In middle-aged adults free of the disease, we observed that the risk allele was associated with subtle structural properties of the brain white matter found in multiple sclerosis (P = 0.02). In summary, we identified a long-range meQTL that controls methylation and expression of several genes and may be involved in increasing brain vulnerability to multiple sclerosis.

However, while some of these methods assume a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for the underlying noise, its real distribution is known to be non-Gaussian and to depend on many factors such as the number of coils and the methodology used to combine multichannel MRI signals. Indeed, the two prevailing methods for multichannel signal combination lead to noise patterns better described by Rician and noncentral Chi distributions. Here we develop a Robust and Unbiased Model-BAsed Spherical Deconvolution (RUMBA-SD) technique, intended to deal with realistic MRI noise, based on a Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm adapted to Rician and noncentral Chi likelihood models. To quantify the benefits of using proper noise models, RUMBA-SD was compared with dRL-SD, a well-established method based on the RL algorithm for Gaussian noise. Another aim of the study was to quantify the impact of including a total variation (TV) spatial regularization term in the estimation framework. To do this, we developed TV spatially-regularized versions of both RUMBA-SD and dRL-SD algorithms. The evaluation was performed by comparing various quality metrics on 132 three-dimensional synthetic phantoms involving different inter-fiber angles and volume fractions, which were contaminated with noise mimicking patterns generated by data processing in multichannel scanners. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of proper likelihood models leads to an increased ability to resolve fiber crossings with smaller inter-fiber angles and to better detect non-dominant fibers. The inclusion of TV regularization dramatically improved the resolution power of both techniques. The above findings were also verified in human brain data.

Sleep-Wake Disturbances and Fatigue after Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review of the Literature	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Review						childhood; fatigue; sleep; systematic review; traumatic brain injury	MINOR HEAD-INJURY; SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; RISK-FACTORS; POSTCONCUSSIVE SYMPTOMS; BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; SOCIAL COMPETENCE; REFERRAL CENTER; YOUNG-CHILDREN	Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequently reported and can persist several years post-injury. The adult literature covering this topic is exhaustive; numerous robust studies using objective measures of sleep and advanced methodologies support the presence of SWD post-TBI. Despite being the leading cause of morbidity in children and adolescents, however, relatively few studies exist investigating SWD and symptoms of fatigue after pediatric TBI. We undertook a systematic search of the literature in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases with the aim of documenting persistent fatigue and SWD after pediatric TBI. Terms and keywords pertaining to TBI, children/adolescents, and sleep/fatigue were used, and of the 461 articles initially identified, 24 studies met our inclusion criteria. According to the results of the literature search, SWD and fatigue are common after pediatric TBI. The methodologies used in the studies reported varied widely, however, and were mainly subjective (e.g., questionnaires and interviews with caregivers). Moreover, no study targeted preschool children despite the fact that there is evidence regarding the critical importance of sleep for appropriate cognitive development, especially in high-order cognitive functioning. In sum, the results of the studies analyzed were consistent with the presence of SWD and fatigue after pediatric TBI, but there is a lack of information concerning this relationship in younger children. The use of more objective measures, such as actigraphy, could bring better insight to the impact of TBI on the quality of children's sleep.

Objective: The present study aimed at verifying the criterion-related validity of the Montreal-Toulouse Language Assessment Battery - Brazilian version (MTL-BR) by assessing its ability to discriminate between individuals with unilateral brain damage with and without aphasia. Methods: The investigation was carried out in a Brazilian community-based sample of 104 adults, divided into four groups: 26 participants with left hemisphere damage (LHD) with aphasia, 25 participants with right hemisphere damage (RHD), 28 with LHD non-aphasic, and 25 healthy adults. Results: There were significant differences between patients with aphasia and the other groups on most total and subtotal scores on MTL-BR tasks. Conclusions: The results showed strong criterion-related validity evidence for the MTL-BR Battery, and provided important information regarding hemispheric specialization and interhemispheric cooperation. Future research is required to search for additional evidence of sensitivity, specificity and validity of the MTL-BR in samples with different types of aphasia and degrees of language impairment.

Here we introduce a "linear" TMS mapping approach based on the individual shape of the central sulcus to obtain mediolateral corticomotor excitability profiles of the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscles. In thirteen young volunteers, we used stereotactic neuronavigation to stimulate the right M1(HAND) with a small eight-shaped coil at 120% of FDI resting motor threshold. We pseudorandomly stimulated six targets located on a straight mediolateral line corresponding to the overall orientation of the central sulcus with a fixed coil orientation of 45 degrees to the mid-sagittal line (STRAIGHT-45(FIX)(0)) or seven targets in the posterior part of the crown of the central sulcus following the bending of the central sulcus (CURVED). CURVED mapping employed a fixed (CURVED-45(FIX)(0)) or flexible coil orientation producing always a current perpendicular to the sulcal wall (CURVED-90(FLEX)(0)). During relaxation, CURVED but not STRAIGHT mapping revealed distinct corticomotor excitability peaks in M1(HAND) with the excitability maximum of ADM located medially to the FDI maximum. This mediolateral somatotopy was still present during tonic contraction of the ADM or FDI. During ADM contraction, cross-correlation between the spatial excitability profiles of ADM and FDI was lowest for CURVED-90(FLEX)(0). Together, the results show that within-M1(HAND) somatotopy can be readily probed with linear TMS mapping aligned to the sulcal shape. Sulcus-aligned linear mapping will benefit non-invasive studies of representational plasticity in human M1(HAND). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We investigated 222 PA and report increased aneuploidy in older patients. Aneuploid genomes were identified in 45% of adult compared with 17% of pediatric PA. Gains were non-random, favoring chromosomes 5, 7, 6 and 11 in order of frequency, and preferentially affecting non-cerebellar PA and tumors with BRAF V600E mutations and not with KIAA1549-BRAF fusions or FGFR1 mutations. Aneuploid PA differentially expressed genes involved in CNS development, the unfolded protein response, and regulators of genomic stability and the cell cycle (MDM2, PLK2), whose correlated programs were overexpressed specifically in aneuploid PA compared to other glial tumors. Thus, convergence of pathways affecting the cell cycle and genomic stability may favor aneuploidy in PA, possibly representing an additional molecular driver in older patients with this brain tumor.

An increase in KOC2 (SLC12A5) Cl transporter activity drives the developmental GABA excitatory-inhibitory sequence, but the role of KCC2 in human NDs is essentially unknown. Here, we report two rare, non-synonymous (NS), functionally-impairing variants in the KCC2 C-terminal regulatory domain (GIRD) in human ASD (R952H and R1049C) and SCZ (R952H) previously linked with IGE and familial febrile seizures, and another novel NS KCC2 variant in ASD (R1048W) with highly-predicted pathogenicity. Exome data from 2517 simplex families in the ASD Simon Simplex Collection (SSC) revealed significantly more KCC2 GIRD variants in ASD cases than controls, and interestingly, these were more often synonymous and predicted to disrupt or introduce a CpG site Furthermore, full gene analysis showed ASD cases are more likely to contain rare KCC2 variants affecting CpG sites than controls. These data suggest genetically-encoded dysregulation of KCC2-dependent GABA signaling may contribute to multiple human NDs.

Investigators often use translated research instruments to guide their inquiry in disparate geographic locations. Present-day hypnosis researchers rely heavily on two primary scales that are more than half a century old: the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form C (SHSS:C) (Weitzenhoffer & Hilgard, 1959) and the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility: Form A (HGSHS:A) (Shor & Orne, 1962). Scholars typically translate these scales to measure hypnotizability transculturally. This approach, however, operates under the specious assumption that the concept of hypnotizability is largely monolithic or universal across cultures. Whereas translations likely conserve the linguistic content, they may arguably imply different cultural meanings and historical subtexts. Whereas social scientists acknowledge the importance of qualitative and phenomenological accounts in the study of altered consciousness, including suggestibility, researchers interested in hypnotizability consider the impact of findings from anthropology and ethnography too little. Clinicians and scholars of hypnosis would stand to benefit from incorporating the insights afforded by transcultural research in the overarching investigation of a concept as nuanced as hypnotizability.

While the pathophysiology of PD is complex and goes much beyond the nigro-striatal degeneration, the striatum has been shown to be responsible for many cognitive functions. Patients with PD develop impairments in multiple cognitive domains and the PD model is probably the most extensively studied regarding striatum dysfunction and its influence on cognition. Up to 40% of PD patients present cognitive impairment even in the early stages of disease development. Thus, understanding the key patterns of striatum and connecting regions' influence on cognition will help develop more specific approaches to alleviate cognitive impairment and slow down its decline. This review focuses on the contribution of neuroimaging studies in understanding how striatum impairment affects cognition in PD.

Indeed, lesion studies in animals and studies of some neurological conditions in humans have brought further evidence to this idea. However, better methods of investigation have raised concerns about this notion, and it was proposed that the striatum could also be involved in different types of functions including cognitive ones. Although the notion was originally a matter of debate, it is now well-accepted that the caudate nucleus contributes to cognition, while the putamen could be involved in motor functions, and to some extent in cognitive functions as well. With the arrival of modern neuroimaging techniques in the early 1990, knowledge supporting the cognitive aspect of the striatum has greatly increased, and a substantial number of scientific papers were published studying the role of the striatum in healthy individuals. For the first time, it was possible to assess the contribution of specific areas of the brain during the execution of a cognitive task. Neuroanatomical studies have described functional loops involving the striatum and the prefrontal cortex suggesting a specific interaction between these two structures. This review examines the data up to date and provides strong evidence for a specific contribution of the fronto-striatal regions in different cognitive processes, such as set-shifting, self-initiated responses, rule learning, action contingency, and planning. Finally, a new two level functional model involving the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum is proposed suggesting an essential role of the dorsal striatum in selecting between competing potential responses or actions, and in resolving a high level of ambiguity.

However, larger studies using advanced imaging techniques in substantial patient populations are lacking. In the present study, we investigated changes of thalamic volume and shape in a large multicenter cohort of patients with migraine. High-resolution T1-weighted MRI data acquired at 3 tesla in 131 patients with migraine (38 with aura; 30.8 +/- 9 years old; 109 women; monthly attack frequency: 3.2 +/- 2.5; disease duration: 14 +/- 8.4 years) and 115 matched healthy subjects (29 +/- 7 years old; 81 women) from four international tertiary headache centers were analyzed. The thalamus and thalamic subnuclei, striatum, and globus pallidus were segmented using a fully automated multiatlas approach. Deformation-based shape analysis was performed to localize surface abnormalities. Differences between patients with migraine and healthy subjects were assessed using an ANCOVA model. After correction for multiple comparisons, performed using the false discovery rate approach (p < 0.05 corrected), significant volume reductions of the following thalamic nuclei were observed in migraineurs: central nuclear complex (F-(1,F-233) = 6.79), anterior nucleus (F-(1,F-237) = 7.38), and lateral dorsal nucleus (F-(1,F-238) = 6.79). Moreover, reduced striatal volume (F-(1,F-238) = 6.9) was observed in patients. This large-scale study indicates structural thalamic abnormalities in patients with migraine. The thalamic nuclei with abnormal volumes are densely connected to the limbic system. The data hence lend support to the view that higher-order integration systems are altered in migraine.

Leptin can decrease locomotion and running, yet the mechanisms involved and the influence of leptin on the rewarding effects of running ("runner's high'') are unknown. Leptin receptor (LepR) signaling involves activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), including in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that are essential for reward-relevant behavior. We found that mice lacking STAT3 in dopamine neurons exhibit greater voluntary running, an effect reversed by viral-mediated STAT3 restoration. STAT3 deletion increased the rewarding effects of running whereas intra-VTA leptin blocked it in a STAT3-dependent manner. Finally, STAT3 loss-of-function reduced mesolimbic dopamine overflow and function. Findings suggest that leptin influences the motivational effects of running via LepR-STAT3 modulation of dopamine tone. Falling leptin is hypothesized to increase stamina and the rewarding effects of running as an adaptive means to enhance the pursuit and procurement of food.

These vital responses are triggered when hypothalamic osmoregulatory neurons become depolarized by ion channels encoded by an unknown product of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 gene (Trpv1). Here, we show that rodent osmoregulatory neurons express a transcript of Trpv1 that mediates the selective translation of a TRPV1 variant that lacks a significant portion of the channel's amino terminus (Delta N-TRPV1). The mRNA transcript encoding this variant (Trpv1dn) is widely expressed in the brains of osmoregulating vertebrates, including the human hypothalamus. Transfection of Trpv1dn into heterologous cells induced the expression of ion channels that could be activated by either hypertonicity or by heating in the physiological range. Moreover, expression of Trpv1dn rescued the osmosensory and thermosensory responses of single hypothalamic neurons obtained from Trpv1 knockout mice. Delta N-TRPV1 is therefore a co-detector of core body temperature and fluid tonicity.

Six locations representing five cities were chosen for the sediment sampling during winter and summer seasons: P1 - Chiclana de la Frontera, P2 - Puerto Real, P3 - Cadiz, P4 and P5 - El Puerto de Santa Maria, P6 - Rota (reference site). Biochemical biomarkers were explored in clams after 14-days of exposure under controlled conditions, that included changes in cellular energy status (total lipids content TLP and mitochondrial electron transport activity MET), gametogenic activity (dopamine and ALP levels), metabolism of monoamines (monoamine oxidase activity - MAO), inflammation and spawning properties (cyclooxygenase activity - COX). Wastewater discharges induced energy budget alterations, as suggested by MET decrease (P4 and P5) and accumulation of To (P1, P2 and P3) in gonads. ALP levels (P1, P2 and P3), dopamine (P2) and COX activity (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5) decreased in clams after the exposure to summer sediments. MAO increased in clams exposed to winter (P1 and P2) and summer (P3 and P4) sediments. Wastewater discharges composition changed between different seasons, mainly leading to oxidative stress, inflammation (COX activity and ALP levels) and spawning delay in summer. This study highlights the importance of considering reproduction of marine biota when assessing adverse effects of wastewater discharges.

We have recently demonstrated that selective MT2 melatonin receptor partial agonists have antiallodynic properties in animal models of chronic neuropathic pain by modulating ON/OFF cells of the descending antinociceptive system. Here, we examined the antinociceptive properties of the selective MT2 melatonin receptor partial agonists N-{2-[(3-methoxyphenyl)phenylamino]ethyl}acetamide (UCM765) and N-{2-[(3-bromophenyl)-(4-fluorophenyl)amino]ethyl}acerarnicle (UCM924) in two animal models of acute and inflammatory pain: the hot-plate and formalin tests. UCM765 and UCM924 (5-40 mg/kg, s.c.) dose-depencleraly increased the temperature of the first hind paw lick in the hot-plate Lest and decreased the total time spent licking the injected hind paw in the formalin test. Antinociceprive effects of UCM765 and UCM924 were maximal at the dose of 20 mg/kg. At this dose, the areas of UCM765 and UCM924 were similar to those produced by 200 mg/kg aceraminophen in the hot-plate Lest., and by 3 mg/kg kerorolac or 150 mg/kg MLT in the formalin test Notably, antinociceptive effects of the two MT2 partial agonists were blocked by the pre-treatment with the MT2 antagonist 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin (4P-PDOT, 10 mg/kg) in both paradigms. These results demonstrate the antinociceptive properties of UCM765 and UCM924 in acute and inflammatory pain models and corroborate the concept that MT2 melatonin receptor may be a novel target for analgesic drug development.

However, there are few neuropsychological tests adapted to Brazilian society, culture, and language, especially for evaluating the communication of individuals with right hemisphere damage.Aims: This study was designed to describe age and education effects on the communicative performance of non-brain-damaged Brazilian adults on the Brazilian Montreal Communication Evaluation Battery (MAC Battery), which was created to evaluate components of communication usually overlooked by aphasia tests.Methods & Procedures: The sample was composed of 240 adults, divided into two education and three age groups. The influence of these variables on the Brazilian MAC Battery performance was assessed.Outcomes & Results: Communicative performance is influenced by educational level. Age also partially impacts performance, but to a lesser degree, and there is an interaction between these factors in five tasks.Conclusions: These results are important for the use of this protocol with patients with neurological disorders since education and age will have to be taken into consideration.

The optimization aims to maximize the film cooling performance, which is assessed using the cooling effectiveness, while minimizing the corresponding aerodynamic loss, which is measured with a mass-averaged total pressure coefficient. Three geometric variables defining the hole shape are optimized: the conical expansion angle, compound angle and length to diameter ratio of the non-diffused portion of the hole. The optimization employs a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm coupled with an artificial neural network to generate the Pareto front. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations are employed to construct the neural network and investigate the aerodynamic and thermal optimum solutions. The optimum designs exhibit improved performance in comparison to the reference design. The optimization methodology allowed investigation into the impact of varying the geometric variables on the cooling effectiveness and the aerodynamic loss.

Condition- based maintenance decision support system for oil and gas pipelines	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						oil and gas pipelines; life cycle cost; Monte Carlo simulation; fuzzy approach	CORROSION DEFECTS; NEURAL-NETWORK; LIFE; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The 2013 report card of America's infrastructure has scored the condition of oil and gas pipelines as D+ which means that such pipelines are in a relatively poor condition. More than 10,000 failures have been recorded in the US. These failures have resulted in environmental, health and property damages. Therefore, there is a definite need to give more attention to the maintenance of oil and gas pipelines. This paper develops a comprehensive model for the maintenance planning of oil and gas pipelines. The model selects rehabilitation/repair alternatives for oil and gas pipelines based on their condition during their service life. These alternatives are then used to calculate the cash flow throughout the service life of these infrastructures. The model, which uses Monte Carlo simulation and fuzzy approach to address the uncertainties in the estimation of the maintenance operation costs and the economic parameters, calculates the Equivalent Uniform Annual Worth of the identified alternatives. The optimum maintenance programmes consist of the alternatives that have the lowest life cycle cost of oil and gas pipelines. The model is expected to support pipeline operators in the maintenance decision-making process of oil and gas pipelines.

Clinics devoted to the spiritual care of people with dementia question the role of the credere and love in their most crucial aspects for psychic health. How and why do these patients fall in love? A study of the clinical implications of these questions in relation with observations gathered among people suffering from severe dementia should allow us a better understanding of the meaning of soul, consciousness, and cognition.

No means of early detection exist. We hypothesized that systemic fetal inflammation without septic shock will be reflected in alterations of fetal heart rate (FHR) variability (fHRV) distinguishing baseline versus inflammatory response states. In chronically instrumented near-term fetal sheep (n = 24), we induced an inflammatory response with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injected intravenously (n = 14). Ten additional fetuses served as controls. We measured fetal plasma inflammatory cytokine IL-6 at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h. 44 fHRV measures were determined continuously every 5 min using continuous individualized multi-organ variability analysis (CIMVA). CIMVA creates an fHRV measures matrix across five signal-analytical domains, thus describing complementary properties of fHRV. Using principal component analysis (PCA), a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction, we derived and quantitatively compared the CIMVA fHRV PCA signatures of inflammatory response in LPS and control groups. In the LPS group, IL-6 peaked at 3 h. In parallel, PCA-derived fHRV composite measures revealed a significant difference between LPS and control group at different time points. For the LPS group, a sharp increase compared to baseline levels was observed between 3 h and 6 h, and then abating to baseline levels, thus tracking closely the IL-6 inflammatory profile. This pattern was not observed in the control group. We also show that a preselection of fHRV measures prior to the PCA can potentially increase the difference between LPS and control groups, as early as 1 h post LPS injection. We propose a fHRV composite measure that correlates well with levels of inflammation and tracks well its temporal profile. Our results highlight the potential role of HRV to study and monitor the inflammatory response non-invasively over time.

Its development, organization, and synaptic properties are highly structured and regulated to support such reliability and efficacy. Yet, the NMJ is also highly plastic, able to react to injury and adapt to changes. This balance between structural stability and synaptic efficacy on one hand and structural plasticity and repair on another hand is made possible by the intricate regulation of perisynaptic Schwann cells, glial cells at this synapse. They regulate both the efficacy and structural plasticity of the NMJ in a dynamic, bidirectional manner owing to their ability to decode synaptic transmission and by their interactions via trophic-related factors.

The phenomenon was first described more than 50 years ago but did not fit the dominant paradigm that posited that consolidation takes place only once per LTM item. Research on reconsolidation was revitalized only more than a decade ago with the demonstration of reconsolidation in a well-defined behavioral protocol (auditory fear conditioning in the rat) subserved by an identified brain circuit (basolateral amygdala). Since then, reconsolidation has been shown in many studies over a range of species, tasks, and amnesic agents, and cellular and molecular correlates of reconsolidation have also been identified. In this review, I will first define the evidence on which reconsolidation is based, and proceed to discuss some of the conceptual issues facing the field in determining when reconsolidation does and does not occur. Last, I will refer to the potential clinical implications of reconsolidation.

In humans, the organization and layout of core and belt auditory fields are still poorly understood, and most auditory neuroimaging studies rely on macroanatomical criteria, rather than functional localization of distinct fields. A myeloarchitectonic method has been suggested recently for distinguishing between core and belt fields in humans (Dick F, Tierney AT, Lutti A, Josephs O, Sereno MI, Weiskopf N. 2012. In vivo functional and myeloarchitectonic mapping of human primary auditory areas. J Neurosci. 32:16095-16105). We propose a marker for core AC based directly on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and pattern classification. We show that a portion of AC in Heschl's gyrus classifies sound frequency more accurately than other regions in AC. Using fMRI data from macaques, we validate that the region where frequency classification performance is significantly above chance overlaps core auditory fields, predominantly A1. Within this region, we measure tonotopic gradients and estimate the locations of the human homologues of the core auditory subfields A1 and R. Our results provide a functional rather than anatomical localizer for core AC. We posit that inter-individual variability in the layout of core AC might explain disagreements between results from previous neuroimaging and cytological studies.

Research in applied psychology and sociolinguistics suggests that we generally prefer our own accent to other varieties of our native language and attribute more positive traits to it. Despite the widespread influence of accents on social interactions, educational and work settings the neural underpinnings of this social bias toward our own accent and, what may drive this bias, are unexplored. We measured brain activity while participants from two different geographical backgrounds listened passively to 3 English accent types embedded in an adaptation design. Cerebral activity in several regions, including bilateral amygdalae, revealed a significant interaction between the participants' own accent and the accent they listened to: while repetition of own accents elicited an enhanced neural response, repetition of the other group's accent resulted in reduced responses classically associated with adaptation. Our findings suggest that increased social relevance of, or greater emotional sensitivity to in-group accents, may underlie the own-accent bias. Our results provide a neural marker for the bias associated with accents, and show, for the first time, that the neural response to speech is partly shaped by the geographical background of the listener.

These medications include modulators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. In addition, an agent with a distinct and complementary mechanism of bradycardic action, the selective pacemaker-current (If) inhibitor ivabradine, provides further reduction of heart rate. Also, a new drug that incorporates neprilysin inhibition combined with angiotensin receptor blockade shows incremental effectiveness. The primary goal of this review is to provide a mechanistic explanation of the complementary role of therapeutic interventions in modulating pathways leading to progressive systolic heart failure. A secondary goal is to summarize the key findings of the pivotal clinical trials that have demonstrated the efficacy of these agents in this population.	[Mancini, G. B.

Aberrant Lipid Metabolism in the Forebrain Niche Suppresses Adult Neural Stem Cell Proliferation in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease	CELL STEM CELL			English	Article							PRESENILIN-1 MUTATION CARRIERS; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; AMYLOID DEPOSITION; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; TRANSGENIC MICE; FATTY-ACIDS; IMPAIRED NEUROGENESIS; PERIVENTRICULAR ZONE; TANGLE FORMATION; MAMMALIAN BRAIN	Lipid metabolism is fundamental for brain development and function, but its roles in normal and pathological neural stem cell (NSC) regulation remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a fatty acid-mediated mechanism suppressing endogenous NSC activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that postmortem AD brains and triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) mice accumulate neutral lipids within ependymal cells, the main support cell of the forebrain NSC niche. Mass spectrometry and microarray analyses identified these lipids as oleic acid-enriched triglycerides that originate from niche-derived rather than peripheral lipid metabolism defects. In wild-type mice, locally increasing oleic acid was sufficient to recapitulate the AD-associated ependymal triglyceride phenotype and inhibit NSC proliferation. Moreover, inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of oleic acid synthesis rescued proliferative defects in both adult neurogenic niches of 3xTg-AD mice. These studies support a pathogenic mechanism whereby AD-induced perturbation of niche fatty acid metabolism suppresses the homeostatic and regenerative functions of NSCs.

Curcumin was encapsulated in the NPs with a view to develop a delivery platform to treat diseases involving oxidative stress affecting the CNS. We observed a sharp decrease in size between 15 and 20% w/w of PEG which corresponds to a transition from a large solid particle structure to a "micelle-like" or "polymer nano-aggregate" structure. Drug loading, loading efficacy and release kinetics were determined. The diffusion coefficients of curcumin in NPs were determined using a mathematical modeling. The higher diffusion was observed for solid particles compared to "polymer nano-aggregate" particles. NPs did not present any significant toxicity when tested in vitro on a neuronal cell line. Moreover, the ability of NPs carrying curcumin to prevent oxidative stress was evidenced and linked to polymer architecture and NPs organization. Our study showed the intimate relationship between the polymer architecture and the biophysical properties of the resulting NPs and sheds light on new approaches to design efficient NP-based drug carriers.

Uri			A Pro-Nerve Growth Factor (proNGF) and NGF Binding Protein, alpha(2)-Macroglobulin, Differentially Regulates p75 and TrkA Receptors and Is Relevant to Neurodegeneration Ex Vivo and In Vivo	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTIRECEPTOR MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; NEUROTROPHIC RATIONALE; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; FACTOR PRECURSOR; TYROSINE KINASE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; AMYLOID-BETA; TNF-ALPHA; DEATH	Nerve growth factor (NGF) is generated from a precursor, proNGF, that is proteolytically processed. NGF preferentially binds a trophic tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA, while proNGF binds a neurotrophin receptor (NTR), p75(NTR), that can have neurotoxic activity. Previously, we along with others showed that the soluble protein alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha M-2) is neurotoxic. Toxicity is due in part to alpha M-2 binding to NGF and inhibiting trophic activity, presumably by preventing NGF binding to TrkA. However, the mechanisms remained unclear. Here, we show ex vivo and in vivo three mechanisms for alpha M-2 neurotoxicity. First, unexpectedly the alpha M-2-NGF complexes do bind TrkA receptors but do not induce TrkA dimerization or activation, resulting in deficient trophic support. Second, alpha M-2 makes stable complexes with proNGF, conveying resistance to proteolysis that results in more proNGF and less NGF. Third, alpha M-2-proNGF complexes bind p75(NTR) and are more potent agonists than free proNGF, inducing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production. Hence, alpha M-2 regulates proNGF/p75(NTR) positively and mature NGF/TrkA negatively, causing neuronal death ex vivo. These three mechanisms are operative in vivo, and alpha M-2 causes neurodegeneration in a p75(NTR)- and proNGF-dependent manner. alpha M-2 could be exploited as a therapeutic target, or as a modifier of neurotrophin signals.

Early-onset scoliosis covers a variety of etiologies (idiopathic, neurologic, dystrophic, malformative, etc.) with onset before the age of 5 years. Progression and severity threaten respiratory development and may result in respiratory failure in adulthood. Many surgical techniques have been developed in recent years, aiming to protect spinal and thoracic development. Material and methods: Present techniques are based on one of two main principles. The first consists in posterior distraction of the spine in its concavity (single growing rod, or vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib [VEPTR]), or on either side (dual rod); this requires iterative surgery, for lengthening, unless motorized using energy provided by a magnetic system. The second option is to use spinal growth force to lengthen the assembly; these techniques (Luque Trolley, Shilla), using a sliding assembly, are known as growth guidance. Results: These techniques are effective in controlling early scoliotic deformity, and to some extent restore spinal growth. However, they show a high rate of complications: infection, rod breakage, spinal fixation pull out and, above all, progressive spinal stiffness, reducing long-term efficacy. Respiratory gain is harder to assess, as thoracic expansion does not systematically improve respiratory function, particularly due to impaired compliance of the thoracic cage.

Cone transplantation could represent a therapeutic solution. However, an abundant source of human cones remains difficult to obtain. Work performed in model organisms suggests that anterior neural cell fate is induced 'by default' if BMP, TGF beta and Wnt activities are blocked, and that photoreceptor genesis operates through an S-cone default pathway. We report here that Coco (Dand5), a member of the Cerberus gene family, is expressed in the developing and adult mouse retina. Upon exposure to recombinant COCO, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated into S-cone photoreceptors, developed an inner segment-like protrusion, and could degrade cGMP when exposed to light. Addition of thyroid hormone resulted in a transition from a unique S-cone population toward a mixed M/S-cone population. When cultured at confluence for a prolonged period of time, COCO-exposed hESCs spontaneously developed into a cellular sheet composed of polarized cone photoreceptors. COCO showed dose-dependent and synergistic activity with IGF1 at blocking BMP/TGF beta/Wnt signaling, while its cone-inducing activity was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by exposure to BMP, TGF beta or Wnt-related proteins. Our work thus provides a unique platform to produce human cones for developmental, biochemical and therapeutic studies and supports the hypothesis that photoreceptor differentiation operates through an S-cone default pathway during human retinal development.

Baroreflex activation therapy for the treatment of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction: safety and efficacy in patients with and without cardiac resynchronization therapy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE			English	Article						Baroreflex; Heart failure; Resynchronization; Autonomic nervous system; Randomized controlled trial	PROGNOSTIC IMPLICATIONS; ARTERIAL BAROREFLEX; FAILING HEART; HF TRIAL; INHIBITION; METOPROLOL; SYSTEM	AimsIncreased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity contribute to heart failure (HF) symptoms and disease progression. Carotid baroreceptor stimulation (baroreflex activation therapy, BAT) results in centrally mediated reduction of sympathetic and increase in parasympathetic activity. Because patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may have less sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance, we hypothesized that there would be differences in the response to BAT in patients with CRT vs. those without CRT. Methods and resultsNew York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III patients with an ejection fraction (EF) 35% were randomized (1 : 1) to ongoing guideline-directed medical and device therapy (GDMT, control) or ongoing GDMT plus BAT. Safety endpoint was system-/procedure-related major adverse neurological and cardiovascular events (MANCE). Efficacy endpoints were Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Quality of Life (QoL), 6-min hall walk distance (6MHWD), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and HF hospitalization rate. In this sample, 146 patients were randomized (70 control; 76 BAT) and were 140 activated (45 with CRT and 95 without CRT). MANCE-free rate at 6 months was 100% in CRT and 96% in no-CRT group. At 6 months, in the no-CRT group, QoL score, 6MHWD, LVEF, NT-proBNP and HF hospitalizations were significantly improved in BAT patients compared with controls. Changes in efficacy endpoints in the CRT group favoured BAT; however, the improvements were less than in the no-CRT group and were not statistically different from control. ConclusionsBAT is safe and significantly improved QoL, exercise capacity, NTpro-BNP, EF, and rate of HF hospitalizations in GDMT-treated NYHA Class III HF patients. These effects were most pronounced in patients not treated with CRT.

Development of a model to guide decision making in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis multidisciplinary care	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						caregivers; motor neurone disease; patient-centred care; stakeholder perspectives	MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; QUALITY STANDARDS SUBCOMMITTEE; PRACTICE PARAMETER UPDATE; EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE; OF-LIFE; BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES; AMERICAN ACADEMY; PATIENT; ALS; PEOPLE	Background Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) face numerous decisions for symptom management and quality of life. Models of decision making in chronic disease and cancer care are insufficient for the complex and changing needs of patients with ALS. Objective The aim was to examine the question: how can decision making that is both effective and patient-centred be enacted in ALS multidisciplinary care? Setting and participants Fifty-four respondents (32 health professionals, 14 patients and eight carers) from two specialized ALS multidisciplinary clinics participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed thematically. Results Comparison of stakeholder perspectives revealed six key themes of ALS decision making. These were the decision-making process; patient-centred focus; timing and planning; information sources; engagement with specialized ALS services; and access to non-specialized services. A model, embedded in the specialized ALS multidisciplinary clinic, was derived to guide patient decision making. The model is cyclic, with four stages: 'Participant Engagement'; 'Option Information'; 'Option Deliberation'; and 'Decision Implementation'. Discussion Effective and patient-centred decision making is enhanced by the structure of the specialized ALS clinic, which promotes patients' symptom management and quality of life goals. However, patient and carer engagement in ALS decision making is tested by the dynamic nature of ALS, and patient and family distress. Our model optimizes patient-centred decision making, by incorporating patients' cyclic decision-making patterns and facilitating carer inclusion in decision processes. Conclusions The model captures the complexities of patient-centred decision making in ALS. The framework can assist patients and carers, health professionals, researchers and policy-makers in this challenging disease environment.

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated age-related microstructural changes in specific white matter tracts during development and aging. However, the age-related alterations in the topological architecture of the white matter structural connectome across the human lifespan remain largely unknown. Here, a cohort of 113 healthy individuals (ages 9-85) with both diffusion and structural MRI acquisitions were examined. For each participant, the high-resolution white matter structural networks were constructed by deterministic fiber tractography among 1024 parcellation units and were quantified with graph theoretical analyses. The global network properties, including network strength, cost, topological efficiency, and robustness, followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory with a peak age around the third decade. The brain areas with the most significantly nonlinear changes were located in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Different brain regions exhibited heterogeneous trajectories: the posterior cingulate and lateral temporal cortices displayed prolonged maturation/degeneration compared with the prefrontal cortices. Rich-club organization was evident across the lifespan, whereas hub integration decreased linearly with age, especially accompanied by the loss of frontal hubs and their connections. Additionally, age-related changes in structural connections were predominantly located within and between the prefrontal and temporal modules. Finally, based on the graph metrics of structural connectome, accurate predictions of individual age were obtained (r=0.77). Together, the data indicated a dynamic topological organization of the brain structural connectome across human lifespan, which may provide possible structural substrates underlying functional and cognitive changes with age.

In addition, the project attempts to identify the most efficient model averaging method and the optimal number of models to include in the weighting scheme. In order to address the first objective, streamflow was simulated using four lumped hydrological models (HSAMI, HMETS, MOHYSE and GR4J-6), each of which were calibrated with three different objective functions on 429 watersheds. The resulting 12 hydrographs (4 models x 3 metrics) were weighted and combined with the help of 9 averaging methods which are the simple arithmetic mean (SAM), Akaike information criterion (AICA), Bates-Granger (BGA), Bayes information criterion (BICA), Bayesian model averaging (BMA), Granger-Ramanathan average variant A, B and C (GRA, GRB and GRC) and the average by SCE-UA optimization (SCA). The same weights were then applied to the hydrographs in validation mode, and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency metric was measured between the averaged and observed hydrographs. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the accuracy of weighted methods to that of individual models. A Kruskal-Wallis test and a multi-objective optimization algorithm were then used to identify the most efficient weighted method and the optimal number of models to integrate. Results suggest that the GRA, GRB, GRC and SCA weighted methods perform better than the individual members. Model averaging from these four methods were superior to the best of the individual members in 76% of the cases. Optimal combinations on all watersheds included at least one of each of the four hydrological models. None of the optimal combinations included all members of the ensemble of 12 hydrographs. The Granger-Ramanathan average variant C (GRC) is recommended as the best compromise between accuracy, speed of execution, and simplicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Visceral fat enhances blood pressure reactivity to physical but not mental challenges in male adolescents	PEDIATRIC OBESITY			English	Article						Blood pressure; sex; stress; visceral fat	SYMPATHETIC NEURAL ACTIVATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; YOUNG-ADULTS; SYSTOLIC HYPERTENSION; METABOLIC RISK; BODY-FAT; CHILDREN; ASSOCIATION; ADIPOSITY; RECOVERY	Background: Excess visceral fat is a major risk factor for hypertension. Enhanced blood pressure (BP) reactivity and delayed BP recovery from physical and mental challenges predict future hypertension. Objectives: Determine whether visceral fat is associated with higher BP reactivity and delayed BP recovery from physical and mental challenges during adolescence. Methods: In a community-based sample of 283 male and 308 female adolescents, we measured visceral fat with magnetic resonance imaging, total body fat with bioimpedance, and beat-by-beat BP with a Finometer at rest and during physical (10-min standing) and mental (2-min math stress) challenges. Results: Males vs. females showed greater BP reactivity and no differences in BP recovery from either type of challenges. Visceral fat was positively associated with BP reactivity to standing up only and in males only (+8.4 +/- 3.6 mmHg per 1 log cm(3) of visceral fat, P = 0.008), and this association was independent of total body fat. No association was seen between visceral fat and BP recovery from either type of challenge in either sex. All these associations were independent of age, puberty stage, height and initial BP. Conclusions: Adolescent males vs. females demonstrate greater BP reactivity but similar BP recovery from physical and mental challenges. Excess visceral fat enhances BP reactivity to physical but not mental challenges in males only.

Electrosensory Midbrain Neurons Display Feature Invariant Responses to Natural Communication Stimuli	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES; DIRECTIONAL SELECTIVITY; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; CIRCUIT PARAMETERS; CHANNEL EXPRESSION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SENSORY NEURONS	Neurons that respond selectively but in an invariant manner to a given feature of natural stimuli have been observed across species and systems. Such responses emerge in higher brain areas, thereby suggesting that they occur by integrating afferent input. However, the mechanisms by which such integration occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that midbrain electrosensory neurons can respond selectively and in an invariant manner to heterogeneity in behaviorally relevant stimulus waveforms. Such invariant responses were not seen in hindbrain electrosensory neurons providing afferent input to these midbrain neurons, suggesting that response invariance results from nonlinear integration of such input. To test this hypothesis, we built a model based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism that received realistic afferent input. We found that multiple combinations of parameter values could give rise to invariant responses matching those seen experimentally. Our model thus shows that there are multiple solutions towards achieving invariant responses and reveals how subthreshold membrane conductances help promote robust and invariant firing in response to heterogeneous stimulus waveforms associated with behaviorally relevant stimuli. We discuss the implications of our findings for the electrosensory and other systems.

"Learning how to deal with feelings differently": Psychotropic medications as vehicles of socialization in adolescence	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Canada; Adolescence; Psychiatric medications; Mental health; Teenage brain	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BRAIN; NEUROSCIENCE; ADHD; PSYCHIATRY; CULTURE; PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY; METHYLPHENIDATE; EXPERIENCE; SCIENCE	Drawing from ethnographic research among clinicians working with adolescents at a hospital psychiatric emergency department and outpatient clinic, and with interviews with adolescent psychiatric patients and their parents, we examine how psychiatric medicines function as socializing agents. Although psychiatric medications are thought to exert their main effects through direct biological action on neural circuitry, in fact, their use mobilizes specific kinds of moral discourse and social positioning that may have profound effects on sense of self, personhood, and psychological development. Specifically, our data reveal how clinical discourse around medications aims to enlist adolescents in becoming responsible, emotionally intelligent selves through learning to manage their medications. Among doctors, adolescents and their families, talk about psychiatric medications intertwines narratives of 'growing up' and 'getting well'. Our analysis of case studies from the clinic thus demonstrates that while psychiatric medications are explicitly designed to influence behavior by acting directly on the brain, they also act to structure adolescents' selves and social worlds through indirect, rather than direct causal pathways to the brain.

AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; face perception; local; global; synthetic faces; viewpoint change	SPATIAL-FREQUENCY BIASES; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; IDENTITY RECOGNITION; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; CHILDREN; BRAIN; INDIVIDUALS; DEFICITS; AMYGDALA	Face perception is the most commonly used visual metric of social perception in autism. However, when found to be atypical, the origin of face perception differences in autism is contentious. One hypothesis proposes that a locally oriented visual analysis, characteristic of individuals with autism, ultimately affects performance on face tasks where a global analysis is optimal. The objective of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis by assessing face identity discrimination with synthetic faces presented with and without changes in viewpoint, with the former condition minimizing access to local face attributes used for identity discrimination. Twenty-eight individuals with autism and 30 neurotypical participants performed a face identity discrimination task. Stimuli were synthetic faces extracted from traditional face photographs in both front and 20 degrees side viewpoints, digitized from 37 points to provide a continuous measure of facial geometry. Face identity discrimination thresholds were obtained using a two-alternative, temporal forced choice match-to-sample paradigm. Analyses revealed an interaction between group and condition, with group differences found only for the viewpoint change condition, where performance in the autism group was decreased compared to that of neurotypical participants. The selective decrease in performance for the viewpoint change condition suggests that face identity discrimination in autism is more difficult when access to local cues is minimized, and/or when dependence on integrative analysis is increased. These results lend support to a perceptual contribution of atypical face perception in autism. (c) 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Biphasic Effect of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor on Anterior Pituitary Folliculostellate TtT/GF Cell Coupling, and Connexin 43 Expression and Phosphorylation	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						folliculostellate cells; connexion 43; bFGF; gap junction; hypophysis	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; GAP-JUNCTIONAL COMMUNICATION; NEURAL PROGENITOR CELLS; LENS EPITHELIAL-CELLS; BREAST-TUMOR CELLS; HORMONE LH-RH; INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION; STELLATE CELLS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE	Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a mitogenic and differentiating cytokine. In the anterior pituitary, folliculostellate (FS) cells constitute the major source of bFGF. bFGF affects endocrine cell proliferation and secretion in the anterior pituitary. In addition, bFGF increases its own expression by acting directly on FS cells. FS cell Cx43-mediated gap junction intercellular communication allows the establishment of an intrapituitary network for the transmission of information. In the present study, we assessed how bFGF regulates FS cell coupling. Time course studies were carried out on the FS cell line TtT/GF. Short-term bFGF treatment induced a transient cell uncoupling and the phosphorylation in Ser368 of membrane-bound Cx43 without modifying Cx43 levels. We demonstrated the involvement of the protein kinase C (PKC) isoform a in the phosphorylation of Cx43 in S368. Moreover, we showed that bFGF induced PKCa activation by stimulating its expression, phosphorylation and association with the plasma membrane. The long-term incubation with bFGF increased TtT/ GF cell coupling, total Cx43 levels and Cx43 accumulation at the cell membrane of cytoplasmic projections. The Cx43 level increase was a result of the stimulation of Cx43 gene transcription as mediated by the extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 signalling pathway. Taken together, the data show that bFGF modulates TtT/GF cell coupling by activating different pathways that lead to opposite effects on Cx43 phosphorylation and expression depending on the duration of the exposure of the cells to bFGF. A short-term bFGF exposure reduces cell-to-cell communication as a mean of desynchronising FS cells. By contrast, long-term exposure to bFGF enhances cell-to-cell communication and facilitates coordination among FS cells.	[Vitale, M.

Predicting plasticity: acute context-dependent changes to vocal performance predict long-term age-dependent changes	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Bengalese finch; birdsong; sequencing; tempo; social context	ZEBRA FINCH SONG; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUIT; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; IMAGING BRAIN PLASTICITY; ADULT BENGALESE FINCHES; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; DELIBERATE PRACTICE; SEQUENCE VARIABILITY; EXPERT PERFORMANCE; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE	Understanding the factors that predict and guide variation in behavioral change can lend insight into mechanisms of motor plasticity and individual differences in behavior. The performance of adult birdsong changes with age in a manner that is similar to rapid context-dependent changes to song. To reveal mechanisms of vocal plasticity, we analyzed the degree to which variation in the direction and magnitude of age-dependent changes to Bengalese finch song could be predicted by variation in context-dependent changes. Using a repeated-measures design, we found that variation in age-dependent changes to the timing, sequencing, and structure of vocal elements ("syllables") was significantly predicted by variation in context-dependent changes. In particular, the degree to which the duration of intersyllable gaps, syllable sequencing at branch points, and fundamental frequency of syllables within spontaneous [undirected (UD)] songs changed over time was correlated with the degree to which these features changed from UD song to female-directed (FD) song in young-adult finches (FD young). As such, the structure of some temporal features of UD songs converged over time onto the structure of FD young songs. This convergence suggested that the FD young song could serve as a stable target for vocal motor plasticity. Consequently, we analyzed the stability of FD song and found that the temporal structure of FD song changed significantly over time in a manner similar to UD song. Because FD song is considered a state of heightened performance, these data suggest that age-dependent changes could reflect practice-related improvements in vocal motor performance.

It establishes reciprocal connections with virtually all visual cortexes and likely plays a role in transthalamic cortico-cortical communication. In cats, the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of the LP-pulvinar complex can be subdivided in two subregions, the lateral (LPl) and medial (LPm) parts, which receive a predominant input from the striate cortex and the superior colliculus, respectively. Here, we revisit the receptive field structure of LPl and LPm cells in anesthetized cats by determining their first-order spatiotemporal profiles through reverse correlation analysis following sparse noise stimulation. Our data reveal the existence of previously unidentified receptive field profiles in the LP nucleus both in space and time domains. While some cells responded to only one stimulus polarity, the majority of neurons had receptive fields comprised of bright and dark responsive subfields. For these neurons, dark subfields' size was larger than that of bright subfields. A variety of receptive field spatial organization types were identified, ranging from totally overlapped to segregated bright and dark subfields. In the time domain, a large spectrum of activity overlap was found, from cells with temporally coinciding subfield activity to neurons with distinct, time-dissociated subfield peak activity windows. We also found LP neurons with space-time inseparable receptive fields and neurons with multiple activity periods. Finally, a substantial degree of homology was found between LPl and LPm first-order receptive field spatiotemporal profiles, suggesting a high integration of cortical and subcortical inputs within the LP-pulvinar complex.

Prodromal disease refers to the stage wherein early symptoms or signs of PD neurodegeneration are present, but classic clinical diagnosis based on fully evolved motor parkinsonism is not yet possible. Given the lack of clear neuroprotective/disease-modifying therapy for prodromal PD, these criteria were developed for research purposes only. The criteria are based upon the likelihood of prodromal disease being present with probable prodromal PD defined as 80% certainty. Certainty estimates rely upon calculation of an individual's risk of having prodromal PD, using a Bayesian naive classifier. In this methodology, a previous probability of prodromal disease is delineated based upon age. Then, the probability of prodromal PD is calculated by adding diagnostic information, expressed as likelihood ratios. This diagnostic information combines estimates of background risk (from environmental risk factors and genetic findings) and results of diagnostic marker testing. In order to be included, diagnostic markers had to have prospective evidence documenting ability to predict clinical PD. They include motor and nonmotor clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and ancillary diagnostic tests. These criteria represent a first step in the formal delineation of early stages of PD and will require constant updating as more information becomes available.

The disrupted mitochondrial dynamics observed in a large number of neurodegenerative diseases suggests a common etiology with the possibility of therapies targeting multiple diseases. This review highlights the contributions of structural studies of disease-related proteins to the understanding of neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis and especially the cellular events leading to disruptions in mitochondrial dynamics and function. The examples used are parkin and sacsin, two proteins linked respectively to autosomal-recessive early-onset PD and autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. Structural studies of parkin and sacsin explain the pathogenicity of a large number of disease-associated mutations and reveal insights into their cellular functions related to mitochondrial dynamics.

Although the behavioral manifestations associated with AgCC have been widely studied, the effects of complete absence of the corpus callosum (CC) on cerebral cortex anatomy are still not completely understood. In this study, cortical thickness in adults with complete AgCC was compared to a group of healthy controls. Results showed highly variable patterns of cortical thickness in AgCC individuals, with few areas showing significant and consistent alterations including primary visual cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex. These results suggest relatively limited effects of AgCC on cortical morphology, which are mostly restricted to primary sensory and motor areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Less is known about how alterations at one level of processing (i.e., low-level) interact with that of another (i.e., mid-level). The aim of this study was to assess whether manipulating the physical properties (luminance vs texture) of local contour elements of a mid-level, visual pattern interferes with the discrimination of that pattern in a differential manner for individuals with AS. Methods: Twenty-nine AS individuals and thirty control participants (range 14-27 years) were asked to discriminate between perfect circles and Radial Frequency Patterns (RFP) of two, three, five, and 10 radial frequencies (RF), or deformations along the pattern's contour. When RFP have few deformations (< five RF), a global, pattern analysis is needed for shape discrimination. Conversely, when RFP contain many deformations (>= 10 RF), discrimination is dependent on the analysis of local deformations along the RFP contour. The effect of manipulating RF on RFP discrimination was assessed for RFP whose local contour elements were defined by either luminance or texture information, the latter previously found less efficiently processed in AS individuals. Results: Two separate mixed factorial ANOVAs [2 (Group) x 4 (RF)] were conducted on mean deformation thresholds for luminance- and texture-defined conditions. A significant Group x RF interaction was found for the luminance-defined condition where thresholds were higher in the AS group for the two and three RF conditions; no between-group differences were found for the five and 10 RF conditions. A significant main effect of group was identified for the texture-defined condition, where mean thresholds were higher for the AS group across all RF conditions assessed (two, three, five and 10); a Group x RF interaction effect was not found. Performance for each RFP condition was not affected across group by either chronological age or intelligence, as measured by either Weschler scales or Raven Progressive Matrices. Conclusions: The ability of AS individuals to discriminate a circular pattern is differentially affected by the availability (number of deformations along the RFP contour) and type (luminance vs texture) of local, low-level elements defining its contour. Performance is unaffected in AS when RFP discrimination is dependent on the analysis of local deformations of luminance-defined contour elements, but decreased across all RF conditions when local contour elements are texture-defined. These results suggest that efficient pattern perception in AS is functionally related to the efficacy with which its local elements are processed, indicative of an early origin for altered mid-level, pattern perception in AS.

Preferential decoding of emotion from human non-linguistic vocalizations versus speech prosody	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Emotional communication; Vocal expression; Speech prosody; ERPs; Anxiety	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; AFFECT DECISION TASK; TIME-COURSE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; PROCESSING EMOTIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NONVERBAL EMOTION; VOCAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL RESPONSES; SOCIAL PHOBIA	This study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to compare the time course of emotion processing from non-linguistic vocalizations versus speech prosody, to test whether vocalizations are treated preferentially by the neurocognitive system. Participants passively listened to vocalizations or pseudo-utterances conveying anger, sadness, or happiness as the EEG was recorded. Simultaneous effects of vocal expression type and emotion were analyzed for three ERP components (N100, P200, late positive component). Emotional vocalizations and speech were differentiated very early (N100) and vocalizations elicited stronger, earlier, and more differentiated P200 responses than speech. At later stages (450-700 ms), anger vocalizations evoked a stronger late positivity (LPC) than other vocal expressions, which was similar but delayed for angry speech. Individuals with high trait anxiety exhibited early, heightened sensitivity to vocal emotions (particularly vocalizations). These data provide new neurophysiological evidence that vocalizations, as evolutionarily primitive signals, are accorded precedence over speech-embedded emotions in the human voice.

Valproic Acid Induces the Hyperacetylation of P53, Expression of P53 Target Genes, and Markers of the Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway in Midorganogenesis Murine Limbs	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART B-DEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						valproic acid; valpromide; HDAC inhibitor; limb; p53; apoptosis	HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS; NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; MOUSE LIMBS; CELL-DEATH; IN-VITRO; ACETYLATION; CANCER; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; LEUKEMIA	In utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), increases the risk of congenital malformations. Although the mechanisms leading to the teratogenicity of VPA remain unsolved, several HDAC inhibitors increase cell death in cancer cell lines and embryonic tissues. Moreover, P53, the master regulator of apoptosis, is an established HDAC target. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of VPA on P53 signaling and markers of apoptosis during midorganogenesis in vitro limb development. Timed-pregnant CD1 mice (gestation day 12) were euthanized; embryonic forelimbs were excised and cultured in vitro for 3, 6, 12, or 24 hr in the presence or absence of VPA or valpromide (VPD), a non-HDACi analog of VPA. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blots were used to assess the expression of candidate genes and proteins involved in P53 signaling and apoptosis. P53 hyperacetylation and a decrease (Survivin/Birc5 and Bcl2) or an increase (p21/Cdkn1a) in the expression of p53 target genes was observed only in VPA-exposed limbs. VPA exposure also triggered an increase in markers of apoptosis and DNA damage; the concentrations of cleaved caspase 9 and caspase 3, cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and gamma-H2AX were increased in VPA-exposed limbs. VPD treatment caused a small but significant increase in cleaved caspase 3. Thus, in vitro exposure to an HDACi such as VPA leads to P53 hyperacetylation, enhances the expression of P53 target genes, and triggers an increase in apoptosis that may contribute to teratogenicity.

In order to identify how these specific brain regions contribute to phonological processing, we manipulated subsyllabic phonological complexity and stimulus modality during speech perception using fMRI. Subjects passively attended to visual or auditory pseudowords. Similar to previous studies, a bilateral network of cortical regions was recruited during the presentation of visual and auditory stimuli. Moreover, pseudowords recruited a similar network of regions as words and letters. Few regions in the whole-brain results revealed neural processing differences associated with phonological complexity independent of modality of presentation. In an ROI analysis, the only region sensitive to phonological complexity was the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFGpo), with the complexity effect only present for print. In sum, the sensitivity of phonological brain areas depends on the modality of stimulus presentation and task demands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the underlying neuronal integrity of the semantic network in normal aging. Young and older healthy adults carried out a semantic judgment task while their cortical activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Despite equivalent behavioral performance, young adults activated the left IPC to a greater extent than older adults, while the latter group recruited the temporoparietal region bilaterally and the left ATL to a greater extent than younger adults. Results indicate that significant neuronal changes occur in normal aging, mainly in regions underlying semantic control processes, despite an apparent stability in performance at the behavioral level.

Test-Retest Reliability of Cerebral Blood Flow and Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Responses to Hypercapnia and Hyperoxia Using Dual-Echo Pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling and Step Changes in the Fractional Composition of Inspired Gases	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article							TIDAL CARBON-DIOXIDE; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; BOLD FMRI; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IMAGING TECHNIQUES; VASCULAR-RESPONSE; PRECISE CONTROL; CALIBRATED MRI; SIGNAL CHANGES; PERFUSION MRI	Purpose: To assess the reproducibility of blood oxygenation level-dependent / cerebral blood flow (BOLD/CBF) responses to hypercapnia/hyperoxia using dual-echo pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) and step changes in inspired doses. Materials and Methods: Eight subjects were scanned twice, within 24 hours, using the same respiratory manipulation and imaging protocol. Imaging comprised a 5-minute anatomical acquisition, allowing segmentation of the gray matter (GM) tissue for further analysis, and an 18-minute pCASL functional scan. Hypercapnia/hyperoxia were induced by increasing the fraction of inspired CO2 to 5% and inspired O-2 to 60%, alternately. Reproducibility of BOLD and CBF pCASL measures was assessed by computing the inter-session coefficient of variation (CV) of the respective signals in GM. Results: BOLD and CBF measures in GM were robust and consistent, yielding CV values below 10% for BOLD hypercapnic/hyperoxic responses (which averaged 1.9 +/- 0.1% and 1.14 +/- 0.02%) and below 20% for the CBF hypercapnic response (which averaged 35 +/- 2 mL/min/100g). The CV for resting CBF was 3.5%. Conclusion: It is possible to attain reproducible measures of the simultaneous BOLD and CBF responses to blood gases, within a reasonable scan time and with whole brain coverage, using a simple respiratory manipulation and dual-echo pCASL.

These conditions were reduced to sequencing considerations, as classical model participants were first subjected to a possible cognitive conflict induced by a video, followed by another video about the targeted conceptions; prevalence model participants were subjected to the same videos but in the opposite chronological order; and repetition condition participants watched the "traditional teaching" video twice. Differences in accuracy and response times between our computerized and validated "sink/float" pretest and retest were analyzed. Results and interpretations confirm that cognitive conflicts are useful in teaching sequences that aim at producing conceptual changes. However, the major findings of this research suggest that such conflicts should not necessarily be triggered at the very beginning of teaching sequences, and therefore that the prevalence model might possibly be the preferable one to promote conceptual changes in real-life school science teaching settings. Recommendations for teaching and research are formulated. Presented results, although statistically significant, sometimes show weak effects sizes, and therefore call for further research efforts.

GPNMB cooperates with neuropilin-1 to promote mammary tumor growth and engages integrin alpha(5)beta(1) for efficient breast cancer metastasis	ONCOGENE			English	Article							GLYCOPROTEIN NONMETASTATIC B; EXPRESSION SIGNATURE; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; CARCINOMA-CELLS; DC-HIL; OSTEOACTIVIN; PROTEIN; SURVIVAL; ANGIOGENESIS; PROGRESSION	Glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB) promotes breast tumor growth and metastasis and its expression in tumor epithelium correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Despite its biological and clinical significance, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms engaged by GPNMB. Herein, we show that GPNMB engages distinct functional domains and mechanisms to promote primary tumor growth and metastasis. We demonstrate that neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) expression is increased in breast cancer cells that overexpress GPNMB. Interestingly, the GPNMB-driven increase in NRP-1 expression potentiated vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in breast cancer cells and was required for the growth, but not metastasis, of these cells in vivo. Interrogation of RNAseq data sets revealed a positive correlation between GPNMB and NRP-1 levels in human breast tumors. Furthermore, we ascribe pro-growth and pro-metastatic functions of GPNMB to its ability to bind alpha(5)beta(1) integrin and increase downstream signaling in breast cancer cells. We show that GPNMB enhances breast cancer cell adhesion to fibronectin, increases alpha(5)beta(1) expression and associates with this receptor through its RGD motif. GPNMB recruitment into integrin complexes activates Src and Fak signaling pathways in an RGD-dependent manner. Importantly, both the RGD motif and cytoplasmic tail of GPNMB are required to promote primary mammary tumor growth; however, only mutation of the RGD motif impaired the formation of lung metastases. Together, these findings identify novel and distinct molecular mediators of GPNMB-induced breast cancer growth and metastasis.	[Maric, G.; Annis, M. G.; Dong, Z.; Rose, A. A.

This allele has been associated with a number of phenotypes, such as pain and anxiety. In comparison with mice carrying the ancestral allele (Comt(+)), Comt(B2t) mice show higher Comt mRNA and enzymatic activity levels. Here, we investigated the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying this allelic specific regulation of Comt expression. Insertion of the B2 element introduces an early polyadenylation signal generating a shorter Comt transcript, in addition to the longer ancestral mRNA. Comparative analysis and in silico prediction of Comt mRNA potential targets within the transcript 3' to the B2 element was performed and allowed choosing microRNA (miRNA) candidates for experimental screening: mmu-miR-3470a, mmu-miR-3470b, and mmu-miR-667. Cell transfection with each miRNA downregulated the expression of the ancestral transcript and COMT enzymatic activity. Our in vivo experiments showed that mmu-miR-667-3p is strongly correlated with decreasing amounts of Comt mRNA in the brain, and lentiviral injections of mmu-miR-3470a, mmu-miR-3470b, and mmu-miR-667 increase hypersensitivity in the mouse formalin model, consistent with reduced COMT activity. In summary, our data demonstrate that the Comt+ transcript contains regulatory miRNA signals in its 3'-untranslated region leading to mRNA degradation; these signals, however, are absent in the shorter transcript, resulting in higher mRNA expression and activity levels.

Numerous studies have linked COMT to pivotal brain functions such as mood, cognition, response to stress, and pain. Both nociception and risk of clinical pain have been associated with COMT genetic variants, and this association was shown to be mediated through adrenergic pathways. Here, we show that association studies between COMT polymorphic markers and pain phenotypes in 2 independent cohorts identified a functional marker; rs165774, situated in the 3' untranslated region of a newfound splice variant, (a)-COMT. Sequence comparisons showed that the (a)-COMT transcript is highly conserved in primates, and deep sequencing data demonstrated that (a)-COMT is expressed across several human tissues, including the brain. In silico analyses showed that the (a)-COMT enzyme features a distinct C-terminus structure, capable of stabilizing substrates in its active site. In vitro experiments demonstrated not only that (a)-COMT is catalytically active but also that it displays unique substrate specificity, exhibiting enzymatic activity with dopamine but not epinephrine. They also established that the pain-protective A allele of rs165774 coincides with lower COMT activity, suggesting contribution to decreased pain sensitivity through increased dopaminergic rather than decreased adrenergic tone, characteristic of reference isoforms. Our results provide evidence for an essential role of the (a)-COMT isoform in nociceptive signaling and suggest that genetic variations in (a)-COMT isoforms may contribute to individual variability in pain phenotypes.

Although more than one mechanism may be responsible for this, some similarities exist between the different proposed models. These can be separated into two main categories, depending on whether they involve a single-strand-switching or a reciprocal-strand-switching event. Single-strand-switching events lead to intermediates containing Y junctions, whereas reciprocal-strand-switching creates Holliday junctions. Common features in all the described models include replication stress, fork stalling and the presence of inverted repeats, but no single element appears to be required in all cases. We review the field, and examine the ideas that several mechanisms may take place in any given genome, and that the presence of palindromes or inverted repeats in certain regions may favor specific rearrangements.

Sex differences in the dynamics of brain maturation during adolescence may be of particular importance with regard to vulnerability of the male brain to cannabis exposure. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the association between cannabis use and cortical maturation in adolescents is moderated by a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observation of 3 population-based samples included initial analysis in 1024 adolescents of both sexes from the Canadian Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) and follow-up in 426 adolescents of both sexes from the IMAGEN Study from 8 European cities and 504 male youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) based in England. A total of 1577 participants (aged 12-21 years; 899 [57.0%] male) had (1) information about cannabis use; (2) imaging studies of the brain; and (3) a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia across 108 genetic loci identified by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Data analysis was performed from March 1 through December 31, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cortical thickness derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Linear regression tests were used to assess the relationships between cannabis use, cortical thickness, and risk score. RESULTS Across the 3 samples of 1574 participants, a negative association was observed between cannabis use in early adolescence and cortical thickness in male participants with a high polygenic risk score. This observation was not the case for low-risk male participants or for the low-or high-risk female participants. Thus, in SYS male participants, cannabis use interacted with risk score vis-a-vis cortical thickness (P = .009); higher scores were associated with lower thickness only in males who used cannabis. Similarly, in the IMAGEN male participants, cannabis use interacted with increased risk score vis-a-vis a change in decreasing cortical thickness from 14.5 to 18.5 years of age (t(137) = -2.36; P = .02). Finally, in the ALSPAC high-risk group of male participants, those who used cannabis most frequently (>= 61 occasions) had lower cortical thickness than those who never used cannabis (difference in cortical thickness, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01-0.12]; P = .02) and those with light use (<5 occasions) (difference in cortical thickness, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.03-0.18]; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cannabis use in early adolescence moderates the association between the genetic risk for schizophrenia and cortical maturation among male individuals. This finding implicates processes underlying cortical maturation in mediating the link between cannabis use and liability to schizophrenia.

Participants completed questionnaires assessing: perfectionism dimensions, general depressive symptoms (i.e., shared with anxiety), specific depressive symptoms (i.e., anhedonia), general anxious symptoms (i.e., shared with depression), and specific anxious symptoms (i. e., somatic anxious arousal) at Time 1; daily stress and affect (e.g., sadness, negative affect) for 14 consecutive days at Month 6 and Year 3; and depressive and anxious symptoms at Year 4. Path analyses indicated that SC perfectionism predicted daily stress-sadness reactivity (i. e., greater increases in sadness in response to increases in stress) across Month 6 and Year 3, which in turn explained why individuals with higher SC perfectionism had more general depressive symptoms, anhedonic depressive symptoms, and general anxious symptoms, respectively, 4 years later. In contrast, daily reactivity to stress with negative affect did not mediate the prospective relation between SC perfectionism and anhedonic depressive symptoms. Findings also demonstrated that higher mean levels of daily stress did not mediate the relationship between SC perfectionism and depressive and anxious symptoms 4 years later. These findings highlight the importance of targeting enduring heightened stress reactivity in order to reduce SC perfectionists' vulnerability to depressive and anxious symptoms over the long term.

Norepinephrine triggers metaplasticity of LTP by increasing translation of specific mRNAs	LEARNING & MEMORY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; AMPA-RECEPTOR TRAFFICKING; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 REGION; THETA-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; DEPENDENT LATE-PHASE; RAT DENTATE GYRUS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS	Norepinephrine (NE) is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain structure crucially involved in memory formation. NE boosts synaptic plasticity mostly through initiation of signaling cascades downstream from beta (beta)-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs). Previous studies demonstrated that a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, can modify the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative cellular mechanism for learning and memory, in a process known as "metaplasticity." Metaplasticity is the ability of synaptic plasticity to be modified by prior experience. We asked whether NE itself could engage metaplastic mechanisms in area CA1 of mouse hippocampal slices. Using extracellular field potential recording and stimulation, we show that application of NE (10 mu M), which did not alter basal synaptic strength, enhances the future maintenance of LTP elicited by subthreshold, high-frequency stimulation (HFS: 1 x 100 Hz, 1 sec). HFS applied 30 min after NE washout induced long-lasting (>4 h) LTP, which was significantly extended in duration relative to HFS alone. This NE-induced metaplasticity required beta 1-AR activation, as coapplication of the beta 1-receptor antagonist CGP-20712A (1 mu M) attenuated maintenance of LTP. We also found that NE-mediated metaplasticity was translation and transcription-dependent. Polysomal profiles of CA1 revealed increased translation rates for specific mRNAs during NE-induced metaplasticity. Thus, activation of beta-ARs by NE primes synapses for future long-lasting plasticity on time scales extending beyond fast synaptic transmission; this may facilitate neural information processing and the subsequent formation of lasting memories.

Care4Rare Canada Consortium	Autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy in a sibling pair due to a novel homozygous mutation in IGHMBP2	NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS			English	Article						IGHMBP2; Next-generation sequencing; Charcot-Marie Tooth disease; Hereditary sensory and motor neuropathy; Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress 1	SPINAL MUSCULAR-ATROPHY; RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS TYPE-1; SMARD1; DISEASE; MOUSE; MOTOR	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by a sensorimotor polyneuropathy with subsequent muscle atrophy, areflexia, and sensory loss. More than 60 genes have been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotypes, including IGHMBP2. Until recently, mutations in IGHMBP2 were exclusively associated with spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMARD1). We present a sibling pair with a novel homozygous truncating mutation in IGHMBP2. The patients presented with childhood-onset distal weakness, wasting in the upper and lower limbs, areflexia and decreased sensation, but no respiratory involvement. Exome sequencing was performed and a homozygous variant was identified (c.2601_2604del; p.Lys868Profs*109). Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of this variant in a homozygous state in the two affected siblings, while both parents were heterozygous. Further analyses showed decreased mRNA and IGHMBP2 protein in a lymphoblast cell line derived from one of the siblings. We demonstrate the utility of next-generation sequencing in reaching a molecular diagnosis for a heterogeneous condition such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth. Taken together, our data and that from the literature suggest that the spectrum of clinical presentations associated with mutations in IGHMBP2 may be secondary, at least in part, to the amount of residual protein.

It manifests with pyrexia, eosinophilia, and lymphadenopathy, with multiple organ involvement, mainly the skin, liver, and kidneys. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that DRESS syndrome can be associated with cerebral manifestations, a concept not well known in the neuroradiological literature. We describe three cases of DRESS syndrome associated with cerebral vasculitic-like lesions and realize a review of the literature to demonstrate that this association represents a very rare entity. Acute ischemic lesions were found among two patients. In all cases, perivascular enhancement was present. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) sequence was normal. Although no cerebral biopsy was performed, this enhancement pattern is strongly suggestive of a vasculitic process associated with DRESS syndrome. Diagnosis of cerebral vasculitic-like associated lesions must be considered in patients with DRESS syndrome since it can be reversed completely by withdrawing the causal medication and instigating corticosteroid treatment in a timely fashion.

The main reactive components of the CNS include microglial cells and infiltrating myeloid cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and the blood-brain barrier, cytokines, and cytokine signaling. Neuroinflammatory responses may be helpful or harmful, as mechanisms associated with neuroinflammation are involved in normal brain development, as well as in neuropathological processes. This review examines the roles of various cell types that contribute to the immune dysregulation associated with neuroinflammation. Microglia enter the CNS very early in embryonic development and, as such, play an essential role in both the healthy and diseased brain. B-cell diversity contributes to CNS disease through both antibody-dependent and antibody-independent mechanisms. The influences of these B-cell mechanisms on other cell types, including myeloid cells and T cells, are reviewed in relationship to antibody-mediated CNS disorders, paraneoplastic neurological diseases, and multiple sclerosis. New insights into neuroinflammation offer exciting opportunities to investigate potential therapeutic targets for debilitating CNS diseases.

John			A genome-wide association study of suicidal behavior	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS			English	Article						suicide; GWAS; immune response; suicide attempt; suicidal ideation	POPULATION; DISEASE; GENE	Genome wide array studies have reported limited success in identifying genetic markers conferring risk for suicidal behavior (SB). This may be attributable to study designs with primary outcome other than SB. We performed a GWAS on suicides and cases with a history of nonfatal suicide attempts compared with psychiatric controls and healthy volunteers. A consortium of USA, Canadian and German teams assembled two groups of cases (suicide attempters and suicides, N=577) and non-attempter psychiatric and healthy controls (N=1,233). Logistic regression was used to test genotype-suicidal behavior association. The test was repeated separating suicide attempt and completed suicide as outcomes. No SNP reached genome-wide significance, but several SNPs within STK3, ADAMTS14, PSME2, and TBX20 genes reached P<1x10(-5). The top SNPs for the suicide attempt analysis included two from DPP10, one from CTNNA3 and one from STK32B. In the suicide analysis we found seven SNPs from the TBX20 gene in the top hits. Pathway analysis identified the following pathways: Cellular Assembly and Organization, Nervous System Development and Function, Cell Death and Survival, Immunological Disease, Infectious Disease, and Inflammatory Response. The top genes in the SB analysis did not overlap with those in the ideation analysis. No genome wide significant results suggest that susceptibility to SB has genetic risk factors with smaller effect sizes. The strongest candidate genes, ADAMTS14, and PSME2 (both linked to inflammatory response), STK3 (neuronal cell death), and TBX20 (brainstem motor neuron development), have not been previously reported in association with suicide and warrant further study.

Astrogliosis and increased levels of chondroitin sulfate, a major component of brain extracellular matrix, are also seen in hippocampal sclerosis. Our aim was to evaluate the association between hippocampal volume and chondroitin sulfate, as well as neuronal and astroglial populations in the hippocampus of patients with TLE. MethodsPatients with drug-resistant TLE were subdivided, according to hippocampal volume measured by MRI, into two groups: hippocampal atrophy (HA) or normal volume (NV) cases. Hippocampi from TLE patients and age-matched controls were submitted to immunohistochemistry to evaluate neuronal population, astroglial population, and chondroitin sulfate expression with antibodies against neuron nuclei protein (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and chondroitin sulfate (CS-56) antigens, respectively. ResultsBoth TLE groups were clinically similar. NV cases had higher hippocampal volume, both ipsilateral and contralateral, when compared to HA. Compared to controls, NV and HA patients had reduced neuron density, and increased GFAP and CS-56 immunopositive area. There was no statistical difference between NV and HA groups in neuron density or immunopositive areas for GFAP and CS-56. Hippocampal volume correlated positively with neuron density in CA1 and prosubiculum, and with immunopositive areas for CS-56 in CA1, and negatively with immunopositive area for GFAP in CA1. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that both neuron density and CS-56 immunopositive area in CA1 were statistically significant predictors of hippocampal volume. SignificanceOur findings indicate that neuron density and chondroitin sulfate immunopositive area in the CA1 subfield are crucial for the hippocampal volume, and that chondroitin sulfate is important for the maintenance of a normal hippocampal volume in some cases with severe neuron loss.

To address this complex issue and to facilitate collaborative, innovative research in the rising field of neurobehavioral comorbidities and cognition disturbances in new-onset epilepsy, international epilepsy experts met at the 3rd Halifax International Epilepsy Conference & Retreat at White Point, South Shore, Nova Scotia, Canada from September 18 to 20, 2014. This Conference Proceedings provides a summary of the conference proceedings. Specifically, the following topics are discussed: (i) role of comorbidities in epilepsy diagnosis and management, (ii) role of antiepileptic medications in understanding the relationship between epilepsy and neurobehavioral and cognition problems, and (iii) animal data and diagnostic approaches. Evidence to date, though limited, strongly suggests a bidirectional relationship between epilepsy and cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. In fact, it is likely that seizures and neurobehavioral problems represent different symptoms of a common etiology or network-wide disturbance. As a reflection of this shared network, psychiatric comorbidities and/or cognition problems may actually precede the seizure occurrence and likely get often missed if not screened.

Despite their functional significance, the midbrain population of DAergic neurons is sparse, constituting only 20 000-30 000 neurons in mice, and development of novel tools to identify these cells is warranted. Here, a bacterial artificial chromosome mouse line [Dat1-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)] from the Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas (GENSAT) that expresses eGFP under control of the dopamine transporter (DAT) promoter was characterized. Confocal microscopy analysis of brain sections showed strong eGFP signal reporter in midbrain regions and striatal terminals that co-localized with the DAergic markers DAT and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Thorough quantification of co-localization of the eGFP reporter signal with DAT and TH in the ventral midbrain showed that a vast majority of eGFP-expressing neurons are DAergic. Importantly, expression profiles also revealed DAergic heterogeneity when comparing substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Dat1-eGFP mice showed neither change in synaptosomal DA uptake nor altered levels of DAT and TH in both striatum and midbrain. No behavioural difference between Dat1-eGFP and wild-type was found, suggesting that the strain is not aberrant. Finally, cell populations highly enriched in DAergic neurons can be obtained from postnatal mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and the sorted neurons can be cultured in vitro. The current investigation demonstrates that eGFP expression in this mouse line is selective for DAergic neurons, suggesting that the Dat1-eGFP mouse strain constitutes a promising tool for delineating new aspects of DA biology.

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low-and high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated by up to four raters-and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.

Optimal Strategies for Reporting Pain in Clinical Trials and Systematic Reviews: Recommendations from an OMERACT 12 Workshop	JOURNAL OF RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Review						OMERACT; OUTCOMES; PAIN; CLINICAL TRIALS; VISUAL ANALOG SCALE; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS	CHRONIC NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOTOR CORTEX RTMS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; OUTCOME MEASURES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; EFFECT SIZE; METAANALYSIS; DIFFERENCE; RELIEF	Objective. Pain is a patient-important outcome, but current reporting in randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews is often suboptimal, impeding clinical interpretation and decision making. Methods. A working group at the 2014 Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT 12) was convened to provide guidance for reporting treatment effects regarding pain for individual studies and systematic reviews. Results. For individual trials, authors should report, in addition to mean change, the proportion of patients achieving 1 or more thresholds of improvement from baseline pain (e.g., >=. 20%, >= 30%, >= 50%), achievement of a desirable pain state (e.g., no worse than mild pain), and/or a combination of change and state. Effects on pain should be accompanied by other patient-important outcomes to facilitate interpretation. When pooling data for metaanalysis, authors should consider converting all continuous measures for pain to a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and use the established, minimally important difference (MID) of 10 mm, and the conventionally used, appreciably important differences of 20 mm, 30 mm, and 50 mm, to facilitate interpretation. Effects <= 0.5 units suggest a small or very small effect. To further increase interpretability, the pooled estimate on the VAS should also be transformed to a binary outcome and expressed as a relative risk and risk difference. This transformation can be achieved by calculating the probability of experiencing a treatment effect greater than the MID and the thresholds for appreciably important differences in pain reduction in the control and intervention groups. Conclusion. Presentation of relative effects regarding pain will facilitate interpretation of treatment effects.

In this study, we searched for differences in brain structure at age 14 years in adolescents with subthreshold depression and their relation to depression at age 16 years. Method: High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess adolescents with self-reported subthreshold depression (n = 119) and healthy control adolescents (n = 461), all recruited from a community-based sample. Regional gray and white matter volumes were compared across groups using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry. The relationship between subthreshold depression at baseline and depression outcome was explored using causal mediation analyses to search for mediating effects of regional brain volumes. Results: Adolescents with subthreshold depression had and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and caudates, and smaller white matter volumes in the anterior limb of internal capsules, left forceps minor, and right cingulum. In girls, but not in boys, the relation between subthreshold depression at baseline and high depression score at follow-up was mediated by medial prefrontal gray matter volume. Conclusion: Subthreshold depression in early adolescence might be associated with smaller gray and white matter volumes in regions of the frontal striatal limbic affective circuit, and the occurrence of depression in girls with subthreshold depression might be influenced by medial prefrontal gray matter volume. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the clinical assessment methods.

They are widely used by patients, sometimes without a clear evidence base. Objective: We conducted a systematic review of animal and clinical research to determine the evidence for the benefits of OTC anti-oxidants in MS. Methods: Using predefined criteria, we searched key databases. Two authors scrutinized all studies against inclusion/exclusion criteria, assessed study risk-of-bias and extracted results. Results: Of the 3507 titles, 145 met criteria and included compounds, (alpha)-lipoic acid (ALA), anti-oxidant vitamins, Ginkgo biloba, quercetin, resveratrol and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (ECGC). The strongest evidence to support OTC anti-oxidants was for compounds EGCG and ALA in animal models; both consistently showed anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant effects and reduced neurological impairment. Only vitamin E, Ginkgo biloba and ALA were examined for efficacy in pilot clinical trials with either conflicting evidence or evidence of no benefit. Conclusion: OTC anti-oxidants EGCG and ALA show the most consistent benefit, however only in preclinical studies. There is no evidence that they alter MS relapses or progression. Future work should focus on testing more of these therapies for clinical efficacy before recommending them to MS patients.

Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus	NATURE REVIEWS NEPHROLOGY			English	Review							AQUAPORIN-2 WATER CHANNEL; LONG-TERM REGULATION; VASOPRESSIN V2 RECEPTOR; COLLECTING DUCT; RAT-KIDNEY; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONES; PROSTAGLANDIN SYNTHESIS; RENAL AQUAPORINS; AVPR2 MUTATIONS; DOWN-REGULATION	Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.

We examine here to what extent amusic adults, who have experienced pitch perception difficulties all their lives, still maintain some ability to perceive emotions from music. Amusic and control participants judged the emotions expressed by unfamiliar musical clips intended to convey happiness, sadness, fear and peacefulness (Experiment 1A). Surprisingly, most amusic individuals showed normal recognition of the four emotions tested here. This preserved ability was not due to some peculiarities of the music, since the amusic individuals showed a typical deficit in perceiving pitch violations intentionally inserted in the same clips (Experiment 1B). In Experiment 2, we tested the use of two major structural determinants of musical emotions: tempo and mode. Neutralization of tempo had the same effect on both amusics and controls' emotional ratings. In contrast, amusics did not respond to a change of mode as markedly as controls did. Moreover, unlike the control participants, amusics' judgments were not influenced by subtle differences in pitch, such as the number of semitones changed by the mode manipulation. Instead, amusics showed normal sensitivity to fluctuations in energy, to pulse clarity, and to timbre differences, such as roughness. Amusics even showed sensitivity to key clarity and to large mean pitch differences in distinguishing happy from sad music. Thus, the pitch perception deficit experienced by amusic adults had only mild consequences on emotional judgments. In sum, emotional responses to music may be possible in this condition.

Accordingly, retinoid signaling is involved in multiple biologic processes, including development, cell differentiation, metabolism, and cell death. However, the role and function of RXRs in different heterodimer complexes remain unidentified, mainly because most RXR drugs (called rexinoids) are not selective of specific heterodimer complexes. The lack of selectivity strongly limits the use of rexinoids for specific therapeutic approaches. To better characterize rexinoids at specific NR complexes, we have developed and optimized luciferase (Luc) protein complementation(PCA)-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays that can directly measure recruitment of a coactivator (CoA) motif fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) by specific NR dimers. To validate the assays, we compared rexinoid modulation of CoA recruitment by the RXR homodimer and by the heterodimers Nur77/RXR and Nurr1/RXR. Results revealed that some rexinoids display selective CoA recruitment activities with homo-or heterodimer complexes. In particular, SR11237 (BMS649) has stronger potency for recruitment of CoA motif and transcriptional activity with the heterodimer Nur77/RXR than other complexes. This technology should be useful in identifying new compounds with specificity for individual dimeric species formed by NRs.

This study analyzes nine different movements taken from 48 children evenly distributed among three different school grades corresponding to pupils aged 3, 4, and 5 years. On the one hand, our results show that the ability to perform graphomotor activities depends on kindergarten grades. More importantly, this study shows which performance criteria, from sophisticated neuromotor modeling as well as more classical kinematic parameters, can differentiate children of different school grades. These criteria provide a valuable tool for studying children's graphomotor control learning strategies. On the other hand, from a practical point of view, it is observed that school grades do not clearly reflect pupils' graphomotor performances. This calls for a large-scale investigation, using a more efficient experimental design based on the various observations made throughout this study regarding the choice of the graphic shapes, the number of repetitions and the features to analyze.

Errors associated with tracking, tool calibration and registration between a physical object and its corresponding image were investigated and compared with theoretical descriptions of these errors. A precision milled linear testing apparatus was constructed to perform the measurements. The tracking error was shown to increase in linear fashion with distance normal to the camera, and the tracking error ranged between 0.15 and 0.6 mm. The tool calibration error increased as a function of distance from the camera and the reference tool (0.2-0.8 mm). The fiducial registration error was shown to improve when more points were used up until a plateau value was reached which corresponded to the total fiducial localization error (0.8 mm). The target registration error distributions followed a distribution with the largest error and variation around fiducial points. To minimize errors, tools should be calibrated as close as possible to the reference tool and camera, and tools should be used as close to the front edge of the camera throughout the intervention, with the camera pointed in the direction where accuracy is least needed during surgery.

Improving recorded volume in mesial temporal lobe by optimizing stereotactic intracranial electrode implantation planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG); Depth electrode implantation; Trajectory optimization; Intracranial EEG recording; Automatic target segmentation	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; CLINICAL ARTICLE; EPILEPSY SURGERY; SEGMENTATION; STEREOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; HIPPOCAMPUS; SYSTEM; MRI; EEG	Intracranial electrodes are sometimes implanted in patients with refractory epilepsy to identify epileptic foci and propagation. Maximal recording of EEG activity from regions suspected of seizure generation is paramount. However, the location of individual contacts cannot be considered with current manual planning approaches. We propose and validate a procedure for optimizing intracranial electrode implantation planning that maximizes the recording volume, while constraining trajectories to safe paths. Retrospective data from 20 patients with epilepsy that had electrodes implanted in the mesial temporal lobes were studied. Clinical imaging data (CT/A and T1w MRI) were automatically segmented to obtain targets and structures to avoid. These data were used as input to the optimization procedure. Each electrode was modeled to assess risk, while individual contacts were modeled to estimate their recording capability. Ordered lists of trajectories per target were obtained. Global optimization generated the best set of electrodes. The procedure was integrated into a neuronavigation system. Trajectories planned automatically covered statistically significant larger target volumes than manual plans . Median volume coverage was for automatic plans versus for manual plans. Furthermore, automatic plans remained at statistically significant safer distance to vessels and sulci . Surgeon's scores of the optimized electrode sets indicated that 95 % of the automatic trajectories would be likely considered for use in a clinical setting. This study suggests that automatic electrode planning for epilepsy provides safe trajectories and increases the amount of information obtained from the intracranial investigation.

Enhancing decision-making and cognitive impulse control with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC): A randomized and sham-controlled exploratory study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Decision-making; Impulse control; Neuromodulation; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Orbitofrontal cortex	RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IOWA GAMBLING TASK; BRAIN-STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; NEURAL BASIS; FMRI; NEUROBIOLOGY	Background: Decision-making and impulse control (both cognitive and motor) are complex interrelated processes which rely on a distributed neural network that includes multiple cortical and subcortical regions. Among them, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) seems to be particularly relevant as demonstrated by several neuropsychological and neuroimaging investigations. Methods: In the present study we assessed whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied bilaterally over the OFC is able to modulate decision-making and cognitive impulse control. More specifically, 45 healthy subjects were randomized to receive a single 30-min session of active or sham anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) applied over either the left or the right OFC (coupled with contralateral cathodal tDCS). They were also assessed pre- and post-tDCS with a battery of computerized tasks. Results: Our results show that participants who received active anodal tDCS (irrespective of laterality), vs. those who received sham tDCS, displayed more advantageous decision-making (i.e., increased Iowa Gambling Task "net scores" [p = 0.04]), as well as improved cognitive impulse control (i.e., decreased "interference" in the Stroop Word-Colour Task [p = 0.007]). However, we did not observe tDCS-related effects on mood (assessed by visual analogue scales), attentional levels (assessed by the Continuous Performance Task) or motor impulse control (assessed by the Stop-Signal Task). Conclusions: Our study potentially serves as a key translational step towards the development of novel non-invasive neuromodulation-based therapeutic interventions directly targeting vulnerability factors for psychiatric conditions such as suicidal behaviour and addiction.

ACF chromatin-remodeling complex mediates stress-induced depressive-like behavior	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							HISTONE METHYLATION; SOCIAL DEFEAT; MAJOR DEPRESSION; IN-VIVO; ISWI; ACETYLATION; DISORDERS; SUBUNIT; TRANSCRIPTION; COMORBIDITY	Improved treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) remains elusive because of the limited understanding of its underlying biological mechanisms. It is likely that stress-induced maladaptive transcriptional regulation in limbic neural circuits contributes to the development of MDD, possibly through epigenetic factors that regulate chromatin structure. We establish that persistent upregulation of the ACF (ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, occurring in the nucleus accumbens of stress-susceptible mice and depressed humans, is necessary for stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. We found that altered ACF binding after chronic stress was correlated with altered nucleosome positioning, particularly around the transcription start sites of affected genes. These alterations in ACF binding and nucleosome positioning were associated with repressed expression of genes implicated in susceptibility to stress. Together, our findings identify the ACF chromatin-remodeling complex as a critical component in the development of susceptibility to depression and in regulating stress-related behaviors.

Materials and Methods Using magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling, regional cerebral blood flow was measured at a term-equivalent age for three very preterm newborns (born at < 32 weeks), one newborn with congenital heart disease before his corrective surgery and three healthy newborns. In addition, a histopathological analysis was performed on a newborn with congenital heart disease. Results The very preterm newborns and the newborn with congenital heart disease included in this study all displayed an increased signal in their white matter on T2-weighted imaging. The cerebral blood flow of these newborns was increased in their white matter, compared with the healthy term newborns. The vascular endothelial growth factor was overexpressed in the injured white matter of the newborn with congenital heart disease. Conclusion Brain perfusion may be increased at term in the white matter, in very preterm newborns, and newborns with congenital heart disease, and it correlates with white matter abnormalities on conventional imaging.

Gray matter differences linked to autism spectrum disorder have been studied using a variety of structural imaging methods, but yielded little consensus; the extent to which disparate results reflect differences in methodology or heterogeneity within autism spectrum disorder is not yet clear. Moreover, very few studies have examined gray matter changes as a function of age in autism spectrum disorder. METHOD: A detailed investigation of gray matter structural development was performed via voxel-based morphometry, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area analyses in 38 autism spectrum disorder versus 46 typically developing children. RESULTS: Relative to typically developing children, the autism spectrum disorder group showed gray matter increases most prominently in the frontal and temporal lobes (including regions such as medial frontal gyrus, Broca's area and posterior temporal cortex), as well as certain parietal and occipital subcortical regions. Gray matter decreases were found only near the temporoparietal junction. Subcortical gray matter increases were found in the putamen and caudate nucleus, while decreases were found in cerebellum. There were age-dependent GM differences in distributed regions including prefrontal cortex, primary sensorimotor cortex, and temporoparietal junction. CONCLUSION: The results underline the distributed nature of gray matter structural differences in autism spectrum disorder and provide a more comprehensive characterization of autism spectrum disorder related cortical and subcortical gray matter structural differences during childhood and adolescent development.

Methods: Twenty-two SCZ-TR patients on clozapine, 24 schizophrenia patients on antipsychotics other than clozapine, and 39 healthy controls were scanned using functional neuroimaging while viewing positive, negative and neutral images. Results: Emotionally-laden images (positive and negative) elicited hyper-activations in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex and left cerebellum in SCZ-TR patients, compared to the two other groups. Similarly, neutral images prompted hyper-activations in the cingulate gyrus in SCZ-TR patients, relative to the two other groups. Conclusions: Treatment resistance is associated with neuro-functional hyper-activations in schizophrenia patients during emotion processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Psychophysical inference of frequency-following fidelity in the neural substrate for brain stimulation reward	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Intracranial self-stimulation; Brain stimulation reward; Lateral hypothalamus; Frequency following; Medial forebrain bundle; Dopamine	MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; SELF-STIMULATION; CONDUCTION-VELOCITY; REFRACTORY PERIOD; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; HYPOTHALAMIC-STIMULATION; OPERANT PERFORMANCE; IMPULSE CONDUCTION	The rewarding effect of electrical brain stimulation has been studied extensively for 60 years, yet the identity of the underlying neural circuitry remains unknown. Previous experiments have characterized the directly stimulated ("first-stage") neurons implicated in self-stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. Their properties are consistent with those of fine, myelinated axons, at least some of which project rostro-caudally. These properties do not match those of dopaminergic neurons. The present psychophysical experiment estimates an additional first-stage characteristic: maximum firing frequency. We test a frequency-following model that maps the experimenter-set pulse frequency into the frequency of firing induced in the directly stimulated neurons. As pulse frequency is increased, firing frequency initially increases at the same rate, then becomes probabilistic, and finally levels off. The frequency-following function is based on the counter model which holds that the rewarding effect of a pulse train is determined by the aggregate spike rate triggered in first-stage neurons during a given interval. In 7 self-stimulating rats, we measured current- vs. pulse-frequency trade-off functions. The trade-off data were well described by the frequency-following model, and its upper asymptote was approached at a median value of 360 Hz (IQR=46 Hz). This value implies a highly excitable, non-dopaminergic population of first-stage neurons. Incorporating the frequency-following function and parameters in Shizgal's 3-dimensional reward-mountain model improves its accuracy and predictive power. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Glutamate levels in migraine patients, but not controls, correlated with the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the primary visual cortex during visual stimulation. Conclusion Migraine with visual aura appears to disrupt the excitation-inhibition coupling in the occipital cortex.	[Bridge, Holly; Stagg, Charlotte J.; Cader, M.

The severe phenotype in patients suffering from mutations inactivating LIFR beta indicates that members of this cytokine family play key, non-redundant roles during development. Accordingly, three decades of research has revealed potent and promising trophic and regulatory activities of CNTF in neurons, oligodendrocytes, muscle cells, bone cells, adipocytes and retinal cells. These findings led to clinical trials to test the therapeutic potential of CNTF and CNTF derivatives for treating neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. Promising results have encouraged continuation of studies for treating retinal degenerative diseases. Results of some clinical trials showed that side-effects may limit the systemically administrated doses of CNTF. Therefore, therapies being currently tested rely on local delivery of CNTF using encapsulated cytokine-secreting implants. Since the side effects of CNTF might be linked to its ability to activate the alternative IL6R alpha-LIFR beta-gp130 receptor, CNTFR-specific mutants of CNTF have been developed that bind to the CNTFR alpha-LIFR beta-gp130 receptor. These developments may prove to be a breakthrough for therapeutic applications of systemically administered CNTF in pathologies such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease. The "designer cytokine approach" offers future opportunities to further enhance specificity by conjugating mutant CNTF with modified soluble CNTFR alpha to target therapeutically relevant cells that express gp130-LIFR beta and a specific cell surface marker.

RMND1 deficiency associated with neonatal lactic acidosis, infantile onset renal failure, deafness, and multiorgan involvement	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSLATION DEFECT; SIDEROBLASTIC ANEMIA-MLASA; COMPLEX DEFICIENCIES; MUTATION; MYOPATHY; PROTEINS; GENE	RMND1 is an integral inner membrane mitochondrial protein that assembles into a large 240 kDa complex to support translation of the 13 polypeptides encoded on mtDNA, all of which are essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. Variants in RMND1 produce global defects in mitochondrial translation and were first reported in patients with severe neurological phenotypes leading to mortality in the first months of life. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous RMND1 variants in a 4-year-old patient with congenital lactic acidosis, severe myopathy, hearing loss, renal failure, and dysautonomia. The levels of mitochondrial ribosome proteins were reduced in patient fibroblasts, causing a translation defect, which was rescued by expression of the wild-type cDNA. RMND1 was almost undetectable by immunoblot analysis in patient muscle and fibroblasts. BN-PAGE analysis showed a severe combined OXPHOS assembly defect that was more prominent in patient muscle than in fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that RMND1 localizes to discrete foci in the mitochondrial network, juxtaposed to RNA granules where the primary mitochondrial transcripts are processed. RMND1 foci were not detected in patient fibroblasts. We hypothesize that RMND1 acts to anchor or stabilize the mitochondrial ribosome near the sites where the mRNAs are matured, spatially coupling post-transcriptional handling mRNAs with their translation, and that loss of function variants in RMND1 are associated with a unique constellation of clinical phenotypes that vary with the severity of the mitochondrial translation defect.

The older brother had global developmental delay and spastic paraplegia. Brain MRIs from these two affected individuals showed moderate to severe cerebellar atrophy. To identify the genetic basis for their disease, we conducted a whole exome sequencing (WES) investigation using genomic DNA prepared from the affected sibs and their healthy father. We identified two mutations in the SIL1 gene, which is reported to cause Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. This study emphasizes how the diagnosis of patients with ataxic gait and cerebellar atrophy may benefit from WES to identify the genetic cause of their condition.

Objectives: We sought to investigate the potential value of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide pertaining to the prediction of coronary artery dilatation (Z-score>2.5) and/or of resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. We hypothesised that increased serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level correlates with increased coronary artery dilatation and/or resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin. Methods: We carried out a prospective study involving newly diagnosed patients treated with 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin within 5-10 days of onset of fever. Echocardiography was performed in all patients at onset, then weekly for 3 weeks, then at month 2, and month 3. Coronary arteries were measured at each visit, and coronary artery Z-score was calculated. All the patients had N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide serum level measured at onset, and the Z-score calculated. Results: There were 109 patients enrolled at 6.58 +/- 2.82 days of fever, age 3.79 +/- 2.92 years. High N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was associated with coronary artery dilatation at onset in 22.2 versus 5.6% for normal N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels (odds ratio 4.8 [95% confidence interval 1.05-22.4]; p=0.031). This was predictive of cumulative coronary artery dilatation for the first 3 months (p=0.04-0.02), but not during convalescence at 2-3 months (odds ratio 1.28 [95% confidence interval 0.23-7.3]; p=non-significant). Elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels did not predict intravenous immunoglobulin resistance, 15.3 versus 13.5% (p=1). Conclusion: Elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level correlates with acute coronary artery dilatation in treated Kawasaki disease, but not with intravenous immunoglobulin resistance.

We measured reaction time (RT) and accuracy, during a computerized Stroop task, in 19 young adults (7 males and 12 females). Their mean +/- A SD age, height, body mass and body mass index (BMI) were 24 +/- A 4 years, 1.67 +/- A 0.07 m, 72 +/- A 14 kg and 25 +/- A 3 kg m(-2), respectively. Each subject performed the Stroop task at rest and during cycling at exercise of low intensity [40 % of peak power output (PPO)], moderate intensity (60 % of PPO) and high intensity (85 % of PPO). Cerebral oxygenation was monitored during the resting and exercise conditions over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). High-intensity exercise slowed RT in both the Naming (p = 0.04) and the Executive condition (p = 0.04). The analysis also revealed that high-intensity exercise was associated with a decreased accuracy when compared to low-intensity exercise (p = 0.021). Neuroimaging results confirm a decrease of cerebral oxygenation during high-intensity exercise in comparison to low- (p = 0.004) and moderate-intensity exercise (p = 0.003). Correlations revealed that a lower cerebral HbO(2) in the prefrontal cortex was associated with slower RT in the Executive condition only (p = 0.04, g = -0.72). Results of the present study suggest that low to moderate exercise intensity does not alter Executive functioning, but that exercise impairs cognitive functions (Executive and non-Executive) when the physical workload becomes heavy. The cerebral HbO(2) correlation suggests that a lower availability of HbO(2) was associated with slower RT in the Executive condition only.

J	Safi-Harb, M; Proulx, S; von Ellenrieder, N; Gotman, J				Safi-Harb, Mouna; Proulx, Sebastien; von Ellenrieder, Nicolas; Gotman, Jean			Advantages and disadvantages of a fast fMRI sequence in the context of EEG-fMRI investigation of epilepsy patients: A realistic simulation study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BOLD HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; SPIKES; ENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; TRAJECTORIES; SENSITIVITY; ACTIVATION	EEG-fMRI is an established technique to allow mapping BOLD changes in response to interictal discharges recorded in the EEG of epilepsy patients. Traditional fMRI experiments rely on an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a time resolution given by its time-to-repetition (TR) of similar to 2 s. Recently, multiple fast fMRI sequences have been developed to get around the limited temporal resolution of the EPI sequence, and achieved a TR in the 100 ms range or lower. One such sequence is called Magnetic Resonance EncephaloGraphy (MREG). Its high temporal resolution should offer increased detection sensitivity and statistical power in the context of epilepsy studies and in fMRI experiments in general. The aim of this work was to investigate the advantages and disadvantages offered by MREG. This was done by superimposing artificial event-related BOLD responses on EPI and MREG background signals, from 5 epileptic patients, that were free of epileptic discharges (spikes) on simultaneously recorded EEG. These functional datasets simulated different spiking rates and hemodynamic response amplitudes, and were analyzed with the commonly used General Linear Model (GLM) with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) as a fixed model of the response. Robustness to violation of the assumptions of the GLM was additionally assessed with similar simulations using variable spike-to-spike response amplitudes and 8 non-canonical HRFs. Consistent with previous work, MREG yields higher maximum statistical t-values than EPI, but our simulations showed these statistics to be inflated, as the false positive rate at a standard threshold was high. At thresholds set to appropriately control specificity, EPI showed better true positive rate and larger cluster size than MREG. However, the lack of an appropriate calibration of the amplitude of the responses across the sequences precludes definitive judgment on their relative sensitivity. In addition, we show that a mismatch between the assumed and actual HRF impairs more MREG detection performance, but that EPI is more affected by non-modeled spike-to-spike variations of response amplitude. Filtering-out physiological noise, which is not aliased at the fast sampling rate of MREG, and the modeling of temporal autocorrelation are advantageous in increasing the detection power of MREG. This simulation study 1) warrants care when interpreting statistical t-values from fast fMRI sequences, 2) proposes thresholds for valid inferences and processing methods for maximal sensitivities, and 3) demonstrates the relative robustness/susceptibility of MREG and EPI to violation of the GLM's assumptions.

However, very little is known about how direct gaze is processed during live interaction with a real partner. Here, for the first time we used an experimental setup allowing the participant inside an MRI scanner to interact face-to-face with a partner located in the scanner room. Depending on condition, the participant and the partner were instructed either to look at each other in the eyes or to direct their gaze away from the other. As control conditions, participants gazed at their own eyes, reflected in a mirror, or gazed at a picture of the partner's eyes. Results revealed that direct gaze by the partner was associated with activity in areas involved in production and comprehension of language and action, including the IFG, the premotor cortex (PM), and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Activations in these areas were observed regardless of the participant's gaze behavior. In contrast, increased activity in arMPFC, an area involved in inference of other mental states during social interaction and communication, was only observed when the participant reciprocated the partner's direct gaze so as to establish mutual gaze. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed effective connectivity between the IFG and the arMPFC during mutual gaze. This suggests that, within a larger network concerned with the processing of social gaze, mutual gaze with a real partner is established by an increased coupling between areas involved in the detection of communicative intentions, language, and social interaction.

Multivariate combination of magnetization transfer, T-2* and B0 orientation to study the myelo-architecture of the in vivo human cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MTR; T-2*; B0 orientation; Myeloarchitecture; ICA; Brodmann	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HIGH-FIELD MRI; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS BRAIN; WHITE-MATTER; 7 T; TRANSFER RATIO; FIBER ORIENTATION; CORTICAL AREAS; POSTMORTEM	Recently, T-2* imaging at 7 Tesla (T) MRI was shown to reveal microstructural features of the cortical myeloarchitecture thanks to an increase in contrast-to-noise ratio. However, several confounds hamper the specificity of T-2* measures (iron content, blood vessels, tissues orientation). Anothermetric, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), is known to also be sensitive to myelin content and thus would be an excellent complementary measure because its underlying contrast mechanisms are different than that from T-2*. The goal of this study was thus to combine MTR and T-2* using multivariate statistics in order to gain insights into cortical myelin content. Seven healthy subjects were scanned at 7 T and 3 T to obtain T-2* and MTR data, respectively. A multivariate myelin estimation model (MMEM) was developed, and consists in (i) normalizing T-2* and MTR values and (ii) extracting their shared information using independent component analysis (ICA). B0 orientation dependence and cortical thickness were also computed and included in the model. Results showed high correlation between MTR and T-2* in the whole cortex (r = 0.76, p < 10(-16)), suggesting that both metrics are partly driven by a common source of contrast, here assumed to be the myelin. Average MTR and T-2* were respectively 31.0+/-0.3% and 32.1+/-1.4 ms. Results of the MMEM spatial distribution showed similar trends to that from histological work stained for myelin (r = 0.77, p < 0.01). Significant right-left differences were detected in the primary motor cortex (p < 0.05), the posterior cingulate cortex (p < 0.05) and the visual cortex (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that MTR and T-2* are highly correlated in the cortex. The combination of MTR, T-2*, CT and B0 orientation may be a useful means to study cortical myeloarchitecture with more specificity than using any of the individual methods. The MMEM framework is extendable to other contrasts such as T-1 and diffusion MRI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However there is currently no standardized localization procedure to reliably identify specific areas across individuals such as the standard 'localizers' available in the visual domain. Here we present an fMRI 'voice localizer' scan allowing rapid and reliable localization of the voice-sensitive 'temporal voice areas' (TVA) of human auditory cortex. We describe results obtained using this standardized localizer scan in a large cohort of normal adult subjects. Most participants (94%) showed bilateral patches of significantly greater response to vocal than nonvocal sounds along the superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (STS/STG). Individual activation patterns, although reproducible, showed high inter-individual variability in precise anatomical location. Cluster analysis of individual peaks from the large cohort highlighted three bilateral clusters of voice-sensitivity, or "voice patches" along posterior (TVAp), mid (TVAm) and anterior (TVAa) STS/STG, respectively. A series of extra-temporal areas including bilateral inferior prefrontal cortex and amygdalae showed small, but reliable voice-sensitivity as part of a large-scale cerebral voice network. Stimuli for the voice localizer scan and probabilistic maps in MNI space are available for download. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

White matter atlas of the human spinal cord with estimation of partial volume effect	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MRI; Spinal cord; Atlas; Template; White matter	DIFFEOMORPHIC IMAGE REGISTRATION; IN-VIVO DTI; OF-THE-ART; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; GRAY-MATTER; 3 TESLA; SEGMENTATION; RESOLUTION; DISABILITY	Template-based analysis has proven to be an efficient, objective and reproducible way of extracting relevant information from multi-parametric MRI data. Using common atlases, it is possible to quantify MRI metrics within specific regions without the need for manual segmentation. This method is therefore free from user-bias and amenable to group studies. While template-based analysis is common procedure for the brain, there is currently no atlas of the white matter (WM) spinal pathways. The goals of this study were: (i) to create an atlas of the white matter tracts compatible with the MNI-Poly-AMU template and (ii) to propose methods to quantify metrics within the atlas that account for partial volume effect. The WM atlas was generated by: (i) digitalizing an existing WM atlas from a well-known source (Gray's Anatomy), (ii) registering this atlas to the MNI-Poly-AMU template at the corresponding slice (C4 vertebral level), (iii) propagating the atlas throughout all slices of the template (C1 to T6) using regularized diffeomorphic transformations and (iv) computing partial volume values for each voxel and each tract. Several approaches were implemented and validated to quantifymetrics within the atlas, including weighted-average and Gaussian mixture models. Proof-of-concept application was done in five subjects for quantifying magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in each tract of the atlas. The resulting WM atlas showed consistent topological organization and smooth transitions along the rostrocaudal axis. The median MTR across tracts was 26.2. Significant differences were detected across tracts, vertebral levels and subjects, but not across laterality (right-left). Among the different tested approaches to extract metrics, the maximum a posteriori showed highest performance with respect to noise, inter-tract variability, tract size and partial volume effect. This new WM atlas of the human spinal cord overcomes the biases associated with manual delineation and partial volume effect. Combined with multi-parametric data, the atlas can be applied to study demyelination and degeneration in diseases such as multiple sclerosis and will facilitate the conduction of longitudinal and multi-center studies.

Pituitary volume and clinical trajectory in young relatives at risk for schizophrenia	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Familial risk; MRI; pituitary; psychosis; schizophrenia	ULTRA-HIGH-RISK; FAMILIAL HIGH-RISK; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; ADRENAL AXIS; DEVELOPING PSYCHOSIS; GLAND VOLUME; GENERAL-POPULATION; DOPAMINE RELEASE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; STRESS MODEL	Background. Stress and vulnerability likely interact to play a major role in psychosis. While much has been written about the neural diathesis-stress model in psychosis and its clinical risk states, little is known about HPA axis biomarkers in non-help-seeking individuals at familial high risk (FHR). We sought to prospectively measure pituitary volume (PV) in adolescents and young adults at FHR for schizophrenia and to follow their emerging sub-clinical psychotic symptoms and clinical trajectories. Method. Forty healthy controls and 38 relatives of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were identified in Pittsburgh, USA. PV was derived from baseline 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging. Chapman's schizotypy scales were acquired at baseline, and structured clinical interviews for DSM-IV-TR Axis I diagnoses were attempted annually for up to 3 years. Results. Seven individuals converted to psychosis. PV did not differ between FHR and control groups overall. Within the FHR group, PV was positively correlated with Chapman's positive schizotypy (Magical Ideation and Perceptual Aberration) scores, and there was a significant group x PV interaction with schizotypy. PV was significantly higher in FHR subjects carrying any baseline Axis I diagnosis (p = 0.004), and higher still in individuals who went on to convert to psychosis (p = 0.0007). Conclusions. Increased PV is a correlate of early positive schizotypy, and may predict trait vulnerability to subsequent psychosis in FHR relatives. These preliminary findings support a model of stress-vulnerability and HPA axis activation in the early phases of psychosis.	[Shah, J. L.; Tandon, N.; Howard, E. R.; Keshavan, M.

Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 inhibitors attenuate the effect of cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 and human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis serum on glomerular filtration barrier	TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article							NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR-RECEPTOR; CELL-STIMULATING FACTOR-3; INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME; CHANGE NEPHROTIC SYNDROME; SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITOR; UROKINASE RECEPTOR; PERMEABILITY FACTORS; MITOCHONDRIAL STAT3; KIDNEY DEVELOPMENT; SIGNAL TRANSDUCER	Recurrence of idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) after renal transplantation is believed to be caused by a circulating factor(s). We detected cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), a member of the interleukin 6 family, in the plasma from patients with recurrent FSGS. We hypothesized that CLCF1 contributes to the effect of FSGS serum on the glomerular filtration barrier in vitro. Presently, we studied the effect of CLCF1 on isolated rat glomeruli using an in vitro assay of albumin permeability (P-alb). CLCF1 (0.05-100 ng/mL) increased P-alb and caused maximal effect at 5-10 ng/mL (P < 0.001). The increase in P-alb was analogous to the effect of FSGS serum. Anti-CLCF1 monoclonal antibody blocked the CLCF1-induced increase in P-alb and significantly attenuated the effect of FSGS serum (P < 0.001). The heterodimer composed of CLCF1 and cosecreted molecule cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1) attenuated the increase in P-alb caused by CLCF1 or FSGS serum. Western blot analysis showed that CLCF1 upregulated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Tyr705) in glomeruli. This effect was diminished by the heterodimer CLCF1-CRLF1. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor BMS-1119543 or STAT3 inhibitor Stattic significantly blocked the effect of CLCF1 or FSGS serum on P-alb (P < 0.001). These novel findings suggest that when monomeric CLCF1 increases P-alb, the heterodimer CLCF1-CRLF1 may protect the glomerular filtration barrier. We speculate that albuminuria in FSGS is related to qualitative or quantitative changes in the CLCF1-CRLF1 complex, and that JAK2 or STAT3 inhibitors may be novel therapeutic agents to treat FSGS.

Hyperoxia Exacerbates Myocardial Ischemia in the Presence of Acute Coronary Artery Stenosis in Swine	CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS			English	Article						coronary stenosis; hyperoxia; ischemia; magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen; swine		Background-Current guidelines limit the use of high oxygen tension after return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest, focusing on neurological outcome and mortality. Little is known about the impact of hyperoxia on the ischemic heart. Oxygen is frequently administered and is generally expected to be beneficial. This study seeks to assess the effects of hyperoxia on myocardia oxygenation in the presence of severe coronary artery stenosis in swine. Methods and Results-In 22 healthy pigs, we surgically attached a magnetic resonance compatible flow probe to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 11 pigs, a hydraulic occluder was inflated distal to the flow probe. After increasing PaO2 to >300 mm Hg, LAD flow decreased in all animals. In 8 stenosed animals with a mean fractional flow reserve of 0.64 +/- 0.02, hyperoxia resulted in a significant decrease of myocardial signal intensity in oxygenation-sensitive cardiovascular magnetic resonance images of the midapical segments of the LAD territory. This was not seen in remote myocardium or in the other 8 healthy animals. The decreased signal intensity was accompanied by a decrease in circumferential strain in the same segments. Furthermore, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and oxygen extraction ratio declined in these animals. Changing PaCO2 levels did not have a significant effect on any of the parameters; however, hypercapnia seemed to nonsignificantly attenuate the hyperoxia-induced changes. Conclusions-Ventilation-induced hyperoxia may decrease myocardial oxygenation and lead to ischemia in myocardium subject to severe coronary artery stenosis.

Nitrosative modifications of the Ca2+ release complex and actin underlie arthritis-induced muscle weakness	ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article							NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; COLLAGEN-INDUCED ARTHRITIS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; INTRACELLULAR CALCIUM; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; SUDDEN-DEATH; PEROXYNITRITE; MICE; EXERCISE; FORCE	Objective Skeletal muscle weakness is a prominent clinical feature in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the underlying mechanism(s) is unknown. Here we investigate the mechanisms behind arthritis-induced skeletal muscle weakness with special focus on the role of nitrosative stress on intracellular Ca2+ handling and specific force production. Methods Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression, degree of nitrosative stress and composition of the major intracellular Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor 1, RyR1) complex were measured in muscle. Changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) and force production were assessed in single-muscle fibres and isolated myofibrils using atomic force cantilevers. Results The total neuronal NOS (nNOS) levels were increased in muscles both from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice and patients with RA. The nNOS associated with RyR1 was increased and accompanied by increased [Ca2+](i) during contractions of muscles from CIA mice. A marker of peroxynitrite-derived nitrosative stress (3-nitrotyrosine, 3-NT) was increased on the RyR1 complex and on actin of muscles from CIA mice. Despite increased [Ca2+](i), individual CIA muscle fibres were weaker than in healthy controls, that is, force per cross-sectional area was decreased. Furthermore, force and kinetics were impaired in CIA myofibrils, hence actin and myosin showed decreased ability to interact, which could be a result of increased 3-NT content on actin. Conclusions Arthritis-induced muscle weakness is linked to nitrosative modifications of the RyR1 protein complex and actin, which are driven by increased nNOS associated with RyR1 and progressively increasing Ca2+ activation.

Enhancing both motor and cognitive functioning in Parkinson's disease: Aerobic exercise as a rehabilitative intervention	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Aerobic exercise; Cognition; Motor; Executive functions; Procedural learning	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; REACTION-TIME-TASK; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; OLDER-ADULTS; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; BASAL GANGLIA; PEOPLE; PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; BENEFITS	Background: Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to provide health benefits in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is yet unknown to what extent AET also improves cognitive and procedural learning capacities, which ensure an optimal daily functioning. Objective: In the current study, we assessed the effects of a 3-month AET program on executive functions (EF), implicit motor sequence learning (MSL) capacity, as well as on different health-related outcome indicators. Methods: Twenty healthy controls (HC) and 19 early PD individuals participated in a supervised, high-intensity, stationary recumbent bike-training program (3 times/week for 12 weeks). Exercise prescription started at 20 min (+5 min/week up to 40 mm) based on participant's maximal aerobic power. Before and after AET, EF tests assessed participants' inhibition and flexibility functions, whereas implicit MSL capacity was evaluated using a version of the Serial Reaction Time Task. Results: The AET program was effective as indicated by significant improvement in aerobic capacity in all participants. Most importantly, AET improved inhibition but not flexibility, and motor learning skill, in both groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that AET can be a valuable non-pharmacological intervention to promote physical fitness in early PD, but also better cognitive and procedural functioning.

Parkin maintains mitochondrial levels of the protective Parkinson's disease-related enzyme 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION			English	Article							UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME SYSTEM; E3 LIGASE PARKIN; DEFICIENT MICE; DAMAGED MITOCHONDRIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RNASE P; PINK1; MITOPHAGY; PROTEIN; DEGRADATION	Mutations of the PARK2 and PINK1 genes, encoding the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Parkin and the mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase PINK1, respectively, cause autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin and PINK1 cooperate in a biochemical mitochondrial quality control pathway regulating mitochondrial morphology, dynamics and clearance. This study identifies the multifunctional PD-related mitochondrial matrix enzyme 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (HSD17B10) as a new Parkin substrate. Parkin overproduction in cells increased mitochondrial HSD17B10 abundance by a mechanism involving ubiquitin chain extension, whereas PARK2 downregulation or deficiency caused mitochondrial HSD17B10 depletion in cells and mice. HSD17B10 levels were also found to be low in the brains of PD patients with PARK2 mutations. Confocal and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy revealed that HSD17B10 recruited Parkin to the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM), close to PINK1, both in functional mitochondria and after the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m). PD-causing PARK2 mutations impaired interaction with HSD17B10 and the HSD17B10-dependent mitochondrial translocation of Parkin. HSD17B10 overproduction promoted mitochondrial elongation and mitigated CCCP-induced mitochondrial degradation independently of enzymatic activity. These effects were abolished by overproduction of the fission-promiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). By contrast, siRNA-mediated HSD17B10 silencing enhanced mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. These findings suggest that the maintenance of appropriate mitochondrial HSD17B10 levels is one of the mechanisms by which Parkin preserves mitochondrial quality. The loss of this protective mechanism may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal degeneration in autosomal recessive PD.

Neuronal NLRP1 inflammasome activation of Caspase-1 coordinately regulates inflammatory interleukin-1-beta production and axonal degeneration-associated Caspase-6 activation	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION			English	Article							AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MOLECULAR PLATFORM; NALP3 INFLAMMASOME; BETA-PEPTIDE; EXPRESSION; APOPTOSIS; DEATH	Neuronal active Caspase-6 (Casp6) is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), cognitive impairment, and axonal degeneration. Caspase-1 (Casp1) can activate Casp6 but the expression and functionality of Casp1-activating inflammasomes has not been well-defined in human neurons. Here, we show that primary cultures of human CNS neurons expressed functional Nod-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1), absent in melanoma 2, and ICE protease activating factor, but not the NLRP3, inflammasome receptor components. NLRP1 neutralizing antibodies in a cell-free system, and NLRP1 siRNAs in neurons hampered stress-induced Casp1 activation. NLRP1 and Casp1 siRNAs also abolished stress-induced Casp6 activation in neurons. The functionality of the NLRP1 inflammasome in serum-deprived neurons was also demonstrated by NLRP1 siRNA-mediated inhibition of speck formation of the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain conjugated to green fluorescent protein. These results indicated a novel stress-induced intraneuronal NLRP1/Casp1/Casp6 pathway. Lipopolysaccharide induced Casp1 and Casp6 activation in wild-type mice brain cortex, but not in that of Nlrp1(-/-) and Casp1(-/-) mice. NLRP1 immunopositive neurons were increased 25- to 30-fold in AD brains compared with non-AD brains. NLRP1 immunoreactivity in these neurons co-localized with Casp6 activity. Furthermore, the NLRP1/Casp1/Casp6 pathway increased amyloid beta peptide 42 ratio in serum-deprived neurons. Therefore, CNS human neurons express functional NLRP1 inflammasomes, which activate Casp1 and subsequently Casp6, thus revealing a fundamental mechanism linking intraneuronal inflammasome activation to Casp1-generated interleukin-1-beta-mediated neuroinflammation and Casp6-mediated axonal degeneration.

Here, we test the hypothesis that genes associated with NDDs continue to have a role in adult human brain to explore the idea that NDD symptoms may be partially a result of their adult function rather than just their neurodevelopmental function. To demonstrate adult brain function, we performed expression analyses and ChIPseq in human neural stem cell(NSC) lines at different developmental stages and adult human brain, targeting two genes associated with NDDs, SATB2 and EHMT1, and the WNT signaling gene TCF7L2, which has not been associated with NDDs. Analysis of DNA interaction sites in neural stem cells reveals high (40-50 %) overlap between proliferating and differentiating cells for each gene in temporal space. Studies in adult brain demonstrate that consensus sites are similar to NSCs but occur at different genomic locations. We also performed expression analyses using BrainSpan data for NDD-associated genes SATB2, EHMT1, FMR1, MECP2, MBD5, CTNND2, RAI1, CHD8, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, TCF4, SCN2A, and DYRK1A and find high expression of these genes in adult brain, at least comparable to developing human brain, confirming that genes associated with NDDs likely have a role in adult tissue. Adult function of genes associated with NDDs might be important in clinical disease presentation and may be suitable targets for therapeutic intervention.

Comparative performance of six supervised learning methods for the development of models of hard rock pillar stability prediction	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Pillar stability; Pillar design; Hard rock mine; Supervised learning; Classification; Repeated cross-validation; R system	MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; COAL PILLARS; CROWN PILLAR; DESIGN; MINES; STRENGTH; MACHINE; SAFETY; ROOM	The prediction of pillar stability (PS) in hard rock mines is a crucial task for which many techniques and methods have been proposed in the literature including machine learning classification. In order to make the best use of the large variety of statistical and machine learning classification methods available, it is necessary to assess their performance before selecting a classifier and suggesting improvement. The objective of this paper is to compare different classification techniques for PS detection in hard rock mines. The data of this study consist of six features, namely pillar width, pillar height, the ratio of pillar width to its height, uniaxial compressive strength of the rock, pillar strength, and pillar stress. A total of 251 pillar cases between 1972 and 2011 are analyzed. Six supervised learning algorithms, including linear discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression, multilayer perceptron neural networks, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine, are evaluated for their ability to learn for PS based on different input parameter combinations. In this study, the available data set is randomly split into two parts: training set (70 %) and test set (30 %). A repeated tenfold cross-validation procedure (ten repeats) is applied to determine the optimal parameter values during modeling, and an external testing set is employed to validate the prediction performance of models. Two performance measures, namely classification accuracy rate and Cohen's kappa, are employed. The analysis of the accuracy together with kappa for the PS data set demonstrates that SVM and RF achieve comparable median classification accuracy rate and Cohen's kappa values. All models are fitted by "R" programs with the libraries and functions described in this study.

Nucleus Accumbens and Posterior Amygdala Mediate Cue-Triggered Alcohol Seeking and Suppress Behavior During the Omission of Alcohol-Predictive Cues	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							CONTEXT-INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COCAINE-SEEKING; SHELL; EXTINCTION; REWARD; CORE; RAT; MOTIVATION	Neurobiological mechanisms that influence behavior in the presence of alcohol-associated stimuli involve processes that organize behavior during the presence of these cues, and separately, regulation of behavior in their absence. However, little is known about anatomical structures that might mediate this regulation. Here we examined nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) as a possible neural substrate mediating behavior modulation triggered by the presence and absence of alcohol-associated environmental cues and contexts. We also examined subregions of basal amygdala nuclei-rostral basolateral (BLA) and basal posterior (BAP)-as they provide a major source of glutamatergic input to the AcbSh. Animals were trained to associate an auditory conditioning stimulus with alcohol in a discriminative context and then subsequently tested for conditioned port-entries across contexts either previously associated or not associated with alcohol. We found that, on test to the alcohol cue alone, AcbSh inactivation prevented conditioned port-entries in contexts that either were associated with alcohol or were novel, while also increasing unconditioned port-entries during the intertrial intervals. When tested to alcohol-reinforced cues, AcbSh inactivation produced more cue-trial omissions and elevated unconditioned port-entries. Interestingly, BLA and BAP inactivation produced dissociable effects. BAP but not BLA increased unconditioned port-entries, while both manipulations prevented conditioned port-entries during the alcohol-cue. We conclude that AcbSh is necessary for modulating control over behavior otherwise guided by the presence of alcohol-predictive environmental stimuli and contexts. Moreover, this role may involve integration of functionally segregated inputs from rostral and posterior portions of basal amygdala nuclei.	[Millan, E.

In mice, dcc haploinsufficiency results in increased mPFC dopamine innervation and concentrations in adulthood. In turn, dcc haploinsufficiency leads to resilience to the effects of stimulant drugs of abuse on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and behavior. First, we set out to determine whether increased mPFC dopamine innervation causes blunted behavioral responses to amphetamine in adult dcc haploinsufficient mice. Second, we investigated whether unc5c, another netrin-1 receptor expressed by dopamine neurons, is involved in these effects. Third, we assessed whether haploinsufficiency of netrin-1 itself leads to blunted behavioral responding to amphetamine, whether this phenotype emerges before or after adolescence and whether increased mPFC dopamine input is the underlying mechanism. Adult, but not adolescent, dcc, unc5c and netrin-1 haploinsufficient mice exhibit blunted behavioral responses to amphetamine. Furthermore, adult dcc, unc5c, and netrin-1 haploinsufficient mice have exaggerated mPFC dopamine concentrations in comparison to their wild-type littermates. Importantly, resilience to amphetamine-induced behavioral activation in all the three mouse models is abolished by selective dopamine depletion in the medial prefrontal cortex. dcc, unc5c, or netrin-1 haploinsufficiency leads to increased dopamine content in the mPFC and to resilience against amphetamine-induced behavioral activation. Our findings raise the hypothesis that DCC, UNC5C, and netrin-1 act in concert to organize the adolescent development of mesocortical dopamine innervation and, in turn, determine behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.

The major aim of our work was to evaluate the ability of CoVs to enter the central nervous system (CNS) through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Using the highly hepatotropic mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), its attenuated variant, 51.6-MHV3, which shows low tropism for endothelial cells, and the weakly hepatotropic MHV-A59 strain from the murine coronavirus group, we investigated the virus-induced dysfunctions of BBB in vivo and in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) in vitro. We report here a MHV strain-specific ability to cross the BBB during acute infection according to their virulence for liver. Brain invasion was observed only in MHV3-infected mice and correlated with enhanced BBB permeability associated with decreased expression of zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), VE-cadherin, and occludin, but not claudin-5, in the brain or in cultured BMECs. BBB breakdown in MHV3 infection was not related to production of barrier-dysregulating inflammatory cytokines or chemokines by infected BMECs but rather to a downregulation of barrier protective beta interferon (IFN-beta) production. Our findings highlight the importance of IFN-beta production by infected BMECs in preserving BBB function and preventing access of blood-borne infectious viruses to the brain. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect several mammals, including humans, and are associated with respiratory, gastrointestinal, and/or neurological diseases. There is some evidence that suggest that human respiratory CoVs may show neuroinvasive properties. Indeed, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the CoVs OC43 and 229E were found in the brains of SARS patients and multiple sclerosis patients, respectively. These findings suggest that hematogenously spread CoVs may gain access to the CNS at the BBB level. Herein we report for the first time that CoVs exhibit the ability to cross the BBB according to strain virulence. BBB invasion by CoVs correlates with virus-induced disruption of tight junctions on BMECs, leading to BBB dysfunction and enhanced permeability. We provide evidence that production of IFN-beta by BMECs during CoV infection may prevent BBB breakdown and brain viral invasion.

SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED MOTOR IMAGERY PRACTICE ON MUSCLE ACTIVATION AND FORCE PERFORMANCE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mental practice; force development; training; rehabilitation	AUTONOMIC NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NEUROMUSCULAR FATIGUE; MENTAL REHEARSAL; STRENGTH; CONTRACTIONS; RESPONSES; REHABILITATION; INCREASES; VOLUNTARY; MOVEMENT	The effect of motor imagery (MI) practice on isometric force development is well-documented. However, whether practicing MI during rest periods of physical training improves the forthcoming performance remains unexplored. We involved 18 athletes in a counterbalanced design including three physical training sessions scheduled over five consecutive days. Training involved 10 maximal isometric contractions against a force plate, with the elbow at 90 degrees. During two sessions, we integrated MI practice (focusing on either muscle activation or relaxation) during the inter-trial rest periods. We measured muscle performance from force plate and electromyograms of the biceps brachii and anterior deltoideus. We continuously monitored electrodermal activity (EDA) to control sympathetic nervous system activity. MI of muscle activation resulted in higher isometric force as compared to both MI of muscle relaxation and passive recovery (respectively + 2.1% and + 3.5%). MI practice of muscle relaxation also outperformed the control condition (+ 1.9%). Increased activation of the biceps brachii was recorded under both MI practice conditions compared to control. Biceps brachii activation was similar between the two MI practice conditions, but electromyography revealed a marginal trend toward greater activation of the anterior deltoideus during MI practice of muscle activation. EDA and self-reports indicated that these effects were independent from physiological arousal and motivation. These results might account for priming effects of MI practice yielding to higher muscle activation and force performance. Present findings may be of interest for applications in sports training and neurologic rehabilitation. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sex differences in the shoulder joint position sense acuity: a cross-sectional study	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Sex difference; Position sense; Shoulder joint; Motor control; Work-related musculoskeletal disorders	MOTION-INDUCED FATIGUE; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS; MOTOR VARIABILITY; RISK-FACTORS; SENSORIMOTOR SYSTEM; MUSCLE FATIGUE; WORK; STRENGTH; TASK	Background: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) is the most expensive form of work disability. Female sex has been considered as an individual risk factor for the development of WMSD, specifically in the neck and shoulder region. One of the factors that might contribute to the higher injury rate in women is possible differences in neuromuscular control. Accordingly the purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of sex on shoulder joint position sense acuity (as a part of shoulder neuromuscular control) in healthy individuals. Methods: Twenty-eight healthy participants, 14 females and 14 males were recruited for this study. To test position sense acuity, subjects were asked to flex their dominant shoulder to one of the three pre-defined angle ranges (low, mid and high-ranges) with eyes closed, hold their arm in that position for three seconds, go back to the starting position and then immediately replicate the same joint flexion angle, while the difference between the reproduced and original angle was taken as the measure of position sense error. The errors were measured using Vicon motion capture system. Subjects reproduced nine positions in total (3 ranges x 3 trials each). Results: Calculation of absolute repositioning error (magnitude of error) showed no significant difference between men and women (p-value >= 0.05). However, the analysis of the direction of error (constant error) showed a significant difference between the sexes, as women tended to mostly overestimate the target, whereas men tended to both overestimate and underestimate the target (p-value <= 0.01, observed power = 0.79). The results also showed that men had a significantly more variable error, indicating more variability in their position sense, compared to women (p-value <= 0.05, observed power = 0.78). Discussion: Differences observed in the constant JPS error suggest that men and women might use different neuromuscular control strategies in the upper limb. In addition, higher JPS variability observed in men might be one of the factors that could contribute to their lower rate of musculoskeletal disorders, compared to women. Conclusions: The result of this study showed that shoulder position sense, as part of the neuromuscular control system, differs between men and women. This finding can help us better understand the reasons behind the higher rate of musculoskeletal disorders in women, especially in the working environments.

These requirements undermine many of the advantages provided by in vitro cell culture approaches when compared with more complex in vivo techniques. New Method: Here, we identified a reliable marker (MHCI) that allows for direct isolation of primary neurons from fetal human brain. We utilized a magnetic labeling and isolation technique to separate neurons from other neural cells. We established a defined condition, omitting the astroglial supports that could maintain the human neurons for varying amounts of time. Results: We showed that the new method significantly improved the purity of human neurons in culture without the need for further chemical/mechanical enrichment. We demonstrated the suitability of these neurons for functional studies including Rho-kinase dependent regulation of neurite outgrowth and ensheathment in co-cultures with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from fetal human brain. Comparison with existing methods: The accountability for neuron-only seeding and the controllable density allows for better neuronal maturation and better visualization of the different neuronal compartments. The higher purity culture constitutes an effective system to study and screen for compounds that impact neuron biology without potential confounding effects from glial crowding. Conclusions: High purity human neurons generated using the improved method will enable enhanced reliability in the discovery and development of drugs with neuroregenerative and neuroprotective activity.

However, scant research has focused on white matter integrity in patients presenting with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) with persistent negative symptoms (PNS). This study aimed to explore microstructure in the neurocircunry proposed to be involved in PNS, by using a region-of-interest. approach. Secondly, the relationship between individual negative symptoms and white matter were explored. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured in the fornix and three other tracts bilaterally including the uncinaLe fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and the cingulum bundle. Twelve patients with PNS were compared to a non-PNS group (52) and a healthy control group (51). Results showed that the PNS group had significantly lower FA values in the fornix when compared to healthy controls and that the non-PNS group had significantly lower FA values in the right uncinare fasciculus compared to healthy controls. Significant correlations were observed between SANS global score for anhedonia-asociality and lower FA values in the right cingulum bundle. Our results suggest that frontotemporal white matter might be more closely related to PNS and that this relationship may possibly be mediated by greater anhedonia in PNS patients.

This retrospective single-center study included all women with fetuses of gestational age <33 weeks of gestation whose birth was planned or expected within 24 hours from September 2011 to December 2012. They were to receive magnesium sulfate, administered intravenously as a 4-g bolus followed by a constant infusion of 1g per hour. If delivery had not occurred after 12 hours and was no longer considered imminent, the infusion was to be discontinued. The study included 119 women, 81 (68.1%) of whom received magnesium sulfate. Among the latter, 71 (87.5%) gave birth within 24 hours. The reasons treatment was not given were: omission by medical team (19/38, 50%), urgent delivery (18/38, 47.4%), and contraindication to treatment (1/38, 2.6%). The mean gestational age at protocol implementation was 29.6 +/- 2.1 weeks. Maternal monitoring, especially at the onset of infusion, appeared suboptimal. No major maternal side effects were observed. Our study shows that implementing a protocol for prevention of cerebral palsy by magnesium sulfate is feasible in a tertiary obstetric center.

J	Marrelec, G; Messe, A; Bellec, P				Marrelec, Guillaume; Messe, Arnaud; Bellec, Pierre			A Bayesian Alternative to Mutual Information for the Hierarchical Clustering of Dependent Random Variables	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN; FMRI; INTEGRATION; MODEL; ORGANIZATION; SHRINKAGE; SELECTION; DISTANCE; MATRICES; CRITERIA	The use of mutual information as a similarity measure in agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) raises an important issue: some correction needs to be applied for the dimensionality of variables. In this work, we formulate the decision of merging dependent multivariate normal variables in an AHC procedure as a Bayesian model comparison. We found that the Bayesian formulation naturally shrinks the empirical covariance matrix towards a matrix set a priori (e.g., the identity), provides an automated stopping rule, and corrects for dimensionality using a term that scales up the measure as a function of the dimensionality of the variables. Also, the resulting log Bayes factor is asymptotically proportional to the plug-in estimate of mutual information, with an additive correction for dimensionality in agreement with the Bayesian information criterion. We investigated the behavior of these Bayesian alternatives (in exact and asymptotic forms) to mutual information on simulated and real data. An encouraging result was first derived on simulations: the hierarchical clustering based on the log Bayes factor outperformed off-the-shelf clustering techniques as well as raw and normalized mutual information in terms of classification accuracy. On a toy example, we found that the Bayesian approaches led to results that were similar to those of mutual information clustering techniques, with the advantage of an automated thresholding. On real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets measuring brain activity, it identified clusters consistent with the established outcome of standard procedures. On this application, normalized mutual information had a highly atypical behavior, in the sense that it systematically favored very large clusters. These initial experiments suggest that the proposed Bayesian alternatives to mutual information are a useful new tool for hierarchical clustering.

Consequently, intense research has focused upon deciphering their physiological roles to understand their altered state in Alzheimer disease pathophysiology. Recently, the impact of APP metabolites (APP intracellular fragment (AICD) and A beta) and Tau on the nucleus has emerged as an important, new topic. Here we discuss (i) how AICD, A beta, and Tau reach the nucleus and how AICD and A beta control protein expression at the transcriptional level, (ii) post-translational modifications of AICD, A beta, and Tau, and (iii) what these three molecules have in common.

The etiology of such lesions is complex and multifactorial. Furthermore, timing and length of exposure to infection also influence neurodevelopmental outcomes. Different mechanisms have been posited to mediate the observed brain injury including microglial activation followed by subsequent release of pro-inflammatory species, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and vulnerability of developing oligodendrocytes to cerebral insults. The prevalence of such neurological impairments requires an urgent need for early detection and effective neuroprotective strategies. Accordingly, noninvasive methods of monitoring disease progression and therapy effectiveness are essential. While diagnostic tools using biomarkers from bodily fluids may provide useful information regarding potential risks of developing neurological diseases, the use of magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy has emerged as a promising candidate for such purpose. Various pharmacological agents have demonstrated protective effects in the immature brain in animal models; however, few studies have progressed to clinical trials with promising results.

HCN channels represent the molecular correlate of I-f or I-h in sinoatrial node (SAN) and neuronal cells. Previous studies have implicated a role for cholesterol in the regulation of rabbit HCN4 channels with effects on pacing in the rabbit SAN. Using electrophysiological and biochemical approaches, we examined the effect of cholesterol modulation on human HCN1, HCN2 and HCN4 isoforms. Patch-clamp experiments uncovered isoform specific differences in the effect of cholesterol on gating kinetics upon depletion by M beta CD or mevastatin or enrichment using M beta CD/cholesterol. Most dramatically cholesterol had isoform specific effects on mode-shifting, which has been suggested to play a key role in stabilizing firing rate and preventing arrhythmic firing in SAN cells and neurons. Mode-shifting in HCN1 channels was insensitive to cholesterol manipulation, while HCN2 and HCN4 were strongly affected. Trafficking of each isoform to the plasma membrane was also affected by cholesterol modulation differentially between isoforms, however, each isoform remained localized in lipid raft domains after cholesterol depletion. These effects may contribute to the side effects of cholesterol reducing therapies including disrupted heart rhythm and neuropathic pain, as well as the susceptibility of sinus dysfunction in patients with elevated cholesterol.

Expert and crowd-sourced validation of an individualized sleep spindle detection method employing complex demodulation and individualized normalization	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep; spindle; EEG; detection; automated; crowdsourcing	MOTOR MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; TOPOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; BRAIN RHYTHMS; EEG; AGE; FREQUENCY; ABILITY	A spindle detection method was developed that: (1) extracts the signal of interest (i.e., spindle-related phasic changes in sigma) relative to ongoing "background" sigma activity using complex demodulation, (2) accounts for variations of spindle characteristics across the night, scalp derivations and between individuals, and (3) employs a minimum number of sometimes arbitrary, user-defined parameters. Complex demodulation was used to extract instantaneous power in the spindle band. To account for intra- and inter individual differences, the signal was z-score transformed using a 60 s sliding window, per channel, over the course of the recording. Spindle events were detected with a z-score threshold corresponding to a low probability (e.g., 99th percentile). Spindle characteristics, such as amplitude, duration and oscillatory frequency, were derived for each individual spindle following detection, which permits spindles to be subsequently and flexibly categorized as slow or fast spindles from a single detection pass. Spindles were automatically detected in 15 young healthy subjects. Two experts manually identified spindles from C3 during Stage 2 sleep, from each recording: one employing conventional guidelines, and the other, identifying spindles with the aid of a sigma (11-16 Hz) filtered channel. These spindles were then compared between raters and to the automated detection to identify the presence of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. This method of automated spindle detection resolves or avoids many of the limitations that complicate automated spindle detection, and performs well compared to a group of non-experts, and importantly, has good external validity with respect to the extant literature in terms of the characteristics of automatically detected spindles.

Here, we investigated if methylene blue can inhibit caspases via the oxidation of their active site cysteine. Methylene blue, and derivatives, azure A and azure B competitively inhibited recombinant Caspase-6 (Casp6), and inhibited Casp6 activity in transfected human colon carcinoma cells and in serum-deprived primary human neuron cultures. Methylene blue also inhibited recombinant Casp1 and Casp3. Furthermore, methylene blue inhibited Casp3 activity in an acute mouse model of liver toxicity. Mass spectrometry confirmed methylene blue and azure B oxidation of the catalytic Cys163 cysteine of Casp6. Together, these results show a novel inhibitory mechanism of caspases via sulfenation of the active site cysteine. These results indicate that methylene blue or its derivatives could (1) have an additional effect against Alzheimer Disease by inhibiting brain caspase activity, (2) be used as a drug to prevent caspase activation in other conditions, and (3) predispose chronically treated individuals to cancer via the inhibition of caspases.

The cationic current I-h mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels plays an important role in pain by facilitating ectopic firing and hyperexcitability in DRG neurons, however little is known regarding the role of Ih in supraspinal pain pathways. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is reported to be involved in the affective aspects of pain, exhibits high HCN channel expression. Using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain in Long-Evans rats and patch-clamp recordings in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the contralateral mPFC, we observed a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependent activation of Ih in SNI neurons, whereas maximal Ih remained unchanged. Accordingly, SNI mPFC pyramidal neurons exhibited increased input resistance and excitability, as well as facilitated glutamatergic mGluR5-mediated persistent firing, compared with sham neurons. Moreover, intracellular application of bromo-cAMP abolished the hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependent activation of Ih observed in SNI neurons, whereas protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition further promoted this shift in both SNI and sham neurons. Behaviorally, acute HCN channel blockade by local injection of ZD7288 in the mPFC of SNI rats induced a decrease in cold allodynia. These findings suggest that changes in the cAMP/PKA axis in mPFC neurons underlie alterations to HCN channel function, which can influence descending inhibition of pain pathways in neuropathic conditions.

Neto2-null mice have impaired GABAergic inhibition and are susceptible to seizures	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Neto proteins; KCC2; chloride; GABA; seizure; inhibition; transporter; hippocampus; auxiliary subunit	CATION-CHLORIDE COTRANSPORTERS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; KAINATE RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; AUXILIARY SUBUNITS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; KCC2; PHOSPHORYLATION; HOMEOSTASIS; HYPEREXCITABILITY	Neto2 is a transmembrane protein that interacts with the neuron-specific K -CI cotransporter (KCC2) in the central nervous system (CNS). Efficient KCC2 transport is essential for setting the neuronal Cl gradient, which is required for fast GABAergic inhibition. Neto2 is required to maintain the normal abundance of KCC2 in neurons, and increases KCC2 function by binding to the active oligomeric form of this cotransporter In the present study, we characterized GABAergic inhibition and KCC2-mediated neuronal chloride homeostasis in pyramidal neurons from adult hippocampal slices. Using gramicidin perforated patch clamp recordings we found that the reversal potential for GABA (EGABA) was significantly depolarized. We also observed that surface levels of KCC2 and phosphorylation of KCC2 serine 940 (Ser940) were reduced in Neto2-/neurons compared to wild-type controls. To examine GABAergic inhibition we recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and found that Neto2-/- neurons had significant reductions in both their amplitude and frequency. Based on the critical role of Neto2 in regulating GABAergic inhibition we rationalized that Neto2-null mice would be prone to seizure activity. We found that Neto2-null mice demonstrated a decrease in the latency to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and an increase in seizure severity.

SOCS3 in retinal neurons and glial cells suppresses VEGF signaling to prevent pathological neovascular growth	SCIENCE SIGNALING			English	Article							OXYGEN-INDUCED RETINOPATHY; HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1-ALPHA; VASCULAR-PERMEABILITY; ANGIOGENESIS; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; PREMATURITY; BRAIN; MOUSE; STAT3	Neurons and glial cells in the retina contribute to neovascularization, or the formation of abnormal new blood vessels, in proliferative retinopathy, a condition that can lead to vision loss or blindness. We identified a mechanism by which suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in neurons and glial cells prevents neovascularization. We found that Socs3 expression was increased in the retinal ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers after oxygen-induced retinopathy. Mice with Socs3 deficiency in neuronal and glial cells had substantially reduced vaso-obliterated retinal areas and increased pathological retinal neovascularization in response to oxygen-induced retinopathy, suggesting that loss of neuronal/glial SOCS3 increased both retinal vascular regrowth and pathological neovascularization. Furthermore, retinal expression of Vegfa (which encodes vascular endothelial growth factor A) was higher in these mice than in Socs3 flox/flox controls, indicating that neuronal and glial SOCS3 suppressed Vegfa expression during pathological conditions. Lack of neuronal and glial SOCS3 resulted in greater phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, which led to increased expression of its gene target Vegfa, and increased endothelial cell proliferation. In summary, SOCS3 in neurons and glial cells inhibited the STAT3-mediated secretion of VEGF from these cells, which suppresses endothelial cell activation, resulting in decreased endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. These results suggest that neuronal and glial cell SOCS3 limits pathological retinal angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF signaling.

This leads to severe neurological symptoms, but the mechanisms underlying brain involvement were unclear. Here, we show that selectively deleting Nemo or the upstream kinase Tak1 in brain endothelial cells resulted in death of endothelial cells, a rarefaction of brain microvessels, cerebral hypoperfusion, a disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB), and epileptic seizures. TAK1 and NEMO protected the BBB by activating the transcription factor NF-kappa B and stabilizing the tight junction protein occludin. They also prevented brain endothelial cell death in a NF-kappa B-independent manner by reducing oxidative damage. Our data identify crucial functions of inflammatory TAK1-NEMO signaling in protecting the brain endothelium and maintaining normal brain function, thus explaining the neurological symptoms associated with IP.

Why DA (dopamine) neurons and a select small subset of brain nuclei are particularly vulnerable to such ubiquitous cellular dysfunctions is presently one of the key unanswered questions in Parkinson's disease research. One intriguing hypothesis is that their heightened vulnerability is a consequence of their elevated bioenergetic requirements. Here, we show for the first time that vulnerable nigral DA neurons differ from less vulnerable DA neurons such as those of the VTA (ventral tegmental area) by having a higher basal rate of mitochondrial OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation), a smaller reserve capacity, a higher density of axonal mitochondria, an elevated level of basal oxidative stress, and a considerably more complex axonal arborization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reducing axonal arborization by acting on axon guidance pathways with Semaphorin 7A reduces in parallel the basal rate of mitochondrial OXPHOS and the vulnerability of nigral DA neurons to the neurotoxic agents MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) and rotenone. Blocking L-type calcium channels with isradipine was protective against MPP+ but not rotenone. Our data provide the most direct demonstration to date in favor of the hypothesis that the heightened vulnerability of nigral DA neurons in Parkinson's disease is directly due to their particular bioenergetic and morphological characteristics.

While it is acknowledged that early-onset and long-standing blindness leads the occipital cortex to respond to non-visual stimulation [8, 9], it remains unknown whether a short and transient period of postnatal visual deprivation is sufficient to trigger crossmodal reorganization that persists after years of visual experience. In the present study, we characterized brain responses to auditory stimuli in 11 adults who had been deprived of all patterned vision at birth by congenital cataracts in both eyes until they were treated at 9 to 238 days of age. When compared to controls with typical visual experience, the cataract-reversal group showed enhanced auditorydriven activity in focal visual regions. A combination of dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian model selection [10] indicated that this auditory-driven activity in the occipital cortex was better explained by direct cortico-cortical connections with the primary auditory cortex than by subcortical connections. Thus, a short and transient period of visual deprivation early in life leads to enduring large-scale crossmodal reorganization of the brain circuitry typically dedicated to vision.

Despite the existence of a blood-nerve barrier, both humoral and cellular immunity can be directed against peripheral axons and myelin. Molecular mimicry may be triggered at the systemic level, as was best demonstrated in the case of bacterial oligosaccharides. The classification of immune neuropathy has been expanded to take into account specific syndromes that share unique clinical, electrophysiological, prognostic and serological features. Guillain-Barre syndrome encompasses a classical syndrome of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and many variants: axonal motor and sensory, axonal motor, Miller-Fisher, autonomic, and sensory. Similarly, chronic immune neuropathy is composed of classic chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and variants characterized as multifocal (motor or sensorimotor), sensory, distal symmetric, and syndromes associated with monoclonal gammopathy. Among putative biomarkers, myelin associated glycoprotein and several anti-ganglioside autoantibodies have shown statistically significant associations with specific neuropathic syndromes. Currently, the strongest biomarker associations are those linking Miller-Fisher syndrome with anti-GQ1b, multifocal motor neuropathy with anti-GM1, and distal acquired symmetric neuropathy with anti-MAG antibodies. Many other autoantibody associations have been proposed, but presently lack sufficient specificity and sensitivity to qualify as biomarkers. This field of research has contributed to the antigenic characterization of motor and sensory functional systems, as well as helping to define immune neuropathic syndromes with widely different clinical presentation, prognosis and response to therapy. Serologic biomarkers are likely to become even more relevant with the advent of new targeted forms of immunotherapy, such as monoclonal antibodies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modulation of GABA and resting state functional connectivity by transcranial direct current stimulation	ELIFE			English	Article							HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; GAMMA FREQUENCY; EXCITABILITY; GLUTAMATE; AMPLITUDE; NETWORK; HUMANS; FMRI	We previously demonstrated that network level functional connectivity in the human brain could be related to levels of inhibition in a major network node at baseline (Stagg et al., 2014). In this study, we build upon this finding to directly investigate the effects of perturbing M1 GABA and resting state functional connectivity using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a neuromodulatory approach that has previously been demonstrated to modulate both metrics. FMRI data and GABA levels, as assessed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, were measured before and after 20 min of 1 mA anodal or sham tDCS. In line with previous studies, baseline GABA levels were negatively correlated with the strength of functional connectivity within the resting motor network. However, although we confirm the previously reported findings that anodal tDCS reduces GABA concentration and increases functional connectivity in the stimulated motor cortex; these changes are not correlated, suggesting they may be driven by distinct underlying mechanisms.

To investigate whether mitochondrial dysfunction is present in trauma-induced painful mononeuropathy, a time-course of mitochondrial function and bioenergetics was characterized in the mouse partial sciatic nerve ligation model. Results: Traumatic nerve injury induces increased metabolic indices of the nerve, resulting in increased oxygen consumption and increased glycolysis. Increased metabolic needs of the nerve are concomitant with bioenergetic and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by reduced ATP synthase activity, reduced electron transport chain activity, and increased futile proton cycling. Bioenergetic dysfunction is characterized by reduced glycolytic reserve, reduced glycolytic capacity, and increased non-glycolytic acidification. Conclusion: Traumatic peripheral nerve injury induces persistent mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction which implies that pharmacological agents which seek to normalize mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction could be expected to be beneficial for pain treatment. Increases in both glycolytic acidification and non-glycolytic acidification suggest that pH sensitive drugs which preferentially act on acidic tissue will have the ability to preferential act on injured nerves without affecting healthy tissues.

Because nociceptive information is first detected in skin, it is important to understand how alterations in peripheral innervation contribute to pain in each model. Over 16 weeks in male rats, changes in sensory and autonomic innervation of the skin were described after cuff and SNI using immunohistochemistry to label myelinated (neurofilament 200 positive-NF200+) and peptidergic (calcitonin gene-related peptide positive-CGRP+) primary afferents and sympathetic fibres (dopamine beta-hydroxylase positive-DBH+) Results: Cuff and SNI caused an early loss and later reinnervation of NF200 and CGRP fibres in the plantar hind paw skin. In both models, DBH+ fibres sprouted into the upper dermis of the plantar skin 4 and 6 weeks after injury. Despite these similarities, behavioural pain measures were significantly different in each model. Sympathectomy using guanethidine significantly alleviated mechanical allodynia 6 weeks after cuff, when peak sympathetic sprouting was observed, having no effect at 2 weeks, when fibres were absent. In SNI animals, mechanical allodynia in the lateral paw was significantly improved by guanethidine at 2 and 6 weeks, and the development of cold hyperalgesia, which roughly paralleled the appearance of ectopic sympathetic fibres, was alleviated by guanethidine at 6 weeks. Sympathetic fibres did not sprout into the dorsal root ganglia at 2 or 6 weeks, indicating their unimportance to pain behaviour in these two models. Conclusions: Alterations in sympathetic innervation in the skin represents an important mechanism that contributes to pain in cuff and SNI models of neuropathic pain.

Ventromedial Frontal Cortex Is Critical for Guiding Attention to Reward-Predictive Visual Features in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; lesion study; prefrontal cortex; reward; value; ventromedial frontal lobe	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; POP-OUT; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; DOUBLE DISSOCIATION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; STIMULUS-VALUE; HUMAN BRAIN	Adaptively interacting with our environment requires extracting information that will allow us to successfully predict reward. This can be a challenge, particularly when there are many candidate cues, and when rewards are probabilistic. Recent work has demonstrated that visual attention is allocated to stimulus features that have been associated with reward on previous trials. The ventromedial frontal lobe (VMF) has been implicated in learning in dynamic environments of this kind, but the mechanism by which this region influences this process is not clear. Here, we hypothesized that the VMF plays a critical role in guiding attention to reward-predictive stimulus features based on feedback. We tested the effects of VMF damage in human subjects on a visual search task in which subjects were primed to attend to task-irrelevant colors associated with different levels of reward, incidental to the search task. Consistent with previous work, we found that distractors had a greater influence on reaction time when they appeared in colors associated with high reward in the previous trial compared with colors associated with low reward in healthy control subjects and patients with prefrontal damage sparing the VMF. However, this reward modulation of attentional priming was absent in patients with VMF damage. Thus, an intact VMF is necessary for directing attention based on experience with cue-reward associations. We suggest that this region plays a role in selecting reward-predictive cues to facilitate future learning.

We studied a sibling pair and an unrelated indiviadual who presented with MSL and neuropathy to determine the genetic etiology of this disorder in patients who did not carry the MSL-associated MERRF mutation. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the siblings, and a rare, shared homozygous mutation in MFN2 (c.2119C>T:p.R707W) was identified. The mutation was not present in their healthy siblings. In silico programs predict it to be pathogenic, and heterozygous carriers of the MFN2 p.R707W substitution are known to have Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. A third, unrelated patient with multiple symmetrical lipomatosis and neuropathy also harbored the same homozygous mutation and had been previously diagnosed with CMT. Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrate that the p.R707W substitution impairs homotypic (MFN2-MFN2) protein interactions required for normal activity and renders mitochondria prone to perinuclear aggregation. These findings show that homozygous mutations at p.R707W in MFN2 are a novel cause of multiple symmetrical lipomatosis.

In particular, the neural firing pattern is an important indicator of dynamic circuitry within a neuronal population. Indeed, in microcircuits, neurons act as soloists or choristers wherein the characteristical activity of a 'soloist' differs from the firing pattern of a 'chorister'. Both cell types correlate their respective firing rate with the global populational activity in a unique way. In the present study, we sought to examine the relationship between the spike shape (thin spike neurons and broad spike neurons) of cortical neurons recorded from V1, their firing levels and their propensity to act as soloists or choristers. We found that thin spike neurons, which exhibited higher levels of firing, generally correlate their activity with the neuronal population (choristers). On the other hand, broad spike neurons showed lower levels of firing and demonstrated weak correlations with the assembly (soloists). A major consequence of the present study is: estimating the correlation of neural spike trains with their neighboring population is a predictive indicator of spike waveforms and firing level. Indeed, we found a continuum distribution of coupling strength ranging from weak correlation-strength (attributed to lowfiring neurons) to high correlation-strength (attributed to high-firing neurons). The tendency to exhibit high- or low-firing is conducive to the spike shape of neurons. Our results offer new insights into visual processing by showing how high-firing rate neurons (mostly thin spike neurons) could modulate the neuronal responses within cell-assemblies.

Although the domain architecture of sacsin suggests that it is a neuronal chaperone assisting in protein quality control, the precise function of sacsin remains elusive. Using fluorescence polarization (FP) assays, we confirmed that the HEPN domain of sacsin binds to nucleotides with low micromolar affinities. FP competition assays with a variety of nucleotides and nucleotide analogs revealed that the binding is primarily mediated by the phosphate groups of nucleotides. A highthroughput screen subsequently identified novel small molecule ligands of HEPN, providing new chemical probes for cell culture studies and drug development. Together, the results are consistent with the HEPN domain contributing to the functional activity of sacsin by binding to nucleotides or other multiply charged anionic compounds in neurons.

Although CUX1 is ubiquitously expressed, CUX2 plays an important role in the specification of neuronal cells and continues to be expressed in postmitotic neurons. Cut repeats from the CUX1 protein were recently shown to stimulate 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), an enzyme that removes oxidized purines from DNA and introduces a single strand break through its apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity to initiate base excision repair. Here, we investigated whether CUX2 plays a similar role in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Cux2 knockdown in embryonic cortical neurons increased levels of oxidative DNA damage. In vitro, Cut repeats from CUX2 increased the binding of OGG1 to 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-containing DNA and stimulated both the glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activities of OGG1. Genetic inactivation in mouse embryo fibroblasts or CUX2 knockdown in HCC38 cells delayed DNA repair and increased DNA damage. Conversely, ectopic expression of Cut repeats from CUX2 accelerated DNA repair and reduced levels of oxidative DNA damage. These results demonstrate that CUX2 functions as an accessory factor that stimulates the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Neurons produce a high level of reactive oxygen species because of their dependence on aerobic oxidation of glucose as their source of energy. Our results suggest that the persistent expression of CUX2 in postmitotic neurons contributes to the maintenance of genome integrity through its stimulation of oxidative DNA damage repair.

We demonstrated previously that postsynaptic TrkC functions as a glutamatergic synapse-inducing (synaptogenic) cell adhesion molecule trans-interacting with presynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP sigma). Given that NT-3 and PTP sigma bind distinct domains of the TrkC extracellular region, here we tested the hypothesis that NT-3 modulates TrkC/PTP sigma binding and synaptogenic activity. NT-3 enhanced PTP sigma binding to cell surface-expressed TrkC and facilitated the presynapse-inducing activity of TrkC in rat hippocampal neurons. Imaging of recycling presynaptic vesicles combined with TrkC knockdown and rescue approaches demonstrated that NT-3 rapidly potentiates presynaptic function via binding endogenous postsynaptic TrkC in a tyrosine kinase-independent manner. Thus, NT-3 positively modulates the TrkC-PTP sigma complex for glutamatergic presynaptic assembly and function independently from TrkC kinase activation. Our findings provide new insight into synaptic roles of neurotrophin signaling and mechanisms controlling synaptic organizing complexes.

Together with the peptidergic sub-population, they transmit nociceptive information from the periphery to the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Despite the numerous studies investigating the role of the non-peptidergic primary afferents, their role in normal nociception and in pain remains poorly understood. Our lab has previously demonstrated that, in rat models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain, there is a de novo expression of substance P receptors (NK-1r) by lamina I pyramidal projection neurons, a neuronal population that normally does not express these receptors. Results: In this study, we used a ribosomal toxin, saporin, conjugated to the lectin IB4 to selectively ablate the non-peptidergic nociceptive C fibers, to investigate if the loss of these fibers was enough to induce a change in NK-1r expression by lamina I projection neurons. IB4-saporin treatment led to the permanent ablation of the IB4-positive afferents but also to a small non-significant reduction in CGRP-positive afferents. An overall increase in immunoreactivity for the NK-1r was observed in lamina I projection neurons, however, the lack of non-peptidergic afferents did not increase the number of lamina I pyramidal projection neurons immunoreactive for the receptor. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the deletion of the non-peptidergic afferents, at the L4-L5 spinal levels, is not sufficient to trigger the de novo expression of NK-1r by projection pyramidal neurons but increases the expression of NK-1r in fusiform and multipolar projection neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that a neuropathic component is essential to trigger the expression of NK-1r by pyramidal neurons.

Loch			The unruptured intracranial aneurysm treatment score A multidisciplinary consensus	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TERM-FOLLOW-UP; NATURAL-HISTORY; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; SACCULAR ANEURYSMS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; RUPTURE RISK; METAANALYSIS; COHORT; AGE	Objective: We endeavored to develop an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) treatment score (UIATS) model that includes and quantifies key factors involved in clinical decision-making in the management of UIAs and to assess agreement for this model among specialists in UIA management and research. Methods: An international multidisciplinary (neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, clinical epidemiology) group of 69 specialists was convened to develop and validate the UIATS model using a Delphi consensus. For internal (39 panel members involved in identification of relevant features) and external validation (30 independent external reviewers), 30 selected UIA cases were used to analyze agreement with UIATS management recommendations based on a 5-point Likert scale (5 indicating strong agreement). Interrater agreement (IRA) was assessed with standardized coefficients of dispersion (v(r)*) (v(r)* 5 0 indicating excellent agreement and v(r)* = 1 indicating poor agreement). Results: The UIATS accounts for 29 key factors in UIA management. Agreement with UIATS (mean Likert scores) was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1-4.3) per reviewer for both reviewer cohorts; agreement per case was 4.3 (95% CI 4.1-4.4) for panel members and 4.5 (95% CI 4.3-4.6) for external reviewers (p = 0.017). Mean Likert scores were 4.2 (95% CI 4.1-4.3) for interventional reviewers (n = 56) and 4.1 (95% CI 3.9-4.4) for noninterventional reviewers (n = 12) (p = 0.290). Overall IRA (v(r)*) for both cohorts was 0.026 (95% CI 0.019-0.033). Conclusions: This novel UIA decision guidance study captures an excellent consensus among highly informed individuals on UIA management, irrespective of their underlying specialty. Clinicians can use the UIATS as a comprehensive mechanism for indicating how a large group of specialists might manage an individual patient with a UIA.

Studies have shown that appetitive smoking-related stimuli (e.g., someone smoking) trigger significant cravings in smokers impede their self-control capacities and promote drug seeking behavior. In this review, we begin by an overview of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the neural correlates of smokers to appetitive smoking cues. The literature reveals a complex and vastly distributed neuronal network underlying smokers' craving response that recruits regions involved in self referential processing, planning/regulatory processes, emotional responding, attentional biases, and automatic conducts. We then selectively review important factors contributing to the heterogeneity of results that significantly limit the implications of these findings, namely between- (abstinence, smoking expectancies, and self-regulation) and within studies factors (severity of smoking dependence, sex differences, motivation to quit, and genetic factors). Remarkably, we found that little to no attention has been devoted to examine the influence of personality traits on the neural correlates of cigarette cravings in fMRI studies. Impulsivity has been linked with craving and relapse in substance and tobacco use, which prompted our research team to examine the influence of impulsivity on cigarette cravings in an fMRI study. We found that the influence of impulsivity on cigarette cravings was mediated by fronto-cingulate mechanisms. Given the high prevalence of cigarette smoking in several psychiatric disorders that are characterized by significant levels of impulsivity, we conclude by identifying psychiatric patients as a target population whose tobacco-smoking habits deserve further behavioral and neuro-imaging investigation.

Deformation-based morphometry and independent component analysis identified PD-specific atrophy in the midbrain, basal ganglia, basal forebrain, medial temporal lobe, and discrete cortical regions. The degree of atrophy reflected clinical measures of disease severity. The spatial pattern of atrophy demonstrated overlap with intrinsic networks present in healthy brain, as derived from functional MRI. Moreover, the degree of atrophy in each brain region reflected its functional and anatomical proximity to a presumed disease epicenter in the substantia nigra, compatible with a trans-neuronal spread of the disease. These results support a network-spread mechanism in PD. Finally, the atrophy pattern in PD was also seen in healthy aging, where it also correlated with the loss of striatal dopaminergic innervation.

Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) was the first myelin-derived growth inhibitory protein identified, and its inhibitory activity was initially elucidated in 1994 independently by the Filbin lab and the McKerracher lab using cell-based and biochemical techniques, respectively. Since that time we have gained a wealth of knowledge concerning the numerous growth inhibitory proteins that are present in myelin, and we also have dissected many of the neuronal signaling pathways that act as stop signs for axon regeneration. Here we give an overview of the early research efforts that led to the identification of myelin-derived growth inhibitory proteins, and the importance of this family of proteins for understanding neurotrauma and CNS diseases. We further provide an update on how this knowledge has been translated towards current clinical studies in regenerative medicine.

However, very little is known about dynamic functional connectivity (D-FC) patterns of spontaneous human brain networks during rest and about how these spontaneous brain dynamics are constrained by the underlying structural connectivity. Here, we combined sub-second multiband R-fMRI data with graph theoretical approaches to comprehensively investigate the dynamic characteristics of the topological organization of human whole-brain functional networks, and then employed diffusion imaging data in the same participants to further explore the associated structural substrates. At the connection level, we found that human whole-brain D-FC patterns spontaneously fluctuated over time, while homotopic D-FC exhibited high connectivity strength and low temporal variability. At the network level, dynamic functional networks exhibited time-varying but evident small-world and assortativity architecture, with several regions (e.g., insula, sensorimotor cortex and medial prefrontal cortex) emerging as functionally persistent hubs (i.e., highly connected regions) while possessing large temporal variability in their degree centrality. Finally, the temporal characteristics (i.e., strength and variability) of the connectional and nodal properties of the dynamic brain networks were significantly associated with their structural counterparts. Collectively, we demonstrate the economical, efficient, and flexible characteristics of dynamic functional coordination in large-scale human brain networks during rest, and highlight their relationship with underlying structural connectivity, which deepens our understandings of spontaneous brain network dynamics in humans.

In an initial effort to validate the AMMI, the interview was administered to participants who were followed from age 4 to 23. ANOVA and contrast tests confirmed the AMMI's capacity to discriminate between mother, father, and partner IWMs. AMMI security with each parent was correlated with coherence according to the Adult Attachment Interview, and AMMI disorganization with mother with unresolved trauma (N =53). AMMI dimensions of security, deactivation, and hyperactivation with the mother were associated with cumulative lifetime scores of security (N =23), avoidance, and resistance (N =34), respectively. Intercorrelations between these AMMI scales were also theory-consistent. Associations with the AAI and between AMMI security scores of different relationships are consistent with previous findings suggesting a contribution from both parents in the development of a state of mind, but a more important role of the mother for representations of the partner.

Results: Here, we comprehensively characterize 5hmC in the prefrontal cortices of 24 subjects. We show that, although there is inter-individual variability in 5hmC content among unrelated individuals, approximately 8 % of all CpGs on autosomal chromosomes contain 5hmC, while sex chromosomes contain far less. Our data also provide evidence suggesting that 5hmC has transcriptional regulatory properties, as the density of 5hmC was highest in enhancer regions and within exons. Furthermore, we link increased 5hmC density to histone modification binding sites, to the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, and to exon-intron boundaries. Finally, we provide several genomic regions of interest that contain gender-specific 5hmC. Conclusions: Collectively, these results present an important reference for the growing number of studies that are interested in the investigation of the role of 5hmC in brain and mental disorders.

Here we assessed the perceptual-cognitive expertise of athletes and non-athletes using sport specific and non-sport specific biological motion perception (BMP) tasks. Using a virtual environment, university-level soccer players and university students' non-athletes were asked to perceive the direction of a point-light walker and to predict the trajectory of a masked-ball during a point-light soccer kick. Angles of presentation were varied for orientation (upright, inverted) and distance (2 m, 4 m, 16 m). Accuracy and reaction time were measured to assess observers' performance. The results highlighted athletes' superior ability compared to non-athletes to accurately predict the trajectory of a masked soccer ball presented at 2 m (reaction time), 4 m (accuracy and reaction time), and 16 m (accuracy) of distance. More interestingly, experts also displayed greater performance compared to non-athletes throughout the more fundamental and general point-light walker direction task presented at 2 m (reaction time), 4 m (accuracy and reaction time), and 16 m (reaction time) of distance. In addition, athletes showed a better performance throughout inverted conditions in the walker (reaction time) and soccer kick (accuracy and reaction time) tasks. This implies that during human BMP, athletes demonstrate an advantage for recognizing body kinematics that goes beyond sport specific actions.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) signaling has been linked to RGC damage, however, the mechanism by which TNF alpha promotes neuronal death remains poorly defined. Using an in vivo rat glaucoma model, we show that TNF alpha is upregulated by Muller cells and microglia/macrophages soon after induction of ocular hypertension. Administration of XPro1595, a selective inhibitor of soluble TNF alpha, effectively protects RGC soma and axons. Using cobalt permeability assays, we further demonstrate that endogenous soluble TNF alpha triggers the upregulation of Ca2+ - permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) expression in RGCs of glaucomatous eyes. CP-AMPAR activation is not caused by defects in GluA2 subunit mRNA editing, but rather reflects selective downregulation of GluA2 in neurons exposed to elevated eye pressure. Intraocular administration of selective CP-AMPAR blockers promotes robust RGC survival supporting a critical role for non-NMDA glutamate receptors in neuronal death. Our study identifies glia-derived soluble TNF alpha as a major inducer of RGC death through activation of CP-AMPARs, thereby establishing a novel link between neuroinflammation and cell loss in glaucoma.

Effects of Peritoneal Sepsis on Rat Central Osmoregulatory Neurons Mediating Thirst and Vasopressin Release	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						osmoreceptor; sepsis; thirst; vasopressin	MAGNOCELLULAR NEUROSECRETORY NEURONS; LAMINA TERMINALIS NEURONS; ORGANUM VASCULOSUM; SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; SEPTIC SHOCK; OSMOSENSORY TRANSDUCTION; POLYMICROBIAL SEPSIS; OSMOTIC STIMULATION; WATER-DEPRIVATION; CECAL LIGATION	Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the systemic inflammatory response to a bacterial infection. Although much is known about the cellular and molecular changes that characterize the peripheral inflammatory response to sepsis, almost nothing is known of the neuronal changes that cause associated perturbations in the central control of homeostasis. Osmoregulation is one of the key homeostatic systems perturbed during sepsis. In healthy subjects, systemic hypertonicity normally excites osmoreceptor neurons in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT), which then activates downstream neurons that induce a parallel increase in water intake and arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion to promote fluid expansion and maintain blood pressure. However, recent studies have shown that the early phase of sepsis is associated with increased AVP levels and suppressed thirst. Here we examined the electrophysiological properties of OVLT neurons and magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) in acute in vitro preparations obtained from rats subjected to sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We found that the intrinsic excitability of OVLT neurons was not affected significantly 18 -24 h after CLP. However, OVLT neurons in CLP rats were hyperpolarized significantly compared with shams. Moreover, a reduced proportion of these cells displayed spontaneous electrical activity and osmoresponsiveness in septic animals. In contrast, the osmoresponsiveness of MNCs was only attenuated by CLP, and a larger proportion of these neurons displayed spontaneous electrical activity in septic animals. These results suggest that acute sepsis disrupts centrally mediated osmoregulatory reflexes through differential effects on the properties of neurons in the OVLT and supraoptic nucleus.

The authors examined brain oxygenation patterns in subjects with severe and minor persistent postconcussive difficulties and a healthy control group during working memory tasks in prefrontal brain regions using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The results demonstrated decreased working memory performances among concussed subjects with severe postconcussive symptoms that were accompanied by decreased brain oxygenation patterns. An association appears to exist between decreased brain oxygenation, poor performance of working memory tasks, and increased symptom severity scores in subjects suffering from persistent postconcussive symptoms.

Retrospective Analysis of the Short-Term Safety of ECT in Patients With Neurological Comorbidities: A Guide for Pre-ECT Neurological Evaluations	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article							ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DEPRESSED-PATIENTS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CLINICAL-EXPERIENCE; EEG ABNORMALITIES; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CASE-SERIES; HEADACHE; EFFICACY	Pre-ECT neurology consultations are often requested to determine the relative risk of the procedure in patients with neurological comorbidities, but there is limited data to guide clinicians. The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all consecutive inpatients at McLean Hospital who underwent a pre-ECT neurological evaluation between January 2012 and June 2014 (N=68). ECT was safe and effective in patients with a wide variety of neurological diseases. Only one minor event was related to a neurological comorbidity, and there were no serious neurological complications. Based on the latest evidence, the authors provide guidance on the pre-ECT evaluation with respect to neurologic status.

J	Walburg, V; Chiaramello, S				Walburg, V.; Chiaramello, S.			Link between early maladaptive schemas and defense mechanisms	EUROPEAN REVIEW OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE			English	Article						Defense mechanisms; Early maladaptive schemas; Daily hassles; Schema therapy	BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; STYLE QUESTIONNAIRE; CORE BELIEFS; FOCUSED THERAPY; DAILY HASSLES; DEPRESSION; STRESS; SYMPTOMS; DISTRESS; MODES	Introduction. - Defense mechanism and early maladaptive schemas are two concepts distorting the perception of reality. Objective. - The aim of this study was to explore the link between two reality-distorting concepts from two theoretical models: early maladaptive schemas from the cognitive and behavioral model and defense mechanisms based on the psychoanalytic model. Method. - Two hundred thirty-two non-clinical participants completed the Defense Style Questionnaire and the Young Schema Questionnaire (short version). Then a Bravais Pearson correlation analysis connecting these two concepts, and a multiple regressions analysis using early maladaptive schemas as predictors for defense style mechanisms levels were conducted. Results. - The results indicate that 2 early maladaptive schema domains (i.e. other-directedness as well as over-vigilance and inhibition) predict the frequency of use of the neurotic defense mechanism, and 3 schema domains (i.e. disconnection and rejection, impaired autonomy and performances as well as impaired limits) predict the frequency of use of the immature defense mechanism. Conclusion. - To conclude, two psychological concepts based on two different theoretical models (psychoanalytic and cognitive and behavioral therapy) seem to share an important link justifying the use of integrative therapies such as schema therapy.

Predicting prolonged length of hospital stay in older emergency department users: Use of a novel analysis method, the Artificial Neural Network	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Inpatients; Elderly; Screening; Length of hospital stay	FUNCTIONAL DECLINE; RISK; PEOPLE; FRAILTY; ADULTS; CARE; INTERVENTION; MULTICENTER; INPATIENTS; OUTCOMES	Objective: To examine performance criteria (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV], likelihood ratios [LR], area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]) of a 10-item brief geriatric assessment (BGA) for the prediction of prolonged length hospital stay (LHS) in older patients hospitalized in acute carewards after an emergency department (ED) visit, using artificial neural networks (ANNs); and to describe the contribution of each BGA item to the predictive accuracy using the AUROC value. Methods: A total of 993 geriatric ED users admitted to acute care wards were included in this prospective cohort study. Age>85 years, gendermale, polypharmacy, non use of formal and/or informal home-help services, history of falls, temporal disorientation, place of living, reasons and nature for ED admission, and use of psychoactive drugs composed the 10 items of BGA and were recorded at the ED admission. The prolonged LHS was defined as the top third of LHS. The ANNs were conducted using two feeds forward (multilayer perceptron [MLP] and modified MLP). Results: The best performance was reported with the modified MLP involving the 10 items (sensitivity=62.7%; specificity - 96.6%; PPV - 87.1; NPV - 87.5; positive LR - 18.2; AUC - 90.5). In thismodel, presence of chronic conditions had the highest contributions (51.3%) in AUROC value. Conclusions: The 10-item BGA appears to accurately predict prolonged LHS, using the ANNMLP method, showing the best criteria performance ever reported until now. Presence of chronic conditions was the main contributor for the predictive accuracy. (C) 2015 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Launay, C.

The weights of heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain were recorded in 68 pediatric ICU cases. For each organ, weight Z scores were calculated based on reference values previously established in large cohorts of deceased children by Kayser (any organ), or Dekaban and Sadowsky (brain only). Organ weight Z scores in pediatric ICU patients were severely increased (median [range] for heart, +3.2 [-6.3 to +37.7]; lungs, +3.0 [-8.6 to +38.1]; kidneys, +3.6 [-10.0 to +56.3]; liver, +4.2 [-14.9 to +70.5]; and spleen, +1.3 [-11.5 to +155.8]). Conversely, the brain weight Z score was lower compared to any other organ using either set of reference values: Kayser, 21.1 (-10.5 to +10.6; P < 0.0001); Dekaban and Sadowsky, 20.2 (-7.4 to +7.7; P < 0.0001). Pediatric ICU cases were subdivided based on disease acuity: (1) previously healthy with an acute illness (n = 11), (2) chronic disease due to congenital malformations (n 5 29), and (3) chronic disease without any detectable malformation (n = 28). Organ weight Z scores were similar among subgroups with the exception of the brain, which was statistically decreased in chronic disease pathologies (groups 2 and 3). Overall, this study demonstrates the heterogenous distribution of organ weights at autopsy in critically ill children; the weight of heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver, being most frequently increased. The brain is relatively smaller in chronic disease pathologies of pediatric ICU patients.

J	Palmer, C				Palmer, Caroline			LISTENING, IMAGINING, PERFORMING: MELODY AS A LIFE CYCLE OF MUSICAL THOUGHT	MUSIC PERCEPTION			English	Article						melody; salience; stability; coherence; communication	AUDITORY STREAM SEGREGATION; EXPECTANCY; PERCEPTION; COGNITION; MEMORY	MELODY HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A DISTINCT perceptual unit that exhibits stability and coherence to listeners and performers. These psychological processes (distinctiveness, stability, coherence) contribute to the foundations of three theories of music cognition (Bregman, 1990; Krumhansl, 1990; Narmour, 1990), yet several mysteries still exist in the human experience of melody. From early exposure to lullabies and brief exposures in advertising jingles, to the full-length concert exposure of complex musical works, listeners' imagination and focus are captured in unique ways by the experience of melody. People with various amounts of musical training hum, tap, clap, and find other ways of interacting with a melody; they perform to it. Listeners report the experience of a recurring melody playing in their minds (earworms). I discuss neuroscience findings that aid in modeling the fine-level time course of melodic experiences, and address how the listener/performer identifies a melody as distinct in a complex auditory scene, how expectations unfold in implications and realizations that contribute to coherence, and how hierarchical tonal relationships of stability are detected. The life cycle of a melody in the ears, brain, and heart of a listener/performer sheds light on the human experience of music.

PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING AUDITORY SCENE ANALYSIS	MUSIC PERCEPTION			English	Article						auditory perception; auditory scene analysis; ASA; CASA; auditory streaming; infants; auditory brain; music; animal perception	STREAM SEGREGATION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; NEWBORN-INFANTS; TONE SEQUENCES; ORGANIZATION; LISTENERS; SOUNDS; CORTEX; RULES	IN THIS PAPER, I MAKE THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS: (1) Subjective experience is tremendously useful in guiding productive research. (2) Studies of auditory scene analysis (ASA) in adults, newborn infants, and non-human animals (e.g., in goldfish or pigeons) establish the generality of ASA and suggest that it has an innate foundation. (3) ASA theory does not favor one musical style over another. (4) The principles used in the composition of polyphony (slightly modified) apply not only to one particular musical style or culture but to any form of layered music. (5) Neural explanations of ASA do not supersede explanations in terms of capacities; the two are complementary. (6) In computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) - ASA by computer systems - or any adequate theory of ASA, the most difficult challenge will be to discover how the contributions of a very large number of types of acoustical evidence and top-down schemas (acquired knowledge about the sound sources in our environments), can be coordinated without producing conflict that disables the system. (7) Finally I argue that the movement of a listener within the auditory scene provides him/her/it with rich information that should not be ignored by ASA theorists and researchers.

However, the mechanisms underlying such iron accumulation are not fully understood. We studied the expression and cellular localization of molecules involved in cellular iron influx, storage, and efflux. This was assessed in two mouse models of EAE: relapsing-remitting (RR-EAE) and chronic (CH-EAE). The expression of molecules involved in iron homeostasis was assessed at the onset, peak, remission/progressive and late stages of the disease. We provide several lines of evidence for iron accumulation in the EAE spinal cord which increases with disease progression and duration, is worse in CH-EAE, and is localized in macrophages and microglia. We also provide evidence that there is a disruption of the iron efflux mechanism in macrophages/microglia that underlie the iron accumulation seen in these cells. Macrophages/microglia also lack expression of the ferroxidases (ceruloplasmin and hephaestin) which have antioxidant effects. In contrast, astrocytes which do not accumulate iron, show robust expression of several iron influx and efflux proteins and the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin which detoxifies ferrous iron. Astrocytes therefore are capable of efficiently recycling iron from sites of EAE lesions likely into the circulation. We also provide evidence of marked dysregulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism genes, as well as of NADPH oxidase genes in the EAR spinal cord. This data provides the basis for the selective iron accumulation in macrophage/microglia and further evidence of severe mitochondrial dysfunction in RAE. It may provide insights into processes underling iron accumulation in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases in which iron accumulation occurs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

Guidelines recommend use of a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist in conjunction with a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist and corticosteroid in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. We aimed to assess rolapitant, an NK-1 receptor antagonist, for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer after administration of cisplatin-based highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Methods We conducted two global, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 trials (HEC-1 and HEC-2) at 155 cancer centres (76 in HEC-1 and 79 in HEC-2) in 26 countries (17 in HEC-1 and 14 in HEC-2). We enrolled patients with cancer aged 18 years or older, who had not previously been treated with cisplatin, with a Karnofsky performance score of 60 or higher, and a predicted life expectancy of 4 months or longer. We used an interactive web-based randomisation system to randomly assign patients to treatment. Patients were stratified by sex and randomly allocated to either oral rolapitant (180 mg dose; rolapitant group) or a placebo that was identical in appearance (active control group) about 1-2 h before administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy. All patients received granisetron (10 mu g/kg intravenously) and dexamethasone (20 mg orally) on day 1, and dexamethasone (8 mg orally) twice daily on days 2-4. Every cycle was a minimum of 14 days. In up to five subsequent cycles, patients were allowed to receive the same study drug they were assigned in cycle 1, unless removed at the clinician's discretion. Patients could also choose to leave the study at any point. Efficacy analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat population (comprising all patients who received at least one dose of study drug at a cancer centre compliant with Good Clinical Practice [GCP]). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (no emesis or use of rescue medication) in the delayed phase (>24-120 h after initiation of chemotherapy) in cycle 1. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01499849 and NCT01500213. Both studies have been completed. Findings Between Feb 21, 2012, and March 12, 2014, 532 patients in HEC-1 and 555 patients in HEC-2 were randomly assigned to treatment. 526 patients in HEC-1 (264 rolapitant and 262 active control) and 544 in HEC-2 (271 rolapitant and 273 active control) received at least one dose of study drug at a GCP-compliant site and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the rolapitant group had complete responses in the delayed phase than did patients in the active control group (HEC-1: 192 [73%] vs 153 [58%]; odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7; p=0.0006; HEC-2: 190 [70%] vs 169 [62%]; 1.4, 1.0-2.1; p=0.0426; pooled studies: 382 [71%] vs 322 [60%]; 1.6, 1.3-2.1; p=0.0001). The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups. The most commonly reported treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events in the rolapitant versus active control groups were headache (three [<1%] vs two [<1%]), hiccups (three [<1%] vs four [<1%]), constipation (two [<1%] vs three [<1%]), and dyspepsia (two [<1%] vs three [<1%]). For cycle 1, the most common grade 3-5 adverse events in patients allocated rolapitant versus active control were neutropenia (HEC-1: nine [3%] vs 14 [5%]; HEC-2: 16 [6%] vs 14 [ 5%]), anaemia (HEC-1: one [<1%] vs one [<1%]; HEC-2: seven [ 3%] vs two [<1%]), and leucopenia (HEC-1: six [2%] vs two [<1%]; HEC-2: two [<1%] vs two [<1%]).

Louis			New Protocol for Skin Landmark Registration in Image-Guided Neurosurgery: Technical Note	OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Anatomical landmarks; Image guided neurosurgery; Landmark registration; Neuronavigation; Registration error	FIDUCIAL LOCALIZATION ERROR; POINT-BASED REGISTRATION; NEURONAVIGATION; ACCURACY	BACKGROUND: Newer versions of the commercial Medtronic StealthStation allow the use of only 8 landmark pairs for patient-to-image registration as opposed to 9 landmarks in older systems. The choice of which landmark pair to drop in these newer systems can have an effect on the quality of the patient-to-image registration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 4 landmark registration protocols based on 8 landmark pairs and compare the resulting registration accuracy with a 9-landmark protocol. METHODS: Four different protocols were tested on both phantoms and patients. Two of the protocols involved using 4 ear landmarks and 4 facial landmarks and the other 2 involved using 3 ear landmarks and 5 facial landmarks. Both the fiducial registration error and target registration error were evaluated for each of the different protocols to determine any difference between them and the 9-landmark protocol. RESULTS: No difference in fiducial registration error was found between any of the 8-landmark protocols and the 9-landmark protocol. A significant decrease (P < .05) in target registration error was found when using a protocol based on 4 ear landmarks and 4 facial landmarks compared with the other protocols based on 3 ear landmarks. CONCLUSION: When using 8 landmarks to perform the patient-to-image registration, the protocol using 4 ear landmarks and 4 facial landmarks greatly outperformed the other 8-landmark protocols and 9-landmark protocol, resulting in the lowest target registration error.

Semantic properties, aptness, familiarity, conventionality, and interpretive diversity scores for 84 metaphors and similes	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	44th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Computers-in-Psychology (SCiP)	NOV 20, 2014	Long Beach, CA	Soc Comp Psychol		Metaphor; Simile; Semantic norms; Aptness; Conventionality; Familiarity; Interpretive diversity (entropy); Figurative language	COMPREHENSION; SIMILARITY; APPRECIATION; PREFERENCE; ENGLISH; CONTEXT; ERP	For 84 unique topic-vehicle pairs (e.g., knowledge-power), participants produced associated properties for the topics (e.g., knowledge), vehicles (e.g., power), metaphors (knowledge is power), and similes (knowledge is like power). For these properties, we also obtained frequency, saliency, and connotativeness scores (i.e., how much the properties deviated from the denotative or literal meaning). In addition, we examined whether expression type (metaphor vs. simile) impacted the interpretations produced. We found that metaphors activated more salient properties than did similes, but the connotativeness levels for metaphor and simile salient properties were similar. Also, the two types of expressions did not differ across a wide range of measures collected: aptness, conventionality, familiarity, and interpretive diversity scores. Combined with the property lists, these interpretation norms constitute a thorough collection of data about metaphors and similes, employing the same topic-vehicle words, which can be used in psycholinguistic and cognitive neuroscience studies to investigate how the two types of expressions are represented and processed. These norms should be especially useful for studies that examine the online processing and interpretation of metaphors and similes, as well as for studies examining how properties related to metaphors and similes affect the interpretations produced.

The presence of RNA foci, repeat-associated translation products, and sequestration of RNA binding proteins suggests that toxic RNA gain-of-function contributes to pathology while C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency may be an additional pathological factor. One viable therapeutic strategy for treating expansion diseases is the use of small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic modifier proteins to reactivate expanded genetic loci. Indeed, previous studies have established proof of this principle by increasing the drug-induced expression of expanded (and abnormally heterochromatinized) FMR1, FXN and C9ORF72 genes in respective patient cells. While epigenetic modifier proteins are increasingly recognized as druggable targets, there have been few screening strategies to address this avenue of drug discovery in the context of expansion diseases. Here we utilize a semi-high-throughput gene expression based screen to identify siRNAs and small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic modifier proteins that regulate C9ORF72 RNA in patient fibroblasts, lymphocytes and reprogrammed motor neurons. We found that several bromodomain small molecule inhibitors increase the expression of C9ORF72 mRNA and pre-mRNA without affecting repressive epigenetic signatures of expanded C9ORF72 alleles. These data suggest that bromodomain inhibition increases the expression of unexpanded C9ORF72 alleles and may therefore compensate for haploinsufficiency without increasing the production of toxic RNA and protein products, thereby conferring therapeutic value.

The aim of this study was to derive and validate a clinical case definition rule to identify neuropsychological impairment in children and adolescents. An existing normative pediatric sample was used to calculate base rates of abnormal functioning on eight measures covering six domains of neuropsychological functioning. The dataset was analyzed by varying the range of cutoff levels [1, 1.5, and 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean] and number of indicators of impairment. The derived rule was evaluated by bootstrap, internal and external clinical validation (orthopedic and traumatic brain injury). Our neuropsychological impairment (NPI) rule was defined as two or more test scores that fall 1.5 SDs below the mean. The rule identifies 5.1% of the total sample as impaired in the assessment battery and consistently targets between 3 and 7% of the population as impaired even when age, domains, and number of tests are varied. The NPI rate increases in groups known to exhibit cognitive deficits. The NPI rule provides a psychometrically derived method for interpreting performance across multiple tests and may be used in children 6-18 years. The rule may be useful to clinicians and scientists who wish to establish whether specific individuals or clinical populations present within expected norms versus impaired function across a battery of neuropsychological tests.

We modified the classic Posner paradigm, which assesses visuospatial attention, to also assess vigilance and impulsivity. This paradigm is based on the well-documented findings that a target will be detected more quickly if a visual cue indicates beforehand where it will appear, and more slowly if the cue indicates a false spatial location. In our task, visual distractors were introduced, in addition to the classic Posner trials, to assess impulsivity, and a central smiley face, whose eye-movement cued the location of the targets, to measure spatial attention. This task was administered to 27 school-age Inuit children (mean age = 11.2 years) from Nunavik (Arctic Quebec, Canada), in which pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental contaminants had been documented from birth. After controlling for the impact of confounding variables, multivariable regressions revealed that prenatal exposures to PCBs and Pb were significantly associated with greater inattention and impulsivity, respectively, while current exposure to Pb was significantly associated with longer reaction times. Although a significant correlation was observed between cord blood PCB concentration and decreased visuospatial performance, no significant association was found after adjustment for confounders. No effect was found for Hg exposures. These results suggest that our adapted Posner paradigm is sensitive in detecting a range of attention deficits in children exposed to environmental contaminants; implications for future studies are discussed.

Participants: Fifty untreated OSA patients aged between 55 and 85 years, divided into mild, moderate, and severe OSA, and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Interventions: N/A. Measurements: Using statistical parametric mapping, rCBF was compared between groups and correlated with clinical, respiratory, and sleep variables. Results: Whereas no rCBF change was observed in mild and moderate groups, participants with severe OSA had reduced rCBF compared to controls in the left parietal lobules, left precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyri, and right precuneus. Reduced rCBF in these regions and in areas of the bilateral frontal and left temporal cortex was associated with more hypopneas, snoring, hypoxemia, and sleepiness. Higher apnea, microarousal, and body mass indexes were correlated to increased rCBF in the basal ganglia, insula, and limbic system. Conclusions: While older individuals with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) had hypoperfusion in the sensorimotor and parietal areas, respiratory variables and subjective sleepiness were correlated with extended regions of hypoperfusion in the lateral cortex. Interestingly, OSA severity, sleep fragmentation, and obesity correlated with increased perfusion in subcortical and medial cortical regions. Anomalies with such a distribution could result in cognitive deficits and reflect impaired vascular regulation, altered neuronal integrity, and/or undergoing neurodegenerative processes.

The updated Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich sources	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						errata, addenda; large-scale structure of Universe; galaxies: clusters: general; catalogs	GALAXY CLUSTERS; PAN-STARRS; TELESCOPE	We update the all-sky Planck catalogue of 1227 clusters and cluster candidates (PSZ1) published in March 2013, derived from detections of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect using the first 15.5 months of Planck satellite observations. As an addendum, we deliver an updated version of the PSZ1 catalogue, reporting the further confirmation of 86 Planck-discovered clusters. In total, the PSZ1 now contains 947 confirmed clusters, of which 214 were confirmed as newly discovered clusters through follow-up observations undertaken by the Planck Collaboration. The updated PSZ1 contains redshifts for 913 systems, of which 736 (similar to 80.6%) are spectroscopic, and associated mass estimates derived from the Y-z mass proxy. We also provide a new SZ quality flag for the remaining 280 candidates. This flag was derived from a novel artificial neural-network classification of the SZ signal. Based on this assessment, the purity of the updated PSZ1 catalogue is estimated to be 94%. In this release, we provide the full updated catalogue and an additional readme file with further information on the Planck SZ detections.	[Bartlett, J.

There is a large literature in mathematics and physics which proposes mathematical models for the physiological systems and carries out analyses of the properties of these models using nonlinear dynamics concepts involving analyses of the stability and bifurcations of attractors. This paper discusses how these concepts can be applied to medicine. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, accessed through Ovid Technologies, Inc, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text, accessed through EBSCO host, from 1990 to 2015. Our search strategies combined controlled vocabulary relevant to each database (eg, MeSH for MEDLINE) and text words relevant to our research question and the inclusion criteria. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies were eligible. Random pairs of independent reviewers screened studies for relevance and critically appraised relevant studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. Studies with low risk of bias were synthesized following best evidence synthesis principles. Results: We screened 6618 articles and critically appraised 11 studies. Of those, 7 had low risk of bias: 5 addressed carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 2 addressed de Quervain disease. We found evidence that various types of night splints lead to similar outcomes for the management of CTS. The evidence suggests that a night wrist splint is less effective than surgery in the short term but not in the long term. Furthermore, a night wrist splint and needle electroacupuncture lead to similar outcomes immediately postintervention. Finally, low-level laser therapy and placebo low-level laser therapy lead to similar outcomes. The evidence suggests that kinesio tape or a thumb spica cast offers short-term benefit for the management of de Quervain disease. Our search did not identify any low risk of bias studies examining the effectiveness of passive physical modalities for the management of other soft tissue injuries or neuropathies of the wrist and hand. Conclusions: Different night orthoses provided similar outcomes for CTS. Night orthoses offer similar outcomes to electroacupuncture but are less effective than surgery in the short term. This review suggests that kinesio tape or a thumb spica cast may offer short-term benefit for the management of de Quervain disease.

Neural systems may thus have evolved to implement similar algorithms across modalities to extract behaviorally relevant stimulus information, leading to the notion of a canonical computation. In both vision and touch, information about motion is extracted from a spatiotemporal pattern of activation across a sensory sheet (in the retina and in the skin, respectively), a process that has been extensively studied in both modalities. In this essay, we examine the processing of motion information as it ascends the primate visual and somatosensory neuraxes and conclude that similar computations are implemented in the two sensory systems.

Factors associated with the risk profiles of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with DM are not well established. Heart rate turbulence (HRT) and T-wave alternans (TWA) are often used to predict arrhythmia events. Methods and ResultsHRT and TWA were measured in two independent groups: the ARTEMIS cohort study and the REFINE-ICD randomized trial. ARTEMIS assesses risk 3-12 months after coronary angiography in patients with CAD. The initial 1001 patients in ARTEMIS, 526 with and 475 without DM, are included in this analysis. REFINE-ICD compares usual care versus usual care plus ICD therapy in patients with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) values of 36-50% assessed 2-15 months after myocardial infarction. The initial 275 patients screened in REFINE ICD are included in this analysis. Abnormal HRT plus TWA was more common in patients with versus without DM in ARTEMIS (125/526, 24% vs 63/475, 13%; P < 0.001) and REFINE-ICD (43/55, 78% vs 55/220, 25%; P < 0.001), respectively. Abnormal HRT plus TWA was also more common in patients with LVEF values < 50% (28%) vs 50% (18%; P < 0.001) in ARTEMIS and LVEF values below the population median of 42% (60/138, 43%) versus above the median (38/137, 28%; P < 0.01) in REFINE-ICD.

J	Alluin, O; Delivet-Mongrain, H; Rossignol, S				Alluin, Olivier; Delivet-Mongrain, Hugo; Rossignol, Serge			Inducing hindlimb locomotor recovery in adult rat after complete thoracic spinal cord section using repeated treadmill training with perineal stimulation only	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						kinematics; locomotion; neuroplasticity; rat; spinal cord injury	EMBRYONIC RAPHE NUCLEI; EPIDURAL STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; QUIPAZINE TREATMENT; RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; TRANSECTED RATS; MOTOR FUNCTIONS; NEONATAL MOUSE; SEROTONIN; INJURY	Although a complete thoracic spinal cord section in various mammals induces paralysis of voluntary movements, the spinal lumbosacral circuitry below the lesion retains its ability to generate hindlimb locomotion. This important capacity may contribute to the overall locomotor recovery after partial spinal cord injury (SCI). In rats, it is usually triggered by pharmacological and/or electrical stimulation of the cord while a robot sustains the animals in an upright posture. In the present study we daily trained a group of adult spinal (T-7) rats to walk with the hindlimbs for 10 wk (10 min/day for 5 days/wk), using only perineal stimulation. Kinematic analysis and terminal electromyographic recordings revealed a strong effect of training on the reexpression of hindlimb locomotion. Indeed, trained animals gradually improved their locomotion while untrained animals worsened throughout the post-SCI period. Kinematic parameters such as averaged and instant swing phase velocity, step cycle variability, foot drag duration, off period duration, and relationship between the swing features returned to normal values only in trained animals. The present results clearly demonstrate that treadmill training alone, in a normal horizontal posture, elicited by noninvasive perineal stimulation is sufficient to induce a persistent hindlimb locomotor recovery without the need for more complex strategies. This provides a baseline level that should be clearly surpassed if additional locomotor-enabling procedures are added. Moreover, it has a clinical value since intrinsic spinal reorganization induced by training should contribute to improve locomotor recovery together with afferent feedback and supraspinal modifications in patients with incomplete SCI.

HPeVs occur worldwide, comprising up to 17 genotypes. HPeV1 and HPeV3 are most common. Clinical disease varies somewhat among genotypes. HPeV1 causes mostly gastrointestinal infections. HPeV3's prominence is due to its causing sepsis syndromes and central nervous system (CNS) infections in young infants. Currently, HPeV3 is the most common single cause of aseptic meningitis/meningoencephalitis in infants less than 90 days old in North America, usually with biannual summer-fall seasonality. HPeV3 CNS infections usually lack cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Mortality and sequelae are uncommon, usually accompanying initially severe or neurologically complicated acute illnesses.

The objectives of this paper were to determine the survival of pediatric medulloblastoma in Canada, to determine if there has been an improvement in the survival rates between the years of 1990 and 2009, inclusive, and to determine prognostic factors for survival. All patients under the age of 18 years diagnosed with medulloblastoma from 1990 to 2009, inclusive, in Canada were included. Data collected included date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, gender, stage, pathology, treatment, recurrence and current status. From these, survival rates were determined. Data were obtained on 628 eligible patients. The overall 5-year survival rate for the study time period was 69.2 +/- A 3.3 %. The survival rate increased during the interval of 1996-2000, then remained stable; 1990-1994: 60.2 +/- A 4.3 %; 1995-1999: 73.2 +/- A 3.5 %; 2000-2004: 68.8 +/- A 3.7 %; and 2005-2009: 72.1 +/- A 4.9 %, p = 0.05. Children over 14 years of age had a significantly better overall survival than those age 5-14 and those under 5 (85.7 +/- A 5.5 % vs 76.1 +/- A 2.7 % and 60.8 +/- A 3 % respectively, p = 0.001). Histologic medulloblastoma subtype and M stage of disease did not result in significant differences in survival. Despite changes in approaches to therapy, we demonstrate a steady survival rate for children with medulloblastoma after 1996. In our analyses, age over 14 years was associated with a higher survival rate.

Despite the critical nature of these variables, the drug addiction field often ignores pharmacokinetic issues, which we argue can lead to false conclusions. First, we review the clinical data demonstrating the importance of the speed of drug onset and of intermittent patterns of drug intake in psychostimulant drug addiction. This is followed by a review of the preclinical literature demonstrating that pharmacokinetic variables play a decisive role in determining behavioural and neurobiological outcomes in animal models of addiction. This literature includes recent data highlighting the importance of intermittent, 'spiking' brain levels of drug in producing an increase in the motivation to take drug over time. Rapid drug onset and intermittent drug exposure both appear to push the addiction process forward most effectively. This has significant implications for refining animal models of addiction and for better understanding the neuroadaptations that are critical for the disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We wished to find out whether a musicians auditory system also develops increased sensitivity to any sound of everyday life, experiencing them as noise. For this purpose, an online survey, including questionnaires on noise sensitivity, musical background, and listening tests for assessing musical aptitude, was administered to 197 participants in Finland and Italy. Subjective noise sensitivity (assessed with the Weinsteins Noise Sensitivity Scale) was analyzed for associations with musicianship, musical aptitude, weekly time spent listening to music, and the importance of music in each persons life (or music importance). Subjects were divided into three groups according to their musical expertise: Nonmusicians (N = 103), amateur musicians (N = 44), and professional musicians (N = 50). The results showed that noise sensitivity did not depend on musical expertise or performance on musicality tests or the amount of active (attentive) listening to music. In contrast, it was associated with daily passive listening to music, so that individuals with higher noise sensitivity spent less time in passive (background) listening to music than those with lower sensitivity to noise. Furthermore, noise-sensitive respondents rated music as less important in their life than did individuals with lower sensitivity to noise. The results demonstrate that the special sensitivity of the auditory system derived from musical training does not lead to increased irritability from unwanted sounds. However, the disposition to tolerate contingent musical backgrounds in everyday life depends on the individuals noise sensitivity.

Methods: We employed field potential recordings of epileptiform activity in rat brain slices induced with the application of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. Local connections between the EC and subiculum were severed to understand how EC-subicular circuits contribute to patterns of epileptiform synchronization. Results: First, we found that ictal discharges occurred synchronously in these two structures, initiating from either the EC or subiculum, and were characterized by low voltage fast (LVF) or sudden onsets. Second, sudden onset ictal events initiated more frequently in the EC, whereas LVF onset ictal discharges appeared more likely to initiate in the subiculum (P < 0.001). In both structures, polyspike interictal discharges occurred in brain slices generating sudden onset ictal events while isolated slow interictal discharges were recorded in experiments characterized by LVF onset ictal activity. Third, severing the connections between subiculum and EC desynchronized both interictal and ictal discharges occurring in these two regions, leading to a significant decrease in ictal duration (regardless of the onset type) along with blockade of polyspike interictal activity in subiculum. Conclusions: These findings highlight the contribution of EC:subicular interactions to epileptiform synchronization and, specifically, to ictogenesis in this in vitro model.

Methods: All articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to November 2014), and gray literature were searched. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology by two independent reviewers. Results: Overall, 13 studies were identified, with 11 manuscripts and 2 meeting abstracts. Seventy-six adult patients were treated for 82 episodes of SE/RSE. Patients had varying numbers of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), 1-12, on board prior to lidocaine therapy. During 69 of the 82 (84.1%) episodes of SE/RSE, phenytoin was on board. The dose regimen of lidocaine varied, with some utilizing bolus dosing alone; others utilizing a combination of bolus and infusion therapy. Overall, 70.7% of seizures responded to lidocaine, with complete cessation and greater than 50% reduction seen in 64.1% and 6.1% respectively. Patient outcomes were sparingly reported. Conclusions: There currently exists level 4, GRADE C evidence to support the consideration of lidocaine for SE and RSE in the adult population. Thus there is currently weak evidence to support the use of lidocaine in this context. Further prospective studies of lidocaine administration in this setting are warranted.

A neutral/positive/negative face recognition task was administered the evening before (learning and immediate recognition) and the morning after (delayed recognition) sleep. The number of rapid eye movements (REMs), beta and theta EEG activity over the visual areas were measured during REM sleep. Compared to neurotypical children, children with ASD showed more theta activity and longer reaction time (RT) for correct responses in delayed recognition of neutral faces. Both groups showed a positive correlation between sleep and performance but different patterns emerged: in neurotypical children, accuracy for recalling neutral faces and overall RT improvement overnight was correlated with EEG activity and REMs; in children with ASD, overnight RT improvement for positive and negative faces correlated with theta and beta activity, respectively. These results suggest that neurotypical and children with ASD use different sleep-related brain networks to process faces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Anne			Dendritic Polyglycerol Sulfate Inhibits Microglial Activation and Reduces Hippocampal CA1 Dendritic Spine Morphology Deficits	BIOMACROMOLECULES			English	Article							POLYETHER POLYOLS; L-SELECTIN; BRAIN; DISEASE; CELLS; INFLAMMATION; DENDRIMERS; NEUROINFLAMMATION; DERIVATIVES; COGNITION	Hyperactivity of microglia and loss of functional circuitry is a common feature of many neurological disorders including those induced or exacerbated by inflammation. Herein, we investigate the response of microglia and changes in hippocampal dendritic postsynaptic spines by dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) treatment. Mouse microglia and organotypic hippocampal slices were exposed to dPGS and an inflammogen (lipopolysaccharides). Measurements of intracellular fluorescence and confocal microscopic analyses revealed that dPGS is avidly internalized by microglia but not CA1 pyramidal neurons. Concentration and time-dependent response studies consistently showed no obvious toxicity of dPGS. The adverse effects induced by proinflammogen LPS exposure were reduced and dendritic spine morphology was normalized with the addition of dPGS. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in nitrite and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) from hyperactive microglia suggesting normalized circuitry function with dPGS treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that dPGS acts anti-inflammatory, inhibits inflammation-induced degenerative changes in microglia phenotype and rescues dendritic spine morphology.

However, it is unclear whether the rich variety of responses observed across the brain is functionally meaningful and consistent across individuals. Here, we used a multivariate clustering approach that grouped brain regions into clusters based on the similarity of their task-evoked temporal responses at the individual level, and then established the spatial consistency of these individual clusters at the group level. We observed a stable pseudohierarchy of task-evoked networks in the context of a delayed sequential motor task, where the fractionation of networks was driven by a gradient of involvement in motor sequence preparation versus execution. In line with theories about higher-level cognitive functioning, this gradient evolved in a rostro-caudal manner in the frontal lobe. In addition, parcellations in the cerebellum and basal ganglia matched with known anatomical territories and fiber pathways with the cerebral cortex. These findings demonstrate that subtle variations in brain responses associated with task performance are systematic enough across subjects to define a pseudohierarchy of task-evoked networks. Such networks capture meaningful functional features of brain organization as shaped by a given cognitive context.

An emblematic case is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common drug-resistant epilepsy that is electroclinically defined as a focal epilepsy and pathologically associated with hippocampal sclerosis. In this review, we will summarize histopathological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging evidence supporting the concept that the substrate of TLE is not limited to the hippocampus alone, but rather is broadly distributed across multiple brain regions and interconnecting white matter pathways. We will introduce basic concepts of graph theory, a formalismto quantify topological properties of complex systems that has recently been widely applied to study networks derived from brain imaging and electrophysiology. We will discuss converging graph theoretical evidence indicating that networks in TLE show marked shifts in their overall topology, providing insight into the neurobiology of TLE as a network-level disorder. Our review will conclude by discussing methodological challenges and future clinical applications of this powerful analytical approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PDE is caused by deficiency of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase resulting in impaired lysine degradation and subsequent accumulation of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde. Despite adequate seizure control with pyridoxine monotherapy, 75% of individuals with PDE have significant developmental delay and intellectual disability. We describe a new combined therapeutic approach to reduce putative toxic metabolites from impaired lysine metabolism. This approach utilizes pyridoxine, a lysine-restricted diet to limit the substrate that leads to neurotoxic metabolite accumulation and L-arginine to compete for brain lysine influx and liver mitochondrial import. We report the developmental and biochemical outcome of six subjects who were treated with this triple therapy. Triple therapy reduced CSF, plasma, and urine biomarkers associated with neurotoxicity in PDE. The addition of arginine supplementation to children already treated with dietary lysine restriction and pyridoxine further reduced toxic metabolites, and in some subjects appeared to improve neurodevelopmental outcome. Dietary lysine restriction was associated with improved seizure control in one subject, and the addition of arginine supplementation increased the objective motor outcome scale in two twin siblings, illustrating the contribution of each component of this treatment combination. Optimal results were noted in the individual treated with triple therapy early in the course of the disease. Residual disease symptoms could be related to early injury suggested by initial MR imaging prior to initiation of treatment or from severe epilepsy prior to diagnosis. This observational study reports the use of triple therapy, which combines three effective components in this rare condition, and suggests that early diagnosis and treatment with this new triple therapy may ameliorate the cognitive impairment in POE.

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database Mortality Risk Model: Part 2-Clinical Application	ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	61st Annual Meeting of the Southern-Thoracic-Surgical-Association	NOV 05-08, 2014	Tucson, AZ	So Thorac Surg Assoc			EMPIRICALLY BASED TOOL; CARDIAC-SURGERY; OPERATIONS; OUTCOMES; DISEASE	Background. The empirically derived 2014 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database Mortality Risk Model incorporates adjustment for procedure type and patient-specific factors. The purpose of this report is to describe this model and its application in the assessment of variation in outcomes across centers. Methods. All index cardiac operations in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2013) were eligible for inclusion. Isolated patent ductus arteriosus closures in patients weighing less than or equal to 2.5 kg were excluded, as were centers with more than 10% missing data and patients with missing data for key variables. The model includes the following covariates: primary procedure, age, any prior cardiovascular operation, any noncardiac abnormality, any chromosomal abnormality or syndrome, important preoperative factors (mechanical circulatory support, shock persisting at time of operation, mechanical ventilation, renal failure requiring dialysis or renal dysfunction (or both), and neurological deficit), any other preoperative factor, prematurity (neonates and infants), and weight (neonates and infants). Variation across centers was assessed. Centers for which the 95% confidence interval for the observed-to-expected mortality ratio does not include unity are identified as lower-performing or higher-performing programs with respect to operative mortality. Results. Included were 52,224 operations from 86 centers. Overall discharge mortality was 3.7% (1,931 of 52,224). Discharge mortality by age category was neonates, 10.1% (1,129 of 11,144); infants, 3.0% (564 of 18,554), children, 0.9% (167 of 18,407), and adults, 1.7% (71 of 4,119). For all patients, 12 of 86 centers (14%) were lower-performing programs, 67 (78%) were not outliers, and 7 (8%) were higher-performing programs. Conclusions. The 2014 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database Mortality Risk Model facilitates description of outcomes (mortality) adjusted for procedural and for patient-level factors. Identification of low-performing and high-performing programs may be useful in facilitating quality improvement efforts.

Spatial and temporal expression of immunoglobulin superfamily member 1 in the rat	JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						expression profiling; rat; hypothalamus; choroid plexus; pituitary gland; testis	INHIBIN-BINDING-PROTEIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CENTRAL HYPOTHYROIDISM; ESTROUS-CYCLE; PITUITARY; IGSF1; CELLS; TRANSCRIPTOMES; IDENTIFICATION; SECRETION	Loss-of-function mutations in the immunoglobulin superfamily member 1 (IGSF1) gene cause an X-linked syndrome of central hypothyroidism, macroorchidism, variable prolactin and GH deficiency, delayed pubertal testosterone rise, and obesity. To understand the pathophysiology of this syndrome, knowledge on IGSF1's place in normal development is imperative. Therefore, we investigated spatial and temporal protein and mRNA expression of IGSF1 in rats using immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and in situ hybridization. We observed high levels of IGSF1 expression in the brain, specifically the embryonic and adult choroid plexus and hypothalamus (principally in glial cells), and in the pituitary gland (PIT1-lineage of GH, TSH, and PRL-producing cells). IGSF1 is also expressed in the embryonic and adult zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, islets of Langerhans of the pancreas, and costameres of the heart and skeletal muscle. IGSF1 is highly expressed in fetal liver, but is absent shortly after birth. In the adult testis, IGSF1 is present in Sertoli cells (epithelial stages XIII-VI), and elongating spermatids (stages X-XII). Specificity of protein expression was corroborated with Igsf1 mRNA expression in all tissues. The expression patterns of IGSF1 in the pituitary gland and testis are consistent with the pituitary hormone deficiencies and macroorchidism observed in patients with IGSF1 deficiency. The expression in the brain, adrenal gland, pancreas, liver, and muscle suggest IGSF1's function in endocrine physiology might be more extensive than previously considered.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Optimal Target Region for Subject Classification on the Basis of Amyloid PET Images	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; beta-amyloid; F-18-florbetapir; mild cognitive impairment; PET	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FLORBETAPIR F 18; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; HEALTHY CONTROLS; BETA PET; MRI DATA; DEPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA	Classification of subjects on the basis of amyloid PET scans is increasingly being used in research studies and clinical practice. Although qualitative, visual assessment is currently the gold standard approach, automated classification techniques are inherently more reproducible and efficient. The objective of this work was to develop a statistical approach for the automated classification of subjects with different levels of cognitive impairment into a group with low amyloid levels (A beta(L)) and a group with high amyloid levels (A beta(H)) through the use of amyloid PET data from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. Methods: In our framework, an iterative, voxelwise, regularized discriminant analysis is combined with a receiver operating characteristic approach that optimizes the selection of a region of interest (ROI) and a cutoff value for the automated classification of subjects into the A beta(L) and A beta(H) groups. The robustness, spatial stability, and generalization of the resulting target ROIs were evaluated by use of the standardized uptake value ratio for F-18-florbetapir PET images from subjects who served as healthy controls, subjects who had mild cognitive impairment, and subjects who had Alzheimer disease and were participating in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. Results: We determined that several iterations of the discriminant analysis improved the classification of subjects into the A beta(L) and A beta(H) groups. We found that an ROI consisting of the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and the medial frontal cortex yielded optimal group separation and showed good stability across different reference regions and cognitive cohorts. A key step in this process was the automated determination of the cutoff value for group separation, which was dependent on the reference region used for the standardized uptake value ratio calculation and which was shown to have a relatively narrow range across subject groups. Conclusion: We developed a data-driven approach for the determination of an optimal target ROI and an associated cutoff value for the separation of subjects into the A beta(L) and A beta(H) groups. Future work should include the application of this process to other datasets to facilitate the determination of the translatability of the optimal ROI obtained in this study to other populations. Ideally, the accuracy of our target ROI and cutoff value could be further validated with PET-autopsy data from large-scale studies. It is anticipated that this approach will be extremely useful for the enrichment of study populations in clinical trials involving putative disease-modifying therapeutic agents for Alzheimer disease.

Long-Term Outcome of the Management of Chronic Neuropathic Pain: A Prospective Observational Study	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Prospective cohort study; chronic neuropathic pain; long-term outcome; opioid treatment	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; OPIOID THERAPY; BACK-PAIN; GUIDELINES; EFFICACY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INDIVIDUALS	This prospective observational cohort study addressed the long-term clinical effectiveness of the management of chronic neuropathic noncancer pain at 7 Canadian tertiary pain centers. Patients were treated according to standard guidelines and were followed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Standard outcome measures for pain, mood, quality of life, and overall treatment satisfaction were administered, with the primary outcome measure designated as the composite of 30% reduction in average pain intensity and 1-point decrease in the mean Interference Scale Score (0-10) of the Brief Pain Inventory at 12 months relative to baseline. Of 789 patients recruited, mean age was 53.5 +/- 14.2 years (55% female) and mean duration of pain was 4.88 +/- 5.82 years. Mean average pain intensity (0-10), at baseline was 6.1 +/- 1.9. All standard outcome measures showed statistically significant improvement at 12 months relative to baseline (P < .001). However, only 23.7% attained clinically significant improvement in pain and function at 12 months as the primary outcome measure. Univariable analyses showed poorer outcomes at 12-month follow-up with longer duration of pain (P = .002), greater cigarette use (P = .01), more disability compensation (P = .001), and higher opioid doses at baseline and at 12 months (P < .02). Our present treatment modalities provide significant long-term benefit in only about a quarter of patients with neuropathic pain managed at tertiary care pain clinics. Opioid therapy may not be beneficial for the long term. Perspective: Evidence-based treatment of chronic neuropathic pain provides long-term benefit in only about one-quarter of patients seen in tertiary care centers. Opioid therapy may not be beneficial.

We analyzed the clinical presentation and electrophysiological data of 12 children with a confirmed PMP22 gene deletion and reviewed the published reports of HNPP in children and compared our data with the reports from the literature review. Peroneal palsy was the most common presentation (42%) followed by brachial plexus palsy in 25% of our cases. Nerve conduction studies were always suggestive of the diagnosis demonstrating 3 major patterns: multifocal demyelination at the area of entrapment, generalized sensory-motor polyneuropathy and a combination of the two first patterns in a vast majority (60%). Surprisingly, there was bilateral or unilateral electrophysiological entrapment of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in all our patients. The clinical presentation of BNPP in childhood is heterogeneous and electrophysiological findings are helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Any unexplained mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy should lead to PMP22 gene testing to look for the deletion. Early diagnosis is important in order to facilitate appropriate genetic counseling and also for the appropriate care for these patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Decreased glucose transport into the brain results in seizures and cognitive dysfunction. The ketogenic diet is the treatment of choice, but complicated with compliance problems. Stabilization of blood glucose levels by low glycemic index diet and modified high amylopectin cornstarch would provide steady-state glucose transport into the brain to prevent seizures and cognitive dysfunction in patients with glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome as an alternative treatment. PATIENT: We report a new glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome patient (c.988C>T; p. Arg330X in the SLC2A1) treated with modified high amylopectin cornstarch (Glycosade) and low glycemic index diet because of compliance problems with the ketogenic diet. She was diagnosed at 11.5 years of age and was treated with the ketogenic diet between ages 12 and 18 years. RESULTS: She was started on modified high amylopectin cornstarch at bedtime and low glycemic index diet with meals and snacks every 3-4 hours. Within the first 6 months of therapy, she improved in her seizures and cognitive functions, but experienced compliance problems afterwards. Neuropsychological assessment was stable at 12 months of therapy. CONCLUSION: This diet was easy to apply compared with the ketogenic diet and resulted in stable neuropsychological functioning of this glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome patient. Modified high amylopectin cornstarch and low glycemic index diet might be an alternative treatment in glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome patients with compliance problems to the ketogenic diet treatment, but additional patients should be treated to prove usefulness of this new treatment.

MethodsThe validity of published International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, coding algorithms for identifying patients with particular chronic pain syndromes in the RAMQ database was tested using pain specialist-established diagnostic data of 561 patients enrolled in the Quebec Pain Registry, which was used as the reference standard. Modified versions of these algorithms (i.e., adaptation of the number of healthcare encounters) were also tested. For each algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. ResultsIn the RAMQ database, some previously published algorithms and modified versions of these algorithms were found to be valid for identifying patients suffering from chronic lumbar pain (sensitivity: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.59-0.71; specificity: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.79-0.87), chronic back pain (sensitivity: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.64-0.76; specificity: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.68-0.78), and chronic neck/back pain (sensitivity: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.65-0.76; specificity: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.72-0.82). Algorithms to identify patients with other types of chronic pain showed low sensitivity: complex regional pain syndrome (0.07), fibromyalgia (0.42), and neuropathic pain (0.39). ConclusionsOur study provides evidence supporting the value of the RAMQ administrative database for conducting research on certain types of chronic pain disorders including back and neck pain. Users should, however, be cautious about the limitations of this database for studying other types of chronic pain syndromes such as complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, and neuropathic pain.

Characterization and review of MTHFD1 deficiency: four new patients, cellular delineation and response to folic and folinic acid treatment	JOURNAL OF INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASE			English	Article							ONE-CARBON METABOLISM; NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; HEART-DEFECTS; RISK; POLYMORPHISMS; POPULATION; MUTATIONS; SEQUENCE; ENZYME; ALIGNMENT	In the folate cycle MTHFD1, encoded by MTHFD1, is a trifunctional enzyme containing 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity. To date, only one patient with MTHFD1 deficiency, presenting with hyperhomocysteinemia, megaloblastic anaemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and severe combined immunodeficiency, has been identified (Watkins et al J Med Genet 48:590-2, 2011). We now describe four additional patients from two different families. The second patient presented with hyperhomocysteinemia, megaloblastic anaemia, HUS, microangiopathy and retinopathy; all except the retinopathy resolved after treatment with hydroxocobalamin, betaine and folinic acid. The third patient developed megaloblastic anaemia, infection, autoimmune disease and moderate liver fibrosis but not hyperhomocysteinemia, and was successfully treated with a regime that included and was eventually reduced to folic acid. The other two, elder siblings of the third patient, died at 9 weeks of age with megaloblastic anaemia, infection and severe acidosis and had MTFHD1 deficiency diagnosed retrospectively. We identified a missense mutation (c.806C > T, p.Thr296Ile) and a splice site mutation (c.1674G > A) leading to exon skipping in the second patient, while the other three harboured a missense mutation (c.146C > T, p.Ser49Phe) and a premature stop mutation (c.673G > T, p.Glu225*), all of which were novel. Patient fibroblast studies revealed severely reduced methionine formation from [C-14]-formate, which did not increase in cobalamin supplemented culture medium but was responsive to folic and folinic acid. These additional cases increase the clinical spectrum of this intriguing defect, provide in vitro evidence of disturbed methionine synthesis and substantiate the effectiveness of folic or folinic acid treatment.

MethodsA survey including vignettes of eight incompetent patients requiring resuscitation was sent to 140 neonatologists. Patients ranged from a very preterm infant to 80 years old. While some had existing impairments, all faced risk of death or neurological sequelae. Respondents indicated whether they would resuscitate, whether they believed resuscitation was in the patients' best interests, whether they would want intervention for a family member and whether they would comply with families' wishes to withhold resuscitation. They were also asked how they would rank the eight patients in a triage situation. ResultsSeventy-eight per cent of specialists completed the survey. The majority of respondents gave priority to the resuscitation of children over adults. Less than 40% would agree to withhold resuscitation at families' request for all children except for the preterm infant, where 96% would comply with families' wishes to withhold intensive care despite 77% believing resuscitation to be in the infant's best interest. ConclusionThis study found inconsistencies between physicians' perceptions of the patient's best interest regarding resuscitation and their willingness to comply with families' wishes to withhold resuscitation and give comfort care. Accepting a family's refusal of resuscitation was more marked for the premature infant, even among respondents who thought that resuscitation was in the patient's best interest. These findings are consistent with other international studies.

Herpes zoster is a neurocutaneous disease resulting from the reactivation of endogenous varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in dorsal sensory or cranial nerve ganglia. Rarely, this infection manifests without the characteristic dermatomal rash, a condition termed zoster sine herpete. Viral spreading of herpes zoster in the head and neck may manifest as various signs and symptoms because of the multiple possible combinations of cranial neuropathies. With only six cases reported in the English literature up to now, isolated neuropathies of the vagus nerve in the absence of cutaneous lesions tend to be misdiagnosed as idiopathic laryngeal paralysis. Methods. We report a case of herpes zoster of the larynx in an 80-year-old man presenting with sore throat, dysphagia, and hoarseness. Results. Endoscopic examination revealed unilateral vocal fold paralysis, pooling of secretions, and mucosal vesicles of the hemilarynx. After the diagnosis of VZV infection with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, the patient was treated with valacyclovir and corticosteroids, leading to complete recovery after 2 months. Conclusions. Herpes zoster of the larynx is an uncommon condition that should be included in the differential diagnosis of laryngeal paralysis of idiopathic cause. We recommend performing a thorough examination of the pharyngolaryngeal structures and ordering PCR testing as the diagnostic method of choice.

Methods: Data were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, an international study of de novo, untreated PD patients and healthy controls. At baseline, participants were assessed with a wide range of motor and nonmotor scales, including the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Excessive daytime sleepiness was assessed based on the Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS), with a cutoff of 10. Results: Four hundred twenty-three PD subjects and 196 healthy controls were recruited into the study. Mean ESS (min, max) score was 5.8 (0, 20) for the PD subjects and 5.6 (0, 19) for healthy controls (P=0.54). Sixty-six (15.6%) PD subjects and 24 (12%) healthy controls had ESS of at least 10 (P=0.28). No difference was seen in demographic characteristics, age of onset, disease duration, PD subtype, cognitive status, or utilization of sedatives between the PD sleepiness-positive versus the negative group. The sleepiness-positive group had higher MDS-UPDRS Part I and II but not III scores, and higher depression and autonomic dysfunction scores. Sleepiness was associated with a marginal reduction of A-beta (P=0.05) but not alpha-synuclein spinal fluid levels in PD. Conclusions: This largest case control study demonstrates no difference in prevalence of excessive sleepiness in subjects with de novo untreated PD compared with healthy controls. The only clinical correlates of sleepiness were mood and autonomic dysfunction. Ongoing longitudinal analyses will be essential to further examine clinical and biological correlates of sleepiness in PD and specifically the role of dopaminergic therapy.

REM Sleep Behavior Disorder and Neuropathology in Parkinson's Disease	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; pathology; diagnosis; REM sleep behavior disorder	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; HARDWARE-RELATED INFECTIONS; OF-THE-LITERATURE; NEUROSTIMULATION; COMPLICATIONS; ACTIVATION; PATHOLOGY; SURGERY; CIRCUIT	Introduction: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with differences in clinical phenotype, including dementia, autonomic loss, and gait dysfunction. The pathological basis for this remains unclear. Methods: Parkinson's disease subjects in a longitudinal clinicopathologic study were screened for probable RBD with the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire. After death, semiquantitative analyses were conducted for synuclein, amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, and cerebrovascular lesions. Results: Forty cases had probable RBD (PD1RBD), and 41 did not (PD-RBD). Despite similar age at death (similar to 80 y) and disease duration (similar to 14.5 y), PD1RBD had increased synuclein deposition in all regions examined, with nine of 10 regions significantly different. The Lewy body 10-region total score (scale = 0-40) was 29.5 in PD1RBD versus 24.5 in PD-RBD (Cohen-d effect size = 0.79, P = 0.002). Cerebrovascular lesion burden was slightly higher in PD-RBD. Conclusions: Although overlap occurs between groups, PD patients with probable RBD may have greater density and range of synuclein pathology on autopsy.

These cues change during development and when assistive hearing devices are worn. Previous studies have found behavioral recalibration to modified localization cues in human adults, but very little is known about the neural correlates and mechanisms of this plasticity. We equipped participants with digital devices, worn in the ear canal that allowed us to delay sound input to one ear, and thus modify interaural time differences, a major cue for horizontal sound localization. Participants wore the digital earplugs continuously for nine days while engaged in day-to-day activities. Daily psychoacoustical testing showed rapid recalibration to the manipulation and confirmed that adults can adapt to shifted interaural time differences in their daily multisensory environment. High-resolution functional MRI scans performed before and after recalibration showed that recalibration was accompanied by changes in hemispheric lateralization of auditory cortex activity. These changes corresponded to a shift in spatial coding of sound direction comparable to the observed behavioral recalibration. Fitting the imaging results with a model of auditory spatial processing also revealed small shifts in voxel-wise spatial tuning within each hemisphere. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Diurnal fluctuations in brain volume: Statistical analyses of MRI from large populations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MRI; Brain atrophy; Diurnal change; Brain parenchymal fraction	RELAPSING MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; GRAY-MATTER ATROPHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SEGMENTATION; IMAGES; MS; DEHYDRATION; NATALIZUMAB; PROGRESSION; ACCURATE	We investigated fluctuations in brain volume throughout the day using statistical modeling of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from large populations. We applied fully automated image analysis software to measure the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), defined as the ratio of the brain parenchymal volume and intracranial volume, thus accounting for variations in head size. The MRI data came from serial scans of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in clinical trials (n = 755, 3269 scans) and from subjects participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 834, 6114 scans). The percent change in BPF was modeled with a linear mixed effect (LME) model, and the model was applied separately to the MS and ADNI datasets. The LME model for the MS datasets included random subject effects (intercept and slope over time) and fixed effects for the time-of-day, time from the baseline scan, and trial, which accounted for trial-related effects (for example, different inclusion criteria and imaging protocol). The model for ADNI additionally included the demographics (baseline age, sex, subject type [ normal, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease], and interaction between subject type and time from baseline). There was a statistically significant effect of time-of-day on the BPF change in MS clinical trial datasets (-0.180 per day, that is, 0.180% of intracranial volume, p=0.019) as well as the ADNI dataset (-0.438 per day, that is, 0.438% of intracranial volume, p < 0.0001), showing that the brain volume is greater in the morning. Linearly correcting the BPF values with the time-of-day reduced the required sample size to detect a 25% treatment effect (80% power and 0.05 significance level) on change in brain volume from 2 time-points over a period of 1 year by 2.6%. Our results have significant implications for future brain volumetric studies, suggesting that there is a potential acquisition time bias that should be randomized or statistically controlled to account for the day-to-day brain volume fluctuations.

In this paper, a unique combination of magnetization transfer, diffusion imaging and histology is presented, providing a novel method for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of the axon volume fraction and the myelin g-ratio. Our method was demonstrated in the corpus callosum of one cynomolgus macaque, and applied to obtain full-brain g-ratio maps in one healthy human subject and one multiple sclerosis patient. In the macaque, the g-ratio was relatively constant across the corpus callosum, as measured by both MRI and electron microscopy. In the human subjects, the g-ratio in multiple sclerosis lesions was higher than in normal appearing white matter, which was in turn higher than in healthy white matter. Measuring the g-ratio brings us one step closer to fully characterizing white matter non-invasively, making it possible to perform in vivo histology of the human brain during development, aging, disease and treatment.

There exists a family of diffusion MRI techniques, such as AxCaliber, that provide indices of axon microstructure, such as axon diameter and density. However, to obtain accurate measurements of axons with small diameters (<5 mu m), these techniques require strong gradients, i.e. an order of magnitude higher than the 40-80 mT/m currently available in clinical systems. In this study we acquired AxCaliber diffusion data at a variety of different q-values and diffusion times in the spinal cord of five healthy subjects using a 300 mT/m whole body gradient system. Acquisition and processing were optimized using state-of-the-artmethods (e.g., 64-channel coil, template-based analysis). Results consistently show an average axon diameter of 4.5 +/- 1.1 mu min the spinal cord white matter. Diameters ranged from 3.0 mu m(gracilis) to 5.9 mu m (spinocerebellar tracts). Values were similar across laterality (left-right), but statistically different across spinal cord pathways (p < 10(-5)). The observed trends are similar to those observed in animal histology. This study shows, for the first time, in vivo mapping of axon diameter in the spinal cord at 300 mT/m, thus creating opportunities for applications in spinal cord diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Nowhere is this more critical than in the brain where the extracellular concentration of some ions determines neurons' firing pattern and ability to encode information. Several neuronal functions depend on the ability of neurons to change their firing pattern to a rhythmic bursting pattern, whereas, in some circuits, rhythmic firing is, on the contrary, associated to pathologies like epilepsy or Parkinson's disease. In this review, we focus on the four main ions known to fluctuate during rhythmic firing: calcium, potassium, sodium, and chloride. We discuss the synergistic interactions between these elements to promote an oscillatory activity. We also review evidence supporting an important role for astrocytes in the homeostasis of each of these ions and describe mechanisms by which astrocytes may regulate neuronal firing by altering their extracellular concentrations. A particular emphasis is put on the mechanisms underlying rhythmogenesis in the circuit forming the central pattern generator (CPG) for mastication and other CPG systems. Finally, we discuss how an impairment in the ability of glial cells to maintain such homeostasis may result in pathologies like epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.

Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have hinted at interrelations between processing of these three domains. To unravel the neurocognitive basis of orientation, we used high-resolution 7T functional MRI as 16 subjects compared their subjective distance to different places, events, or people. Analysis at the individual-subject level revealed cortical activation related to orientation in space, time, and person in a precisely localized set of structures in the precuneus, inferior parietal, and medial frontal cortex. Comparison of orientation domains revealed a consistent order of cortical activity inside the precuneus and inferior parietal lobes, with space orientation activating posterior regions, followed anteriorly by person and then time. Core regions at the precuneus and inferior parietal lobe were activated for multiple orientation domains, suggesting also common processing for orientation across domains. The medial prefrontal cortex showed a posterior activation for time and anterior for person. Finally, the default-mode network, identified in a separate resting-state scan, was active for all orientation domains and overlapped mostly with person-orientation regions. These findings suggest that mental orientation in space, time, and person is managed by a specific brain system with a highly ordered internal organization, closely related to the default-mode network.

These ectopic glands have a normal follicular architecture but their thyrotropin-induced growth is insufficient, leading to congenital hypothyroidism in the vast majority of affected subjects. We hypothesized that arrested migration is due to premature differentiation [reflected by decreased telomere length (TL)], as observed in neural tube defects in mice. Methods: Absolute TL and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression was measured in four ectopic and six orthotopic thyroids. TL was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA, whereas hTERT expression was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of total RNA. Results: The mean +/- standard deviation TL (in kilobases per diploid genome) was 140.45 +/- 40.07 in ectopic and 97.50 +/- 30.48 in orthotopic thyroids (p=0.12). Expression of hTERT was quiescent in both ectopic and orthotopic thyroids. Conclusions: Compared with orthotopic thyroids, TL shortening is not observed in ectopic thyroid tissues and, consequently, no compensatory hTERT expression was measured. This makes premature differentiation an unlikely cause of arrested migration and it suggests, indirectly, that ectopic thyroids are not at higher risk of cancer than orthotopic thyroids.

However, these self-limiting conditions (with well-established negative feedback loops) become pathological if left uncontrolled. Both pain and inflammation can interact with each other in a multi-dimensional manner. These interactions are known to create an array of 'difficult to manage' pathologies. This review explains in detail the role of immune system and the related cells in peripheral sensitization and neurogenic inflammation. Various neuro-immune interactions are analyzed at peripheral, sensory and central nervous system levels. Innate immunity plays a critical role in central sensitization and in establishing acute pain as chronic condition. Moreover, inflammatory mediators also exhibit psychological effects, thus contributing towards the emotional elements associated with pain. However, there is also a considerable anti-inflammatory and analgesic role of immune system. This review also attempts to enlist various novel pharmacological approaches that exhibit their actions through modification of neuro-immune interface.

ResultsInitially, 54% (n=37) responded suggesting treatment for scenarios; 13 experts rated agreement with scenarios. Fourteen of 16 scenarios had agreement as follows: discoid lupus: first-line therapy was topical agents and hydroxychloroquine and/or glucocorticoids then azathioprine and subsequently mycophenolate (mofetil); uncomplicated cutaneous vasculitis: initial treatment was glucocorticoidshydroxychloroquine +/- methotrexate, followed by azathioprine or mycophenolate and then cyclophosphamide; arthritis: initial therapy was hydroxychloroquine and/or glucocorticoids, then methotrexate and subsequently rituximab; pericarditis: first-line therapy was nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, then glucocorticoids with/without hydroxychloroquine, then azathioprine, mycophenolate, or methotrexate and finally belimumab or rituximab, and/or a pericardial window; interstitial lung disease/alveolitis: induction was glucocorticoids and mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide, then rituximab or intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG), and maintenance followed with azathioprine or mycophenolate; pulmonary hypertension: glucocorticoids and mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide and an endothelin receptor antagonist were initial therapies, subsequent treatments were phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and then prostanoids and rituximab; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: standard anticoagulation with/without hydroxychloroquine, then a thrombin inhibitor for venous thrombosis, versus adding aspirin or platelet inhibition drugs for arterial events; mononeuritis multiplex and central nervous system vasculitis: first-line therapy was glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide followed by maintenance with azathioprine or mycophenolate, and then rituximab, IVIG, or plasmapheresis; and serious lupus nephritis: first-line therapy was glucocorticoids and mycophenolate, then cyclophosphamide then rituximab. ConclusionWe established variable agreement on treatment approaches. For some treatment decisions there was good agreement between experts even if no randomized controlled trial data were available.

Key aims of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Task Force on Suicide included examining the extant literature on epidemiology, neurobiology and pharmacotherapy related to suicide attempts and deaths in bipolar disorder. Methods: Systematic review of studies from 1 January 1980 to 30 May 2014 examining suicide attempts or deaths in bipolar disorder, with a specific focus on the incidence and characterization of suicide attempts and deaths, genetic and non-genetic biological studies and pharmacotherapy studies specific to bipolar disorder. We conducted pooled, weighted analyses of suicide rates. Results: The pooled suicide rate in bipolar disorder is 164 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval=[5, 324]). Sex-specific data on suicide rates identified a 1.7:1 ratio in men compared to women. People with bipolar disorder account for 3.4-14% of all suicide deaths, with self-poisoning and hanging being the most common methods. Epidemiological studies report that 23-26% of people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide, with higher rates in clinical samples. There are numerous genetic associations with suicide attempts and deaths in bipolar disorder, but few replication studies. Data on treatment with lithium or anticonvulsants are strongly suggestive for prevention of suicide attempts and deaths, but additional data are required before relative anti-suicide effects can be confirmed. There were limited data on potential anti-suicide effects of treatment with antipsychotics or antidepressants. Conclusion: This analysis identified a lower estimated suicide rate in bipolar disorder than what was previously published. Understanding the overall risk of suicide deaths and attempts, and the most common methods, are important building blocks to greater awareness and improved interventions for suicide prevention in bipolar disorder. Replication of genetic findings and stronger prospective data on treatment options are required before more decisive conclusions can be made regarding the neurobiology and specific treatment of suicide risk in bipolar disorder.

We examined the distribution of GluD1-2 mRNAs and proteins in the adult rodent brain, focusing mainly on GluD1. In situ hybridization revealed widespread neuronal expression of the GluD1 mRNA, with higher levels occurring in several forebrain regions and lower levels in cerebellum. Quantitative RT-PCR assessed differential GluD1 expression in cortex and cerebellum, and revealed GluD2 expression in cortex, albeit at markedly lower level than in cerebellum. Likewise, a high GluD1/GluD2 mRNA ratio was observed in cortex and a low ratio in cerebellum. GluD1 and GluD2 mRNAs were co-expressed in single cortical and hippocampal neurons, with a large predominance of GluD1. Western blots using GluD1- and GluD2-specific antibodies showed expression of both subunits in various brain structures, but not in non-nervous tissues examined. Both delta subunits were upregulated during postnatal development. Widespread neuronal expression of the GluD1 protein was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. Examination at the electron microscopic level in the hippocampus revealed that GluD1 was mainly localized at postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses on pyramidal cells. Control experiments performed using mice carrying deletion of the GluD1- or the GluD2-encoding gene confirmed the specificity of the present mRNA and protein analyses. Our results support a role for the delta family of glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses in neuronal networks throughout the adult brain.	[Hepp, Regine; Hay, Y.

In fact, in Canada, about one-third of seniors report memory complaints, with different causes. Based on the underlying etiology, different components of memory may be affected in older adults. Nonautobiographical retrograde memory (public or semantic) is an important aspect of memory to assess; nevertheless, there is currently no reliable and standardized clinical tool to evaluate this aspect of memory in the elderly Quebecer population. The aims of this research were therefore: (1) to develop a protocol specifically aimed at assessing non-autobiographical retrograde memory in this population, the PUB-40; (2) to obtain reference data among 105 healthy subjects; and (3) to develop a short version based on the items which discriminated a group of 20 patients with amnestic Mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from older healthy subjects.

Their surface expression is strictly regulated, but mechanisms responsible for channel removal from the membrane remain incompletely understood. Using transfected cells, we show that Kir3.1/3.2 channels and delta opioid receptors (DORs) associate in a complex which persists during receptor activation, behaving as a scaffold that allows beta-arrestin (beta arr) to interact with both signaling partners. This organization favored co-internalization of DORs and Kir3 channels in a beta arr-dependent manner via a clathrin/dynamin-mediated endocytic path. Taken together, these findings identify a new way of modulating Kir3 channel availability at the membrane and assign a putatively novel role for beta arrs in regulating canonical effectors for G protein-coupled receptors.

Automated methods based on intensity histograms constructed from the entire volume are challenged by regional intensity variations due to local radiofrequency artifacts as well as disparities in tissue composition, laminar architecture and folding patterns. Current work proposes a novel anatomy-driven method in which parcels conforming cortical folding were regionally extracted from the brain. Each parcel is subsequently classified using nonparametric mean shift clustering. Evaluation was carried out on manually labeled images from two datasets acquired at 3.0 Tesla (n=15) and 1.5 Tesla (n=20). In both datasets, we observed high tissue classification accuracy of the proposed method (Dice index >97.6% at 3.0 Tesla, and >89.2% at 1.5 Tesla). Moreover, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art classification routines available in SPM8 and FSL-FAST, as well as a recently proposed local classifier that partitions the brain into cubes. Contour-based analyses localized more accurate white matter-gray matter (GM) interface classification of the proposed framework compared to the other algorithms, particularly in central and occipital cortices that generally display bright GM due to their highly degree of myelination. Excellent accuracy was maintained, even in the absence of correction for intensity inhomogeneity. The presented anatomy-driven local classification algorithm may significantly improve cortical boundary definition, with possible benefits for morphometric inference and biomarker discovery.

COMT Diplotype Amplifies Effect of Stress on Risk of Temporomandibular Pain	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome; human COMT protein; psychological stress; gene-environment interaction; cohort studies; proportional hazards models	OPPERA PROSPECTIVE COHORT; PERCEIVED STRESS; PSYCHOLOGICAL-FACTORS; OROFACIAL PAIN; SYMPTOMS; POLYMORPHISMS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ASSOCIATION; POPULATION; DISORDER	When measured once, psychological stress predicts development of painful temporomandibular disorder (TMD). However, a single measurement fails to characterize the dynamic nature of stress over time. Moreover, effects of stress on pain likely vary according to biological susceptibility. We hypothesized that temporal escalation in stress exacerbates risk for TMD, and the effect is amplified by allelic variants in a gene, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), regulating catechol neurotransmitter catabolism. We used data from the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment prospective cohort study of 2,707 community-dwelling adults with no lifetime history of TMD on enrollment. At baseline and quarterly periods thereafter, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) measured psychological stress. Genotyped DNA from blood samples determined COMT diplotypes. During follow-up of 0.25 to 5.2 y, 248 adults developed examiner-verified incident TMD. PSS scores at baseline were 20% greater (P < 0.001) in adults who developed incident TMD compared with TMD-free controls. Baseline PSS scores increased by 9% (P = 0.003) during follow-up in cases but remained stable in controls. This stress escalation was limited to incident cases with COMT diplotypes coding for low-activity COMT, signifying impaired catabolism of catecholamines. Cox regression models confirmed significant effects on TMD hazard of both baseline PSS (P < 0.001), modeled as a time-constant covariate, and change in PSS (P < 0.001), modeled as a time-varying covariate. Furthermore, a significant (P = 0.04) interaction of COMT diplotype and time-varying stress showed that a postbaseline increase of 1.0 standard deviation in PSS more than doubled risk of TMD incidence in subjects with low-activity COMT diplotypes (hazard ratio = 2.35; 95% confidence limits: 1.66, 3.32), an effect not found in subjects with high-activity COMT diplotypes (hazard ratio = 1.42; 95% confidence limits: 0.96, 2.09). Findings provide novel insights into dynamic effects of psychological stress on TMD pain, highlighting that effects are most pronounced in individuals whose genetic susceptibility increases responsiveness to catecholamine neurotransmitters.

Learning to expect the unexpected: rapid updating in primate cerebellum during voluntary self-motion	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SIMPLE SPIKE DISCHARGE; INTERNAL-MODELS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CONTROL; SENSORY PREDICTION; VESTIBULAR NEURONS; REACHING MOVEMENTS; EXPLICIT STRATEGY; PURKINJE-CELLS; ERROR SIGNALS	There is considerable evidence that the cerebellum has a vital role in motor learning by constructing an estimate of the sensory consequences of movement. Theory suggests that this estimate is compared with the actual feedback to compute the sensory prediction error. However, direct proof for the existence of this comparison is lacking. We carried out a trial-by-trial analysis of cerebellar neurons during the execution and adaptation of voluntary head movements and found that neuronal sensitivities dynamically tracked the comparison of predictive and feedback signals. When the relationship between the motor command and resultant movement was altered, neurons robustly responded to sensory input as if the movement was externally generated. Neuronal sensitivities then declined with the same time course as the concurrent behavioral learning. These findings demonstrate the output of an elegant computation in which rapid updating of an internal model enables the motor system to learn to expect unexpected sensory inputs.

In particular, stronger suppression of the amblyopic eye has been associated with poorer amblyopic eye visual acuity and a new therapy has been described that directly targets binocular function and has been found to improve both monocular and binocular vision in adults and children with amblyopia. Furthermore, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that alter excitation and inhibition within the visual cortex have been shown to improve vision in the amblyopic eye. The aim of this review is to summarize this previous work and interpret the therapeutic effects of binocular therapy and non-invasive brain stimulation in the context of three potential neural mechanisms; active inhibition of signals from the amblyopic eye, attenuation of information from the amblyopic eye and metaplasticity of synaptic long term potentiation and long term depression.

Little is known about the impact of amblyopia on the white matter within the visual system. We studied the properties of six major visual white-matter pathways in a group of adults with amblyopia (n = 10) and matched controls (n = 10) using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography. While we did not find significant differences in diffusion properties in cortico-cortical pathways, patients with amblyopia exhibited increased mean diffusivity in thalamo-cortical visual pathways. These findings suggest that amblyopia may systematically alter the white matter properties of early visual pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Initial studies have found that the training effects transfer to both binocular (stereopsis) and monocular (recognition acuity) visual functions. The aim of this study was to assess whether dichoptic training effects also transfer to contrast sensitivity (CS) in adults with amblyopia. We analyzed CS data from 30 adults who had taken part in one of two previous dichoptic training studies and assessed whether the changes in CS exceeded the 95% confidence intervals for change based on test-retest data from a separate group of observers with amblyopia. CS was measured using Gabor patches (0.5, 3 and 10 cpd) before and after 10 days of dichoptic training. Training was delivered using a dichoptic video game viewed through video goggles (n = 15) or on an iPod touch equipped with a lenticular overlay screen (n = 15). In the iPod touch study, training was combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the visual cortex. We found that dichoptic training significantly improved CS across all spatial frequencies tested for both groups. These results suggest that dichoptic training modifies the sensitivity of the neural systems that underpin monocular CS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work the proteomes extracted from primary fibroblasts of two unrelated, hereditary cases of PD patients, with different parkin mutations, were compared with the proteomes extracted from commercial adult normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and primary fibroblasts from the healthy mother of one of the two patients. The results show that the fibroblasts from the two different cases of parkin-mutant patients display analogous alterations in the expression level of proteins involved in different cellular functions, like cytoskeleton structure-dynamics, calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress response, protein and RNA processing.

Early-Onset Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Pattern Recognition	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						pediatric neuroradiology; leukodystrophies; Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome	BASAL GANGLIA; FOLLOW-UP; MUTATIONS; INFECTION	Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is an inherited leukodystrophy with calcifying microangiopathy and abnormal central nervous system myelination. As fewer diagnostic computed tomographic (CT) scans are being performed due to increased availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there is a potential for missed diagnoses on the basis of calcifications. We review a series of patients with MRIs selected from IRB-approved leukodystrophy biorepositories to identify MRI patterns for recognition of early-onset Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and scored for a panel of radiologic predictors. Each individual predictor was tested against disease status using exact logistic regression. Features for pattern recognition of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome are temporal lobe swelling followed by atrophy with temporal horn dilatation, early global cerebral atrophy and visible calcifications, as evidenced by 94.44% of cases of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome correctly classified with a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 96.9%. We identify a panel of MRI features predictive of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome in young patients that would differentiate it from other leukoencephalopathies.

As SLC16A2 encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), a thyroid hormone transporter, patients with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome present a specific altered thyroid hormone profile. Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome has been associated with myelination delay on the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of affected subjects. We report a patient with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and delayed myelination caused by a novel SLC16A2 mutation (p.L291R). The thyroid hormones profile in our patient was atypical for Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. The follow-up examinations showed that the progression of the myelination was not accompanied by a clinical improvement. Our paper suggests that SLC16A2 mutations should be investigated in patients with myelination delay even when the thyroid function is not conclusively altered.

Methods Data were analyzed from a sample of 2,382 patients with chronic pain in the Quebec Pain Registry (QPR). Patients were grouped into the following diagnostic categories based on their primary pain diagnosis recorded in the QPR: musculoskeletal pain; myofascial pain; neuropathic pain, and visceral pain. Analyses were performed to examine the associations between pain diagnosis, patient demographics, pain intensity, depressive symptoms, and unemployment status. Results Pain diagnosis, age, marital status, education, pain intensity, and depressive symptoms were each significant unique predictors of unemployment status in a hierarchical logistic regression analysis; the addition of depressive symptoms in this model contributed to the greatest increment of model fit. Conclusions Depressive symptoms are associated with unemployment across a number of common chronic pain conditions, even when controlling for other factors that are associated with unemployment in these patients. Depressive symptoms, as a modifiable factor, may thus be an important target of intervention for unemployed patients with chronic pain.

First-degree relatives of suicide completers may have impaired decision-making but functional cognitive control	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Neuropsychology; Suicide; Cognition; Decision-making; Endophenotype; Heritability	EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ATTEMPTERS; BEHAVIOR; RISK; HERITABILITY; DEPRESSION; INVENTORY; HISTORY; MEMORY	Background: The heritability of suicide is well established. Transmission of risk appears to follow traits more than disorders like depression. In the present project, we aimed at investigating the potential for transmission of cognitive deficits previously observed in suicide attempters, specifically impaired decision-making and cognitive control. Methods: Seventeen healthy first-degree relatives of suicide completers with no personal history of suicidal act were compared to 18 first-degree relatives of individuals with major depressive disorder but no family history of suicidal act, and 19 healthy controls. Decision-making was assessed with the Iowa Gambling Task, and cognitive control with the Stroop Task, the Hayling Sentence Completion Test, and the Trail-Making Test. Results: Both suicide and depressed relatives showed lower gambling task net scores than healthy controls. However, there were trends toward lower learning abilities in suicide than depressed relatives (interaction: p = 0.07), with more risky choices at the end of the test. Suicide relatives also showed a higher number of self-corrected errors relative to the total number of errors in the Stroop colour test compared to both control groups, with no difference in interference scores. There was no group-difference for any other cognitive tests. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that decision-making impairment may be found in healthy relatives of suicides and represent a cognitive endophenotype of suicidal behaviour. Normal cognitive control (or self-corrected deficits) may protect relatives against suicidal acts. Impairments in value-based and control processes may, therefore, be part of the suicide vulnerability and represent potential targets of preventative interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Speech acquisition predicts regions of enhanced cortical response to auditory stimulation in autism spectrum individuals	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Autism spectrum; fMRI; Auditory; Speech; Variability; Regional plasticity	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; ASPERGERS-DISORDER; CORTEX; METAANALYSIS; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; PATTERNS; FMRI; DISCRIMINATION; ABNORMALITIES	A continuum of phenotypes makes up the autism spectrum (AS). In particular, individuals show large differences in language acquisition, ranging from precocious speech to severe speech onset delay. However, the neurological origin of this heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we sought to determine whether AS individuals differing in speech acquisition show different cortical responses to auditory stimulation and morphometric brain differences. Whole-brain activity following exposure to non-social sounds was investigated. Individuals in the AS were classified according to the presence or absence of Speech Onset Delay (AS-SOD and AS-NoSOD, respectively) and were compared with IQ-matched typically developing individuals (TYP). AS-NoSOD participants displayed greater task-related activity than TYP in the inferior frontal gyrus and pen-auditory middle and superior temporal gyri, which are associated with language processing. Conversely, the AS-SOD group only showed enhanced activity in the vicinity of the auditory cortex. We detected no differences in brain structure between groups. This is the first study to demonstrate the existence of differences in functional brain activity between AS individuals divided according to their pattern of speech development. These findings support the Trigger-threshold-target model and indicate that the occurrence of speech onset delay in AS individuals depends on the location of cortical functional reallocation, which favors perception in AS-SOD and language in AS-NoSOD.

Methods We investigated patients with MDD and healthy controls using fMRI and an emotional attention-shifting task. We assessed site-specific DNA methylation of a previously characterized SLC6A4 region in peripheral blood DNA using pyrosequencing. Results Our study involved 25 patients with MDD and 35 healthy controls. Activation in the anterior insula elicited by negative emotional content was significantly positively associated with the degree of SLC6A4 methylation. Significantly negative associations were observed between activation in the posterior insula and the degree of SLC6A4 methylation when judging the geometry of pictures after seeing negative in contrast to positive emotional stimuli. Healthy controls with a high degree of SLC6A4 methylation depicted significantly more activity elicited by positive stimuli in limbic regions and more activity elicited by negative stimuli in limbic as well as cognitive control regions than those with a low degree of SLC6A4 methylation. Limitations It is impossible to measure methylation directly in the brain and thus we assessed peripheral methylation of SLC6A4. Since the association was cross-sectional, no conclusion about cause and effect can be drawn. Conclusion Our study provides further support to the hypothesis that particular DNA methylation states that are associated with brain function during emotion processing are detectable in the periphery.

How to implement such training sustainably remains a challenge. We developed a compact module for first-year surgery residents integrating theory with practice in high-fidelity simulations, to reinforce the preparedness and confidence of junior residents in their ability to manage common emergent patient care scenarios in trauma and critical care surgery. METHODS: The 3-day module features a combination of simulated patient encounters using standardized patients and electronic manikins, didactic sessions, and hands-on training. Manikin-based scenarios developed in-house were used to teach trauma and critical care management concepts and skills. Separate scenarios in collaboration with the regional organ donation program addressed communication in difficult situations such as brain death. Didactic material based on contemporary evidence, as well as skills stations, was developed to complement the scenarios. Residents were surveyed before and after training on their confidence in meeting the 14 learning objectives of the curriculum on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Data from 15 residents who underwent this training show an overall improvement in confidence across all learning objectives defined for the module, with confidence scores before to after training improving significantly from 2.8 (sigma = 0.85, median = 3) to 3.9 (sigma = 0.87, median = 4) of 5, p < 0.001. Although female residents reported higher posttraining confidence scores compared with male residents (average 4.2 female vs 3.8 male, p = 0.002), there were no other significant differences in confidence scores or changes to scores owing to resident sex or program status (categorical or preliminary). CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented a multimodal simulation-based curriculum that provides skills training integrated with the clinical context of managing trauma and critical care patients, simultaneously addressing a range of clinical competencies. Results to date show consistent improvement in residents' confidence in meeting learning objectives. Development of the curriculum continues for sustainability, as well as measures to embed objective evaluations of resident competence. (C) 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

The burst of polydopamine-based multifunctional coatings in materials science is just one example, and the list may be expanded to include melanin thin films for organic electronics and bioelectronics, drug delivery systems, functional nanoparticles and biointerfaces, sunscreens, environmental remediation devices. Despite considerable advances, applied research on melanins and melanogenesis is still far from being mature. A closer intersectoral interaction between research centers is essential to raise the interests and increase the awareness of the biomedical, biomaterials science and hi-tech sectors of the manifold opportunities offered by pigment cells and related metabolic pathways. Starting from a survey of biological roles and functions, the present review aims at providing an interdisciplinary perspective of melanin pigments and related pathway with a view to showing how it is possible to translate current knowledge about physical and chemical properties and control mechanisms into new bioinspired solutions for biomedical, dermocosmetic, and technological applications.

Here, we expand this work by determining the NMR structure of a 62-nucleotide RNA (J236) that encompasses the VS ribozyme II-III-VI three-way junction and its adjoining stems. In addition, we localize Mg2+-binding sites within this structure using Mn2+-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. The NMR structure of the J236 RNA displays a family C topology with a compact core stabilized by continuous stacking of stems II and III, a cis WC/WC G center dot A base pair, two base triples and two Mg2+ ions. Moreover, it reveals a remote tertiary interaction between the adenine bulges of stems II and VI. Additional NMR studies demonstrate that both this bulge-bulge interaction and Mg2+ ions are critical for the stable folding of the II-III-VI junction. The NMR structure of the J236 RNA is consistent with biochemical studies on the complete VS ribozyme, but not with biophysical studies performed with a minimal II-III-VI junction that does not contain the II-VI bulge-bulge interaction. Together with previous NMR studies, our findings provide important new insights into the three-dimensional architecture of this unique ribozyme.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective study of foetuses and neonates of more than 22weeks' gestation that died in the delivery room or in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a tertiary referral hospital in the Netherlands, comparing end-of-life decisions and mortality in 2001-2003 and 2008-2010, before and after euthanasia legislation was introduced. ResultsIn 2008-2010, there were more deaths in the delivery room due to termination of pregnancy than in 2001-2003 (17% versus 29%, p=0.031), and fewer infants received comfort medication (12% versus 20%, p=0.078). The main mode of death in the NICU was the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. The number of days that infants lived increased significantly between 2001-2003 (11.5days) and 2008-2010 (18.4days, p<0.006). Most infants received comfort medication, and neuromuscular blocking agents were administered incidentally. ConclusionTerminations increased after changes in healthcare regulations. Modes of death in the NICU remained similar over 10years. The increased duration of NICU treatment before dying suggests a more interventionist approach to treatment in 2008-2010.

Mother-child dyads (N = 105) participated in 2 toddlerhood visits in their homes, when children were 15 months and 2 years of age. Mother-child attachment security was assessed with the Attachment Q-Sort during both these visits. When children were in kindergarten (ages 5-6), they were administered a battery of EF tasks, and their teachers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function to assess children's EF problems. The results indicated that kindergarteners who were more securely attached to their mothers in toddlerhood showed better performance on all EF tasks, and were considered by their teachers to present fewer EF problems in everyday school situations. These results held above family socioeconomic status (SES) and child age, sex, and general cognitive functioning. The fact that early attachment security uniquely predicted both teacher reports and children's objective EF task performance suggests that parent-child attachment may be a promising factor to consider in the continuing search for the social antecedents of young children's EF.

Clinical presentation is variable and includes psychomotor delay or regression, acute neurological or acidotic episodes, hypotonia, ataxia, spasticity, movement disorders, and corresponding anomalies of the basal ganglia and brain stem on magnetic resonance imaging. To date, 35 genes have been associated with LS, mostly involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and encoded in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify disease-causing variants in four patients with basal ganglia abnormalities and clinical presentations consistent with LS. Compound heterozygote variants in ECHS1, encoding the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase were identified. One missense variant (p.Thr180Ala) was common to all four patients and the haplotype surrounding this variant was also shared, suggesting a common ancestor of French-Canadian origin. Rare mutations in ECHS1 as well as in HIBCH, the enzyme downstream in the valine degradation pathway, have been associated with LS or LS-like disorders. A clear clinical overlap is observed between our patients and the reported cases with ECHS1 or HIBCH deficiency. The main clinical features observed in our cohort are T2-hyperintense signal in the globus pallidus and putamen, failure to thrive, developmental delay or regression, and nystagmus. Respiratory chain studies are not strikingly abnormal in our patients: one patient had a mild reduction of complex I and III and another of complex IV. The identification of four additional patients with mutations in ECHS1 highlights the emerging importance of this pathway in LS.

Aims: This study aims to determine if articles in the American Journal of Psychiatry (AJP) are more likely to attribute biological factors to the etiology of psychosis than those of the British Journal of Psychiatry (BJP). Methods: A systematic MEDLINE search for articles in the AJP and BJP from 2005 to 2007 identified 360 abstracts with psychosis and etiology-related words. Chi-square analyses were used to test differences in the proportion of attributed biological or psychosocial etiology of psychosis in each journal. Results: A greater proportion of abstracts (83/87) in the AJP attributed biological etiology of psychosis (x(2)=12.33, df=1, p<0.001), while a greater proportion in the BJP (16/44 abstracts) attributed psychosocial etiology (x(2)=19.76, df=1, p<0.001). Conclusions: The AJP tends to publish biomedical explanations of psychosis, while the BJP shows a relative preference for psychosocial theories.	[Jarvis, G.

JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES			English	Article						Pathological Gambling; Compulsive-impulsive spectrum; Self-report measures; Cognitive measures	DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION TEST; DECISION-MAKING; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; INTRUSIONS INVENTORY; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; DRUG-ADDICTION; NEURAL SYSTEMS; GAMBLERS; ALCOHOL	Although the phenomenology of Pathological Gambling (PG) is clearly characterized by impulsive features, some of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-5) criteria for PG are similar to those of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Therefore, the compulsive-impulsive spectrum model may be a better (or complementary) fit with PG phenomenology. The present exploratory research was designed to further investigate the compulsive and impulsive features characterizing PG, by comparing PG individuals, alcohol dependents (ADs), OCD patients, and healthy controls (HCs) on both self-report and cognitive measures of compulsivity and impulsivity. A better understanding of the shared psychological and cognitive mechanisms underlying differently categorized compulsive and impulsive disorders may significantly impact on both clinical assessment and treatment strategies for PG patients. With respect to self-report measures, PG individuals reported more compulsive and impulsive features than did HCs. As regards motor inhibition ability indices, PG individuals and HCs performed similarly on the Go/No-go task and better than AD individuals and OCD patients. Results from the Iowa Gambling Task highlighted that PG, AD, and OCD participants performed worse than did HCs. An in-depth analysis of each group's learning profile revealed similar patterns of impairment between PG and AD individuals in decision-making processes. Current findings support the utility of adopting a dimensional-transdiagnostic approach to complement the DSM-5 classification when working with PG individuals in clinical practice. Indeed, clinicians are encouraged to assess both compulsivity and impulsivity to provide individualized case conceptualizations and treatment plans focusing on the specific phenomenological features characterizing each PG patient.

MethodsSummaries of research and theory about PFMT adherence (based on a comprehensive literature search) were presented by subject experts at the 2011 Seminar to generate discussion and guidance for clinical practice and future research. Supplemental research, post-seminar, resulted in, three review papers summarizing: (1) relevant behavioral theories, (2) adherence measurement, determinants and effectiveness of PFMT adherence interventions, and (3) patients' PFMT experiences. A fourth, reported findings from an online survey of health professionals and the public. ResultsFew high-quality studies were found. Paper I summarizes 12 behavioral frameworks relevant to theoretical development of PFMT adherence interventions and strategies. Findings in Paper II suggest both PFMT self-efficacy and intention-to-adhere predict PFMT adherence. Paper III identified six potential adherence modifiers worthy of further investigation. Paper IV found patient-related factors were the biggest adherence barrier to PFMT adherence. ConclusionGiven the lack of high-quality studies, the conclusions were informed by expert opinion. Adherence is central to short- and longer-term PFMT effect. More attention and explicit reporting is needed regarding: (1) applying health behavior theory in PFMT program planning; (2) identifying adherence determinants; (3) developing and implementing interventions targeting known adherence determinants; (4) using patient-centred approaches to evaluating adherence barriers and facilitators; (5) measuring adherence, including refining and testing instruments; and (6) testing the association between adherence and PFMT outcome.

MethodsExisting literature on theories of health behavior were identified through a conventional subject search of electronic databases, reference-list checking, and input from the expert panel. A core eligibility criterion was that the study included a theoretical model to underpin adherence strategies used in an intervention to promote PFM training/exercise. ResultsA brief critique of 12 theoretical models/theories is provided and, were appropriate, their use in PFMT adherence strategies identified or examples of possible uses in future studies outlined. ConclusionA better theoretical-based understanding of interventions to promote PFMT adherence through changes in health behaviors is required. The results of this scoping review and expert opinions identified several promising models. Future research should explicitly map the theories behind interventions that are thought to improve adherence in various populations (e.g., perinatal women to prevent or lessen urinary incontinence). In addition, identified behavioral theories applied to PFMT require a process whereby their impact can be evaluated. Neurourol. Urodynam. 34:???-???, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

MethodData were amassed from a literature review and an expert panel (2011 conference), following consensus statement methodology. Experts in pelvic floor dysfunction collated and synthesized the evidence and expert opinions on PFMT adherence for urinary incontinence (UI) and lower bowel dysfunction in men and women and pelvic organ prolapse in women. ResultsThe literature was scarce for most of the studied populations except for limited research on women with UI. Outcome measures: Exercise diaries were the most widely-used adherence outcome measure, PFMT adherence was inconsistently monitored and inadequately reported. Determinants: Research, mostly secondary analyses of RCTs, suggested that intention to adhere, self-efficacy expectations, attitudes towards the exercises, perceived benefits and a high social pressure to engage in PFMT impacted adherence. Strategies: Few trials studied and compared adherence strategies. A structured PFMT programme, an enthusiastic physiotherapist, audio prompts, use of established theories of behavior change, and user-consultations seem to increase adherence. ConclusionThe literature on adherence outcome measures, determinants and strategies remains scarce for the studied populations with PFM dysfunction, except in women with UI. Although some current adherence findings can be applied to clinical practice, more effective and standardized research is urgently needed across all the sub-populations. Neurourol.

MethodsPrimary qualitative studies were identified through a conventional subject search of electronic databases, reference-list checking, and expert contact. A core eligibility criterion was the inclusion of verbatim quotes from participants about PFMT experiences. Details of study aims, methods, and participants were extracted and tabulated. Data were inductively grouped into categories describing modifiers of adherence (verified by a second author) and systematically displayed with supporting illustrative quotes. ResultsThirteen studies (14 study reports) were included; eight recruited only or predominantly women with urinary incontinence, three recruited postnatal women, and two included women with pelvic organ prolapse. The quality of methodological reporting varied. Six modifiers of adherence were described: knowledge; physical skill; feelings about PFMT; cognitive analysis, planning, and attention; prioritization; and service provision. ConclusionsIndividuals' experience substantial difficulties with capability (particularly knowledge and skills), motivation (especially associated with the considerable cognitive demands of PFMT), and opportunity (as external factors generate competing priorities) when adopting and maintaining a PFMT program. Expert consensus was that judicious selection and deliberate application of appropriate behavior change strategies directed to the modifiers of adherence identified in the review may improve PFMT outcomes. Future research is needed to explore whether the review findings are congruent with the PFMT experiences of antenatal women, men, and adults with fecal incontinence. Neurourol.

A web-based survey was conducted (1) to investigate whether responses from health professionals and the public broadly reflected findings in the literature, (2) if responses differed between the two groups, and (3) to identify new research directions. MethodsHealth professional and public surveys were posted on the ICS website. PFMT adherence barriers and facilitators were divided into four categories: physical/condition, patient, therapy, and social-economic. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics from quantitative data and thematic data analysis for qualitative data. ResultsFive hundred and fifteen health professionals and 51 public respondents participated. Both cohorts felt patient-related factors constituted the most important adherence barrier, but differed in their rankings of short- and long-term barriers. Health professionals rated patient-related and the public therapy-related factors as the most important adherence facilitator. Both ranked perception of PFMT benefit as the most important long-term facilitator. Contrary to published findings, symptom severity was not ranked highly. Neither cohort felt the barriers nor facilitators differed according to PFM condition (urinary/faecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic pain); however, a large number of health professionals felt differences existed across age, gender, and ethnicity. Half of respondents in both cohorts felt research barriers and facilitators differed from those in clinical practice. ConclusionsAn emphasis on patient-related factors, ahead of condition-specific and therapy-related, affecting PFMT adherence barriers was evident. Health professionals need to be aware of the importance of long-term patient perception of PFMT benefits and consider enabling strategies. Neurourol. Urodynam. 34:???-???, 2015.

Emotion regulation in bipolar disorder type I: an fMRI study	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Amygdala; emotional processing; functional magnetic resonance imaging; prefrontal cortex	NEGATIVE EMOTION; QUANTITATIVE METAANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL; NEUROIMAGING FINDINGS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOWN-REGULATION; RATING-SCALE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; AMYGDALA	Background Bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) is associated with emotion dysregulation. However, experimentally controlled studies of emotion regulation (ER), particularly those examining the brain correlates of the putative deficits, are scarce and their results inconsistent. Method Nineteen euthymic BD-I patients and 17 healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a visual ER 2 x 2 factorial task, with instruction (Look or Decrease) and valence (Negative or Neutral) as within-subject factors. Emotional ratings were collected after each picture presentation to assess regulation success. Results BD-I patients were successful at downregulating their emotions, although to a lesser degree than HC. Both groups engaged brain regions previously implicated in ER; however, unlike HC, patients engaged some of those regions, particularly the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in the Negative Look and Neutral Decrease conditions. Moreover, patients failed to show the reduced amygdala activation in the Negative Decrease condition observed in HC. Conclusion Our findings suggest that BD-I patients are able to downregulate their emotions when instructed to do so. However, they also appear to engage their ER network, particularly the VLPFC, even when not required to do so. These findings may help explain their often-reported difficulty in regulating emotions in everyday life despite their attempts to do so.	[Corbalan, F.; Beaulieu, S.; Armony, J.

But how is this negative affect experienced subjectively, and are these feelings related to variation in cognitive control? To address these questions, 42 participants performed a punished inhibitory control task while periodically reporting their subjective experience. We found that within-subject variation in subjective experience predicted control implementation, but not neural monitoring (i.e., the error-related negativity, ERN). Specifically, anxiety and frustration predicted increased and decreased response caution, respectively, while hopelessness accompanied reduced inhibitory control, and subjective effort coincided with the increased ability to inhibit prepotent responses. Clarifying the nature of these phenomenological results, the effects of frustration, effort, and hopelessnessbut not anxietywere statistically independent from the punishment manipulation. Conversely, while the ERN was increased by punishment, the lack of association between this component and phenomenology suggests that early monitoring signals might precede the development of control-related subjective experience. Our results indicate that the types of feelings experienced during cognitively demanding tasks are related to different aspects of controlled performance, critically suggesting that the relationship between emotion and cognitive control extends beyond the dimension of valence.

However, its use has been mostly restricted to researchers that have developed these methods, in part due to the need to write complicated in-house software for modeling and data analysis. We have developed a software package (qMTLab) with a simple and easy to use graphical user interface that unifies three of the most widely used qMTI methods: MT spoiled gradient echo (MT-SPGR), MT balanced steady-state free precession (MT-bSSFP), and selective inversion recovery with fast spin echo (SIR-FSE). qMTLab is free open-source software that allows anyone interested in using these methods to easily simulate qMTI data, compare the performance of the methods under various experimental conditions, define new acquisition protocols, fit acquired data, and visualize the fitted parameters maps. By providing free software that gives end users a simple and easy to use graphical interface, we hope to make qMTI accessible to a greater number of investigators and facilitate the development, evaluation, and optimization of acquisition protocols and models.

J.; Achim, Andre; Roberge, Carl; Gauvin, Geofrey			Callosal Sensitivity to Short-Range Stimulus Orientation and Long-Range Stimulus Context Orientation: Tachistoscopic Evidence	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							DIMOND PARADIGM; REACTION-TIME; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; VISUAL-CORTEX; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; OBLIQUE; POFFENBERGER; CONNECTIONS; SYMMETRY	To study local-global relationships in interhemispheric interactions, tachistoscopically presented pairs of lines (1.15 degrees) were compared for their relative orientation by 48 neurotypical adults. Orientations of line stimuli (local aspect of the task) were vertical, horizontal, forward slash or backslash, as were those of the interstimulus axes. The latter created a global context that could influence line discrimination. Stimulus pairs were presented within a field (not requiring callosal participation for line orientation comparison) or one on each side of the visual field meridian (requiring callosal participation). The primary purpose of the design was to determine whether local or global violations of stimulus "homotopy" across the meridian would impose costs of interhemispheric integration. The rationale for this expectation is that the fiber projection of the corpus callosum is highly symmetric across the midsagittal plane (i.e., homotopic). The expected "callosal homotopy" effect was significantly upheld as a whole but broke down or became extravagant in certain specific conditions, with specific costs of interhemispheric integration varying from null to a highly significant 20-ms as a function of interactions of interstimulus and stimulus orientations. The corpus callosum seems to be particularly sensitive to local stimulus orientation in interaction with long-range stimulus context orientation.	[Braun, Claude M.

Age-related differences in the neural basis of the subjective vividness of memories: evidence from multivoxel pattern classification	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Subjective experience; Vividness; Aging; MVPA	OLDER-ADULTS; WORKING-MEMORY; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; FALSE RECOGNITION; QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS; PHENOMENAL CHARACTERISTICS; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES; REFLECTIVE ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL DETAILS; ILLUSORY MEMORIES	Although older adults often show reduced episodic memory accuracy, their ratings of the subjective vividness of their memories often equal or even exceed those of young adults. Such findings suggest that young and older adults may differentially access and/or weight different kinds of information in making vividness judgments. We examined this idea using multivoxel pattern classification of fMRI data to measure category representations while participants saw and remembered pictures of objects and scenes. Consistent with our hypothesis, there were age-related differences in how category representations related to the subjective sense of vividness. During remembering, older adults' vividness ratings were more related, relative to young adults', to category representations in prefrontal cortex. In contrast, young adults' vividness ratings were more related, relative to older adults, to category representations in parietal cortex. In addition, category representations were more correlated among posterior regions in young than in older adults, whereas correlations between PFC and posterior regions did not differ between the 2 groups. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that young and older adults differentially weight different types of information in assessing subjective vividness of their memories.

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the standard of care for infants with moderate and severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), promotes neuroprotection by several mechanisms including a decrease in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) influx which may improve serum Ca2+ levels and homeostasis. Aims: To evaluate the impact of TH on Ca2+ homeostasis. Study design: Historical, retrospective cohort analysis. Subjects: Infants with moderate or severe HIE admitted to the hospital with 24 hours of age, gestational age 36 weeks, and birth weight >= 1800 g, before (pre-TH) and after (post-TH) TH was implemented. Outcome measures: Minimum and maximum serum levels of ionized Ca2+ (iCa(2+)) and magnesium (Mg), Ca2+ and Mg intakes, and incidence of hypo/hypercalcemia during the first week of life. Results: A total of 67 infants were included: 29 pre-TH and 38 post-TH. Minimum iCa(2+) levels were significantly lower in the pre-TH group; some infants required Ca2+ boluses infusions. In the post-TH group, a significantly lower intake of Ca2+ was necessary to maintain normal Ca2+ levels and no infant required boluses. The incidence of hypocalcemia was higher in the pre-TH group with a statistically significant difference on day 2 of life (18 vs 0%; p = 0.01). Conclusions: After the implementation of TH, iCa(2+) levels were within normal ranges despite lower Ca2+ intakes. A lower incidence of hypocalcemia was observed during cooling. Our findings support the hypothesis that TH improves Ca2+ homeostasis in HIE infants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is the first analysis to specifically compare post-operative hearing outcomes following stapedotomy surgery performed under local versus general anesthesia. Hearing outcomes were further stratified by comparing conventional perforator and Er:YAG laser ablation perforation techniques. Pre- and post-operative audiograms were retrospectively analyzed together with the method of anesthesia and the perforation technique for all patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapedotomy between 1998 and 2007. Pre-operative individual standard audiometry frequency thresholds (IFTs), air (AC) and bone conduction pure tone averages (PTA), and air bone gaps (ABG) were compared against post-operative results. Differences between pre- and post-operative PTAs and ABGs were compared between patients who received stapedotomy under local versus general anesthesia, as well as for patients who underwent conventional versus Er:YAG laser ablation perforations. Eighty-six patients were identified of which 24 % (n = 21) received local and 76 % (n = 65) received general anesthesia. Post-operative audiograms were available for 84 and 48 patients, respectively. Significant improvements were seen across all groups for standard 4-frequency AC-PTA and ABG and for IFTs up to 3 kHz. No significant difference was seen for IFTs between 4 and 6 kHz. A significant decline in post-operative hearing thresholds was seen at 8 kHz. Significant improvements in PTA and ABG were seen for all groups. There was a trend toward general compared to local anesthesia post-operative hearing results furthermore in combination with conventional perforation technique then with laser technique.

These comorbidities include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some psychopathologies, which have been linked to a low-grade inflammatory state. Obese individuals exhibit an increase in circulating inflammatory mediators implicated as the underlying cause of these comorbidities. A number of these molecules are also manufactured and released by white adipose tissue (WAT), in direct proportion to tissue mass and are collectively known as adipokines. In the current review we focused on the role of two of the better-studied members of this family namely, leptin and adiponectin, with particular emphasis on their role in neuro-immune interactions, neuroinflammation and subsequent brain diseases.

One mechanism by which ovarian hormones might impact mood regulation is by mediating the effect of psychosocial stress, which often precedes depressive episodes and may have mood consequences that are particularly relevant in women. In the current study, brain activity and mood response to psychosocial stress was examined in healthy, normally cycling women at either the high or low estradiol phase of the menstrual cycle. Twenty eight women were exposed to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST), with brain activity determined through functional magnetic resonance imaging, and behavioral response assessed with subjective mood and stress measures. Brain activity responses to psychosocial stress differed between women in the low versus high estrogen phase of the menstrual cycle: women with high estradiol levels showed significantly less deactivation in limbic regions during psychosocial stress compared to women with low estradiol levels. Additionally, women with higher estradiol levels also had less subjective distress in response to the MIST than women with lower estradiol levels. The results of this study suggest that, in normally cycling premenopausal women, high estradiol levels attenuate the brain activation changes and negative mood response to psychosocial stress. Normal ovarian hormone fluctuations may alter the impact of psychosocially stressful events by presenting periods of increased vulnerability to psychosocial stress during low estradiol phases of the menstrual cycle. This menstrual cycle-related fluctuation in stress vulnerability may be relevant to the greater risk for affective disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder in women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While previous research has concentrated on the effects of hydraulic and geometric parameters on the scour patterns at river confluences, there remains a lack of expert systems designed to predict the maximum scour depth (d(sm)). In the present study, several soft computing models, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) and M5P model tree, were used to predict the d(sm) at river confluences under live-bed conditions. Model performance, assessed through a number of statistical indices (RMSE, MAE, MARE and R-2), showed that while all three models could provide acceptable predictions of d(sm) under live-bed conditions, the MLP model was the most accurate. By testing the models at three different ranges of scour depths, we determined that while the MLP model was the most accurate model in the low scour depth range, the RBF model was more accurate in the higher range of scour depths.

The ANFIS prediction model consists of three ANFIS modules for estimating the Flex-HR parameters. Each module was developed based on clustering a training set of data samples relevant to that module and then the ANFIS prediction model was tested against a validation data set. Fifty-eight participants performed the Meyer and Flenghi step-test, during which heart rate (HR) and (V) over dotO(2) were measured. Results indicated no significant difference between observed and estimated Flex-HR parameters and between measured and estimated (V) over dotO(2) in the overall HR range, and separately in different HR ranges. The ANFIS prediction model (MAE = 3 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) demonstrated better performance than Rennie et al.'s (MAE = 7 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) and Keytel et al.'s (MAE = 6 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) models, and comparable performance with the standard Flex-HR method (MAE = 2.3 ml kg(-1) min(-1)) throughout the HR range. The ANFIS model thus provides practitioners with a practical, cost- and time-efficient method for (V) over dotO(2) estimation without the need for individual calibration.

To investigate brain morphological correlates of PD-Sx, we measured subcortical volume and shape, and cortical thickness/surface area, based on structural magnetic resonance images. We investigated 37 subjects who reported PD-Sx exceeding DSM-IV Axis-II screening thresholds, and 35 age, sex, and smoking status-matched control subjects. Subjects reporting PD-Sx were then grouped into symptom-based clusters: N = 20 into Cluster B (reporting Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, or Narcissistic PD-Sx) and N = 28 into Cluster C (reporting Obsessive Compulsive, Avoidant, or Dependent PD-Sx); N = 11 subjects reported PDSx from both clusters, and none reported Cluster A (Paranoid, Schizoid, or Schizotypal) PD-Sx. Compared to control, Cluster C PD-Sx was associated with greater striatal surface area localized to the caudate tail, smaller ventral striatum volumes, and greater cortical thickness in right prefrontal cortex. Both Cluster B and C PD-Sx groups also showed trends toward greater posterior caudate volumes and orbitofrontal surface area anomalies, but these findings did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. The results point to morphological abnormalities that could contribute to Cluster C PDSx. In addition, the observations parallel those in substance use disorders, pointing to the importance of considering PD-Sx when interpreting findings in often-comorbid psychiatric disorders.

The activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases within the extending growth cone facilitates the dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton required to drive axon extension. The Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Trio is essential for netrin-1-induced axon outgrowth and guidance. Here, we identify the molecular chaperone heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) as a novel Trio regulator. Hsc70 dynamically associated with the N-terminal region and Rac1 GEF domain of Trio. Whereas Hsc70 expression supported Trio-dependent Rac1 activation, adenosine triphosphatase-deficient Hsc70 (D10N) abrogated Trio Rac1 GEF activity and netrin-1-induced Rac1 activation. Hsc70 was required for netrin-1-mediated axon growth and attraction in vitro, whereas Hsc70 activity supported callosal projections and radial neuronal migration in the embryonic neocortex. These findings demonstrate that Hsc70 chaperone activity is required for Rac1 activation by Trio and this function underlies netrin-1/DCC-dependent axon outgrowth and guidance.

In this study, we investigated a number of 2-phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine acetamide derivatives, analogs of alpidem, for their ability to bind TSPO and to affect steroidogenesis in a mouse Leydig tumor cell line. We observed that not only some compounds behaved as agonists, stimulating steroidogenesis (e.g., 3 and 4) with EC50 values (15.9 and 6.99 mu M) close to that determined for FGIN-1-27 used as positive control (7.24 mu m)but two compounds, namely 5 and 6, which on the other hand are the most lipophilic ones in the investigated series, behaved as antagonists, by significantly inhibiting steroid production at concentrations at least twenty times lower than the cytotoxic ones. To our surprise, the newly synthesized compound 3, which is a strict analog of alpidem bearing at the para position of the 2-phenyl group a methoxy group instead of chlorine, achieved a ten-fold stimulation of the steroid production (for comparison FGIN-1-27 achieved 1.6-fold stimulation). Within the limits of the examined property space, some unprecedented SARs were unveiled, which can help in understanding the key molecular factors underlying the transition from agonism to antagonism in the steroidogenesis process. Besides the substitution pattern and the physicochemical features (mainly hydrogen bonding potential) of the substituents at the positions C(6) and C(8) of the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine nucleus, and at the para position of the 2-phenyl group, the structure activity relationship analysis suggested lipophilicity, whose increase seems to be generally related to steroidogenesis inhibition, and steric hindrance, which appeared as a stimulation-limiting factor, as two main properties to control in the design or optimization of novel imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-based TSPO ligands endowed with potential in modulating the steroidogenesis process.

Decline in the Recovery from Synaptic Depression in Heavier Aplysia Results from Decreased Serotonin-Induced Novel PKC Activation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							C APL-II; GILL-WITHDRAWAL REFLEX; PROTEIN-KINASE CS; SENSORY NEURONS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNAPSES; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES; FACILITATION; CALIFORNICA	The defensive withdrawal reflexes of Aplysia are important behaviors for protecting the animal from predation. Habituation and dishabituation allow for experience-dependent tuning of these reflexes and the mechanisms underlying these forms of behavioral plasticity involve changes in transmitter release from the sensory to motor neuron synapses through homosynaptic depression and the serotonin-mediated recovery from depression, respectively. Interestingly, dishabituation is reduced in older animals with no corresponding change in habituation. Here we show that the cultured sensory neurons of heavier animals (greater than 120g) that form synaptic connections with motor neurons have both reduced recovery from depression and reduced novel PKC Apl II activation with 5HT. The decrease in the recovery from depression correlated better with the size of the animal than the age of the animal. Much of this change in PKC activation and synaptic facilitation following depression can be rescued by direct activation of PKC Apl II with phorbol dibutyrate, suggesting a change in the signal transduction pathway upstream of PKC Apl II activation in the sensory neurons of larger animals.

Asphyxia and hypothermia have been mentioned separately as possible risk factors of IVH, since they might cause fluctuations of cerebral blood flow. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, the timing, and the risk factors of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of all term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia from August 2008 to June 2013. The presence or not of IVH was assessed using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after the hypothermia treatment was completed or using head ultrasound during the hypothermia treatment. For these newborns, to determine the timing of IVH, we retrospectively reviewed if they had other brain imaging studies performed during their neonatal hospitalization stay. In addition, we compared their general characteristics with those not developing IVH. Results: One hundred and sixty asphyxiated newborns met the criteria for hypothermia. Fifteen of these newborns developed IVH, leading to an estimate of 9 % (95 % CI: 5.3-15.0 %) of IVH in this population of newborns. Fifty-three percent had hemorrhage limited to the choroid plexus or IVH without ventricular dilatation; 47 % had IVH with ventricular dilatation or parenchymal hemorrhage. Sixty-seven percent had an initial normal brain imaging; the diagnostic brain imaging that demonstrated the IVH was obtained either during cooling (in 30 %), within 24 h of the rewarming (in 30 %), or 24 h after the rewarming (in 40 %). Recurrent seizures were the presenting symptom of IVH during the rewarming in 20 % of the newborns. Coagulopathy was more frequent in the asphyxiated newborns developing IVH (p < 0.001). The asphyxiated newborns developing IVH also presented more frequently with persistent pulmonary hypertension, hypotension, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia appear to be at an increased risk of IVH, especially those with significant hemodynamic instability. IVH seems to develop during late hypothermia and rewarming. Efforts should be directed towards maintaining hemodynamic stability in these patients, even during the rewarming.

We have previously shown that chronic haloperidol (HAL) treatment reduces amphetamine (AMPH)-induced locomotor activity in AMPH-sensitized rats, but only when paired with high levels of the estrogen, 17-beta estradiol. In addition, we reported estradiol-dependent responses to AMPH in AMPH-sensitized rats as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. It is thus clear that estradiol and antipsychotics both affect the rat brain, however the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. The aim of the current study was to assess this interaction by investigating the effects of estradiol, AMPH and HAL on brain volume changes in awake female rats. Repeated exposure to AMPH resulted in an overall reduction in brain volume, regardless of hormonal status (i.e. no, low or high estradiol). Similarly, chronic HAL treatment further reduced brain volume compared to acute treatment. Hormonal status affected hippocampal volume with rats receiving low estradiol replacement showing larger volume; this difference was no longer significant after repeated exposure to AMPH. Finally, we found changes in volume in response to AMPH throughout hippocampal components (i.e. CA1-CA3 and dentate) as well as components of the mesocortical system. In conclusion, brain volume seems to be influenced by hormonal status, as well as exposure to AMPH and haloperidol treatment. These findings implicate areas where estradiol, amphetamine and antipsychotics may be producing volumetric changes in the brain, pointing the way to where future studies should focus.

We show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity with both pre- and postsynaptic expression develops receptive fields with reduced variability and improved discriminability compared to postsynaptic plasticity alone. These long-term modifications in receptive field statistics match recent sensory perception experiments. Moreover, learning with this form of plasticity leaves a hidden postsynaptic memory trace that enables fast relearning of previously stored information, providing a cellular substrate for memory savings. Our results reveal essential roles for presynaptic plasticity that are missed when only postsynaptic expression of long-term plasticity is considered, and suggest an experience-dependent distribution of pre- and postsynaptic strength changes.

Here we show in rats that NMDA-induced vasodilation and hemodynamic responses evoked by whisker stimulation involve cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity and activation of the prostaglandin E2 (PgE(2)) receptors EP2 and EP4. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that PgE(2) is released by NMDA in cortical slices. The characterization of PgE2 producing cells by immunohistochemistry and single-cell reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that pyramidal cells and not astrocytes are the main cell type equipped for PgE2 synthesis, one third expressing COX-2 systematically associated with a PgE2 synthase. Consistent with their central role in NVC, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal cells evoked COX-2-dependent hyperemic responses in mice. These observations identify PgE2 as the main prostaglandin mediating sensory-evoked NVC, pyramidal cells as their principal source and vasodilatory EP2 and EP4 receptors as their targets.

Detection of p75(NTR) Trimers: Implications for Receptor Stoichiometry and Activation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						p75(NTR); proNGF; signaling unit; stoichiometry; TNF receptor; trimerization	P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CONE RETRACTION; GAMMA-SECRETASE; MELANOMA-CELLS; FACTOR BINDING; NGF RECEPTOR; APOPTOSIS	The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is a multifunctional receptor that participates in many critical processes in the nervous system, ranging from apoptosis to synaptic plasticity and morphological events. It is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, whose members undergo trimeric oligomerization. Interestingly, p75(NTR) interacts with dimeric ligands (i.e., proneurotrophins or mature neurotrophins), but several of the intracellular adaptors that mediate p75(NTR) signaling are trimeric (i.e., TNFR-associated factor 6 or TRAF6). Consequently, the active receptor signaling unit remains uncertain. To identify the functional receptor complex, we evaluated its oligomerization in vitro and in mice brain tissues using a combination of biochemical techniques. We found that the most abundant homotypic arrangement for p75(NTR) is a trimer and that monomers and trimers coexist at the cell surface. Interestingly, trimers are not required for ligand-independent or ligand-dependent p75(NTR) activation in a growth cone retraction functional assay. However, monomers are capable of inducing acute morphological effects in neurons. We propose that p75(NTR) activation is regulated by its oligomerization status and its levels of expression. These results indicate that the oligomeric state of p75(NTR) confers differential responses and offers an explanation for the diverse and contradictory actions of this receptor in the nervous system.

When used in conjunction with a dendritic phosphorescent probe, Oxyphor G4, this system enabled minimally invasive measurements of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in cerebral tissue with high spatial and temporal resolution during 4-AP induced epileptic seizures. Investigating epileptic events, we characterized the spatio-temporal distribution of the "initial dip" in pO2 near the probe injection site and along nearby arterioles. Our results reveal a correlation between the percent change in the pO2 signal during the "initial dip" and the duration of seizure-like activity, which can help localize the epileptic focus and predict the length of seizure.

Louis			Spatio-Temporal Regularization for Longitudinal Registration to Subject-Specific 3d Template	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE PROGRESSION; MRI DATA; ATLAS CONSTRUCTION; BRAIN; ATROPHY; SEGMENTATION; IMAGES; ACCURATE; MODELS	Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease present subtle anatomical brain changes before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Manual structure segmentation is long and tedious and although automatic methods exist, they are often performed in a cross-sectional manner where each time-point is analyzed independently. With such analysis methods, bias, error and longitudinal noise may be introduced. Noise due to MR scanners and other physiological effects may also introduce variability in the measurement. We propose to use 4D non-linear registration with spatio-temporal regularization to correct for potential longitudinal inconsistencies in the context of structure segmentation. The major contribution of this article is the use of individual template creation with spatio-temporal regularization of the deformation fields for each subject. We validate our method with different sets of real MRI data, compare it to available longitudinal methods such as FreeSurfer, SPM12, QUARC, TBM, and KNBSI, and demonstrate that spatially local temporal regularization yields more consistent rates of change of global structures resulting in better statistical power to detect significant changes over time and between populations.

Global Burden Dis Study	Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013	LANCET			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS; MENTAL-DISORDERS; CONDUCT DISORDER; HEALTH OUTCOMES; IRON-DEFICIENCY; OTITIS-MEDIA; WEIGHTS; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Background Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2.4 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537.6 million in 1990 to 764.8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114.87 per 1000 people to 110.31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21.1% in 1990 to 31.2% in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries.

Catherine			Is a Responsive Default Mode Network Required for Successful Working Memory Task Performance?	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						chronic pain; default mode; external-task-positive; FMRI; task performance; working memory	N-BACK TASK; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN NETWORKS; CHRONIC PAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEUROIMAGING DATA; FMRI; ACTIVATION; COGNITION; ATTENTION	In studies of cognitive processing using tasks with externally directed attention, regions showing increased (external-task-positive) and decreased or "negative" [default-mode network (DMN)] fMRI responses during task performance are dynamically responsive to increasing task difficulty. Responsiveness (modulation of fMRI signal by increasing load) has been linked directly to successful cognitive task performance in external-task-positive regions but not in DMN regions. To investigate whether a responsive DMN is required for successful cognitive performance, we compared healthy human subjects (n = 23) with individuals shown to have decreased DMN engagement (chronic pain patients, n = 28). Subjects performed a multilevel working-memory task (N-back) during fMRI. If a responsive DMN is required for successful performance, patients having reduced DMN responsiveness should show worsened performance; if performance is not reduced, their brains should show compensatory activation in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. All subjects showed decreased accuracy and increased reaction times with increasing task level, with no significant group differences on either measure at any level. Patients had significantly reduced negative fMRI response (deactivation) of DMN regions (posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex). Controls showed expected modulation of DMN deactivation with increasing task difficulty. Patients showed significantly reduced modulation of DMN deactivation by task difficulty, despite their successful task performance. We found no evidence of compensatory neural recruitment in external-task-positive regions or elsewhere. Individual responsiveness of the external-task-positive ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, but not of DMN regions, correlated with task accuracy. These findings suggest that a responsive DMN may not be required for successful cognitive performance; a responsive external-task-positive network may be sufficient.

To better characterize receptor location and trafficking, knock-in mice were created by inserting the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) into the NOP receptor gene (Oprl1) and producing mice expressing a functional NOP-eGFP C-terminal fusion in place of the native NOP receptor. The NOP-eGFP receptor was present in brain of homozygous knock-in animals in concentrations somewhat higher than in wild-type mice and was functional when tested for stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding in vitro and in patch-clamp electrophysiology in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and hippocampal slices. Inhibition of morphine analgesia was equivalent when tested in knock-in and wild-type mice. Imaging revealed detailed neuroanatomy in brain, spinal cord, and DRG and was generally consistent with in vitro autoradiographic imaging of receptor location. Multicolor immunohistochemistry identified cells coexpressing various spinal cord and DRG cellular markers, as well as coexpression with mu-opioid receptors in DRG and brain regions. Both in tissue slices and primary cultures, the NOP-eGFP receptors appear throughout the cell body and in processes. These knock-in mice have NOP receptors that function both in vitro and in vivo and appear to be an exceptional tool to study receptor neuroanatomy and correlate with NOP receptor function.

Complete Loss of Netrin-1 Results in Embryonic Lethality and Severe Axon Guidance Defects without Increased Neural Cell Death	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							SPINAL-CORD; SURVIVAL FACTOR; RECEPTOR; DCC; EXPRESSION; APOPTOSIS; IDENTITY; SYSTEM; CANCER; GENES	Netrin-1 regulates cell migration and adhesion during the development of the nervous system, vasculature, lung, pancreas, muscle, and mammary gland. It is also proposed to function as a dependence ligand that inhibits apoptosis; however, studies disagree regarding whether netrin-1 loss-of-function mice exhibit increased cell death. Furthermore, previously studied netrin-1 loss-of-function gene-trap mice express a netrin-1-beta-galactosidase protein chimera with potential for toxic gain-of-function effects, as well as a small amount of wild-type netrin-1 protein. To unambiguously assess loss of function, we generated netrin-1 floxed and netrin-1 null mouse lines. Netrin-1(-/-) mice die earlier and exhibit more severe axon guidance defects than netrin-1 gene-trap mice, revealing that complete loss of function is more severe than previously reported. Netrin-1(-/-) embryos also exhibit increased expression of the netrin receptors DCC and neogenin that are proposed dependence receptors; however, increased apoptosis was not detected, inconsistent with netrin-1 being an essential dependence receptor ligand in the embryonic spinal cord.

CDK5 phosphorylates DRP1 and drives mitochondrial defects in NMDA-induced neuronal death	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE-5; CELL-DEATH; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PROTEIN-KINASE; FISSION; MORPHOLOGY; EXCITOTOXICITY; PLASTICITY; GTPASE; APOPTOSIS	Defects in mitochondrial fission and cyclin dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation are early events that precede neuronal loss following NMDA-induced neuronal death. Here, we report that the cytoplasmic CDK5 tightly regulates mitochondrial morphology defects associated with NMDA-induced neuronal injury via regulation of the mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). We show that DRP1 is a direct target of CDK5. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of DRP1 at a conserved Serine residue, S585, is elevated at the mitochondria and is associated with increased mitochondrial fission. Ectopic expression of a cytoplasmic CDK5 or mutant DRP1-S585D results in increased mitochondrial fragmentation in primary neurons. Conversely, expression of a dominant negative form of cytoplasmic CDK5 or mutant DRP1-S585A results in elongated mitochondria. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of CDK5 by Roscovitine inhibits DRP1 phosphorylation and mitochondrial fission associated with NMDA-induced neuronal loss. Importantly, conditional deletion of CDK5 significantly attenuates DRP1 phosphorylation at S585 and rescues mitochondrial fission defects in neurons exposed to NMDA. Our studies delineate an important mechanism by which CDK5 regulates mitochondrial morphology defects associated with neuronal injury.

Anatomical organization of the rat organum vasculosum laminae terminalis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						OVLT; osmoregulation; thirst; vasopressin; tanycytes; blood-brain barrier	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; SENSORY CIRCUMVENTRICULAR ORGANS; GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; HYPOTHALAMIC PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; HISTOCHEMICAL-LOCALIZATION; VASOPRESSIN SECRETION; FOS IMMUNOREACTIVITY; OSMOTIC STIMULATION; HYPERTONIC SALINE; EPENDYMAL CELLS	The organum vasculosum of the laminae terminalis (OVLT) is a circumventricular organ located along the ventral part of the anterior wall of the third ventricle. Because it lacks a complete blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-borne signals detected in the OVLT provide the brain with information from the periphery and contribute to the generation of centrally mediated responses to humoral feedback and physiological stressors. Experimental studies on the rat OVLT are hindered by a poor understanding of its precise anatomical dimensions and cellular organization. In this study, we use histological techniques to characterize the spatial outline of the rat OVLT and to examine the location of neurons, astrocytes, tanycytes, and ependymocytes within its confines. Our data reveal that OVLT neurons are embedded in a dense network of tanycyte processes. Immunostaining against the neuronal marker NeuN revealed that neurons are distributed throughout the OVLT, except for a thick midline septum, which comprises densely packed cells of unknown function or lineage. Moreover, the most ventral aspect of the OVLT is devoid of neurons and is occupied by a dense network of glial cell processes that form a thick layer between the neurons and the pial surface on the ventral aspect of the nucleus. Lastly, combined detection of NeuN and c-Fos protein following systemic injection of hypertonic NaCl revealed that neurons responsive to this stimulus are located along the entire midline core of the OVLT, extending from its most anterior ventral aspect to the more caudally located "dorsal cap" region.

Such template can be used as tissue-priors for automated WM/GM segmentation but can also provide a common reference and normalized space for group studies. Here, a new template has been created (AMU(40)), and accuracy of automatic template-based WM/GM segmentation was quantified. The feasibility of tensor-based morphometry (TBM) for studying voxel-wise morphological differences of SC between young and elderly healthy volunteers was also investigated. Sixty-five healthy subjects were divided into young (n=40, age <40 years old, mean age 28 +/- 5 years old) and elderly (n=25, age >50 years old, mean age 57 +/- 5 years old) groups and scanned at 3 T using an axial high-resolution T-2*-weighted sequence. Inhomogeneity correction and affine intensity normalization of the SC and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal intensities across slices were performed prior to both construction of the AMU(40) template and WM/GM template-based segmentation. The segmentation was achieved using non-linear spatial normalization of T-2*-w MR images to the AMU(40) template. Validation of WM/GM segmentations was performed with a leave-one-out procedure by calculating DICE similarity coefficients between manual and automated WM/GM masks. SC morphological differences between young and elderly healthy volunteers were assessed using the same non-linear spatial normalization of the subjects' MRI to a common template, derivation of the Jacobian determinant maps from the warping fields, and a TBM analysis. Results demonstrated robust WM/GM automated segmentation, with mean DICE values greater than 0.8. Concerning the TBM analysis, an anterior GM atrophy was highlighted in elderly volunteers, demonstrating thereby, for the first time, the feasibility of studying local structural alterations in the SC using tensor-based morphometry. This holds great promise for studies of morphological impairment occurring in several central nervous system pathologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The definition, pathogenesis and treatment are controversial, and some even contest the existence of this disorder. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) defined classification criteria that required multiple tender points (areas of tenderness occurring in muscles and muscle-tendon junctions) and chronic widespread pain. In 2010, the ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria excluded tender points, allowed less extensive pain and placed reliance on patient-reported somatic symptoms and cognitive difficulties. Fibromyalgia occurs in all populations worldwide, and symptom prevalence ranges between 2% and 4% in the general population. The prevalence of people who are actually diagnosed with fibromyalgia ('administrative prevalence') is much lower. A model of fibromyalgia pathogenesis has been suggested in which biological and psychosocial variables interact to influence the predisposition, triggering and aggravation of a chronic disease, but the details are unclear. Diagnosis requires the history of a typical cluster of symptoms and the exclusion of a somatic disease that sufficiently explains the symptoms by medical examination. Current evidence-based guidelines emphasize the value of multimodal treatments, which encompass both non-pharmacological and selected pharmacological treatments tailored to individual symptoms, including pain, fatigue, sleep problems and mood problems.

Network models provide insights into how oriens-lacunosum-moleculare and bistratified cell interactions influence the power of local hippocampal CA1 theta oscillations	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mathematical model; inhibitory networks; theta rhythm; interneuron; computational model; hippocampus; microcircuit	RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; IN-VIVO; GABAERGIC NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; INTERNEURON NETWORK; POPULATION ACTIVITY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FAST INHIBITION; PARVALBUMIN	Hippocampal theta is a 4-12 Hz rhythm associated with episodic memory, and although it has been studied extensively, the cellular mechanisms underlying its generation are unclear. The complex interactions between different interneuron types, such as those between oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) interneurons and bistratified cells (BiCs), make their contribution to network rhythms difficult to determine experimentally. We created network models that are tied to experimental work at both cellular and network levels to explore how these interneuron interactions affect the power of local oscillations. Our cellular models were constrained with properties from patch clamp recordings in the CA1 region of an intact hippocampus preparation in vitro. Our network models are composed of three different types of interneurons: parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket and axo-axonic cells (BC/AACs), PV+ BiCs, and somatostatin-positive OLM cells. Also included is a spatially extended pyramidal cell model to allow for a simplified local field potential representation, as well as experimentally-constrained, theta frequency synaptic inputs to the interneurons. The network size, connectivity, and synaptic properties were constrained with experimental data. To determine how the interactions between OLM cells and BiCs could affect local theta power, we explored how the number of OLM-BiC connections and connection strength affected local theta power. We found that our models operate in regimes that could be distinguished by whether OLM cells minimally or strongly affected the power of network theta oscillations due to balances that, respectively, allow compensatory effects or not. Inactivation of OLM cells could result in no change or even an increase in theta power. We predict that the dis-inhibitory effect of OLM cells to BiCs to pyramidal cell interactions plays a critical role in the resulting power of network theta oscillations. Overall, our network models reveal a dynamic interplay between different classes of interneurons in influencing local theta power.

Uri			Ligands Binding to Cell Surface Ganglioside GD2 Cause Src-Dependent Activation of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Signaling and Changes in Cellular Morphology	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRK NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTORS; ANTI-GD2 ANTIBODY THERAPY; PHASE-I TRIAL; FAMILY KINASES; NEUROBLASTOMA; PAIN; PHOSPHORYLATION; GABAPENTIN; MELANOMA; EXPRESSION	Ganglioside GD2 is a plasma membrane glycosphinogolipid. In healthy adults it is expressed at low levels, but it is over-expressed in many cancers. For cancer therapy, GD2 is targeted with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and one adverse side effect is severe visceral pain. Pain is not neuropathic, cannot be blocked with morphine, and stops on discontinuation of mAb therapy. Here, we provide evidence that ligand binding to cell surface GD2 induces rapid and transient activation of Src-family kinases, followed by Src-dependent phosphorylation of NMDA-receptor NR2B subunits selectively, activation of Ca++ fluxes, production of cAMP, and changes in cellular morphology. These GD2-ligand activated signals differ in kinetics and in pharmacology from activation of the same signals in the same cells by BDNF, the growth factor agonist of the TrkB receptor, suggesting biological specificity. Hence, cell surface GD2 regulates pathways that can be associated with neoplasia and with morphine-intractable pain; and this can explain why expression of GD2 correlates with these two pathologies.

Exercise at moderate intensity may confer neuroprotective benefits in multiple sclerosis (MS), however it has been reported that people with MS (PwMS) exercise less than national guideline recommendations. We aimed to determine predictors of moderate to vigorous exercise among a sample of older Canadians with MS who were divided into ambulatory (less disabled) and non-ambulatory (more disabled) groups. Methods. We analysed data collected as part of a national survey of health, lifestyle and aging with MS. Participants (n = 743) were Canadians over 55 years of age with MS for 20 or more years. We identified 'a priori' variables (demographic, personal, socioeconomic, physical health, exercise history and health care support) that may predict exercise at moderate to vigorous intensity (>6.75 metabolic equivalent hours/week). Predictive variables were entered into stepwise logistic regression until best fit was achieved. Results. There was no difference in explanatory models between ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups. The model predicting exercise included the ability to walk independently (OR 1.90, 95% CI [1.24-2.91]); low disability (OR 1.50, 95% CI [1.34-1.68] for each 10 point difference in Barthel Index score), perseverance (OR 1.17, 95% CI [1.08-1.26] for each additional point on the scale of 0-14), less fatigue (OR 2.01, 95% CI [1.32-3.07] for those in the lowest quartile), fewer years since MS diagnosis (OR 1.58, 95% CI [1.11-2.23] below the median of 23 years) and fewer cardiovascular comorbidities (OR 1.55 95% CI [1.02-2.35] one or no comorbidities). It was also notable that the factors, age, gender, social support, health care support and financial status were not predictive of exercise. Conclusions. This is the first examination of exercise and exercise predictors among older, more disabled PwMS. Disability is a major predictor of exercise participation (at moderate to vigorous levels) in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups suggesting that more exercise options must be developed for people with greater disability. Perseverance, fatigue, and cardiovascular comorbidities are predictors that are modifiable and potential targets for exercise adherence interventions.

Haploinsufficiency of the human progranulin gene, GRN, causes frontotemporal dementia. Progranulins are composed of chains of cysteine-rich granulin modules. Modules may be released from progranulin by proteolysis as 6kDa granulin polypeptides. Both intact progranulin and some of the granulin polypeptides are biologically active. The granulin module occurs in certain plant proteases and progranulins are present in early diverging metazoan clades such as the sponges, indicating their ancient evolutionary origin. There is only one Grn gene in mammalian genomes. More gene-rich Grn families occur in teleost fish with between 3 and 6 members per species including short-form Grns that have no tetrapod counterparts. Our goals are to elucidate progranulin and granulin module evolution by investigating (i): the origins of metazoan progranulins (ii): the evolutionary relationships between the single Grn of tetrapods and the multiple Grn genes of fish (iii): the evolution of granulin module architectures of vertebrate progranulins (iv): the conservation of mammalian granulin polypeptide sequences and how the conserved granulin amino acid sequences map to the known three dimensional structures of granulin modules. We report that progranulin-like proteins are present in unicellular eukaryotes that are closely related to metazoa suggesting that progranulin is among the earliest extracellular regulatory proteins still employed by multicellular animals. From the genomes of the elephant shark and coelacanth we identified contemporary representatives of a precursor for short-from Grn genes of ray-finned fish that is lost in tetrapods. In vertebrate Grns pathways of exon duplication resulted in a conserved module architecture at the amino-terminus that is frequently accompanied by an unusual pattern of tandem nearly identical module repeats near the carboxyl-terminus. Polypeptide sequence conservation of mammalian granulin modules identified potential structure-activity relationships that may be informative in designing progranulin based therapeutics.

MTHFR DEFICIENCY OR REDUCED INTAKE OF FOLATE OR CHOLINE IN PREGNANT MICE RESULTS IN IMPAIRED SHORT-TERM MEMORY AND INCREASED APOPTOSIS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF WILD-TYPE OFFSPRING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MTHFR deficiency; maternal folate deficiency; maternal choline deficiency; short-term memory; apoptosis	METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY; LOW DIETARY-FOLATE; ADVERSE REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES; FOLIC-ACID; MOUSE HIPPOCAMPUS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; COMMON MUTATION; METABOLISM; BRAIN	Genetic or nutritional disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, with associated hyperhomocysteinemia, can result in complex disorders including pregnancy complications and neuropsychiatric diseases. In earlier work, we showed that mice with a complete deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a critical enzyme in folate and homocysteine metabolism, had cognitive impairment with disturbances in choline metabolism. Maternal demands for folate and choline are increased during pregnancy and deficiencies of these nutrients result in several negative outcomes including increased resorption and delayed development. The goal of this study was to investigate the behavioral and neurobiological impact of a maternal genetic deficiency in MTHFR or maternal nutritional deficiency of folate or choline during pregnancy on 3-week-old Mthfr(+/+) offspring. Mthfr(+/+) and Mthfr(+/-) females were placed on control diets (CD); and Mthfr(+/+) females were placed on folate-deficient diets (FD) or choline-deficient diets (ChDD) throughout pregnancy and lactation until their offspring were 3 weeks of age. Shortterm memory was assessed in offspring, and hippocampal tissue was evaluated for morphological changes, apoptosis, proliferation and choline metabolism. Maternal MTHFR deficiency resulted in short-term memory impairment in offspring. These dams had elevated levels of plasma homocysteine when compared with wild-type dams. There were no differences in plasma homocysteine in offspring. Increased apoptosis and proliferation was observed in the hippocampus of offspring from Mthfr(+/-) mothers. In the maternal FD and ChDD study, offspring also showed short-term memory impairment with increased apoptosis in the hippocampus; increased neurogenesis was observed in ChDD offspring. Choline acetyltransferase protein was increased in the offspring hippocampus of both dietary groups and betaine was decreased in the hippocampus of FD offspring. Our results reveal short-term memory deficits in the offspring of dams with MTHFR deficiency or dietary deficiencies of critical methyl donors. We suggest that deficiencies in maternal one-carbon metabolism during pregnancy can contribute to hippocampal dysfunction in offspring through apoptosis or altered choline metabolism. (C) 2015 IBRO.

Deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 2 gene (Eif4ebp2), encoding the suppressor of mRNA translation initiation 4E-BP2, leads to an imbalance in excitatory-to-inhibitory neurotransmission and ASD-like behaviors. Inhibition of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) mGluR1 and mGluR5 reverses the autistic phenotypes in several ASD mouse models. Importantly, these receptors control synaptic physiology via activation of mRNA translation. We investigated the potential reversal of autistic-like phenotypes in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice by using antagonists of mGluR1 (JNJ16259685) or mGluR5 (fenobam). Augmented hippocampal mGluR-induced long-term depression (LTD; or chemically induced mGluR-LTD) in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice was rescued by mGluR1 or mGluR5 antagonists. While rescue by mGluR5 inhibition occurs through the blockade of a protein synthesis-dependent component of LTD, normalization by mGluR1 antagonists requires the activation of protein synthesis. Synaptically induced LTD was deficient in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice, and this deficit was not rescued by group I mGluR antagonists. Furthermore, a single dose of mGluR1 (0.3 mg/kg) or mGluR5 (3 mg/kg) antagonists in vivo reversed the deficits in social interaction and repetitive behaviors (marble burying) in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice. Our results demonstrate that Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice serve as a relevant model to test potential therapies for ASD symptoms. In addition, we provide substantive evidence that the inhibition of mGluR1/mGluR5 is an effective treatment for physiological and behavioral alterations caused by exacerbated mRNA translation initiation.

Increasing evidence indicates that somnambulism is associated with functional abnormalities during wakefulness and that sleep deprivation constitutes an important drive that facilitates sleepwalking in predisposed patients. Here, we studied the neural mechanisms associated with somnambulism using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with Tc-99m-Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer (ECD), during wakefulness and after sleep deprivation. Methods Ten adult sleepwalkers and twelve controls with normal sleep were scanned using Tc-99m-ECD SPECT in morning wakefulness after a full night of sleep. Eight of the sleepwalkers and nine of the controls were also scanned during wakefulness after a night of total sleep deprivation. Between-group comparisons of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were performed to characterize brain activity patterns during wakefulness in sleepwalkers. Results During wakefulness following a night of total sleep deprivation, rCBF was decreased bilaterally in the inferior temporal gyrus in sleepwalkers compared to controls. Conclusions Functional neural abnormalities can be observed during wakefulness in somnambulism, particularly after sleep deprivation and in the inferior temporal cortex.

However, the unique contribution of the parahippocampal cortex remains unclear. The current study investigates memory for object identity and memory of the configuration of objects in patients with small thermo-coagulation lesions to the hippocampus or the parahippocampal cortex. Results showed that in contrast to control participants and patients with damage to the hippocampus leaving the parahippocampal cortex intact, patients with lesions that included the right parahippocampal cortex (RPH) were severely impaired on a task that required learning the spatial configuration of objects on a computer screen; these patients, however, were not impaired at learning the identity of objects. Conversely, we found that patients with lesions to the right hippocampus (RH) or left hippocampus (LH), sparing the parahippocampal cortex, performed just as well as the control participants. Furthermore, they were not impaired on the object identity task. In the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment, healthy young adults performed the same tasks. Consistent with the findings of the lesion study, the fMRI results showed significant activity in the RPH in the memory for the spatial configuration condition, but not memory for object identity. Furthermore, the pattern of fMRI activity measured in the baseline control conditions decreased specifically in the parahippocampal cortex as a result of the experimental task, providing evidence for task specific repetition suppression. In summary, while our previous studies demonstrated that the hippocampus is critical to the construction of a cognitive map, both the lesion and fMRI studies have shown an involvement of the RPH for learning spatial configurations of objects but not object identity, and that this takes place independent of the hippocampus.

We aimed to determine whether any clinical manifestation of CES, as stated in Royal College of Radiology guidelines, could predict the presence of established CES on MRI. We also aimed to support a larger study to develop a more universal assessment tool for acute lower back pain. A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who warranted urgent MRI was conducted. Seventy-nine patients were eligible for study. The Kendall's tau test was used for statistical analysis of all data. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. MRI was performed in 62 patients out of 79. A total of 32.9% of patients had scans within 24 hours of admission. Nine of these patients were referred to neurosurgery for urgent neurosurgical review. Of these, 6.3% of patients had an established CES on MRI scan. One patient who had an outpatient MRI spine (15 days from hospital presentation) was found to have an established CES, was urgently referred to spinal surgery and underwent primary fenestration excision of the lumbar vertebra. No clinical features that were able to predict the presence of an established CES on MRI were elucidated. Findings included decreased anal tone 7.6% (p = 0.282), faecal incontinence 3.8% (p = 0.648), urinary retention 7.6% (p = 0.510), bladder incontinence 8.9% (p = 0.474), constipation 2.5% (p = 0.011) and saddle anaesthesia 8.9% (p = 0.368). Patients who had an abnormal MRI spine for back pain prior to this presentation showed a correlation with a newly diagnosed CES on MRI (p = 0.016) with a correlation coefficient of 0.272.

Epigen Global Res Consortium	Association between perinatal methylation of the neuronal differentiation regulator HES1 and later childhood neurocognitive function and behaviour	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						HES1; methylation; neurocognitive development; epigenetic; perinatal	DEVELOPING NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; DNA-METHYLATION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; NEURAL DEVELOPMENT; BIRTH-WEIGHT; EXPRESSION; DROSOPHILA	Background Early life environments induce long-term changes in neurocognitive development and behaviour. In animal models, early environmental cues affect neuropsychological phenotypes via epigenetic processes but, as yet, there is little direct evidence for such mechanisms in humans. Method We examined the relation between DNA methylation at birth and child neuropsychological outcomes in two culturally diverse populations using a genome-wide methylation analysis and validation by pyrosequencing. Results Within the UK Southampton Women's Survey (SWS) we first identified 41 differentially methylated regions of interest (DMROI) at birth associated with child's full-scale IQ at age 4 years. Associations between HES1 DMROI methylation and later cognitive function were confirmed by pyrosequencing in 175 SWS children. Consistent with these findings, higher HES1 methylation was associated with higher executive memory function in a second independent group of 200 SWS 7-year-olds. Finally, we examined a pathway for this relationship within a Singaporean cohort (n = 108). Here, HES1 DMROI methylation predicted differences in early infant behaviour, known to be associated with academic success. In vitro, methylation of HES1 inhibited ETS transcription factor binding, suggesting a functional role of this site. Conclusions Thus, our findings suggest that perinatal epigenetic processes mark later neurocognitive function and behaviour, providing support for a role of epigenetic processes in mediating the long-term consequences of early life environment on cognitive development.

We investigated the effects of term neonatal encephalopathy on retinal function and structure. METHODS. A rat model of term neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy (Vannucci model) was used. Hypoxia-ischemia was induced by a left common carotid ligation followed by a 2-hour period of hypoxia (8% oxygen) in Long-Evans rat pups at postnatal day 10 (P10). Sham operated rats served as controls.. Retinal function was assessed at P30 and P60 by electroretinograms (ERGs), after which retinal histology was performed. Retinocortical function was assessed with visual evoked potentials (VEPs) at P60 and subsequently brain histology was performed. RESULTS. The ERGs of the HI animals at P30 and P60 demonstrated a significant reduction in the scotopic and photopic b-wave amplitudes, but a preserved a-wave amplitude. The retinal histology of the HI animals confirmed that the photoreceptor layer remained intact, whereas the inner layers of the retina were damaged. The HI animals also showed reduced VEP P100 amplitudes, which correlated with reduced left cerebral hemisphere surfaces. There was no correlation between the severities of retinal versus cerebral injuries. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings suggest that term neonatal encephalopathy resulting from HI induces functional and structural damages to the inner retina, while relatively sparing the photoreceptors. These findings raise the possibility that retinal injuries may contribute to visual impairments with or without the presence of brain injury in term asphyxiated newborns and, thus, warrant further studies with humans and animals to better understand the disease process.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders are pathological entities in which gut function is impaired without a clearly established pathophysiology. On the basis of the relative ease with which intestinal biopsies can be obtained, and taking advantage of a recently developed optical recording technique, we evaluated whether functional neuronal defects exist in enteric nerves of patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: The submucous plexus isolated from duodenal biopsies taken from FD patients and control subjects was used to functionally and morphologically examine nerves and ganglionic architecture (neurons and glial cells). In light of previous studies reporting eosinophil and mast cell infiltration in the gut mucosa of FD patients, we also examined whether these cells infiltrated the submucous plexus and whether this correlated with neuronal activity and specific clinical symptoms. RESULTS: We demonstrate that neuronal functioning is impaired in the submucous plexus of FD patients, as shown by decreased calcium responses to depolarization and electrical stimulation. Glial (S100) and neuronal (HuCD) markers show signs of gliosis, altered ganglionic architecture, and neuronal abnormalities in the submucous plexus of FD patients. We found that eosinophils and mast cells infiltrated the submucous layer of FD patients to a much larger extent than in controls. A significant correlation was found between the number of these cells and the calcium transient amplitudes measured in submucous ganglia. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first direct evidence that FD is characterized by functional and structural abnormalities within the submucous ganglion plexus, which may be of future predictive and diagnostic value in the treatment of FD patients.

Study design Fifty-six children born very preterm (24-32 weeks gestational age) followed longitudinally from birth underwent 3-dimensional T-1-weighted neuroimaging at median age 7.6 years. Children with severe brain injury were excluded. Cerebellar subregions were automatically segmented using the multiple automatically generated templates algorithm. The relation between cerebellum subregional volumes (adjusted for total brain volume and sex) and neonatal clinical factors were examined using constrained principal component analysis. Cognitive and visual-motor integration functions in relation to cerebellar volumes were also investigated. Results Higher neonatal procedural pain and infection, as well as other clinical factors, were differentially associated with reduced cerebellar volumes in specific subregions. After adjusting for clinical risk factors, neonatal procedural pain was distinctively associated with smaller volumes bilaterally in the posterior VIIIA and VIIIB lobules. Specific smaller cerebellar subregional volumes were related to poorer cognition and motor/visual integration. Conclusions In very preterm children, exposure to painful procedures, as well as additional neonatal risk factors such as infection, were associated with reduced cerebellar volumes in specific subregions and poorer outcomes at school age.

ACUITY Trial Investigators	Incidence, predictors, and impact of neurological events in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes: the ACUITY trial	EUROINTERVENTION			English	Article						acute coronary syndromes; coronary artery bypass grafting; percutaneous coronary intervention; stroke	ARTERY-BYPASS SURGERY; OFF-PUMP; ON-PUMP; UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ACUTE CATHETERIZATION; STRATEGY TRIAL; GRAFT-SURGERY; SYNTAX TRIAL; INTERVENTION	Aims: We sought to describe the incidence, predictors, and impact of adverse neurological events (NE) in a non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) population undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or medical therapy (MT). Methods and results: 13,819 patients with moderate and high-risk NSTEACS were enrolled in the prospective ACUITY trial. Angiography was performed within 72 hours of presentation, after which 7,789 patients (56.4%) underwent PCI, 1,539 (11.1%) underwent CABG, and 4,491(32.5%) received MT. The rate of NE (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) at 30 days and one year and its relationship to adverse ischaemic events, including death, were assessed. Thirty-day rates of NE were 1.1% with CABG, 0.3% with PCI, and 0.5% with MT (p<0.001). One-year rates of NE were 1.1% with CABG, 0.3% with PCI, and 0.6% with MT (p<0.001). Independent predictors of NE at 30 days and one year included age, renal insufficiency, baseline troponin elevation, and initial treatment with CABG. The occurrence of NE was a strong independent predictor of death at 30 days and one year (HR 4.07, 95% CI [1.49, 11.11], p=0.006, and HR 4.25, 95% CI [2.37, 7.62], p<0.001, respectively). Conclusions: In the large-scale ACUITY trial, CABG was associated with a higher risk of NE at 30 days and one year compared to PCI and MT. The occurrence of NE in patients with NSTEACS was strongly associated with increased early and late mortality.

Estrogen receptors in the central nervous system and their implication for dopamine-dependent cognition in females	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Review						G protein coupled estrogen receptor 1; Estrogen receptor alpha; Estrogen receptor beta; Dopamine; Electron microscopy	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; MOUSE HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; BETA MESSENGER-RNA; RAT DENTATE GYRUS; RADIAL-MAZE TASKS; LATENT INHIBITION	Over the past 30 years, research has demonstrated that estrogens not only are important for female reproduction, but also play a role in a diverse array of cognitive functions. Originally, estrogens were thought to have only one receptor, localized exclusively to the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. However, it is now known that there are at least three estrogen receptors (ERs): ER alpha, ER beta and G-protein coupled ER1 (GPER1). In addition to being localized to nuclei, ER alpha and ER beta are localized to the cell membrane, and GPER1 is also observed at the cell membrane. The mechanism through which ERs are associated with the membrane remains unclear, but palmitoylation of receptors and associations between ERs and caveolin are implicated in membrane association. ER alpha and ER beta are mostly observed in the nucleus using light microscopy unless they are particularly abundant. However, electron microscopy has revealed that ERs are also found at the membrane in complimentary distributions in multiple brain regions, many of which are innervated by dopamine inputs and were previously thought to contain few ERs. In particular, membrane-associated ERs are observed in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, all of which are involved in learning and memory. These findings provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of estrogens in these regions. The effects of estrogens on dopamine-dependent cognition likely result from binding at both nuclear and membrane-associated ERs, so elucidating the localization of membrane-associated ERs helps provide a more complete understanding of the cognitive effects of these hormones.

Treatment, overall survival, and costs in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer after crizotinib monotherapy	CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION			English	Article						Anaplastic lymphoma kinase; Carcinoma, non-small-cell lung; Economic burden of disease; Lung neoplasms; Protein kinase inhibitor; Survival	CLINICAL-EXPERIENCE; DISEASE PROGRESSION; TREATMENT PATTERNS; BRAIN METASTASES; INHIBITORS; GENE; RESISTANCE; MUTATION; PANEL	Background: Limited post-crizotinib treatment options for ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) might lead to poor survival and high economic burden. Objective: To evaluate real-world treatment patterns, overall survival (OS), and costs following crizotinib discontinuation. Methods: This study used chart review and claims data. First, 27 participating US oncologists reviewed medical records of ALK-positive NSCLC patients who discontinued crizotinib monotherapy and reported patient demographic and clinical information, including post-crizotinib treatment and mortality. OS was estimated using Kaplan Meier analyses. Second, three large administrative US claims databases were pooled. NSCLC patients were selected if they discontinued crizotinib monotherapy. Post-crizotinib costs were analyzed separately for patients who did or did not discontinue antineoplastic treatment after crizotinib monotherapy. All data were collected prior to ceritinib approval for this patient population. Results: A total of 119 ALK-positive NSCLC patients discontinued crizotinib monotherapy. Upon discontinuation, 42% had no additional antineoplastic treatment and 13% received radiation therapy only. The median OS postcrizotinib was 61 days; patients with brain metastases had shorter OS than those who did not (44 vs. 69 days, P=0.018), and patients without further antineoplastic treatment had shorter OS than those who did (17 vs. 180 days, P<0.001). From claims data, 305 ALK-positive NSCLC patients discontinued crizotinib monotherapy. After discontinuation, 72% had no additional antineoplastic treatment. Among patients who continued antineoplastic treatment, monthly healthcare costs averaged $22,160, driven by pharmacy ($9202), inpatient ($6419), and outpatient radiotherapy ($2888) and imaging ($1179) costs. Among patients who discontinued any antineoplastic treatment, monthly healthcare costs averaged $3423, mostly driven by inpatient costs ($2074). Conclusions: After crizotinib monotherapy, most patients either received radiotherapy only or discontinued antineoplastic treatment altogether. OS after discontinuing crizotinib was poor and shorter among those with brain metastases than without, and among those without subsequent antineoplastic treatment than with. Patients who continued antineoplastic treatment incurred substantial healthcare costs.	[Guerin, A.; Dea, K.; Nitulescu, R.; Galebach, P.; Macalalad, A.

In Fischer rats, brain irradiation increases the infiltration of cancer cells and reduced the median survival of the animals. In this study, we have determined whether these adverse effects of radiation can be prevented with the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor meloxicam. Materials and methods : Brain of Fischer rats treated or not with meloxicam were irradiated (15 Gy) and then implanted with the F98 glioma cells. The median survival of the animals, the infiltration of F98 cells, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and pro-migration molecules were measured. Results : Meloxicam reduced by 75% the production of prostaglandin E2 (bioproduct of COX-2) in irradiated brains validating its anti-inflammatory effect. Median survival was increased to control levels by the treatment of meloxicam following brain irradiation. This protective effect was associated with a reduction of the infiltration of F98 cells in the brain, a complete inhibition of radiation-enhancement of matrix metalloproteinase-2, and a significant reduction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and tumor growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) expression. Using invasion chambers, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) stimulated by 5-fold the invasiveness of F98 cells, but this stimulation was completely inhibited by meloxicam. This suggests that a cooperation between IL-1 beta and COX-2 are involved in radiation-enhancement of F98 cell invasion. Conclusions : Our results indicate the importance of reducing the inflammatory response of normal brain tissue following irradiation in an effort to extend median survival in F98 tumor-bearing rats.

This study aimed to assess theory of mind after early, mild TBI (mTBI). Fifty-one children who sustained mTBI between 18 and 60 months were evaluated 6 months post-injury on emotion and desires reasoning and false-belief understanding tasks. Their results were compared to that of 50 typically developing children. The two groups did not differ on baseline characteristics, except for pre- and post-injury externalizing behavior. The mTBI group obtained poorer scores relative to controls on both the emotion and desires task and the false-belief understanding task, even after controlling for pre-injury externalizing behavior. No correlations were found between TBI injury characteristics and theory of mind. This is the first evidence that mTBI in preschool children is associated with theory of mind difficulties. Reduced perspective taking abilities could be linked with the social impairments that have been shown to arise following TBI.

Daily dietary phylloquinone intake was estimated from 50-item interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire. Cognition was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); behaviour with Frontotemporal Behavioral Rating Scale (FBRS). Age, gender, social problems, education, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, history of stroke, use vitamin K antagonists, inadequate fatty fish intake, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, albumin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were used as confounders. Compared to participants in the lowest third of dietary phylloquinone intake (n = 64), those with higher intake had higher (i.e., better) mean MMSE score (22.0 +/- 5.7 versus 19.9 +/- 6.2, p = 0.024) and lower (i.e., better) FBRS score (1.5 +/- 1.2 versus 1.9 +/- 1.3, p = 0.042). In multivariate linear regressions, log dietary phylloquinone intake was positively associated with MMSE score (adjusted beta = 1.66, p = 0.013) and inversely associated with FBRS score (adjusted beta = -0.33, p = 0.037). Specifically, log dietary phylloquinone intake correlated negatively with FBRS subscore of physical neglect (r = -0.24, p = 0.001). Higher dietary phylloquinone intake was associated with better cognition and behavior among older adults.

Variations in the frequency of fission and fusion can also reveal an individual's response to environmental changes. As fission-fusion group dynamics influence the risk of disease transmission, measuring it accurately may have implications for population management. Here, we extend a method to assess the frequency of fission and fusion from continuous monitoring of group composition. The former method was based on the variation in group size (i.e., party/subgroup size) within which marked individuals were successively recorded. Upon validation of the method here, we propose a correction, using the coefficient of variation in group size instead of the variation in group size. We performed our study on an enclosed herd of reindeer, Rangifer tarandus. All reindeer were tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and followed by direct observations. GPS collars allowed us to obtain accurate measures of the frequency of fission and fusion that we used to validate our models. The resulting method best described the temporal variation in fission and fusion frequency without the confounding effect of the variation in group size. This method can easily be applied to other populations where some individuals can be recognized and their group size repeatedly recorded. It will also help in quantifying the 2nd dimension of the fission-fusion group dynamics: the variation in group size.

Recent neuroimaging data suggest a fundamental underlying process that links the motor and cognitive roles of the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), namely the processing of feedback during trial and error learning in the cingulate motor region that is related to the modality of the feedback. These data suggest that the specific motor context of a task may be a critical determinant of how its outcome is processed in the MCC. We assessed a patient before and after surgery for brain tumour removal in the medial frontal cortex, and a group of matched control subjects. Subjects had to find by trial and error the stimulus associated with the correct feedback amongst four or five similar stimuli. Subjects performed the task in two different visuo-motor contexts: with the response pad and hand visible and with no sight of either pad or hand. The patient showed a selective impairment in this task relative to control subjects in the hardest conditions and the impairment was most marked when the response pad and the hand were not visible. The results support a specific role of the medial frontal cortex in the construction of a sensorimotor representation of choices and related feedback by encoding the contingency between an efference copy of the action and its outcome.

Some limited pyramidal involvement also occurs in patients with an autosomal recessive neurocutaneous syndrome due to ALDH18A1 mutations. ALDH18A1 encodes delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), an enzyme that catalyses the first and common step of proline and ornithine biosynthesis from glutamate. Through exome sequencing and candidate gene screening, we report two families with autosomal recessive transmission of ALDH18A1 mutations, and predominant complex hereditary spastic paraplegia with marked cognitive impairment, without any cutaneous abnormality. More interestingly, we also identified monoallelic ALDH18A1 mutations segregating in three independent families with autosomal dominant pure or complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as in two sporadic patients. Low levels of plasma ornithine, citrulline, arginine and proline in four individuals from two families suggested P5CS deficiency. Glutamine loading tests in two fibroblast cultures from two related affected subjects confirmed a metabolic block at the level of P5CS in vivo. Besides expanding the clinical spectrum of ALDH18A1-related pathology, we describe mutations segregating in an autosomal dominant pattern. The latter are associated with a potential trait biomarker; we therefore suggest including amino acid chromatography in the clinico-genetic work-up of hereditary spastic paraplegia, particularly in dominant cases, as the associated phenotype is not distinct from other causative genes.

The cause of CP has historically been attributed to environmental stressors resulting in brain damage. While genetic risk factors are also implicated, guidelines for diagnostic assessment of CP do not recommend for routine genetic testing. Given numerous reports of aetiologic copy number variations (CNVs) in other neurodevelopmental disorders, we used microarrays to genotype a population-based prospective cohort of children with CP and their parents. Here we identify de novo CNVs in 8/115 (7.0%) CP patients (similar to 1% rate in controls). In four children, large chromosomal abnormalities deemed likely pathogenic were found, and they were significantly more likely to have severe neuromotor impairments than those CP subjects without such alterations. Overall, the CNV data would have impacted our diagnosis or classification of CP in 11/115 (9.6%) families.

This study aims to examine the separate and combined effects of episodic memory and executive function impairments on the mean value and the coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride time among non-demented older community dwellers. Based on a cross-sectional design, 1458 older community dwellers without dementia (70.6 +/- 4.9 years; 49.2 % female) were recruited and separated into cognitively healthy individuals (CHI) and individuals with cognitive impairment. A score <= 5/6 on the Short Mini-Mental State Examination defined episodic memory impairment. Impaired executive function was defined by errors on the clock-drawing test. Mean value and CoV of stride time were measured by the GAITRite(R) system. A total of 517 participants (35.5 %) had cognitive impairment in at least one cognitive domain. Participants with memory impairment (P = 0.006) and those with combined cognitive impairments (P < 0.001) had greater (i.e., worse gait performance) mean value of stride time (P = 0.006) compared to CHI. Participants with combined cognitive impairment had a greater CoV of stride time (i.e., worse gait performance) compared to CHI (P = 0.004) and to those with separate memory impairment (P = 0.037). Among participants with combined cognitive impairments, mean value and CoV of stride time had the highest effect size (respectively, effect size = 0.49 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.27; 0.71] and effect size = 0.40 [95 % CI 0.18; 0.62]). Participants with episodic memory or executive impairments had a greater mean value and CoV of stride time compared to those with no cognitive impairment. Combined episodic memory and executive impairments exceeded the sum of separate impairments on gait performances, suggesting a complex interplay going beyond a simple additive effect.

The mechanism causing a prolongation of the QT interval during epilepsy remains unknown. Based on observations showing an upregulation of neuronal sodium channels in the brain during epilepsy, we tested the hypothesis that a similar phenomenon occurs in the heart and contributes to QT prolongation by altering cardiac sodium current properties (I-Na). Methods and Results We used the patch clamp technique to assess the effects of epilepsy on the cardiac action potential and I-Na in rat ventricular myocytes. Consistent with QT prolongation, epileptic rats had longer ventricular action potential durations attributable to a sustained component of I-Na (I-NaL). The increase in I-NaL was because of a larger contribution of neuronal Na channels characterized by their high sensitivity to tetrodotoxin. As in the brain, epilepsy was associated with an enhanced expression of the neuronal isoform Na(V)1.1 in cardiomyocyte. Epilepsy was also associated with a lower I-Na activation threshold resulting in increased cell excitability. Conclusions This is the first study correlating increased expression of neuronal sodium channels within the heart to epilepsy-related cardiac arrhythmias. This represents a new paradigm in our understanding of cardiac complications related to epilepsy.

Injury to the Cerebellum in Term Asphyxiated Newborns Treated with Hypothermia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; NEONATAL BRAIN; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES; WHITE-MATTER; MRI; CHILDREN; INFANTS; PREDICTION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Until now, most studies of brain injury related to term neonatal encephalopathy have focused on the cerebrum and ignored the cerebellum. We sought to evaluate whether cerebellar injury occurs in term asphyxiated neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asphyxiated neonates treated with hypothermia were enrolled prospectively. Severity of brain injury in the cerebrum was scored on each MR imaging obtained during the first month of life; cerebellar injury was recorded when mentioned in the imaging or autopsy report. In addition, for some of the neonates, the ADC and fractional anisotropy were measured in 4 regions of interest in the cerebellum. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two asphyxiated neonates met the criteria for hypothermia. Cerebellar injury was visible only on conventional imaging of 4% of the neonates for whom brain imaging was available, but it was reported in the autopsy report of 72% of the neonates who died. In addition, 41 of the asphyxiated neonates had a total of 84 ADC and fractional anisotropy maps. Neonates with brain injury described only in the cerebrum demonstrated ADC and fractional anisotropy changes similar to those of the neonates with brain injury in the cerebrum and cerebellum-increased ADC around day 10 of life and decreased fractional anisotropy on day 2-3 of life, around day 10 of life, and around 1 month of age. CONCLUSIONS: The cerebellum may be injured in term neonates after birth asphyxia. These cerebellar injuries are only rarely visible on conventional imaging, but advanced neuroimaging techniques may help to identify them.

PRP studies assess participants when they give Priority to one task over the other (complete A then B), whereas in DT studies participants give Equal priority to both tasks (complete A and B). The Equal condition could be viewed as adding an executive control component to the task since the participants must spontaneously monitor attention between tasks. In the current study, we assessed the effect of priority instructions (Priority vs. Equal) on the dual-task performance and brain activity of younger (n = 16) and older adults (n = 19) with functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS). In younger adults, the Priority condition showed right-sided activation in the prefrontal cortex during DT execution. Older adults showed bilateral frontal activation, yet restrained to specific areas. They showed increased activation in DT vs. single task condition in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In the Equal condition, the DT condition showed isolated left DLPFC and VLPFC activation in younger adults and widespread bilateral DLPFC activation in older adults. These results suggest that for both older and younger adults, priority effects are associated with distinct patterns of prefrontal activation. Age-related differences also exist in these patterns such that prefrontal activation seems to be more spread out at different sites in older adults when they are instructed to give Equal priority to both tasks.

Animal models provide increased understanding of cancer-induced bone and sensory alterations. The objective of this study was to investigate the measures of pain at distant non-tumor-bearing sites in animals with localized bone metastasis. Immunocompetent BALB/c mice are injected intra-tibially with murine mammary carcinoma cells (4T1) or saline, and the sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli in the contralateral paw was examined. In addition to previously demonstrated development of osteolysis and hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli in the cancer-injected tibia, these animals exhibited an increase in sensory hypersensitivity in the contralateral limb. No bone lesions were evident on radiographs of the contralateral limbs. Histomorphometry detected decreased bone volume per tissue volume and increased osteoclast number in the contralateral tibia and vertebral bones of cancer-bearing animals. Neuroplasticity was examined by immunofluorescence for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in sensory neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in lumbar spinal cords. CGRP-immunoreactivity and GFAP-immunoreactivity were significantly elevated both ipsilateral and contralateral in tumor-bearing animals. The anti-inflammatory and osteolysis-targeting drug rapamycin reduced hypersensitivity to mechanical and cold stimuli, attenuated GFAP over-expression, and lowered osteoclast number. The osteoclast-targeting drug pamidronate reduced sensitivity to cold and protected against bone loss. Localized bone cancer drives hypersensitivity, bone remodeling, and sensory neuron plasticity at sites distant from the primary tumor area. Drugs targeting these mechanisms may be useful in the treatment of pain distant from the primary tumor site.

To address potential contributions of the motor network to the recognition of previously produced sounds, we used event-related potential, electric current density, and behavioral measures to investigate memory for produced and perceived melodies. Musicians performed or listened to novel melodies, and then heard the melodies either in their original version or with single pitch alterations. Production learning enhanced subsequent recognition accuracy and increased amplitudes of N200, P300, and N400 responses to pitch alterations. Premotor and supplementary motor regions showed greater current density during the initial detection of alterations in previously produced melodies than in previously perceived melodies, associated with the N200. Primary motor cortex was more strongly engaged by alterations in previously produced melodies within the P300 and N400 timeframes. Motor memory traces may therefore interface with auditory pitch percepts in premotor regions as early as 200 ms following perceived pitch onsets. Outcomes suggest that auditory-motor interactions contribute to memory benefits conferred by production experience, and support a role of motor prediction mechanisms in the production effect.

The first possibility is that the amusic deficit is due to a broad disorder of acoustic pitch processing that has the effect of disrupting downstream musical pitch processing, and the second is that amusia is specific to a musical pitch processing module. To interrogate these hypotheses, we performed a meta-analysis on two types of effect sizes contained within 42 studies in the amusia literature: the performance gap between amusics and controls on tasks of pitch discrimination, broadly defined, and the correlation between specifically acoustic pitch perception and musical pitch perception. To augment the correlation database, we also calculated this correlation using data from 106 participants tested by our own research group. We found strong evidence for the acoustic account of amusia. The magnitude of the performance gap was moderated by the size of pitch change, but not by whether the stimuli were composed of tones or speech. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between an individuals acoustic and musical pitch perception. However, individual cases show a double dissociation between acoustic and musical processing, which suggests that although most amusic cases are probably explainable by an acoustic deficit, there is heterogeneity within the disorder. Finally, we found that tonal language fluency does not influence the performance gap between amusics and controls, and that there was no evidence that amusics fare worse with pitch direction tasks than pitch discrimination tasks. These results constitute a quantitative review of the current literature of congenital amusia, and suggest several new directions for research, including the experimental induction of amusic behaviour through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the systematic exploration of the developmental trajectory of this disorder.

New Clinical Subtypes of Parkinson Disease and Their Longitudinal Progression A Prospective Cohort Comparison With Other Phenotypes	JAMA NEUROLOGY			English	Article							SLEEP BEHAVIOR DISORDER; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH; SOCIETY TASK-FORCE; DEMENTIA; HETEROGENEITY; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES; RECOMMENDATIONS; IDENTIFICATION	IMPORTANCE There is increasing evidence that Parkinson disease (PD) is heterogeneous in its clinical presentation and prognosis. Defining subtypes of PD is needed to better understand underlying mechanisms, predict disease course, and eventually design more efficient personalized management strategies. OBJECTIVES To identify clinical subtypes of PD, compare the prognosis and progression rate between PD phenotypes, and compare the ability to predict prognosis in our subtypes and those from previously published clustering solutions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study. The cohorts were from 2 movement disorders clinics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (patients were enrolled during the period from 2005 to 2013). A total of 113 patients with idiopathic PD were enrolled. A comprehensive spectrum of motor and nonmotor features (motor severity, motor complications, motor subtypes, quantitative motor tests, autonomic and psychiatric manifestations, olfaction, color vision, sleep parameters, and neurocognitive testing) were assessed at baseline. After a mean follow-up time of 4.5 years, 76 patients were reassessed. In addition to reanalysis of baseline variables, a global composite outcome was created by merging standardized scores for motor symptoms, motor signs, cognitive function, and other nonmotor manifestations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in the quintiles of the global composite outcome and its components were compared between different subtypes. RESULTS The best cluster solution found was based on orthostatic hypotension, mild cognitive impairment, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, anxiety, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II and Part III scores at baseline. Three subtypes were defined as mainly motor/slow progression, diffuse/malignant, and intermediate. Despite similar age and disease duration, patients with the diffuse/malignant phenotype were more likely to have mild cognitive impairment, orthostatic hypotension, and RBD at baseline, and at prospective follow-up, they showed a more rapid progression in cognition (odds ratio [OR], 8.7 [95% CI, 4.0-18.7]; P < .001), other nonmotor symptoms (OR, 10.0 [95% CI, 4.3-23.2]; P < .001), motor signs (OR, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.8-9.1]; P = .001), motor symptoms (OR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.3-6.2]; P < .01), and the global composite outcome (OR, 8.0 [95% CI, 3.7-17.7]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE It is recommended to screen patients with PD for mild cognitive impairment, orthostatic hypotension, and RBD even at baseline visits. These nonmotor features identify a diffuse/malignant subgroup of patients with PD for whom the most rapid progression rate could be expected.

J	Boksa, P; Zhang, Y; Nouel, D				Boksa, Patricia; Zhang, Ying; Nouel, Dominique			Maternal Oxytocin Administration Before Birth Influences the Effects of Birth Anoxia on the Neonatal Rat Brain	NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Brain; Hormones; Hypoxia; Labor; Lactate; Neonatal	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CESAREAN-SECTION; AMNIOTIC-FLUID; FETAL-BRAIN; BLOOD-FLOW; LABOR	Ineffective contractions and prolonged labor are common birth complications in primiparous women, and oxytocin is the most common agent given for induction or augmentation of labor. Clinical studies in humans suggest oxytocin might adversely affect the CNS response to hypoxia at birth. In this study, we used a rat model of global anoxia during Cesarean section birth to test if administering oxytocin to pregnant dams prior to birth affects the acute neonatal CNS response to birth anoxia. Anoxic pups born from dams pre-treated with intravenous injections or infusions of oxytocin before birth showed significantly increased brain lactate, a metabolic indicator of CNS hypoxia, compared to anoxic pups from dams pre-treated with saline. Anoxic pups born from dams given oxytocin before birth also showed decreased brain ATP compared to anoxic pups from saline dams. Direct injection of oxytocin to postnatal day 2 rat pups followed by exposure to anoxia also resulted in increased brain lactate and decreased brain ATP, compared to anoxia exposure alone. Oxytocin pre-treatment of the dam decreased brain malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, as well as protein kinase C activity, both in anoxic pups and controls, suggesting oxytocin may reduce aspects of oxidative stress. Finally, when dams were pretreated with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, maternal oxytocin no longer potentiated effects of anoxia on neonatal brain lactate, suggesting this effect of oxytocin may be mediated via prostaglandin production or other COX-derived products. The results indicate that maternal oxytocin administration may have multiple acute effects on CNS metabolic responses to anoxia at birth.

However, little is known about the role of NPY variations in diet-induced change in adiposity. Objective: The objective was to examine the effects of NPY variant rs16147 on central obesity and abdominal fat distribution in response to dietary interventions. Design: We genotyped a functional NPY variant rs16147 among 723 participants in the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies trial. Changes in waist circumference (WC), total abdominal adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from baseline to 6 and 24 mo were evaluated with respect to the rs16147 genotypes. Genotype dietary fat interaction was also examined. Results: The rs16147 C allele was associated with a greater reduction in WC at 6 mo (P < 0.001). In addition, the genotypes showed a statistically significant interaction with dietary fat in relation to WC and SAT (P-interaction = 0.01 and 0.04): the association was stronger in individuals with high-fat intake than in those with low-fat intake. At 24 mo, the association remained statistically significant for WC in the high-fat diet group (P = 0.02), although the gene dietary fat interaction became nonsignificant (P = 0.30). In addition, we found statistically significant genotype dietary fat interaction on the change in total abdominal adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and SAT at 24 mo (P = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.04): the rs16147 T allele appeared to associate with more adverse change in the abdominal fat deposition in the high-fat diet group than in the low-fat diet group. Conclusion: Our data indicate that the NPY rs16147 genotypes affect the change in abdominal adiposity in response to dietary interventions, and the effects of the rs16147 single-nucleotide polymorphism on central obesity and abdominal fat distribution were modified by dietary fat. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00072995.

If this ganglionic dysfunction also occurs in the islet sympathetic pathway, sympathetically mediated glucagon responses could be impaired. Our objectives were 1) to test for a suppressive effect of 7 days of streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes on celiac ganglia (CG) activation and on neurotransmitter and glucagon responses to preganglionic nerve stimulation, 2) to isolate the defect in the islet sympathetic pathway to the CG itself, and 3) to test for a protective effect of the WLDS mutation. We injected saline or nicotine in nondiabetic and STZ-diabetic rats and measured fos mRNA levels in whole CG. We electrically stimulated the preganglionic or postganglionic nerve trunk of the CG in nondiabetic and STZ-diabetic rats and measured portal venous norepinephrine and glucagon responses. We repeated the nicotine and preganglionic nerve stimulation studies in nondiabetic and STZ-diabetic WLDS rats. In STZ-diabetic rats, the CG fos response to nicotine was suppressed, and the norepinephrine and glucagon responses to preganglionic nerve stimulation were impaired. In contrast, the norepinephrine and glucagon responses to postganglionic nerve stimulation were normal. The CG fos response to nicotine, and the norepinephrine and glucagon responses to preganglionic nerve stimulation, were normal in STZ-diabetic WLDS rats. In conclusion, short-term hyperglycemia's suppressive effect on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the CG impairs sympathetically mediated glucagon responses. WLDS rats are protected from this dysfunction. The implication is that this CG dysfunction may contribute to the impaired glucagon response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia seen early in type 1 diabetes.

Pancreatic NETs are categorized as functional (F) or nonfunctional (NF) based on their ability to secrete hormones that elicit clinically relevant symptoms. Specialized diagnostic tests are required for diagnosis. Treatment options are diverse and include surgical resection, intraarterial hepatic therapy, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Systemic therapy options include targeted agents as well as chemotherapy when indicated. Diagnosis and management should occur through a collaborative team of health care practitioners well-experienced in managing pNETs. Recent advances in pNET treatment options have led to the development of the Canadian consensus document described in this report. The discussion includes the epidemiology, classification, pathology, clinical presentation and prognosis, imaging and laboratory testing, medical and surgical management, and recommended treatment algorithms for pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers.

Historically, it appears however that the first functional predictions about adaptive hippocampal specialization for spatial memory of stored food were preceded, not followed, by the mechanistic paradigm of massive modularity that was dominant in the 1990s. More attention is paid nowadays to domain general aspects of cognition and to neural connectivity. Attention is also now given to evo devo principles of brain organization, which suggest conserved routes to evolutionary changes in the brain driven by conserved developmental schedules. Knowledge gained in answering each of Tinbergen's four questions is thus useful in making predictions concerning the other ones.

Extensive pharmacological, biochemical and cell biological research over the years has led to a model of TSPO involvement in mitochondrial cholesterol transport and promotion of steroid synthesis, a model guiding the design of drugs useful in stimulating neurosteroid synthesis and alleviating psychopathological symptoms. The involvement of TSPO in these processes has been called into question; however, with the publication of TSPO-deletion mouse models which saw no changes in steroid production. Here, we review work characterizing TSPO in steroidogenesis and offer perspective to research into TSPO pharmacology and its involvement in steroid biosynthesis.

J	Amzica, F				Amzica, Florin			What does burst suppression really mean?	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Hyperexcitability; Intracellular; EEG	ISOFLURANE ANESTHESIA; BACLOFEN OVERDOSE; BRAIN; EEG; COMA; HYPOTHERMIA; PROTECTION; PATIENT; PATTERN; CORTEX	This paper describes the various electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns expressed by the comatose brain, starting with the sleep-like oscillations associated with light coma. Deeper coma generally displays a burst-suppression pattern characterized by alternating episodes of isoelectric (flat) EEG and bursting slow waves. The latter are the result of cortical hype rexcitability, as demonstrated by intracellular recordings in anesthetized animals. Further deepening of the coma yields to continuous isoelectric electroencephalogram and eventually results in a newly discovered type of spiky waves that have been termed Nu-complexes. The paper discusses the structures participating in the genesis of burst suppression, the afferent mechanisms, and the reasons for which this activity should or should not be regarded as an epileptic disorder.

The contact forces are described using gradients of nonlinear potentials; then, the deformations of the contact surface can be obtained by an impedance approach. The cooperating manipulators are considered as a combination of subsystems, and the decentralized local dynamics coupled with physical interactions among the subsystems are developed. To compensate for the effect of dynamics uncertainties and external disturbances, decentralized fuzzy control combining parameter adaptations and disturbance observers is constructed. It guarantees the motion trajectories and impedance forces of the constrained object converging to the desired manifolds. It is theoretically established that the disturbance observers compensate for unparameterizable uncertainties, while the adaptive fuzzy mechanism compensates for the fast-changing components of the uncertainties that go beyond the disturbance observers. Moreover, unknown nonlinear dynamics such as the inertia matrix, Coriolis/centripetal matrix, and frictions, as well as interconnections with nonlinear bounds, can be accommodated through online learning. The experiments on two real robots have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.

We recently developed the PropSeg method, which allows for fast, accurate and automatic segmentation of the SC on different types of MRI contrast (e.g., T-1-, T-2- and T-3-weighted sequences) and any field of view. However, comparing measurements from the SC between subjects is hindered by the lack of a generic coordinate system for the SC. In this paper, we present a new framework combining PropSeg and a vertebral level identification method, thereby enabling direct inter-and intra-subject comparison of SC measurements for large cohort studies as well as for longitudinal studies. Our segmentation method is based on the multi-resolution propagation of tubular deformable models. Coupled with an automatic intervertebral disk identification method, our segmentation pipeline provides quantitative metrics of the SC and spinal canal such as cross-sectional areas and volumes in a generic coordinate system based on vertebral levels. This framework was validated on 17 healthy subjects and on one patient with SC injury against manual segmentation. Results have been compared with an existing active surface method and show high local and global accuracy for both SC and spinal canal (Dice coefficients =0.91 +/- 0.02) segmentation. Having a robust and automatic framework for SC segmentation and vertebral-based normalization opens the door to bias-free measurement of SC atrophy in large cohorts.

In recent years, the concept of "brain reserve" has emerged to describe some individuals having an increased "baseline adaptive neuroplasticity", providing greater dynamic capacity for adjusting and remodeling cortical circuits to various stressors. We hypothesize that brain reserve may have neuroprotective effects against late life depression. Here, we discuss the modulatory capacity of stress and corticosteroid hormones on hippocampal plasticity and neuronal viability in late life depression as well as the anti-depressive of ketamine and scopolamine mediated by stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin, increased inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta, and increased synaptogenesis. This review shall shed light on complex neurobiological mechanisms that underpin late life depression and help to better understand neural correlates of resilience. Investigating how rat models of increased cognitive reserve mitigate a chronic mild stress-elicited depression will afford new insights in the search for new therapeutic targets to treat this neuropsychiatric disorder.

One explanation for these opposing observations is that oxytocin induces a communal, other-orientation. Becoming more other oriented should help those people who focus on the self to the exclusion of others, but could be detrimental to those who are other focused but have little sense of an agentic self. Using a within-subjects design, we administered intranasal oxytocin and placebo to 40 males and measured their agency (self-orientation) and communion (other-orientation). Oxytocin produced a slight increase in communion for the average participant; however, as predicted, avoidantly attached individuals were especially likely to perceive themselves as more communal (kind, warm, gentle, etc.) after receiving oxytocin than after receiving the placebo. There was no main effect of oxytocin on agency for the average participant; however, anxiously attached individuals showed a selective decrease in agency (independent, self-confident, etc.) following administration of oxytocin. These data help explain the complex social effects of oxytocin.

We assessed the occurrence of subclinical PE and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels among nonacclimatized individuals during an expedition on Mount Elbrus (5642 m). Methods: Seven subjects underwent assessment of vital signs, Lake Louise Score, ultrasound lung comets using handheld echography and circulating BNP using capillary testing at different stages of ascension, in addition to baseline echocardiography. Friedman tests were used to compare serial measurements. Results: Heart rate, Lake Louise Score (P < 0.0001) and blood pressure (P = 0.037) increased during ascension; oxygen saturation decreased (P < 0.0001). BNP increased (40.7 +/- 16.8 vs 19.7 +/- 3.04 pg/mL; P < 0.01) after the summit, as did ultrasound lung comet count throughout ascension (P < 0.0001), but both parameters were not correlated (r = 0.36; P = 0.42). Post-summit peak BNP correlated with baseline left ventricular mass index (r = -0.79; P = 0.033). Conclusion: This study confirms the high incidence of subclinical PE during subacute exposure to hypobaric hypoxia and enhancement of this phenomenon after exertion. Although not correlated with the degree of PE, BNP levels increased after sustained effort at HA, but not at rest. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the BNP response at HA and its usefulness as a monitoring tool during expeditions.

We identified by whole exome sequencing in a cohort of 12 patients with prenatally diagnosed microlissencephaly, 2 foetal cases with missense mutations in the ACTG1 gene and in one case of living patient with typical Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Both foetuses and child exhibited microcephaly and facial dysmorphism consisting of microretrognatism, hypertelorism and low-set ears. Brain malformations included lissencephaly with an immature cortical plate, dysmorphic (2/3) or absent corpus callosum and vermian hypoplasia (2/3). Our results highlight the powerful diagnostic value of exome sequencing for patients with microlissencephaly, that may expand the malformation spectrum of ACTG1-related Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome and may suggest that ACTG1 could be added to the list of genes for assessing microlissencephaly.

In our previous work, we demonstrated that propofol causes widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in 7-postnatal-day-old (PND7) but not in PND14 rat neurons. The mechanism responsible for these opposing outcomes is unknown, apparently linked to the specific stage of brain development. The present study aims to elucidate the anti-apoptotic process that is activated in the cortex and thalamus of PND14 Wistar rats during the first 48 h after the onset of propofol anesthesia. We showed that the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and several components of its pathway, TNFR1 and caspase-8, was significantly increased in the cortex and thalamus. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 was downregulated in the cortex and upregulated in the thalamus. The expression of c-Fos was upregulated only in the cortex, showing opposed profile compared to NF-kappa B p65. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed the colocalization of NF-kappa B p65 with neuronal marker (NeuN), but with predominantly cytoplasmic localization. Finally, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was upregulated in both examined structures. Immunohistochemical staining with Iba-1 revealed that the treatment did not induce changes in microglial morphology.

The most notable change in this 5th edition is the addition of new recommendations for the use of endovascular therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke and proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. This includes an overview of the infrastructure and resources required for stroke centers that will provide endovascular therapy as well as regional structures needed to ensure that all patients with acute ischemic stroke that are eligible for endovascular therapy will be able to access this newly approved therapy; recommendations for hyperacute brain and enhanced vascular imaging using computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion; patient selection criteria based on the five trials of endovascular therapy published in early 2015, and performance metric targets for important time-points involved in endovascular therapy, including computed tomography-to-groin puncture and computed tomography-to-reperfusion times. Other updates in this guideline include recommendations for improved time efficiencies for all aspects of hyperacute stroke care with a movement toward a new median target door-to-needle time of 30min, with the 90th percentile being 60min. A stronger emphasis is placed on increasing public awareness of stroke with the recent launch of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada FAST signs of stroke campaign; reinforcing the public need to seek immediate medical attention by calling 911; further engagement of paramedics in the prehospital phase with prehospital notification to the receiving emergency department, as well as the stroke team, including neuroradiology; updates to the triage and same-day assessment of patients with transient ischemic attack; updates to blood pressure recommendations for the hyperacute phase of care for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The goal of these recommendations and supporting materials is to improve efficiencies and minimize the absolute time lapse between stroke symptom onset and reperfusion therapy, which in turn leads to better outcomes and potentially shorter recovery times.

Human Parechovirus 3 Meningitis and Fatal Leukoencephalopathy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							RT-PCR; ENTEROVIRUS INFECTION; ENCEPHALITIS; TIME; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ECHOVIRUSES; MYOCARDITIS; CHILDREN; INFANTS; DISEASE	Human parechovirus 3 (HPeV3) is a picornavirus associated with neurologic disease in neonates. Human parechovirus 3 infection of preterm and term infants is associated with seizures and destructive periventricular white matter lesions. Despite unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), HPeV3 RNA can be amplified from CSF and nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs. We report pathologic findings in 2 autopsy cases of infants with active HPeV3 infection. Both children were born approximately 1 month premature and were neurologically intact but, after a few weeks, developed seizures and radiologic evidence of white matter lesions. Neuropathologic examination demonstrated classic severe periventricular leukomalacia in the absence of an immune response. Human parechovirus 3 sequences were identified in RNA extracted from CSF, sera, and tissues. Human parechovirus 3 in situ hybridization detection of infected cells was limited to meninges and associated blood vessels in addition to smooth muscle of pulmonary vessels. Ultrastructural evaluation of meninges demonstrated dense core structures compatible with picornavirus virions. These findings suggest that encephalopathic changes are secondary to infection of meninges and potential compromise of vascular perfusion. Thus, parechovirus infection of vascular smooth muscle may be a more general pathogenic process.

IMAGEN Consortium	Genomic architecture of human neuroanatomical diversity	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							WIDE ASSOCIATION; COMMON SNPS; INTRACRANIAL VOLUME; GENETIC-VARIATION; COMPLEX TRAITS; VARIANTS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HERITABILITY; HIPPOCAMPAL; PERSPECTIVE	Human brain anatomy is strikingly diverse and highly inheritable: genetic factors may explain up to 80% of its variability. Prior studies have tried to detect genetic variants with a large effect on neuroanatomical diversity, but those currently identified account for <5% of the variance. Here, based on our analyses of neuroimaging and whole-genome genotyping data from 1765 subjects, we show that up to 54% of this heritability is captured by large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of small-effect spread throughout the genome, especially within genes and close regulatory regions. The genetic bases of neuroanatomical diversity appear to be relatively independent of those of body size (height), but shared with those of verbal intelligence scores. The study of this genomic architecture should help us better understand brain evolution and disease.

J	Fakhoury, M				Fakhoury, Marc			Spinal cord injury: overview of experimental approaches used to restore locomotor activity	REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						axon regeneration; locomotor training; pharmacological treatment; rehabilitation; spinal cord injury	OLFACTORY ENSHEATHING GLIA; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; SCHWANN-CELL; INTRATHECAL BACLOFEN; EPIDURAL STIMULATION; CORTICOSPINAL TRACT; CONTUSION INJURY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOTOR RECOVERY; GROWTH-FACTOR	Spinal cord injury affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide and can lead to paraplegia and quadriplegia. Anatomical discontinuity in the spinal cord results in disruption of the impulse conduction that causes temporary or permanent changes in the cord's normal functions. Although axonal regeneration is limited, damage to the spinal cord is often accompanied by spontaneous plasticity and axon regeneration that help improve sensory and motor skills. The recovery process depends mainly on synaptic plasticity in the preexisting circuits and on the formation of new pathways through collateral sprouting into neighboring denervated territories. However, spontaneous recovery after spinal cord injury can go on for several years, and the degree of recovery is very limited. Therefore, the development of new approaches that could accelerate the gain of motor function is of high priority to patients with damaged spinal cord. Although there are no fully restorative treatments for spinal injury, various rehabilitative approaches have been tested in animal models and have reached clinical trials. In this paper, a closer look will be given at the potential therapies that could facilitate axonal regeneration and improve locomotor recovery after injury to the spinal cord. This article highlights the application of several interventions including locomotor training, molecular and cellular treatments, and spinal cord stimulation in the field of rehabilitation research. Studies investigating therapeutic approaches in both animal models and individuals with injured spinal cords will be presented.

At present, little is known about the occurrence of residual NMB in Canada. The RECITE (Residual Curarization and its Incidence at Tracheal Extubation) study was a prospective observational study at 8 hospitals in Canada investigating the incidence and severity of residual NMB. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing open or laparoscopic abdominal surgery expected to last <4 hours, ASA physical status I-III, and scheduled for general anesthesia with at least 1 dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent for endotracheal intubation or maintenance of neuromuscular relaxation were enrolled in the study. Neuromuscular function was assessed using acceleromyography with the TOF-Watch (R) SX. All reported TOF ratios were normalized to the baseline values. The attending anesthesiologist and all other observers were blinded to the TOF ratio (T4/T1) results. The primary and secondary objectives were to determine the incidence and severity of residual NMB (TOF ratio <0.9) just before tracheal extubation and at arrival at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). RESULTS: Three hundred and two participants were enrolled. Data were available for 241 patients at tracheal extubation and for 207 patients at PACU arrival. Rocuronium was the NMB agent used in 99% of cases. Neostigmine was used for reversal of NMB in 73.9% and 72.0% of patients with TE and PACU data, respectively. The incidence of residual NMB was 63.5% (95% confidence interval, 57.4%-69.6%) at tracheal extubation and 56.5% (95% confidence interval, 49.8%-63.3%) at arrival at the PACU. In an exploratory analysis, no statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of residual NMB according to gender, age, body mass index, ASA physical status, type of surgery, or comorbidities (all P > 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Residual paralysis is common at tracheal extubation and PACU arrival, despite qualitative neuromuscular monitoring and the use of neostigmine. More effective detection and management of NMB is needed to reduce the risks associated with residual NMB.

Salivary biomarkers of oxidative stress reflect local and systemic pathologies and may inform on the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic responsiveness of numerous human diseases. However, for many of the disorders investigated, data reporting on alterations in salivary reflux homeostasis are often highly conflicted across studies. We surveyed the available biomedical literature on this topic and noted significant discrepancies in the study designs, targets populations, and operating procedures which likely contribute to the discordant data sets reported. Based on these observations, guidelines are provided to minimize interlaboratory variability in reflux biomarker discovery based on human saliva. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We comprehensively assessed the relationships among age, hippocampal morphology, and hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in 137 healthy individuals across the adult lifespan (18-86 years of age). They underwent MRI, cognitive assessments and genotyping for Apolipoprotein E status. We measured hippocampal subfield volumes using a new multiatlas segmentation tool (MAGeT-Brain) and assessed vertex-wise (inward and outward displacements) and global surface-based descriptions of hippocampus morphology. We examined the effects of age on hippocampal morphology, as well as the relationship among age, hippocampal morphology, and episodic and working memory performance. Age and volume were modestly correlated across hippocampal subfields. Significant patterns of inward and outward displacement in hippocampal head and tail were associated with age. The first principal shape component of the left hippocampus, characterized by a lengthening of the antero-posterior axis was prominently associated with working memory performance across the adult lifespan. In contrast, no significant relationships were found among subfield volumes and cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate that hippocampal shape plays a unique and important role in hippocampal-dependent cognitive aging across the adult lifespan, meriting consideration as a biomarker in strategies targeting the delay of cognitive aging.

This variability has been exhaustively examined at the behavioral, neural and genetic level to uncover the mechanisms by which some individuals are more cognitively efficient than others. Studies investigating the neural underpinnings of interindividual differences in cognition aim to establish a reliable nexus between functional/structural properties of a given brain network and higher order cognitive performance. However, these studies have produced inconsistent results, which might be partly attributed to methodological variations. In the current study, 82 healthy young participants underwent MRI scanning and completed a comprehensive cognitive battery including measurements of fluid, crystallized, and spatial intelligence, along with working memory capacity/executive updating, controlled attention, and processing speed. The cognitive scores were obtained by confirmatory factor analyses. T-1-weighted images were processed using three different surface-based morphometry (SBM) pipelines, varying in their degree of user intervention, for obtaining measures of cortical thickness (CT) across the brain surface. Distribution and variability of CT and CT-cognition relationships were systematically compared across pipelines and between two cognitively/demographically matched samples to overcome potential sources of variability affecting the reproducibility of findings. We demonstrated that estimation of CT was not consistent across methods. In addition, among SBM methods, there was considerable variation in the spatial pattern of CT-cognition relationships. Finally, within each SBM method, results did not replicate in matched subsamples. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3227-3245, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recessive mutations in human NALCN cause intellectual disability (ID) with hypotonia. Here, we report a de novo heterozygous mutation in NALCN affecting a conserved residue (p.R1181Q) in a girl with ID, episodic and persistent ataxia, and arthrogryposis. Interestingly, her episodes of ataxia were abolished by the administration of acetazolamide, similar to the response observed in episodic ataxia associated with other ion channels. Introducing the analogous mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue nca-1 induced a coiling locomotion phenotype, identical to that obtained with previously characterized C. elegans gain-of-function nca alleles, suggesting that p.R1181Q confers the same property to NALCN. This observation thus suggests that dominant mutations in NALCN can cause a neurodevelopmental phenotype that overlaps with, while being mostly distinct from that associated with recessive mutations in the same gene.

Mutations causing NS alter genes encoding proteins involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway. We and others identified Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), which encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase acting as a tumor suppressor in myeloid malignancies, as a disease gene underlying a condition clinically related to NS. Here, we further explored the spectrum of germline CBL mutations and their associated phenotype. CBL mutation scanning performed on 349 affected subjects with features overlapping NS and no mutation in NS genes allowed the identification of five different variants with pathological significance. Among them, two splice-site changes, one in-frame deletion, and one missense mutation affected the RING domain and/or the adjacent linker region, overlapping cancer-associated defects. A novel nonsense mutation generating a v-Cbl-like protein able to enhance signal flow through RAS was also identified. Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis performed on available records indicated that germline CBL mutations cause a variable phenotype characterized by a relatively high frequency of neurological features, predisposition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and low prevalence of cardiac defects, reduced growth, and cryptorchidism. Finally, we excluded a major contribution of two additional members of the CBL family, CBLB and CBLC, to NS and related disorders.

Treating the target acceleration as a bounded disturbance, novel guidance law using model predictive control is developed by incorporating missile inside constraints. The combined model predictive approach could be transformed as a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, which may be solved using a linear variational inequality-based primal-dual neural network over a finite receding horizon. Online solutions to multiple parametric QP problems are used so that constrained optimal control decisions can be made in real time. Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed guidance control law for missile interception.

Lesions located on radiculo-pial arteries without involvement of the anterior spinal artery are even rarer. SPAVFs may present with mass effect, venous congestion or hemorrhage. Most often, treatment is performed either by surgery or endovascularly with fluid embolic material. Use of microcoils has not been reported for this condition. We present two cases of radiculo-pial high-flow SPAVFs in two patients in their early 30 s. One patient presented with abrupt headache without proof of hemorrhage and the other one with trigeminal neuralgia resulting from dilated posterior fossa draining veins remote from the fistula. Both patients were successfully treated with endovascular shunt closure using microcoils with resolution of symptoms and disappearance of the dilated veins at follow-up. With recent advances in microcatheter technology, distal navigation and microcoil embolization offers another option for these cases that may be safer than fluid embolic material.

T-2* maps have been used for studying cortical myelo-architecture patterns in vivo and for characterizing conditions associated with changes in iron and/or myelin concentration. MethodsT(2)* maps were calculated from 7T multi-echo T-2*-weighted images acquired during separate scanning sessions on 8 healthy subjects. The reproducibility of surface-based cortical T-2* mapping was assessed at different depths of the cortex; from pial surface (0% depth) towards gray/white matter boundary (100% depth), across cortical regions and hemispheres, using coefficients of variation (COVs=SD/mean) between each couple (scan-rescan) of average T-2* measurements. ResultsAverage cortical T-2* was significantly different among 25%, 50%, and 75% depths (analysis of variance, P<0.001). Coefficient of variations were very low within cortical regions, and whole cortex (average COV=0.83-1.79%), indicating a high degree of reproducibility in T-2* measures. ConclusionSurface-based mapping of T-2* relaxation rates as a function of cortical depth is reproducible and could prove useful for studying the laminar architecture of the cerebral cortex in vivo, and for investigating physiological and pathological states associated with changes in iron and/or myelin concentration.

Low grade astrocytomas represent 30-40 % of brain tumours in this age group. This study reviewed the incidence, characteristics, therapy, and outcome of children less than 36 months of age diagnosed with a low grade astrocytoma from 1990 to 2005 in Canada. A data bank was established using data collected from Canadian pediatric oncology centers on children less than age 3 diagnosed with brain tumors between 1990 and 2005. Cases of low grade astrocytoma were extracted from this data bank and their characteristics summarized. From the 579 cases in the data bank, 153 cases of low grade astrocytoma (26 %) were identified. The mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 13 weeks, and 53 % of patients underwent a greater than 90 % resection of their tumor, while 30 % underwent 10-90 % resection. Seventy-one percent of patients received no further therapy after surgery and of the 45 who received therapy following surgery, 43 received chemotherapy, and 5 received radiation therapy. Sixty-eight patients had recurrence or progression of their tumor. Eighty-seven percent of patients were alive at the time of the survey with a 2 year survival rate of 95.3 +/- A 1.8 %, 5 year survival rate of 93.1 +/- A 2.1 % and 10 year survival rate of 89.1 +/- A 2.8 %. The 5 year survival rate for Canadian children less than 36 months of age with a low grade astrocytoma was 93.0 +/- A 2.8 % which is similar to that for older children with this tumor.

However, the regulatory environment surrounding such uses of stimulation devices is less clear than for stimulant drugs-a fact that has already been commercially exploited by several companies. In this paper, the mechanism of action, uses and adverse effects of non-invasive neurostimulation devices are reviewed, along with social and ethical challenges pertaining to their use as cognitive enhancements. Two regulatory approaches that could be used to facilitate responsible use of these devices as products and services are outlined. Apart from establishing the urgently needed comprehensive regulatory framework, they might provide a starting point for establishing long term physiological and social effects of enhancement uses of tDCS and TMS.

Public discourse on the biology of addiction has been criticized for generating stigma and a diminished perception of self-control in individuals with an addiction, potentially contributing to coercive approaches and criminalization of women who misuse substances during pregnancy. We explored whether this is the case based on literature from social psychology, ethics, addiction research, science communication, and philosophy. The literature shows that the relationship between public discourse on biological aspects of addiction and issues such as stigma and perceptions of diminished self-control are unclear, largely due to the complexity of these phenomena. However, concerns about the biological approach are nevertheless legitimate given the broader social and policy context of women's health.

However, evidence shows that the regenerative capabilities of endogenous and transplanted NPCs are limited in the microenvironment of spinal cord injury (SCI). We previously demonstrated that injury-induced upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) restricts the survival, migration, integration, and differentiation of NPCs following SCI. CSPGs are long-lasting components of the astroglial scar that are formed around the lesion. Our recent in vivo studies demonstrated that removing CSPGs from the SCI environment enhances the potential of transplanted and endogenous adult NPCs for spinal cord repair; however, the mechanisms by which CSPGs regulate NPCs remain unclear. In this study, using in vitro models recapitulating the extracellular matrix of SCI, we investigated the direct role of CSPGs in modulating the properties of adult spinal cord NPCs. We show that CSPGs significantly decrease NPCs growth, attachment, survival, proliferation, and oligodendrocytes differentiation. Moreover, using genetic models, we show that CSPGs regulate NPCs by signaling on receptor protein tyrosine phosphate sigma (RPTP sigma) and leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase (LAR). Intracellularly, CSPGs inhibitory effects are mediated through Rho/ROCK pathway and inhibition of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Downregulation of RPTP sigma and LAR and blockade of ROCK in NPCs attenuates the inhibitory effects of CSPGS. Our work provide novel evidence uncovering how upregulation of CSPGs challenges the response of NPCs in their post-SCI niche and identifies new therapeutic targets for enhancing NPC-based therapies for SCI repair.

Remyelination does occur, but is limited especially in chronic disease stages. Despite effective immunomodulatory therapies that reduce the number of relapses the progressive disease phase cannot be prevented. Therefore, promotion of neuroprotective and repair mechanisms, such as remyelination, represents an attractive additional treatment strategy. A number of pathways have been identified that may contribute to impaired remyelination in MS lesions, among them the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Here, we demonstrate that indometacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been also shown to modulate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer cells promotes differentiation of primary human and murine oligodendrocytes, myelination of cerebellar slice cultures and remyelination in cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our in vitro experiments using GSK3 beta inhibitors, luciferase reporter assays and oligodendrocytes expressing a mutant, dominant stable beta-catenin indicate that the mechanism of action of indometacin depends on GSK3 beta activity and beta-catenin phosphorylation. Indometacin might represent a promising treatment option to enhance endogenous remyelination in MS patients.

Ten children born preterm were assessed at 6 months and at school age, using visual evoked potentials at both time points and cognitive and behavioral tests at school age. We also tested 10 age-matched children born full-term. At 6 months' corrected age, we found no significant differences between preterm and full-term groups for either amplitude or latency of N1 and P1 components. At school age, the preterm group manifested significantly higher N1 amplitudes and tended to show higher P1 amplitudes than the full-term group. We found no significant differences in cognitive and behavioral measures at school age. These results suggest that preterm birth affects visual pathways development, yet the children born preterm did not manifest cognitive problems.

Methods: Healthy pigs were randomized into three groups (standard therapy (ST) alone, ST + No-cell device, ST + SRBAL device) before placement of an implantable intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor and a tunneled central venous catheter. One week later, pigs received bolus infusion of the hepatotoxin D-galactosamine and were followed for up to 90 h. Results: At 48 h, all animals had developed encephalopathy and biochemical changes confirming ALF; extracorporeal treatment was initiated and pigs were observed up to 90 h after drug infusion. Pigs treated with the SRBAL, loaded with porcine hepatocyte spheroids, had improved survival (83%, n = 6) compared to ST alone (0%, n = 6, p = 0.003) and No-cell device therapy (17%, n = 6, p = 0.02). Ammonia detoxification, peak levels of serum ammonia and peak ICP, and pig survival were influenced by hepatocyte cell dose, membrane pore size and duration of SRBAL treatment. Hepatocyte spheroids remained highly functional with no decline in mean oxygen consumption from initiation to completion of treatment. Conclusions: The SRBAL improved survival in an allogeneic model of drug-overdose ALF.

Its peculiar transduction mechanism together with its implication in tissue patterning, neural stem cell biology, and neural tissue homeostasis make Hedgehog pathway of interest in a high number of normal or pathological contexts. Consistent with its role during brain development, misregulation of Hedgehog signaling is associated with congenital diseases and tumorigenic processes while its recruitment in damaged neural tissue may be part of the repairing process. This review focuses on the most recent data regarding the Hedgehog pathway in the developing and adult central nervous system and also its relevance as a therapeutic target in brain and spinal cord diseases.

The goal of this study was to evaluate a multiplexed MS-based approach for the qualification of candidate Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers using CSF samples from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. Experimental design: Reproducibility of sample processing, analytic variability, and ability to detect a variety of analytes of interest were thoroughly investigated. Multiple approaches to statistical analyses assessed whether panel analytes were associated with baseline pathology (mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD) versus healthy controls or associated with progression for MCI patients, and included (i) univariate association analyses, (ii) univariate prediction models, (iii) exploratory multivariate analyses, and (iv) supervised multivariate analysis. Results: A robust targetedMS-based approach for the qualification of candidate AD biomarkers was developed. The results identified several peptides with potential diagnostic or predictive utility, with the most significant differences observed for the following peptides for differentiating (including peptides from hemoglobin A, hemoglobin B, and superoxide dismutase) or predicting (including peptides from neuronal pentraxin-2, neurosecretory protein VGF (VGF), and secretogranin-2) progression versus nonprogression from MCI to AD. Conclusions and clinical relevance: These data provide potential insights into the biology of CSF in AD and MCI progression and provide a novel tool for AD researchers and clinicians working to improve diagnostic accuracy, evaluation of treatment efficacy, and early diagnosis.

IMAGEN Consortium	Resilience and corpus callosum microstructure in adolescence	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Adolescence; corpus callosum; DAWBA; DTI; NEO-FFI; resilience; tractography	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; WHITE-MATTER INTEGRITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; DIFFUSION; BRAIN; PERSONALITY; CORTEX; SAMPLE; ABUSE; MRI	Background. Resilience is the capacity of individuals to resist mental disorders despite exposure to stress. Little is known about its neural underpinnings. The putative variation of white-matter microstructure with resilience in adolescence, a critical period for brain maturation and onset of high-prevalence mental disorders, has not been assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) though, has been reported in the corpus callosum (CC), the brain's largest white-matter structure, in psychiatric and stress-related conditions. We hypothesized that higher FA in the CC would characterize stress-resilient adolescents. Method. Three groups of adolescents recruited from the community were compared: resilient with low risk of mental disorder despite high exposure to lifetime stress (n = 55), at-risk of mental disorder exposed to the same level of stress (n = 68), and controls (n = 123). Personality was assessed by the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Voxelwise statistics of DTI values in CC were obtained using tract-based spatial statistics. Regional projections were identified by probabilistic tractography. Results. Higher FA values were detected in the anterior CC of resilient compared to both non-resilient and control adolescents. FA values varied according to resilience capacity. Seed regional changes in anterior CC projected onto anterior cingulate and frontal cortex. Neuroticism and three other NEO-FFI factor scores differentiated non-resilient participants from the other two groups. Conclusion. High FA was detected in resilient adolescents in an anterior CC region projecting to frontal areas subserving cognitive resources. Psychiatric risk was associated with personality characteristics. Resilience in adolescence may be related to white-matter microstructure.	[Galinowski, A.; Miranda, R.; Lemaitre, H.; Martinot, M. -L.

Elucidating a Goal-Setting Continuum in Brain Injury Rehabilitation	QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH			English	Article						brain injury; Canada; goal setting; grounded theory; health care; culture of; qualitative; rehabilitation	CLIENT-CENTERED APPROACH; OCCUPATIONAL-THERAPY; SELF-REGULATION; STROKE; PERSPECTIVES; ACHIEVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; ATTAINMENT; DESIGN; ADULTS	For individuals with brain injury, active participation in goal setting is associated with better rehabilitation outcomes. However, clinicians report difficulty engaging these clients in goal setting due to perceived or real deficits (e.g., lack of awareness). We conducted a study using grounded theory methods to understand how clinicians from occupational therapy facilitate client engagement and manage challenges inherent in goal setting with this population. Through constant comparative analysis, a goal-setting continuum emerged. At one end of the continuum, therapists embrace client-determined goals and enable clients to decide their own goals. At the other, therapists accept preset organization-determined goals (e.g., the goal is discharge) and pay little attention to client input. Although all participants aspired to embrace client-determined goal setting, most felt powerless to do so within perceived organizational constraints. Views of advocacy and empowerment help to explain our findings and inform more inclusive practice.

Inter-expert and intra-expert reliability in sleep spindle scoring	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep spindles; Agreement; Reliability; Inter-rater; Inter-expert; Intra-rater; Intra-expert; Electroencephalography; Polysomnography; Event detection; Sleep staging; Sleep scoring	SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; NOCTURNAL SLEEP; K-COMPLEX; REM-SLEEP; EEG; DENSITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; AGREEMENT	Objectives: To measure the inter-expert and intra-expert agreement in sleep spindle scoring, and to quantify how many experts are needed to build a reliable dataset of sleep spindle scorings. Methods: The EEG dataset was comprised of 400 randomly selected 115 s segments of stage 2 sleep from 110 sleeping subjects in the general population (57 +/- 8, range: 42-72 years). To assess expert agreement, a total of 24 Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (RPSGTs) scored spindles in a subset of the EEG dataset at a single electrode location (C3-M2). Intra-expert and inter-expert agreements were calculated as F-1-scores, Cohen's kappa (kappa), and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: We found an average intra-expert F-1-score agreement of 72 +/- 7% (kappa: 0.66 +/- 0.07). The average inter-expert agreement was 61 +/- 6% (kappa: 0.52 +/- 0.07). Amplitude and frequency of discrete spindles were calculated with higher reliability than the estimation of spindle duration. Reliability of sleep spindle scoring can be improved by using qualitative confidence scores, rather than a dichotomous yes/no scoring system. Conclusions: We estimate that 2-3 experts are needed to build a spindle scoring dataset with 'substantial' reliability (kappa: 0.61-0.8), and 4 or more experts are needed to build a dataset with 'almost perfect' reliability (kappa: 0.81-1). Significance: Spindle scoring is a critical part of sleep staging, and spindles are believed to play an important role in development, aging, and diseases of the nervous system.

In psychosis, cognitive insight may depend on hippocampal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortical (VLPFC) structure, and verbal memory and executive functions. We explored whether similar relations exist in non-clinical participants. Fifty-one non-clinical subjects completed the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale. Hippocampal volumes and VLPFC thickness were examined using FreeSurfer, and verbal memory and reasoning and problem solving was examined in a subset of the sample (n = 27). Significant correlations emerged between Self-Certainty and left VLPFC thickness, but not Self-Reflectiveness and VLPFC, or either cognitive insight measure and hippocampal volumes. Neither Self-Reflectiveness nor Self-Certainty correlated with neurocognitive functioning. These results provide a framework of mechanisms underlying cognitive insight in non-clinical samples, and allow evaluation of how these process may become dysfunctional in psychosis.

This study aimed to model longitudinal reciprocal associations between social competence (SOC) and language (LANG) pathways in young children with ASD. MethodsData were obtained from 365 participants aged 2-4years who had recently been diagnosed with an ASD and who were followed over three time points: baseline (time of diagnosis), 6- and 12months later. Using structural equation modeling, a cross-lagged reciprocal effects model was developed that incorporated auto-regressive (stability) paths for SOC (using the Socialization subscale of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2) and LANG (using the Preschool Language Scale-4 Auditory Comprehension subscale). Cross-domain associations included within-time correlations and lagged associations. ResultsSOC and LANG were highly stable over 12months. Small reciprocal cross-lagged associations were found across most time points and within-time correlations decreased over time. There were no differences in strength of cross-lagged associations between SOC-LANG and LANG-SOC across time points. Few differences were found between subgroups of children with ASD with and without cognitive impairment. ConclusionsLongitudinal reciprocal cross-domain associations between social competence and language were small in this sample of young children with ASD. Instead, a pattern emerged to suggest that the two domains were strongly associated around time of diagnosis in preschoolers with ASD, and then appeared to become more independent over the ensuing 12months.

One characteristic of bimanual movements is inter-limb coupling. It is the property of motor performance harmonization between hands during a bimanual task. The objective of this study was to identify whether spatial and temporal inter-limb coupling occurred in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients. Twenty-three PD patients and 15 healthy controls were tested. Data from 12 choreic HD patients were also taken from a databank. Participants were asked to perform a unimanual and bimanual rapid repetitive diadochokinesis task. The difference between hands in mean amplitude and mean duration of cycles was computed in the unimanual and bimanual tasks for each group. Results show that healthy controls exhibited temporal and spatial inter-limb coupling during the bimanual diadochokinesis task. Conversely, PD and HD patients exhibited temporal inter-limb coupling; but failed to exhibit spatial inter-limb coupling during the bimanual diadochokinesis task. Furthermore, HD patients exhibited reduced levels of structural coupling compared to controls and PD patients. These results suggest that alterations in basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical networks due to PD and HD do not affect temporal interlimb coupling. However, common pathophysiological changes related to PD and HD may cause altered spatial inter-limb coupling during a rapid repetitive bimanual diadochokinesis task.

MethodsA randomized, community-based, cross-sectional study was performed on 10,160 inhabitants 40 years old in mainland China, via a stratified sampling approach. A questionnaire, including socio-demographics, lifestyle factors and medical history, was completed. Nocturia was defined as a threshold of two or more voids per night. Differences in prevalence between age and gender groups were ascertained by the chi-squared test. Gender-related factors were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ResultsData on 9,637 (94.9%) people aged 59.69.7 years qualified for final statistical analysis. The overall prevalence of nocturia was 31.7% (3,053/9,637), and this increased with age (P<0.001). Nocturia was significantly associated with cardiovascular disease and overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) (P<0.05), while sporting activities were protective (P<0.001). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was significantly correlated with nocturia in men (P<0.05), whereas hypertension was correlated with nocturia in women (P<0.05). No correlation was found between nocturia and education level, occupation, civil status, tea consumption, body mass index (BMI), female birth history, and International Prostate Symptom Score. ConclusionsIn Chinese people aged 40 years, nocturia is associated with aging, OABSS, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and DM. Sporting activities are negatively associated with nocturia.

J	Caruso, VC; Balaban, E				Caruso, Valeria C.; Balaban, Evan			Auditory Perceptual Category Formation Does Not Require Perceptual Warping	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; DISCRIMINATION; SELECTIVITY; PLASTICITY; CORTEX; SOUND	Categorical perception occurs when a perceiver's stimulus classifications affect their ability to make fine perceptual discriminations and is the most intensively studied form of category learning. On the basis of categorical perception studies, it has been proposed that category learning proceeds by the deformation of an initially homogeneous perceptual space (perceptual warping), so that stimuli within the same category are perceived as more similar to each other (more difficult to tell apart) than stimuli that are the same physical distance apart but that belong to different categories. Here, we present a significant counterexample in which robust category learning occurs without these differential perceptual space deformations. Two artificial categories were defined along the dimension of pitch for a perceptually unfamiliar, multidimensional class of sounds. A group of participants (selected on the basis of their listening abilities) were trained to sort sounds into these two arbitrary categories. Category formation, verified empirically, was accompanied by a heightened sensitivity along the entire pitch range, as indicated by changes in an EEG index of implicit perceptual distance (mismatch negativity), with no significant resemblance to the local perceptual deformations predicted by categorical perception. This demonstrates that robust categories can be initially formed within a continuous perceptual dimension without perceptual warping. We suggest that perceptual category formation is a flexible, multistage process sequentially combining different types of learning mechanisms rather than a single process with a universal set of behavioral and neural correlates.

Initially identified on histone proteins in the 1960s, lysine acetylation is now considered as an important form of post-translational modification that rivals phosphorylation. However, only about a dozen of human lysine acetyltransferases have been identified. Among them are MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein; a.k.a. MYST3 and KAT6A) and its paralog MORF (a.k.a. MYST4 and KAT6B). Although there is a distantly related protein in Drosophila and sea urchin, these two enzymes are vertebrate-specific. They form tetrameric complexes with BRPF1 (bromodomain- and PHD finger-containing protein 1) and two small non-catalytic sub-units. These two acetyltransferases and BRPF1 play key roles in various developmental processes; for example, they are important for development of hematopoietic and neural stem cells. The human KAT6A and KAT6B genes are recurrently mutated in leukemia, non-hematologic malignancies, and multiple developmental disorders displaying intellectual disability and various other abnormalities. In addition, the BRPF1 gene is mutated in childhood leukemia and adult medulloblastoma. Therefore, these two acetyltransferases and their partner BRPF1 are important in animal development and human disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is limited in vivo evidence on the normal thalamocortical development, especially in early life. In this study, we aimed to investigate the developmental patterns of the cerebral cortex, the thalamic substructures, and their connectivity with the cortex in the first few weeks of the postnatal brain. We hypothesized that there is developmental synchrony of the thalamus, its cortical projections, and corresponding target cortical structures. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and divided the thalamus into five substructures respectively connecting to the frontal, precentral, postcentral, temporal, and parietal and occipital cortex. T-2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure cortical thickness. We found age-related increases in cortical thickness of bilateral frontal cortex and left temporal cortex in the early postnatal brain. We also found that the development of the thalamic substructures was synchronized with that of their respective thalamocortical connectivity in the first few weeks of the postnatal life. In particular, the right thalamo-frontal substructure had the fastest growth in the early postnatal brain. Our study suggests that the distinct growth patterns of the thalamic substructures are in synchrony with those of the cortex in early life, which may be critical for the development of the cortical and subcortical functional specialization.

To predict possible adverse effects of pharmaceutical products on benthic biota, polychaetes Hediste diversicolor were exposed for 14-days to pharmaceutical-spiked sediments under laboratory conditions. Carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBP) and propranolol (PRO) at concentrations of 500 ng g(-1), 50 ng g(-1), 5 ng g(-1), 0.5 ng g(-1) and 0.05 ng g(-1), fluoxetine (FX) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) at concentrations of 100 ng g(-1), 10 ng g(-1), 1 ng g(-1), 0.1 ng g(-1) and 0.01 ng g(-1), including environmental concentrations (underlined), were spiked in marine sediment samples. After the exposure, cellular energy status (total lipids content - TLP; and mitochondrial electron transport activity - MET), metabolism of monoamines (monoamine oxidase activity - MAO) and inflammation properties (cyclooxygenase activity - COX) were observed in polychaetes. CBZ increased TLP content and MET activity, and decreased MAO activity in polychaetes. IBP did not interfere on the TLP level, but on the MET and MAO activities (environmental concentrations). FX did not cause changes in the energy status. Therefore, environmental concentration diminished MAO activity. EE2 did not affect the energy status, however, MAO activity was significantly lower in polychaetes exposed to environmental concentration. PRO increased TLP level in polychaetes, but not MET activity. MAO activity was significantly lower for polychaetes exposed to environmental concentration. Except FX, all pharmaceuticals showed anti-inflammatory properties confirmed by the decrease of COX activity. Pharmaceutical products affected H. diversicolor physiology and health. As a benthic top predator, adverse effects on sea-worms can potentially culminate in ecosystem perturbations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Maranho, L. A.; Martin-Diaz, M.

A scoping review of determinants for dengue mortality	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Dengue; Dengue mortality; Social determinants of health; Scoping review	HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; VIRUS-INFECTION; NEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; ENDEMIC AREA; HEALTH-CARE; PUERTO-RICO; EPIDEMIC; ADULTS; BRAZIL	Background: Dengue is a viral disease whose clinical spectrum ranges from unapparent to severe forms and fatal outcomes. Although dengue death is 99 % avoidable, every year around 20,000 deaths are estimated to occur in more than 100 countries. We consider that, along with biological factors, social determinants of health (SDHs) are related to dengue deaths as well. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to explore what has been written about the role of SDHs in dengue mortality. The inclusion criteria were that documents (grey or peer-reviewed) had to include information about dengue fatal cases in humans and be published between 1997 and 2013 and written in English, Spanish, Portuguese or French. The search was conducted using a set of key words related to dengue mortality in several electronic databases: PubMed, LILACS, COCHRANE, Scielo, Science Direct, WHOLIS, OpenGrey, OpenSingle and Google Scholar. Information on SDHs was categorized under individual, social and environmental, and health systems dimensions. A summative content analysis using QDA Miner was conducted to assess the frequency of information on SDHs and its contextual meaning in the reviewed literature. The role of each SDH in dengue mortality was assessed using content analysis results. Results: From a total of 971 documents retrieved, 78 met the criteria. Those documents were published in the Americas region (50.0 %), Asia (38.4 %), Europe (9.0 %) and Africa (2.6 %). The described SDHs related to dengue deaths included, in the individual dimension: age, ethnicity, education, type of infection and immunological status; and in the social dimension: poverty and care-seeking behavior. The health systems dimension included access, opportunity, and quality of care, as well as health staff knowledge. Ethnicity was considered a determinant that depends on cultural and socioeconomic conditions. Conclusions: Along with biological factors, there are several SDHs related to dengue mortality. However, only a few of these have been systematically analyzed, suggesting the need for more studies on this subject to inform the design and implementation of sustainable interventions to decrease dengue mortality. These findings nevertheless provide a better understanding of the non-biological factors involved in dengue mortality.

Neonicotinoids have been shown to increase acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in honey bees at sublethal doses. High AChE levels may therefore act as a biomarker of exposure to neonicotinoids. This two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1) control (>= 3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds), and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from control sites. These findings suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid seed coating particles during the planting season can alter bumble bee neuronal activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report in situ that bumble bees living in agricultural areas exhibit signs of neonicotinoid intoxication.

Although the results currently achievable with automatic sleep staging methods are promising, there is need for improvement, especially given the time-consuming and tedious nature of visual sleep scoring. New method: Here we propose a sleep staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. The performance of the method was evaluated using polysomnographic data from 15 subjects (electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EGG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings). The decision tree, or dendrogram, was obtained using a hierarchical clustering technique and a wide range of time and frequency-domain features were extracted. Feature selection was carried out using forward sequential selection and classification was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Results: The dendrogram-based SVM (DSVM) achieved mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.92, 0.74 and 0.88 respectively, compared to expert visual scoring. Restricting DSVM classification to data where both experts' scoring was consistent (76.73% of the data) led to a mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.94, 0.82 and 0.92 respectively. Comparison with existing methods: The DSVM framework outperforms classification with more standard multi-class "one-against-all" SVM and linear-discriminant analysis. Conclusion: The promising results of the proposed methodology suggest that it may be a valuable alternative to existing automatic methods and that it could accelerate visual scoring by providing a robust starting hypnogram that can be further fine-tuned by expert inspection.

J	Combrisson, E; Jerbi, K				Combrisson, Etienne; Jerbi, Karim			Exceeding chance level by chance: The caveat of theoretical chance levels in brain signal classification and statistical assessment of decoding accuracy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						k-Fold cross-validation; Small sample size; Classification; Multi-class decoding; Brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs); Machine learning; Binomial cumulative distribution; Classification significance; Decoding accuracy; MEG; ECoG; Intracranial EEG	MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS; COMPUTER-INTERFACE; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; MOVEMENT DIRECTION; PERMUTATION TESTS; CROSS-VALIDATION; HAND MOVEMENTS; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; CLASSIFYING EEG	Machine learning techniques are increasingly used in neuroscience to classify brain signals. Decoding performance is reflected by how much the classification results depart from the rate achieved by purely random classification. In a 2-class or 4-class classification problem, the chance levels are thus 50% or 25% respectively. However, such thresholds hold for an infinite number of data samples but not for small data sets. While this limitation is widely recognized in the machine learning field, it is unfortunately sometimes still overlooked or ignored in the emerging field of brain signal classification. Incidentally, this field is often faced with the difficulty of low sample size. In this study we demonstrate how applying signal classification to Gaussian random signals can yield decoding accuracies of up to 70% or higher in two-class decoding with small sample sets. Most importantly, we provide a thorough quantification of the severity and the parameters affecting this limitation using simulations in which we manipulate sample size, class number, cross-validation parameters (k-fold, leave-one-out and repetition number) and classifier type (Linear-Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machine). In addition to raising a red flag of caution, we illustrate the use of analytical and empirical solutions (binomial formula and permutation tests) that tackle the problem by providing statistical significance levels (p-values) for the decoding accuracy, taking sample size into account. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our simulations and statistical tests on real brain data by assessing noise-level classifications in Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) baseline recordings.

ATLAS Collaboration	Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks and decaying into in collisions at with the ATLAS detector	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; MASSLESS PARTICLES; BROKEN SYMMETRIES; HADRON COLLIDERS; MONTE-CARLO; LHC; PAIR; NLO; PROGRAM; LEPTONS	A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair, , is presented. The analysis uses 20.3 fb(-1) of pp collision data at , collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2012. The search is designed for the decay mode and uses events containing one or two electrons or muons. In order to improve the sensitivity of the search, events are categorised according to their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities. A neural network is used to discriminate between signal and background events, the latter being dominated by +jets production. In the single-lepton channel, variables calculated using a matrix element method are included as inputs to the neural network to improve discrimination of the irreducible background. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found and an observed (expected) limit of 3.4 (2.2) times the Standard Model cross section is obtained at 95 % confidence level. The ratio of the measured signal cross section to the Standard Model expectation is found to be assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 Gev.	[Jackson, P.; Lee, L.; Soni, N.; White, M.

Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) signals are split into oscillatory (spindles) and transient (K-complex) components. This decomposition is conveniently achieved by applying morphological component analysis (MCA) to a sparse representation of EEG segments obtained by the recently introduced discrete tunable 0-factor wavelet transform (TQVVT). Tuning the 0-factor provides a convenient and elegant tool to naturally decompose the signal into an oscillatory and a transient component. The actual detection step relies on thresholding (i) the transient component to reveal K-complexes and (ii) the time-frequency representation of the oscillatory component to identify sleep spindles. Optimal thresholds are derived from ROC-like curves (sensitivity vs. FDR) on training sets and the performance of the method is assessed on test data sets. We assessed the performance of our method using full-night sleep EEG data we collected from 14 participants. In comparison to visual scoring (Expert 1), the proposed method detected spindles with a sensitivity of 83.18% and false discovery rate (FDR) of 39%, while K-complexes were detected with a sensitivity of 81.57% and an FDR of 29.54%. Similar performances were obtained when using a second expert as benchmark. In addition, when the TQVVT and MCA steps were excluded from the pipeline the detection sensitivities dropped down to 70% for spindles and to 76.97% for K-complexes, while the FDR rose up to 43.62 and 49.09%, respectively. Finally, we also evaluated the performance of the proposed method on a set of publicly available sleep EEG recordings. Overall, the results we obtained suggest that the TQVVT-MCA method may be a valuable alternative to existing spindle and K-complex detection methods. Paths for improvements and further validations with large-scale standard open-access benchmarking data sets are discussed.

Here, we report that Ras suppressor 1 (Rsu1) affects ethanol consumption in flies and humans. Drosophila lacking Rsu1 show reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation. We show that Rsu1 is required in the adult nervous system for normal sensitivity and that it acts downstream of the integrin cell adhesion molecule and upstream of the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) GTPase to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. In an ethanol preference assay, global loss of Rsu1 causes high naive preference. In contrast, flies lacking Rsu1 only in the mushroom bodies of the brain show normal naive preference but then fail to acquire ethanol preference like normal flies. Rsu1 is, thus, required in distinct neurons tomodulate naive and acquired ethanol preference. In humans, we find that polymorphisms in RSU1 are associated with brain activation in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation in adolescents and alcohol consumption in both adolescents and adults. Together, these data suggest a conserved role for integrin/Rsu1/Rac1/actin signaling in modulating reward-related phenotypes, including ethanol consumption, across phyla.

Identification of rare protein disulfide isomerase gene variants in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients	GENE			English	Article						ER stress; Protein disulfide isomerase; PDIA1; ERp57; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; SELECTIVE ER STRESS; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; MISFOLDED PROTEINS; MUTATIONS; ASSOCIATION; ERP57; ALS; NEUROTOXICITY; PROTEOSTASIS	Disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis is a salient feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Upregulation of ER foldases of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family has been reported in ALS mouse models and spinal cord tissue and body fluids derived from sporadic ALS cases. Although in vitro studies suggest a neuroprotective role of PDIs in ALS, the possible contribution of genetic mutations of these ER foldases in the disease process remains unknown. Interestingly, intronic variants of the PDIA1 gene were recently reported as a risk factor for ALS. Here, we initially screened for mutations in two major PDI genes (PDIA1/P4HB and PDIA3/ERp57) in a US cohort of 96 familial and 96 sporadic ALS patients using direct DNA sequencing. Then, 463 familial and 445 sporadic ALS patients from two independent cohorts were also screened for mutations in these two genes using whole exome sequencing. A total of nine PDIA1 missense variants and seven PDIA3 missense variants were identified in 16 ALS patients. We have identified several novel and rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both genes that are enriched in ALS cases compared with a large group of control subjects showing a frequency of around 1% in ALS cases. The possible biological and structural impact of these ALS-linked PDI variants is also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Targeting B16 tumors in vivo with peptide-conjugated gold nanoparticles	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						gold nanoparticles; EPR effect; peptide targeting; melanoma; cancer	CYCLIC RGD PEPTIDE; COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION; QUANTUM DOTS; MYXOMA VIRUS; CANCER; THERAPY	This study examines the effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and peptide conjugation on the biodistribution of ultrasmall (2.7 nm) gold nanoparticles in mice bearing B16 melanoma allografts. Nanoparticles were delivered intravenously, and biodistribution was measured at specific timepoints by organ digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. All major organs were examined. Two peptides were tested: the cyclic RGD peptide (cRGD, which targets integrins); and a recently described peptide derived from the myxoma virus. We found the greatest specific tumor delivery using the myxoma peptide, with or without PEGylation. Un-PEGylated cRGD performed poorly, but PEGylated RGD showed a significant transient collection in the tumor. Liver and kidney were the primary targets of all constructs. None of the particles were able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Although it was able to deliver Au to B16 cells, the myxoma peptide did not show any cytotoxic activity against these cells, in contrast to previous reports. These results indicate that the effect of passive targeting by PEGylation and active targeting by peptides can be independent or combined, and that they should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis when designing new nanosystems for targeted therapies. Both myxoma peptide and cRGD should be considered for specific targeting to melanoma, but a thorough investigation of the cytotoxicity of the myxoma peptide to different cell lines remains to be performed.

The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in Alzheimer's disease, plays a role in synapse formation, and is upregulated in intellectual disabilities. Here, we show that during mouse synaptogenesis and in human FXS fibroblasts, a dual dysregulation of APP and the alpha-secretase ADAM10 leads to the production of an excess of soluble APP alpha (sAPP alpha). In FXS, sAPP alpha signals through the metabotropic receptor that, activating theMAP kinase pathway, leads to synaptic and behavioral deficits. Modulation of ADAM10 activity in FXS reduces sAPPa levels, restoring translational control, synaptic morphology, and behavioral plasticity. Thus, proper control of ADAM10-mediated APP processing during a specific developmental postnatal stage is crucial for healthy spine formation and function(s). Downregulation of ADAM10 activity at synapses may be an effective strategy for ameliorating FXS phenotypes.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						adults; childhood; mental health; pediatrics; repeated injuries; suicide; traumatic brain injury; youth	PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES; NORTHERN FINLAND; BIRTH COHORT; YOUNG-ADULTS; CHILDREN; POPULATION; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in late adolescence and adulthood is associated with a higher risk of suicide; however, it is unknown whether this association is also present in people who sustained a TBI during childhood. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether experiencing a TBI during childhood is a risk factor for suicide later in life and to examine whether the risk of suicide differs by sex or injury severity. A cohort of 135,703 children aged 0-17 years was identified from the Quebec population-based physician reimbursement database in 1987, and follow-up was conducted until 2008. Of the children in this cohort, 21,047 had sustained a TBI. Using a survival analysis with time-dependent indicators of TBI, we found a higher risk of suicide for people who sustained a TBI during childhood (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 2.14), adolescence (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.26), and adulthood (HR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.79, 3.59). When compared with less severe injuries, such as concussions and cranial fractures, more severe injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhages, were associated with a higher risk of suicide (HR = 2.18 vs. 2.77, respectively). Repeated injuries were associated with higher risks of suicide in all age groups.

The ethical problems as well as the technical difficulties associated with the currently employed analysis methods for marine toxins are encouraging the research for suitable alternatives to be applied in a regulatory monitoring regime. Here, we report an electrochemical biosensor platform for BTX-2 detection utilising aptamer as specific receptor. Using in vitro selection, high affinity DNA aptamers to BTX-2 were successfully selected for the first time from a large pool of random sequences. The binding of BTX-2 to aptamer pools/clones was monitored using fluorescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The aptamer BT10 exhibited the highest binding affinity to BTX-2, with a dissociation constant of 42 nM. The effects of the incubation time, pH and metal ions concentrations on the aptamer-toxin binding were studied. The aptamer BT10 was used to construct a label-free competitive impedimetric biosensor for BTX-2 achieving a detection limit of 106 pg/ml. We observed a high degree of cross reactivity of the selected aptamer to the two similar congeners, BTX-2 and -3, whereas no cross reactivity to other marine toxins was obtained. Moreover, the aptasensor was applied for the detection of BTX-2 in spiked shellfish extract showing a very high recovery percentage. We believe that the proposed aptasensor will facilitate the routine detection of BTX-2 in food samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we studied cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals and controls in mid-adolescence (mean age 15 years) and beginning of adulthood (mean age 20 years), as well as longitudinal changes between the two time points. Using univariate approaches, we showed both increases and decreases in cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals compared to controls. Specifically (1) very preterm born adolescents displayed extensive areas of greater cortical thickness, especially in occipitotemporal and prefrontal cortices, differences which decreased substantially by early adulthood; (2) at both time points, very preterm-born participants showed smaller cortical thickness, especially in parahippocampal and insular regions. We then employed a multivariate approach (support vector machine) to study spatially discriminating features between the two groups, which achieved a mean accuracy of 86.5%. The spatially distributed regions in which cortical thickness best discriminated between the groups (top 5%) included temporal, occipitotemporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Within these spatially distributed regions (top 1%), longitudinal changes in cortical thickness in left temporal pole, right occipitotemporal gyrus and left superior parietal lobe were significantly associated with scores on language-based tests of executive function.

Thirty five patients with SIVD and 35 healthy controls underwent high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging. The phase shift value of the bilateral hippocampus (HP), caudate nucleus (CN), globus pallidus (GP), putamen (PU), thalamus (TH), red nucleus (RN), substantia nigra (SN), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate (PCC), parietal cortex (PC) and frontal white matter (FWM) were examined and correlated with neuropsychological scores for SIVD patients. They exhibited significant increased phase shift values in the bilateral HP, CN, PU, right GP and left SN (P<0.05). Close correlations were found between the phase shift value of the left HP, right CN and neuropsychological scores. Our results suggest that brain iron deposition may be a biomarker of SIVD and play an important role in the pathophysiological mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dissociation of sensory facilitation and decision bias in statistical learning	VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article						Statistical learning; Diffusion Decision Model; sensory processing; prospective Memory	MONKEY INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; DIFFUSION-MODEL; NONADJACENT DEPENDENCIES; 8-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; VISUAL TRANSITIONS; NEURAL BASIS; IMPLICIT; REPRESENTATIONS; REGULARITIES; SEQUENCES	The detection of regularities in the sensory environment, known as statistical learning, is an important brain function that has been observed in many experimental contexts. In these experiments, statistical learning of patterned sensory stimulation leads to improvements in the speed and/or accuracy with which subsequent stimuli are recognized. That is, statistical learning facilitates the transformation of sensory stimuli into motor responses, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Statistical learning could improve the efficiency of sensory processing, or it could bias responses toward particular outcomes. The distinction is important, as these different hypotheses imply different functions and different neural substrates for statistical learning. Here we address this problem by studying statistical learning as a decision-making process, which allows us to leverage the extensive computational literature on this topic. Specifically we describe a method for applying the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM) to isolate different sensory and cognitive processes associated with decision-making. The results indicate that statistical learning improves performance on a visual learning task in two distinct ways: by altering the efficiency of sensory processing and by introducing biases in the decision-making process. By fitting the parameters of the DDM to data from individual subjects, we find that the prominence of these two factors differed substantially across the population, and that these differences were predictive of individual performance on the psychophysical task. Overall, these results indicate that different cognitive processes can be recruited by statistical learning, and that the DDM is a powerful framework for detecting these influences.

Identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these health issues is a major public health challenge. Based on recent findings, from studies conducted on animal models of obesity, it has been proposed that inflammatory processes may participate in both the peripheral and brain disorders associated with the obesity condition including the development of emotional and cognitive alterations. This is supported by the fact that obesity is characterized by peripheral low-grade inflammation, originating from increased adipose tissue mass and/or dysbiosis (changes in gut microbiota environment), both of which contribute to increased susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases. In this review, we provide converging evidence showing that obesity is associated with exacerbated neuroinflammation leading to dysfunction in vulnerable brain regions associated with mood regulation, learning, and memory such as the hippocampus. These findings give new insights to the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the development of brain disorders in the context of obesity and provide valuable data for introducing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neuropsychiatric complications often reported in obese patients.

Lead exposure induces changes in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine clusters in CpG islands in human embryonic stem cells and umbilical cord blood	EPIGENETICS			English	Article						clusters; CpG islands; HM450K; HMeDIP-450K; lead; umbilical cord blood; 5-hydroxymethylcytosine; 5-methylcytosine	DNA METHYLATION MICROARRAY; SILVER-RUSSELL-SYNDROME; GENE-EXPRESSION; QUANTILE NORMALIZATION; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; IMPRINTED GENE; DIFFERENTIATION; GLUTATHIONE; BRAIN; IDENTIFICATION	Prenatal exposure to neurotoxicants such as lead (Pb) may cause stable changes in the DNA methylation (5mC) profile of the fetal genome. However, few studies have examined its effect on the DNA de-methylation pathway, specifically the dynamic changes of the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) profile. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the relationship between Pb exposure and 5mC and 5hmC modifications during early development. To study the changes in the 5hmC profile, we use a novel modification of the Infinium HumanMethylation450 assay (Illumina, Inc.), which we named HMeDIP-450K assay, in an in vitro human embryonic stem cell model of Pb exposure. We model Pb exposure-associated 5hmC changes as clusters of correlated, adjacent CpG sites, which are co-responding to Pb. We further extend our study to look at Pb-dependent changes in high density 5hmC regions in umbilical cord blood DNA from 48 mother-infant pairs from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort. For our study, we randomly selected umbilical cord blood from 24 male and 24 female children from the 1st and 4th quartiles of Pb levels. Our data show that Pb-associated changes in the 5hmC and 5mC profiles can be divided into sex-dependent and sex-independent categories. Interestingly, differential 5mC sites are better markers of Pb-associated sex-dependent changes compared to differential 5hmC sites. In this study we identified several 5hmC and 5mC genomic loci, which we believe might have some potential as early biomarkers of prenatal Pb exposure.

The collective findings provide a gripping, albeit preliminary, account of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved in hypnotic phenomena. While substantial advances lend support to different hypotheses pertaining to hypnotic modulation of attention, control, and monitoring processes, the complex interactions among the many mediating variables largely hinder our ability to isolate robust commonalities across studies. The present account presents a critical integrative synthesis of neuroimaging studies targeting hypnosis as a function of suggestion. Specifically, hypnotic induction without task-specific suggestion is examined, as well as suggestions concerning sensation and perception, memory, and ideomotor response. The importance of carefully designed experiments is highlighted to better tease apart the neural correlates that subserve hypnotic phenomena. Moreover, converging findings intimate that hypnotic suggestions seem to induce specific neural patterns. These observations propose that suggestions may have the ability to target focal brain networks. Drawing on evidence spanning several technological modalities, neuroimaging studies of hypnosis pave the road to a more scientific understanding of a dramatic, yet largely evasive, domain of human behavior.

The roles of these variables are examined in the induction and suggestion stages of hypnosis, including how they are related to the experience of involuntariness, one of the hallmarks of hypnosis. It is suggested that studies of the modification of hypnotic suggestibility; cognitive flexibility; response sets and expectancies; the default-mode network; and the search for the neurophysiological correlates of hypnosis, more broadly, in conjunction with research on social psychological variables, hold much promise to further understanding of hypnosis.

Andrew			Activation of Phosphatidylinositol-Linked Dopamine Receptors Induces a Facilitation of Glutamate-Mediated Synaptic Transmission in the Lateral Entorhinal Cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; I ADENYLYL-CYCLASE; INOSITOL 1,4,5-TRISPHOSPHATE RECEPTOR; INTRACELLULAR CALCIUM-RELEASE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; RAT-BRAIN; LAYER-II; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL REGION; NEOSTRIATAL NEURONS	The lateral entorhinal cortex receives strong inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons that can modulate its sensory and mnemonic function. We have previously demonstrated that 1 mu M dopamine facilitates synaptic transmission in layer II entorhinal cortex cells via activation of D-1-like receptors, increased cAMP-PKA activity, and a resulting enhancement of AMPA-receptor mediated currents. The present study assessed the contribution of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked D-1 receptors to the dopaminergic facilitation of transmission in layer II of the rat entorhinal cortex, and the involvement of phospholipase C activity and release of calcium from internal stores. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of glutamate-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents were obtained from pyramidal and fan cells. Activation of D-1-like receptors using SKF38393, SKF83959, or 1 mu M dopamine induced a reversible facilitation of EPSCs which was abolished by loading cells with either the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 or the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. Neither the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, nor the L/N-type channel blocker cilnidipine, blocked the facilitation of synaptic currents. However, the facilitation was blocked by blocking Ca2+ release from internal stores via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptors or ryanodine receptors. Follow-up studies demonstrated that inhibiting CaMKII activity with KN-93 failed to block the facilitation, but that application of the protein kinase C inhibitor PKC(19-36) completely blocked the dopamine-induced facilitation. Overall, in addition to our previous report indicating a role for the cAMP-PKA pathway in dopamine-induced facilitation of synaptic transmission, we demonstrate here that the dopaminergic facilitation of synaptic responses in layer II entorhinal neurons also relies on a signaling cascade dependent on PI-linked D-1 receptors, PLC, release of Ca2+ from internal stores, and PKC activation which is likely dependent upon both DAG and enhanced intracellular Ca2+. These signaling pathways may collaborate to enhance sensory and mnemonic function in the entorhinal cortex during tonic release of dopamine.	[Glovaci, Iulia; Chapman, C.

H.			A Randomized Comparison Between Single- and Triple-Injection Subparaneural Popliteal Sciatic Nerve Block	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							LOCAL-ANESTHETIC SPREAD; PARANEURAL SHEATH; ULTRASOUND; BIFURCATION	Background and Objectives: This prospective randomized trial compared ultrasound-guided single-injection (SI) and triple-injection (TI) subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve block. We hypothesized that multiple injections are not required when local anesthetic (LA) is deposited under the paraneurium because the latter entraps LA molecules, ensuring circumferential spread around the nerve. Therefore, in addition to comparable success rates, we also expected similar total anesthesia-related times (sum of performance and onset times) and designed this study as an equivalency trial. Methods: Ultrasound-guided subparaneural posterior popliteal sciatic nerve block was carried out in 100 patients. In the SI group, LA was deposited at a single location between the tibial and peroneal nerves. In the TI group, LA was injected between the tibial and peroneal divisions, medial to the tibial nerve, and lateral to the common peroneal nerve. The total LA volume (15 mL) and mixture (lidocaine 1%-bupivacaine 0.25%-epinephrine 5 mu g/mL) were identical in all subjects. The performance time, number of needle passes, and adverse events (paresthesia, neural edema) were recorded by the (nonblinded) investigator supervising the block. A blinded observer evaluated the success rate (sensorimotor composite score >= 6/8 points at 30 minutes) as well as the onset time and contacted patients 7 days after the surgery to inquire about persistent numbness or motor deficit. Results: Both techniques provided comparable success rates (92%) and total anesthesia-related times (17.1-19.7 minutes). Expectedly, the SI group required fewer needle passes (1 vs 3; P < 0.001) and a shorter needling time (3.0 +/- 2.3 minutes vs 4.0 +/- 2.3 minutes; P = 0.025). The TI group displayed a shorter onset time (12.5 +/- 7.9 minutes vs 15.8 +/- 7.9 minutes; P = 0.027). The performance time, procedural discomfort, and incidence of paresthesia (14%-20%) were similar between the 2 groups. Sonographic neural swelling was detected in 2 subjects in the SI group. In both cases, the needle was carefully withdrawn and the injection was completed uneventfully. Follow-up of the 100 subjects 1 week after surgery revealed no residual numbness or motor deficit. Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided SI and TI subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve blocks result in comparable success rates and total anesthesia-related times.

Methods: All articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to May 2014), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature were searched. The strength of evidence was adjudicated by two independent reviewers, using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology. Results: Overall, 13 studies were identified, with 10 manuscripts and 3 meeting abstracts. A total of 40 patients were treated. The common target temperature was 33 degrees Celsius, sustained for a median 48 hours. Patients displayed a 62.5%, 15% and 22.5% rate of seizure cessation, seizure reduction, and failure of treatment respectively. External cooling was utilized in the majority of cases. Deep venous thrombosis, coagulopathy and infections were the commonly reported complications. Two ongoing clinical trials were identified. Conclusions: Oxford level 4, GRADE D evidence exists to support the use of therapeutic hypothermia to control seizures in RSE. Further prospective study is warranted.

Awake regional anesthesia (RA) may reduce the risk; however, the evidence is weak. The General Anesthesia compared to Spinal anesthesia study is a randomized, controlled trial designed to assess the influence of general anesthesia (GA) on neurodevelopment. A secondary aim is to compare rates of apnea after anesthesia. Methods: Infants aged 60 weeks or younger, postmenstrual age scheduled for inguinal herniorrhaphy, were randomized to RA or GA. Exclusion criteria included risk factors for adverse neurodevelopmental outcome and infants born less than 26 weeks gestation. The primary outcome of this analysis was any observed apnea up to 12 h postoperatively. Apnea assessment was unblinded. Results: Three hundred sixty-three patients were assigned to RA and 359 to GA. Overall, the incidence of apnea (0 to 12 h) was similar between arms (3% in RA and 4% in GA arms; odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.30, P = 0.2133); however, the incidence of early apnea (0 to 30 min) was lower in the RA arm (1 vs. 3%; OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.91; P = 0.0367). The incidence of late apnea (30 min to 12 h) was 2% in both RA and GA arms (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.41 to 3.33; P = 0.7688). The strongest predictor of apnea was prematurity (OR, 21.87; 95% CI, 4.38 to 109.24), and 96% of infants with apnea were premature. Conclusions: RA in infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy reduces apnea in the early postoperative period. Cardiorespiratory monitoring should be used for all ex-premature infants.

Gen Anesthesia Compared Spinal	Predictors of Failure of Awake Regional Anesthesia for Neonatal Hernia Repair Data from the General Anesthesia Compared to Spinal Anesthesia Study-Comparing Apnea and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							FORMERLY PREMATURE-INFANTS; PRETERM INFANTS; POSTOPERATIVE APNEA; RISK; CHILDREN; SURGERY; HERNIORRHAPHY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BUPIVACAINE; MORBIDITY	Background: Awake regional anesthesia (RA) is a viable alternative to general anesthesia (GA) for infants undergoing lower abdominal surgery. Benefits include lower incidence of postoperative apnea and avoidance of anesthetic agents that may increase neuroapoptosis and worsen neurocognitive outcomes. The General Anesthesia compared to Spinal anesthesia study compares neurodevelopmental outcomes after awake RA or GA in otherwise healthy infants. The aim of the study is to describe success and failure rates of RA and report factors associated with failure. Methods: This was a nested cohort study within a prospective, randomized, controlled, observer-blind, equivalence trial. Seven hundred twenty-two infants 60 weeks or less postmenstrual age scheduled for herniorrhaphy under anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive RA (spinal, caudal epidural, or combined spinal caudal anesthetic) or GA with sevoflurane. The data of 339 infants, where spinal or combined spinal caudal anesthetic was attempted, were analyzed. Possible predictors of failure were assessed including patient factors, technique, experience of site and anesthetist, and type of local anesthetic. Results: RA was sufficient for the completion of surgery in 83.2% of patients. Spinal anesthesia was successful in 86.9% of cases and combined spinal caudal anesthetic in 76.1%. Thirty-four patients required conversion to GA, and an additional 23 patients (6.8%) required brief sedation. Bloody tap on the first attempt at lumbar puncture was the only risk factor significantly associated with block failure (odds ratio = 2.46). Conclusions: The failure rate of spinal anesthesia was low. Variability in application of combined spinal caudal anesthetic limited attempts to compare the success of this technique to spinal alone.

JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS			English	Article							HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; WHOLE-BODY HYPOTHERMIA; SHOULDER DYSTOCIA; BRAIN-INJURY; TERM; POPULATION; NEWBORNS; ASSOCIATION; DELIVERIES; PREVALENCE	Objectives To determine the expected proportion of term cerebral palsy (CP) after neonatal encephalopathy (NE) that could theoretically be prevented by hypothermia and elucidate the perinatal factors associated with CP after NE in those who do not meet currently used clinical criteria required to qualify for hypothermia ("cooling criteria"). Study design Using the Canadian CP Registry, we categorized children born at >= 36 weeks with birth weight >= 1800 g with CP after moderate or severe NE according to the presence or absence of cooling criteria. Maternal, perinatal, postnatal, and placental factors were compared between the 2 groups. A number needed to treat of 8 (95% CI 6-17) to prevent one case of CP was used for calculations. Results Among the 543 term-born children with CP, 155 (29%) had moderate or severe NE. Sixty-four of 155 (41%) met cooling criteria and 91 of 155 (59%) did not. Shoulder dystocia was more common in those who did not meet cooling criteria (OR 8.8; 95% CI 1.1-71.4). Low birth weights (20% of all singletons), small placentas (42%), and chorioamnionitis (13%) were common in both groups. Conclusions The majority of children with CP after NE did not meet cooling criteria. An estimated 5.1% (95% CI 2.4%-6.9%) of term CP after NE may be theoretically prevented with hypothermia. Considering shoulder dystocia as an additional criterion may help recognize more neonates who could potentially benefit from cooling. In all cases, a better understanding of the antenatal processes underlying NE is essential in reducing the burden of CP.

They observed that individual types of engagement had not been studied in conjunction, and little information was available about interactions or synergy between the dimensions; consequently, more studies would contribute to creating finely tuned teaching interventions. Benefiting from the recent technological advances in neurosciences, this paper presents a recently developed methodology to gather and synchronize data on multidimensional engagement during learning tasks. The technique involves the collection of (a) electroencephalography, (b) electrodermal, (c) eye-tracking, and (d) facial emotion recognition data on four different computers. This led to synchronization issues for data collected from multiple sources. Post synchronization in specialized integration software gives researchers a better understanding of the dynamics between the multiple dimensions of engagement. For curriculum developers, these data could provide informed guidelines for achieving better instruction/learning efficiency. This technique also opens up possibilities in the field of brain-computer interactions, where adaptive learning or assessment environments could be developed.

A probing system was developed that allows for the injection of a drug while recording electrophysiological signals from the affected neuronal population. This method provides a simple and economical alternative to commercial solutions. A glass pipette was modified by combining it with a hypodermic needle and a silver filament. The injectrode is attached to commercial microsyringe pump for drug delivery. This results in a technique that provides real-time pharmacodynamics feedback through multi-unit extracellular signals originating from the site of drug delivery. As a proof of concept, we recorded neuronal activity from the superior colliculus elicited by flashes of light in rats, concomitantly with delivery of drugs through the injectrode. The injectrode recording capacity permits the functional characterization of the injection site favoring precise control over the localization of drug delivery. Application of this method also extends far beyond what is demonstrated here, as the choice of chemical substance loaded into the injectrode is vast, including tracing markers for anatomic experiments.

Seizure patterns with similar features are reproduced in animal models of partial seizures and epilepsy. However, the network determinants that support interictal spikes, as well as the initiation, progression, and termination of seizures, are still elusive. Recent findings show that inhibitory networks are prominently involved at the onset of these seizures, and that extracellular changes in potassium contribute to initiate and sustain seizure progression. The end of a partial seizure correlates with an increase in network synchronization, which possibly involves both excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms.

To Be(ta Cell) or Not to Be(ta cell): New Mouse Models for Studying Gene Function in the Pancreatic beta-Cell	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Editorial Material							CRE-RECOMBINASE; TRANSGENIC MICE; GROWTH-HORMONE; EXPRESSION; INSULIN; ISLETS; DRIVEN; BRAIN; LINES	A challenge in the pancreatic beta-cell field has been to identify a promoter fragment that is active only in the beta-cell compartment and inactive in other regions, such as the hypothalamic region of the brain. The presence of Cre recombinase alone in some models may also affect glucoregulation, confounding interpretation of gene function in the beta-cell. A paper presented within describes the development and characterization of 2 new transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the mouse insulin1 promoter that are useful for beta-cell-specific gene ablation: the first is constitutive and coexpresses DsRed (Ins1-Cre-DsRed); the second allows beta-cell-specific expression of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator, which can be used for drug-dependent expression of a target gene of interest for overexpression studies. These novel models show robust specificity and efficiency and will be valuable tools for functional studies of gene action in beta-cells, potentially alleviating current issues associated with previously available mouse lines.

Although brain imaging studies indicate that congenitally blind individuals recruit occipital areas when performing various non-visual and cognitive tasks, it remains unclear through which pathways this is accomplished. To address this question, we compared resting state functional connectivity in a group of congenital blind and matched sighted control subjects. We used a seed-based analysis with a priori specified regions-of-interest (ROls) within visual, somato-sensory, auditory and language areas. Between-group comparisons revealed increased functional connectivity within both the ventral and the dorsal visual streams in blind participants, whereas connectivity between the two streams was reduced. In addition, our data revealed stronger functional connectivity in blind participants between the visual ROls and areas implicated in language and tactile (Braille) processing such as the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and cerebellum. The observed group differences underscore the extent of the cross-modal reorganization in the brain and the supra-modal function of the occipital cortex in congenitally blind individuals.

Behavioral defeminization by prenatal androgen treatment in rats can be overcome by sexual experience in adulthood	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Organizational hypothesis; Estradiol sensitization; Testosterone; Androgen; Prenatal; Sexual behavior	RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; FEMALE RATS; VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS; DIMORPHIC NUCLEUS; TESTOSTERONE PROPIONATE; PROGESTERONE-RECEPTOR; DEVELOPING BRAIN; HISTONE MODIFICATIONS; ESTROGEN-SENSITIVITY	Exposure to testosterone during a critical period of prenatal development disrupts the normal display of sexual behaviors in adult ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with estradiol benzoate (EB) followed by progesterone (P). The organizational hypothesis posits that prenatally androgenized females (PNAFs) are desensitized to EB. We tested this hypothesis by first treating PNAFs with varying doses of EB (2.5, 5, 10, 20 mu g) followed by P (500 mu g), and second by subjecting females to an established EB behavioral sensitization paradigm where females are first given sexual experience with EB (10 mu g) and P prior to repeated sexual behavior testing with EB alone. Long-Evans females were androgenized in utero by a s.c. injection of 500 mu g testosterone propionate or the oil control to pregnant dams on gestational day 18. Female offspring were OVX on postnatal day 80 and tested one week later in the unilevel 4-hole pacing chamber. Genital tissue was defeminized in PHAFs, and the lordosis quotient (LQ) and partial (i.e., hops/darts) and full solicitations were significantly lower, while defensive behaviors were higher, in PNAF females, relative to non-PNAF females regardless of the acute EB priming dose. However, repeated testing with EB alone (10 mu g), or EB and P eliminated the differences between groups on LQ and hops/darts, indicating that the behavioral deficit can be overcome by sexual experience. These results suggest that PHAFs are not desensitized to EB, and despite disruptions in sexual differentiation of anatomical structures, the deficiency in sexual behavior in response to acute EB and P can be experientially overcome. PHAFs appear, however, to have a chronic deficit in the expression of full solicitations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Jones, S. L.; Cordeaux, E.; Germe, K.; Pfaus, J.

Awake craniotomy A patient's perspective	NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article							ANESTHESIA; EXPERIENCE; SATISFACTION; SEDATION; SURGERY; TUMOR	Objective: To report the personal experiences of patients undergoing awake craniotomy for brain tumor resection. Methods: We carried out a qualitative descriptive survey of patients' experiences with awake craniotomies for brain tumor resection. The survey was conducted through a standard questionnaire form after the patient was discharged from the hospital. Results: Of the 9 patients who met the inclusion criteria and underwent awake craniotomy, 3 of those patients reported no recollection of the operation. Five patients had auditory recollections from the operation. Two-thirds (6/9) reported that they did not perceive pain. Five patients remembered the head clamp fixation, and 2 of those patients classified the pain from the clamp as moderate. None of the patients reported that the surgery was more difficult than anticipated. Conclusion: Awake craniotomy for surgical resection of brain tumors was well tolerated by patients. Most patients reported that they do not recall feeling pain during the operation. However, we feel that further work and exploration are needed in order to achieve better control of pain and discomfort during these types of operations.

Mounting evidence implicates oxidative stress in the development of irreversible neuronal and glial injury in this condition. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a sulfhydryl amino acid derivative with antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties. Administration of NAC to mice attenuated the induction of or improved experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an MS model). Methods: We performed an open-label study to explore the tolerability and safety of the combination of glatiramer acetate (GA) and NAC in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis at the outpatient MS clinics of the Jewish General Hospital and Hopital Charles Lemoyne, Montreal, Canada. Seven patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with at least one T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesion on screening magnetic resonance imaging were recruited. Treatment consisted of a 10-week run-in period followed by 36-week treatment with a combination of GA 20 mg subcutaneously once daily plus NAC 2.5 g orally twice daily. Outcome measures included safety and tolerability, redox biochemistry, and magnetic resonance imaging effect. Results: Treatment with the combination of GA and NAC was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: In light of the favorable safety profile, an efficacy-demonstrating study may be considered.

We aimed to evaluate the influence of access to an integrate trauma system on in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS). Methods: All adults admitted to acute care hospitals for major trauma [International Classification of Diseases Injury Severity Score (ICISS < 0.85)] in a Canadian province with an integrated trauma system between 2006 and 2011 were included using an administrative hospital discharge database. The influence of access to an integrated trauma system on in-hospital mortality and LOS was assessed globally and for critically injured patients (ICISS < 0.75), according to the type of injury [traumatic brain injury (TBI), abdominal/thoracic, spine, orthopaedic] using logistic and linear multivariable regression models. Results: We identified 22,749 injury admissions. In-hospital mortality was 7% and median LOS was 9 days for all injuries. Overall, 92% of patients were treated within the trauma system. Globally, patients who did not have access had similar mortality and LOS compared to patients who had access. However, we observed a 62% reduction in mortality for critical abdominal/thoracic injuries (odds ratio = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.92) and an 8% increase in LOS for TBI patients (geometric mean ratio = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14) treated within the trauma system. Conclusions: Results provides evidence that in a health system with an integrated mature trauma system, access to specialised trauma care is high and the small proportion of patients treated outside the system, have similar mortality and LOS compared to patients treated within the system. This study suggests that the Quebec trauma system performs well in its mandate to offer appropriate treatment to victims of injury that require specialised care. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The management of oxidative stress being important to successful aging, we characterized this process in the aging LOU rat. Male/female LOU rats were euthanized at 4, 20, and 29 months. Macrodissected hippocampus, striatum, parietal cortex, cerebellum were assayed for tissue concentrations of glutathione (GSH), gamma-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (gamma-GCS), total thiols, protein carbonyls, mRNAs of clusterin and the known protective enzymes thioredoxine-1 (TRX-1), glutaredoxine-1 (GLRX-1), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1). Brain levels of GSH, gamma-GCS, total thiols remained constant with age, except for GSH and gamma-GCS which decreases in females. Clusterin, TRX-1, GLRX-1, SOD-1 mRNA levels were maintained or increased in the hippocampus with age. Age-dependency of the markers differed between sexes, with SOD-1 and TRX-1 decreases out of hippocampus in females. Since antioxidants were reported to decrease with age in the brain of Wistar rats, maintenance of GSH levels and of protective enzymes mRNA levels in the LOU rat brain could contribute to the preservation of cognitive functions in old age. Altogether, the successful aging of LOU rats may, at least in part, involve the conservation of functional antioxidant mechanisms in the brain, supporting the oxidative stress theory of aging.

Representations of Invariant Musical Categories Are Decodable by Pattern Analysis of Locally Distributed BOLD Responses in Superior Temporal and Intraparietal Sulci	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory categories; categorical perception; intraparietal sulcus; MVPA; superior temporal sulcus	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; AUDITORY-CORTEX; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION; REGIONS; ADAPTATION; INTERVALS	In categorical perception (CP), continuous physical signals are mapped to discrete perceptual bins: mental categories not found in the physical world. CP has been demonstrated across multiple sensory modalities and, in audition, for certain over-learned speech and musical sounds. The neural basis of auditory CP, however, remains ambiguous, including its robustness in nonspeech processes and the relative roles of left/right hemispheres; primary/nonprimary cortices; and ventral/dorsal perceptual processing streams. Here, highly trained musicians listened to 2-tone musical intervals, which they perceive categorically while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analyses were performed after grouping sounds by interval quality (determined by frequency ratio between tones) or pitch height (perceived noncategorically, frequency ratios remain constant). Distributed activity patterns in spheres of voxels were used to determine sound sample identities. For intervals, significant decoding accuracy was observed in the right superior temporal and left intraparietal sulci, with smaller peaks observed homologously in contralateral hemispheres. For pitch height, no significant decoding accuracy was observed, consistent with the non-CP of this dimension. These results suggest that similar mechanisms are operative for nonspeech categories as for speech; espouse roles for 2 segregated processing streams; and support hierarchical processing models for CP.

Methods: This is a retrospective cost-of-injury study of 128 patients admitted to the Montreal General Hospital (MGH) following a TBI that occurred while cycling between 2007-2011. Information was collected from Quebec Trauma Registry. The independent variables collected were socio-demographic, helmet status, clinical and neurological patient information. The dependent variables evaluated societal costs. Results: The median costs of hospitalization were significantly higher (p = 0.037) in the no helmet group ($7246.67 vs. $4328.17). No differences in costs were found for inpatient rehabilitation (p = 0.525), outpatient rehabilitation (p = 0.192), loss of productivity (p = 0.108) or death (p = 1.000). Overall, the differences in total societal costs between the helmet and no helmet group were not significantly different (p = 0.065). However, the median total costs for patients with isolated TBI in the non-helmet group ($22 232.82) was significantly higher (p = 0.045) compared to the helmet group ($13920.15). Conclusion: Cyclists sustaining TBIs who did not wear helmets in this study were found to cost society nearly double that of helmeted cyclists.

Among chief mechanisms of concussion recovery are alterations of neuronal plasticity. Olfactory function, often impaired following a concussion, greatly involves plasticity and, therefore, appears as a good candidate to study the deleterious effects of concussions. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (BDNFMet), which reduces availability of BDNF in the brain, has surprisingly been associated with better recovery following concussion. Objective: This study examines the mediating effect of BDNFMet on olfactory functions in asymptomatic concussed female athletes. Methods: Participants, 105 female university athletes, were divided into four groups based on their history of concussion (Concussion/No concussion) and BDNF polymorphism (BDNF Val66Val/Val66Met). Odour threshold, discrimination and identification were measured using the Sniffin' Sticks Inventory Test. Results: Concussed female BDNFMet athletes performed significantly better than BDNFVal counterparts on threshold (F(1, 34)=4.73, p<0.05), discrimination (F(1, 52)=5.36, p<0.05), identification tests (F(1, 521=5.65, p<0.05) and total olfactory scores (F(1, 34)=9.54, p<0.05). Conclusion: These results support a genotypic effect of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on long-term olfactory function following a concussion in young female athletes.

It is unclear, however, how much variance in intelligence other brain measurements would account for if included together with brain volume in a multivariable model. We examined a large sample of individuals in their seventies (n = 672) who were administered a comprehensive cognitive test battery. Using structural equation modelling, we related six common magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain variables that represent normal and abnormal features brain volume, cortical thickness, white matter structure, white matter hyperintensity load, iron deposits, and microbleeds-to g and to fluid intelligence. As expected, brain volume accounted for the largest portion of variance (similar to 12%, depending on modelling choices). Adding the additional variables, especially cortical thickness ( +similar to 5%) and white matter hyperintensity load (+similar to 2%), increased the predictive value of the model. Depending on modelling choices, all neuroimaging variables together accounted for 18-21% of the variance in intelligence. These results reveal which structural brain imaging measures relate to g over and above the largest contributor, total brain volume. They raise questions regarding which other neuroimaging measures might account for even more of the variance in intelligence. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Morphometric and molecular analyses of Tylodelphys sp metacercariae (Digenea: Diplostomidae) from the vitreous humour of four fish species from Lake Naivasha, Kenya	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY			English	Article							FRESH-WATER FISHES; ST-LAWRENCE-RIVER; LIFE-CYCLE; CLARIAS-GARIEPINUS; TREMATODE PARASITE; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; HOST-SPECIFICITY; RIFT-VALLEY; BIOLOGY; PLATYHELMINTHES	Even in the relatively well-characterized faunas of the developed world, it is difficult to discriminate species of metacercariae in the Diplostomidae using morphology, infection site or host use. The taxonomy, diversity and ecology of diplostomids infecting freshwater fishes in the African continent are particularly poorly known, but recent morphometric and genetic studies have revealed four species of diplostomids in the eyes and brains of siluriform fishes. In the present study, diplostomid metacercariae were collected from the eyes of 288 fish comprising two species within the Cyprinidae (Cyprinus carpio, n = 145, and Barbus paludinosus, n = 67), two Cichlidae (Oreochromis leucostictus, n = 56, and Tilapia zillii, n = 18) and one Centrarchidae (Micropterus salmoides, n = 2) caught in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. Morphometric (14 characters and 8 indices in 111 specimens) and molecular (sequences from the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene in 11 specimens) data were used to discriminate species. All fish species except B. paludinosus were infected with Tylodelphys metacercariae that were initially separated into two types differing mainly in body length. However, this morphological distinction received only intermediate support in quantitative morphological analysis and molecular data indicated that both morphotypes were conspecific. All the specimens therefore are inferred to belong to a single unidentified species of Tylodelphys, which is not conspecific with any other diplostomid for which comparable molecular data are available, including four diplostomid species known from siluriform fish in Nigeria and Tanzania.

Participants completed personality measures (SC, PS, neuroticism, conscientiousness) at baseline (Time 1), a chronic stress interview 6 months later (Time 2), and self-report and interviewer-rated depression measures at Time 1, Time 2, and 1 year after baseline (Time 3). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses of moderator effects demonstrated that patients with higher SC or PS and higher achievement-related chronic stress had higher levels of both self- and interviewer-rated depressive symptoms at Time 3 relative to those of other patients, adjusting for the effects of Time 1 and Time 2 depression scores. SC also interacted with interpersonal chronic stress to predict attenuated improvement in both self- and interviewer-rated depression at Time 3. The broader traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness did not interact with chronic stress to predict depression at Time 3. Our results highlight the importance of targeting perfectionists' dysfunctional characteristics (e.g., contingent self-worth, coping, interpersonal functioning) that perpetuate a chronic sense of hopelessness in the context of chronic stress in order to produce a better treatment response for these individuals.

The persistent influence of pediatric concussion on attention and cognitive control during flanker performance	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Child; Concussion; Brain function; Cognition	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; RESPONSE CONFLICT; HEAD-INJURIES; CHILDREN; TASK; SYSTEM; ERP; QUESTIONNAIRE	This study investigated the influence of concussion history on children's neurocognitive processing. Thirty-two children ages 8-10 years (16 with a concussion history, 16 controls) completed compatible and incompatible conditions of a flanker task while behavioral and neuroelectric data were collected. Relative to controls, children with a concussion history exhibited alterations in the sequential congruency effect, committed more omission errors, and exhibited decreased post-error accuracy. Children with a concussion history exhibited longer N2 latency across task conditions, increased N2 amplitude during the incompatible condition of the task, and decreased P3b amplitude across task conditions. Children with a history of concussion also exhibited decreased ERN and Pe amplitudes, with group difference increasing for the incompatible condition of the task. The current results indicate that pediatric concussion may lead to subtle, but pervasive deficits in attention and cognitive control. These results serve to inform a poorly understood but significant public health concern. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

However, there are no published studies examining the morphological development of this connective pathway in infants at-risk for the disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 270 infants at high familial risk for autism spectrum disorder and 108 low-risk controls at 6, 12 and 24 months of age, with 83% of infants contributing two or more data points. Fifty-seven children met criteria for ASD based on clinical-best estimate diagnosis at age 2 years. Corpora callosa were measured for area, length and thickness by automated segmentation. We found significantly increased corpus callosum area and thickness in children with autism spectrum disorder starting at 6 months of age. These differences were particularly robust in the anterior corpus callosum at the 6 and 12 month time points. Regression analysis indicated that radial diffusivity in this region, measured by diffusion tensor imaging, inversely predicted thickness. Measures of area and thickness in the first year of life were correlated with repetitive behaviours at age 2 years. In contrast to work from older children and adults, our findings suggest that the corpus callosum may be larger in infants who go on to develop autism spectrum disorder. This result was apparent with or without adjustment for total brain volume. Although we did not see a significant interaction between group and age, cross-sectional data indicated that area and thickness differences diminish by age 2 years. Regression data incorporating diffusion tensor imaging suggest that microstructural properties of callosal white matter, which includes myelination and axon composition, may explain group differences in morphology.

CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION			English	Article						Chronic pain; Health Canada; Off-label; Pharmacotherapy; Pregabalin	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; DOUBLE-BLIND; IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; ANXIETY DISORDERS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; PRIMARY-CARE; OPEN-LABEL	Background: Pregabalin is frequently prescribed for chronic non-cancer pain. No previous study has examined its off-label use. Objectives: Our primary aim was to assess the proportion of patients taking pregabalin for conditions approved by Health Canada ('on-label') and compare their perspectives on its use to those who use pregabalin for other conditions ('off-label'). Methods: Patients who have used pregabalin within the past year were recruited from two registries of chronic non-cancer pain patients treated in tertiary care clinics: the Quebec Pain Registry and the Fibromyalgia Patients Registry. Data on the use of pregabalin and its perceived benefits were collected from the registries and from completed questionnaires. Results: Out of 4339 screened chronic non-cancer pain patients, 355 (8.18%) met the study selection criteria. Three-quarters of them (268/355) used pregabalin for pain conditions not approved by Health Canada and were therefore regarded as off-label users. The most prevalent condition for pregabalin use was lumbar back pain (103/357; 28.85%). There were no significant differences between on- and off-label users in their perceived satisfaction from pregabalin therapy and its effect on function and quality of life. Among former users, the most prevalent reason for discontinuation was adverse effects, mainly dry mouth and weight gain. Conclusions: We conclude that despite specific indications for pregabalin prescription, it is mainly used off-label, notably for low back pain. Nevertheless, off-label users were equally satisfied with its clinical effects. Although formal exploration of the broader analgesic properties of pregabalin is warranted, treating heterogeneous chronic pain conditions with pregabalin may be legitimate. Limitations: The main limitations of the study are patients' low response rate, the recruitment of participants solely from a tertiary pain center and not from the general patient population and a possible recall bias that may have arisen from the retrospective nature of the study.

Here we report eight of these cases carrying recessive mutations in POLR1C, a gene encoding a shared POLR1 and POLR3 subunit, also mutated in some Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) cases. Using shotgun proteomics and ChIP sequencing, we demonstrate that leukodystrophy-causative mutations, but not TCS mutations, in POLR1C impair assembly and nuclear import of POLR3, but not POLR1, leading to decreased binding to POLR3 target genes. This study is the first to show that distinct mutations in a gene coding for a shared subunit of two RNA polymerases lead to selective modification of the enzymes' availability leading to two different clinical conditions and to shed some light on the pathophysiological mechanism of one of the most common hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, POLR3-related leukodystrophy.

Considering underlying causes as well as consequences, we conclude that the diagnosis of adult ADHD should be made cautiously, making use of multiple sources of information, including self-report, clinical interviews, collateral information, childhood documentation, and neuropsychological testing. Routine screening with symptom checklists is insufficient, and stimulant response is diagnostically uninformative. The causes of overdiagnosis may include changes in diagnostic thresholds, poor diagnostic practices, and advertising by the pharmaceutical industry. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, and dramatic increases in prescriptions for adult ADHD during the last decade should arouse concern.

The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been linked to more optimal interactive behaviors in mothers without mental illness, and it may play a particularly beneficial role in mothers with mood or anxiety disorders given its antidepressant and anxiolytic functions. We compared the relationship between OT and interactive behavior in mothers with and without mental health problems. Participants included 20 women diagnosed with postpartum mood or anxiety disorders (clinical sample) and 90 women with low levels of depression and anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum (community sample). At 2 months' postpartum, blood was drawn to assess maternal OT levels, and mother-infant interaction was coded for maternal sensitivity, intrusiveness, remoteness, and depressiveness. Clinical mothers exhibited less sensitive, more intrusive, and more depressive interactive behaviors than did community mothers. The groups did not differ in OT levels. Mothers with higher OT levels were less intrusive with their infants. Higher OT levels were associated with less depressive interactive behavior only in clinical mothers. OT was associated with positive interactive behaviors in both groups. In clinical mothers, the calming and soothing effects of OT may promote more relaxed, energetic, and infant-focused interactive behaviors.

At fast inhibitory synapses, strengthening is thought to occur by increasing the number of GABA(A) receptors (GABARs) of the same subunit composition to preexisting synapses. Here, we show that strengthening of mouse cerebellar granule cell GABAergic synapses occurs by a different mechanism. Specifically, we show that the neuropeptide hormone, insulin, strengthens inhibitory synapses by recruiting alpha 6-containing GABARs rather than accumulating more alpha 1-containing receptors that are resident to the synapse. Because alpha 6-receptors are targeted to functionally distinct postsynaptic sites from alpha 1-receptors, we conclude that only a subset of all inhibitory synapses are strengthened. Together with our recent findings on stellate cells, we propose a general mechanism by which mature inhibitory synapses are strengthened. In this scenario, alpha 1-GABARs resident to inhibitory synapses form the hardwiring of neuronal circuits with receptors of a different composition fulfilling a fundamental, but unappreciated, role in synapse strengthening.

We report here that a pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF)-dependent p75NTR signaling pathway plays a major role in excitability and persistent activity of pyramidal neurons in layer V of the EC. Using electrophysiological recordings, we show that proBDNF suppresses persistent firing in entorhinal slices from wild-type mice but not from p75NTR-null mice. Conversely, function-blocking proBDNF antibodies enhance excitability of pyramidal neurons and facilitate their persistent firing, and acute exposure to function-blocking p75NTR antibodies results in enhanced firing activity of pyramidal neurons. Genetic deletion of p75NTR specifically in neurons or during adulthood also induces enhanced excitability and persistent activity, indicating that the proBDNF-p75NTR signaling cascade functions within adult neurons to inhibit pyramidal activity. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-sensitive transient receptor potential canonical channels play a critical role in mediating persistent firing in the EC and we hypothesized that proBDNF-dependent p75NTR activation regulates PIP2 levels. Accordingly, proBDNF decreases cholinergic calcium responses in cortical neurons and affects carbachol-induced depletion of PIP2. Further, we show that the modulation of persistent firing by proBDNF relies on a p75NTR-Rac1-PI4K pathway. The hypothesis that proBDNF and p75NTR maintain network homeostasis in the adult CNS was tested in vivo and we report that p75NTR-null mice show improvements in working memory but also display an increased propensity for severe seizures. We propose that the proBDNF-p75NTR axis controls pyramidal neuron excitability and persistent activity to balance EC performance with the risk of runaway activity.

Physical Functioning and Opioid use in Patients with Neuropathic Pain	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						Neuropathic Pain; Opioid Therapy; Physical Functioning	CHRONIC NONCANCER PAIN; CHRONIC BACK-PAIN; DISABILITY INDEX; DETERMINANTS; LIFE	ObjectiveTo evaluate the association between opioid dosage and ongoing therapy with physical function and disability in patients with neuropathic pain (NeP). DesignSecondary analysis of a prospective cohort. SettingMulticenter clinical NeP registry. SubjectsSeven hundred eighty-nine patients treated for various NeP diagnoses. MethodsThe following measures were included: dependent variables. 12-month self-reported physical function (pain disability index [PDI] and medical outcomes study short form-12 physical function [PCSS-12]); independent variables: baseline opioid dose (none, 200mg and >200mg of morphine equivalent), ongoing opioid use; potential confounding variables: age, sex, baseline pain intensity, and psychological distress (profile of mood states). Analysis of covariance models was created to examine the relationship between opioid therapy and both physical functioning outcomes with adjustment for confounding. ResultsComplete data was available for 535 patients (68%). Compared with the lower and high dose opioid groups, NeP patients not taking opioids had statistically lower disability and higher physical functioning scores, after adjusting for disease severity. Compared with patients prescribed opioid therapy on an ongoing basis, NeP patients who were not prescribed had statistically lower disability and higher physical functioning scores, after adjusting for disease severity. Improvements in disability and physical functioning scores from baseline and 12-months in all groups were modest and may not be clinically significant. ConclusionsPhysical functioning and disability did not improve in patients with NeP who were prescribed opioids compared with those who are not prescribed, even after adjusting for disease severity.

Familial neonatal seizures in 36 families: Clinical and genetic features correlate with outcome	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Genetics; Ion channels; Neonatal seizures; Clinical neurology	POTASSIUM CHANNEL GENE; INFANTILE SEIZURES; EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; CENTROTEMPORAL SPIKES; MISSENSE MUTATION; KCNQ3 MUTATIONS; BENIGN; CONVULSIONS; EPILEPSIES; CHROMOSOME-20	ObjectiveWe evaluated seizure outcome in a large cohort of familial neonatal seizures (FNS), and examined phenotypic overlap with different molecular lesions. MethodsDetailed clinical data were collected from 36 families comprising two or more individuals with neonatal seizures. The seizure course and occurrence of seizures later in life were analyzed. Families were screened for KCNQ2, KCNQ3, SCN2A, and PRRT2 mutations, and linkage studies were performed in mutation-negative families to exclude known loci. ResultsThirty-three families fulfilled clinical criteria for benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE); 27 of these families had KCNQ2 mutations, one had a KCNQ3 mutation, and two had SCN2A mutations. Seizures persisting after age 6months were reported in 31% of individuals with KCNQ2 mutations; later seizures were associated with frequent neonatal seizures. Linkage mapping in two mutation-negative BFNE families excluded linkage to KCNQ2, KCNQ3, and SCN2A, but linkage to KCNQ2 could not be excluded in the third mutation-negative BFNE family. The three remaining families did not fulfill criteria of BFNE due to developmental delay or intellectual disability; a molecular lesion was identified in two; the other family remains unsolved. SignificanceMost families in our cohort of familial neonatal seizures fulfill criteria for BFNE; the molecular cause was identified in 91%. Most had KCNQ2 mutations, but two families had SCN2A mutations, which are normally associated with a mixed picture of neonatal and infantile onset seizures. Seizures later in life are more common in BFNE than previously reported and are associated with a greater number of seizures in the neonatal period. Linkage studies in two families excluded known loci, suggesting a further gene is involved in BFNE.

Herein, we provide a detailed description of the epileptic syndrome in the original family. MethodsA total of 34 members from a large French-Canadian family were evaluated. Family members with seizures or epilepsy underwent (when possible)clinical, neuropsychological, electrophysiologic, and neuroimaging assessments. ResultsEpilepsy was diagnosed in 10 family members (4 deceased, 6 living). In addition to occasional spontaneous complex partial seizures, seven family members clearly had reflex seizures triggered by bathing or showering. Hippocampal atrophy was found in two of five epileptic family members family members who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of three triggered seizures in two affected members showed rhythmic theta activity over temporal head regions. Ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed temporoinsular perfusion changes. Detailed neuropsychological assessments revealed that SYN1 Q555X male mutation carriers showed specific language impairment and mild autistic spectrum disorder. Female carriers also exhibited reading impairments and febrile seizures but no chronic epilepsy. SignificanceAvailable evidence suggests that impaired SYN1 function is associated with hyperexcitability of the temporoinsular network and disturbance of high mental functions such as language and social interaction. The presence of reflex bathing seizures, a most peculiar clinical feature, could be helpful in identifying other patients with this syndrome.

Apoptotic cells trigger a membrane-initiated pathway to increase ABCA1	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							REVERSE CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT; HIGH-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEINS; RECEPTOR KNOCKOUT MICE; IN-VIVO; HDL CHOLESTEROL; TANGIER-DISEASE; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; MACROPHAGES; ENGULFMENT; CLEARANCE	Macrophages clear millions of apoptotic cells daily and, during this process, take up large quantities of cholesterol. The membrane transporter ABCA1 is a key player in cholesterol efflux from macrophages and has been shown via human genetic studies to provide protection against cardiovascular disease. How the apoptotic cell clearance process is linked to macrophage A8CA1 expression is not known. Here, we identified a plasma membrane-initiated signaling pathway that drives a rapid upregulation of ABCA1 mRNA and protein. This pathway involves the phagocytic receptor brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor1 (BAI1), which recognizes phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, and the intracellular signaling intermediates engulfment cell motility1 (ELMO1) and Rac1, as ABCA1 induction was attenuated in primary macrophages from mice lacking these molecules. Moreover, this apoptotic cell-initiated pathway functioned independently of the liver X receptor (LXR) sterol-sensing machinery that is known to regulate ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. When placed on a high-fat diet, mice lacking BAI1 had increased numbers of apoptotic cells in their aortic roots, which correlated with altered lipid profiles. In contrast, macrophages from engineered mice with transgenic BAI1 overexpression showed greater ABCA1 induction in response to apoptotic cells compared with those from control animals. Collectively, these data identify a membrane-initiated pathway that is triggered by apoptotic cells to enhance ABCA1 within engulfing phagocytes and with functional consequences in vivo.

A similar control of ictallike discharges is exerted by low-frequency electrical stimulation in rodent brain slices maintained in vitro during convulsant treatment. By employing field and "sharp" intracellular recordings, we analyzed here the effects of stimuli delivered at 0.1 or 1 Hz in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala on ictallike epileptiform discharges induced by the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine in the perirhinal cortex, in a rat brain slice preparation. We found that 1) ictal events were nominally abolished when the stimulus rate was brought from 0.1 to 1 Hz; 2) this effect was associated with an increased latency of the epileptiform responses recorded in perirhinal cortex following each stimulus; and 3) both changes recovered to control values following arrest of the 1-Hz stimulation protocol. The control of ictal activity by 1-Hz stimulation and the concomitant latency increase were significantly reduced by GABA(B) receptor antagonism. We propose that this frequency-dependent increase in latency represents a short-lasting, GABA(B) receptor-dependent adaptive mechanism that contributes to decrease epileptiform synchronization, thus blocking seizures in epileptic patients and animal models.

Dynamics of the functional link between area MT LFPs and motion detection	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						behavior; cortex; local field potential; MT; vision	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE VISUAL-ATTENTION; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICAL AREA; EYE-MOVEMENTS; TOP-DOWN; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; DISCRIMINATION TASK; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	The evolution of a visually guided perceptual decision results from multiple neural processes, and recent work suggests that signals with different neural origins are reflected in separate frequency bands of the cortical local field potential (LFP). Spike activity and LFPs in the middle temporal area (MT) have a functional link with the perception of motion stimuli (referred to as neural-behavioral correlation). To cast light on the different neural origins that underlie this functional link, we compared the temporal dynamics of the neural-behavioral correlations of MT spikes and LFPs. Wide-band activity was simultaneously recorded from two locations of MT from monkeys performing a threshold, two-stimuli, motion pulse detection task. Shortly after the motion pulse occurred, we found that high-gamma (100-200 Hz) LFPs had a fast, positive correlation with detection performance that was similar to that of the spike response. Beta (10-30 Hz) LFPs were negatively correlated with detection performance, but their dynamics were much slower, peaked late, and did not depend on stimulus configuration or reaction time. A late change in the correlation of all LFPs across the two recording electrodes suggests that a common input arrived at both MT locations prior to the behavioral response. Our results support a framework in which early high-gamma LFPs likely reflected fast, bottom-up, sensory processing that was causally linked to perception of the motion pulse. In comparison, late-arriving beta and high-gamma LFPs likely reflected slower, top-down, sources of neural-behavioral correlation that originated after the perception of the motion pulse.

Feasibility of Lung Volume Recruitment in Early Neuromuscular Weakness: A Comparison Between Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Myotonic Dystrophy, and Postpolio Syndrome	PM&R			English	Article							RESPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS; MECHANICAL INSUFFLATION-EXSUFFLATION; DUCHENNE MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; PULMONARY-FUNCTION; VITAL CAPACITY; DISEASE; MANAGEMENT; COUGH; ALS; VENTILATION	Background: Lung volume recruitment (LVR) is a cough assistance technique used in persons with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), most typically in those requiring noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Whether it may be useful in persons with NMDs who have milder respiratory impairment is unknown. Objective: To assess the feasibility, impact on quality of life (QOL), and preliminary physiological effects of daily LVR in different categories of persons with NMDs who have an early stage of respiratory impairment. Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Academic tertiary care center. Participants: Outpatients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 8), postpolio syndrome (n = 10), and myotonic dystrophy (n = 6) who had restrictive respiratory defects but were not yet using NIV. Methods: Participants were asked to perform LVR up to 4 times daily and log their LVR use in a diary. Physiological measurements and questionnaires were completed at baseline and after 3 months. Main Outcome Measurements: Compliance with LVR use was assessed, along with QOL and willingness to continue the treatment. Physiological measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC), lung insufflation capacity (LIC), and the LIC minus FVC difference. Results: Of the 24 recruited subjects, 7 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 7 with postpolio syndrome, and 5 with myotonic dystrophy completed the study (n = 19). At baseline, mean values for FVC and spontaneous peak cough flow were 59.9% predicted and 373.1 L/min, respectively. For subjects completing the study, 74% were willing to continue long-term LVR use, and QOL scores were not adversely affected by LVR in any NMD subgroup. The LIC-FVC difference increased from baseline to follow-up by a mean of 0.243 L (P = .006) in all subjects (n = 19), suggesting a possible improvement in respiratory system mechanics. Conclusions: In patients with NMDs who have early restrictive respiratory defects but do not yet require NIV, regular use of LVR is feasible with no negative impact on QOL over a 3-month period and may have physiological benefits. Further work is needed to determine whether early institution of LVR can improve respiratory system mechanics and help delay ventilatory failure in persons with NMDs.

Psychological characteristics of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						myotonic dystrophy type 1; personality traits; psychological symptoms; mild myotonic dystrophy type 1; adult-onset myotonic dystrophy type 1	MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; PERSONALITY; MYOPATHY; REPEAT; DM-1	Objectives - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy. It is associated with motor symptoms but patients also display non-motor symptoms such as particular personality traits. Studies have reported mixed results about personality characteristics which may be attributable to small sample sizes, different disease severity of groups studied, and use of different questionnaires or method. This study aimed to describe the psychological characteristics of a large cohort of patients with DM1, to characterize those at risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, and to compare characteristics between two DM1 phenotypes, a mild and more severe adult-onset phenotype. Methods - Two hundred patients with DM1 (152 adult-onset; 48 mild) were asked to complete questionnaires assessing personality traits, psychological symptoms, self-esteem, and suicidal risk. Neurological and neuropsychological assessments were performed to compare personality characteristics to clinical and cognitive measures. Results - Patients with DM1 globally showed personality traits and psychological symptoms in the average range compared to normative data, with normal levels of self-esteem and suicidal ideation. However, 27% of patients were found to be at high risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. Moreover, psychological traits differed across phenotypes, with the most severe phenotype tending to show more severe psychological symptoms. The presence of higher phobic anxiety and lower self-esteem was associated with lower education, a higher number of CTG repeats, more severe muscular impairment, and lower cognitive functioning (P < 0.001). Conclusions - Different phenotypes should thus be taken into account in clinical settings for individual management of patients and optimizing therapeutic success.	[Bertrand, J.

MethodsPatients were assessed annually for mood disorders (4 types, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) and 18 other neuropsychiatric events. Global disease activity scores (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K]), damage scores (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index [SDI]), and Short Form 36 subscales, mental and physical component summary scores were collected. Time to event, linear and ordinal regressions, and multi-state models were used as appropriate. ResultsAmong the 1,827 patients with SLE, 88.9% were female, and 48.9% were Caucasian. The mean SD age of the patients was 35.1 +/- 13.3 years, disease duration was 5.6 +/- 4.8 months, and the length of followup was 4.7 +/- 3.5 years. During the course of the study, 863 (47.2%) of the 1,827 patients had 1,627 neuropsychiatric events. Mood disorders occurred in 232 (12.7%) of 1,827 patients, and 98 (38.3%) of 256 mood disorder events were attributed to SLE. The estimated cumulative incidence of any mood disorder after 10 years was 17.7% (95% confidence interval 15.1, 20.2%). A greater risk of mood disorder was associated with concurrent neuropsychiatric events (P0.01), and a lower risk was associated with Asian race/ethnicity (P=0.01) and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (P=0.003). Mood disorders were associated with lower mental health and mental component summary scores but not with the SLEDAI-2K, SDI, or lupus autoantibodies. Among the 232 patients with depression, 168 (72.4%) were treated with antidepressants. One hundred twenty-six (49.2%) of 256 mood disorders resolved in 117 (50.4%) of 232 patients. ConclusionMood disorders, the second most frequent neuropsychiatric event in patients with SLE, have a negative impact on health-related quality of life and improve over time. The lack of association with global SLE disease activity, cumulative organ damage, and lupus autoantibodies emphasizes the multifactorial etiology of mood disorders and a role for non-lupus-specific therapies.

Because sleep is required for learning, plasticity and recovery, we here evaluated the bidirectional relationship between mTBI and sleep with two specific objectives: (1) Test that mTBI rapidly impairs sleep-wake architecture and the dynamics of the electrophysiological marker of sleep homeostasis (i.e., non-rapid eye movement sleep delta (1-4 Hz) activity); (2) evaluate the impact of sleep loss following mTBI on the expression of plasticity markers that have been linked to sleep homeostasis and on genome-wide gene expression. A closed-head injury model was used to perform a 48 h electrocorticographic (ECoG) recording in mice submitted to mTBI or Sham surgery. mTBI was found to immediately decrease the capacity to sustain long bouts of wakefulness as well as the amplitude of the time course of ECoG delta activity during wakefulness. Significant changes in ECoG spectral activity during wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep were observed mainly on the second recorded day. A second experiment was performed to measure gene expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus after a mTBI followed either by two consecutive days of 6 h sleep deprivation (SD) or of undisturbed behavior (quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing). mTBI modified the expression of genes involved in immunity, inflammation and glial function (e.g., chemokines, glial markers) and SD changed that of genes linked to circadian rhythms, synaptic activity/neuronal plasticity, neuroprotection and cell death and survival. SD appeared to affect gene expression in the cerebral cortex more importantly after mTBI than Sham surgery including that of the astrocytic marker Gfap, which was proposed as a marker of clinical outcome after TBI. Interestingly, SD impacted the hippocampal expression of the plasticity elements Arc and EfnA3 only after mTBI. Overall, our findings reveal alterations in spectral signature across all vigilance states in the first days after mTBI, and show that sleep loss post-mTBI reprograms the transcriptome in a brain area-specific manner and in a way that could be deleterious to brain recovery.

Despite inferior musical performance, amusics exhibit normal auditory cortical responses, with abnormal neural correlates suggested to lie beyond auditory cortices. Here we show, using auditory brainstem responses to complex sounds in humans, that fine-grained automatic processing of sounds is impoverished in amusia. Compared with matched non-musician controls, spectral amplitude was decreased in amusics for higher harmonic components of the auditory brainstem response. We also found a delayed response to the early transient aspects of the auditory stimulus in amusics. Neural measures of spectral amplitude and response timing correlated with participants' behavioral assessments of music processing. We demonstrate, for the first time, that amusia affects how complex acoustic signals are processed in the auditory brainstem. This neural signature of amusia mirrors what is observed in musicians, such that the aspects of the auditory brainstem responses that are enhanced in musicians are degraded in amusics. By showing that gradients of music abilities are reflected in the auditory brainstem, our findings have implications not only for current models of amusia but also for auditory functioning in general.

Brain Dev Cooperative Grp	A new template to study callosal growth shows specific growth in anterior and posterior regions of the corpus callosum in early childhood	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adolescence; brain maturation; corpus callosum; early childhood; magnetic resonance imaging	WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; LIFE-SPAN; MRI DATA; TRACTOGRAPHY	Most of the studies conducted on the development of the corpus callosum (CC) have been limited to a relatively simple assessment of callosal area, providing an estimation of the size of the CC in two dimensions rather than its actual measurement. The goal of this study was to revisit callosal development in childhood and adolescence by using a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging template of the CC that considers the horizontal width of the CC and compares this with the two-dimensional (2D) callosal area. We mapped callosal growth in a large sample of youths followed longitudinally (N=370 at T1; N=304 at T2; and N=246 at T3). Both techniques were based on a five-section subdivision of the CC. The results obtained with the 3D method revealed that the rate of CC growth over a 4-year period in the rostrum, the genu, the anterior body and the splenium was significantly higher in the youngest age group (<7years) than in older groups, indicating an intense period of development in early childhood for the anterior and posterior parts of the CC. Similar results were obtained when 2D callosal area was used for the anterior and posterior parts of the CC. However, divergent results were found in the mid-body and the caudal body of the CC. As shown by differences between 2D estimations and actual 3D measurements of callosal growth, our study highlights the importance of considering the horizontal width in measuring developmental changes in the CC.

The diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors in particular has been a prime example for the usefulness of peptides labeled with a variety of different radionuclides. Among those, Ga-68 and F-18 stand out because of the ease of radionuclide introduction (e.g., Ga-68 isotope) or optimal nuclide properties for PET imaging (slightly favoring the 18F isotope). The in vivo properties of good manufacturing practice-compliant, newly developed kitlike-producible F-18-SiFA- and F-18-SiFAlin- (SiFA = silicon-fluoride acceptor) modified TATE derivatives were compared with the current clinical gold standard Ga-68-DOTATATE for high-quality imaging of somatostatin receptor-bearing tumors. Methods: SiFA- and SiFAlin-derivatized somatostatin analogs were synthesized and radiolabeled using cartridge-based dried F-18 and purified via a C18 cartridge (radiochemical yield 49.8% +/- 5.9% within 20-25 min) without high-performance liquid chromatography purification. Tracer lipophilicity and stability in human serum were tested in vitro. Competitive receptor binding affinity studies were performed using AR42J cells. The most promising tracers were evaluated in vivo in an AR42J xenograft mouse model by ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo PET/CT imaging studies for evaluation of their pharmacokinetic profiles, and the results were compared with those of the current clinical gold standard Ga-68-DOTATATE. Results: Synthetically easily accessible F-18-labeled silicon-fluoride acceptor-modified somatostatin analogs were developed. They exhibited high binding affinities to somatostatin receptor-positive tumor cells (1.88-14.82 nM). The most potent compound demonstrated comparable pharmacokinetics and an even slightly higher absolute tumor accumulation level in ex vivo biodistribution studies as well as higher tumor standardized uptake values in PET/CT imaging than Ga-68-DOTATATE in vivo. The radioactivity uptake in nontumor tissue was higher than for Ga-68-DOTATATE. Conclusion: The introduction of the novel SiFA building block SiFAlin and of hydrophilic auxiliaries enables a favorable in vivo biodistribution profile of the modified TATE peptides, resulting in high tumor-to-background ratios although lower than those observed with Ga-68-DOTATATE. As further advantage, the SiFA methodology enables a kitlike labeling procedure for F-18-labeled peptides advantageous for routine clinical application.

METHODS: In a national cohort study of pediatric ADS, severity of the incident attack and extent of recovery by 12 months were evaluated. Annual evaluations were used to determine current diagnoses (monophasic ADS or multiple sclerosis [MS]) and new deficits. RESULTS: Of 283 children, 244 (86%) required hospitalization for a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 6 (3-10) days, and 184 had moderate or severe deficits; 41 children were profoundly encephalopathic, 129 were unable to ambulate independently, and 59 with optic neuritis (ON) had moderately or severely impaired vision. Those with transverse myelitis (TM) and patients with monophasic disease were more likely to have moderate or severe deficits at onset. Twenty-seven children (10%) did not experience full neurologic recovery from their incident attack; 12 have severe residual deficits. Monophasic illness, TM, and moderate or severe deficits at onset were associated with poor recovery. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 5.06 (3.41-6.97) years, 59 children (21%) were diagnosed with MS; all recovered fully from their incident ADS attacks, although 6 subsequently acquired irreversible deficits after a median (IQR) observation period of 5.93 (4.01-7.02) years. CONCLUSIONS: ADS is a serious illness, with 86% of affected Canadian children requiring hospitalization. More than 90% of children recovered physically from their ADS event, including those children experiencing onset of MS. However, permanent visual or spinal cord impairment occurred in some children with ON or TM.

It consists of a hand-held probe system measuring spectrally resolved inelastically scattered light interacting with tissue, designed and optimized for in vivo measurements. Factors such as linearity of the signal with integration time and laser power, and their impact on signal to noise ratio, are studied leading to optimal data acquisition parameters. The impact of ambient light sources in the operating room is assessed and recommendations made for optimal operating conditions. In vivo Raman spectra of normal brain, cancer and necrotic tissue were measured in 10 patients, demonstrating that real-time inelastic scattering measurements can distinguish necrosis from vital tissue (including tumor and normal brain tissue) with an accuracy of 87%, a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 89%.

This has been highlighted in the context of several medical conditions such as cancer, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and central nervous system disorders, among many others. Here we assessed several steps involved in the development of an ncRNA biomarker discovery pipeline, ranging from sample preparation to bioinformatic processing of small RNA sequencing data. Methods: A total of 45 biological samples were included in the present study. All libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA protocol and sequenced using the HiSeq2500 or MiSeq Illumina sequencers. Small RNA sequencing data was validated using qRT-PCR. At each stage, we evaluated the pros and cons of different techniques that may be suitable for different experimental designs. Evaluation methods included quality of data output in relation to hands-on laboratory time, cost, and efficiency of processing. Results: Our results show that good quality sequencing libraries can be prepared from small amounts of total RNA and that varying degradation levels in the samples do not have a significant effect on the overall quantification of sncRNAs via NGS. In addition, we describe the strengths and limitations of three commercially available library preparation methods: (1) Novex TBE PAGE gel; (2) Pippin Prep automated gel system; and (3) AMPure XP beads. We describe our bioinformatics pipeline, provide recommendations for sequencing coverage, and describe in detail the expression and distribution of all sncRNAs in four human tissues: whole-blood, brain, heart and liver. Conclusions: Ultimately this study provides tools and outcome metrics that will aid researchers and clinicians in choosing an appropriate and effective high-throughput sequencing quantification method for various study designs, and overall generating valuable information that can contribute to our understanding of small ncRNAs as potential biomarkers and mediators of biological functions and disease.

PI3K signaling in the locus coeruleus: anew molecular pathway for ADHDresearch	EMBO MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Editorial Material							BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY; PI3K-GAMMA; ADHD	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized by hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsive behaviors and has significant societal impact. ADHD is recognized as a heterogeneous disease, and genetic and/or environmental factors underlying pathogenesis remain largely unknown. There is an obvious need to increase knowledge on molecular signaling and brain pathways underlying disease development, and genetic mouse models are key to this goal. In this issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine, D'Andrea etal () combine state-of-the-art genetic and behavioral approaches in the mouse to demonstrate an essential role for PI3K and cAMP homeostasis in ADHD-related behaviors, through signaling mechanisms operating at the level of the locus coeruleus, the main source of noradrenaline in the brain. Furthermore, the study posits PI3K knockout mice as a novel tool of high interest for modeling ADHD endophenotypes.

J	Rivaz, H; Collins, DL				Rivaz, Hassan; Collins, D. Louis			Deformable registration of preoperative MR, pre-resection ultrasound, and post-resection ultrasound images of neurosurgery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						Non-rigid registration; Intra-operative ultrasound; Brain surgery; Image-guided neurosurgery; IGNS	BRAIN SHIFT; INTRAOPERATIVE MRI; 3D ULTRASOUND; TUMORS	Sites that use ultrasound (US) in image-guided neurosurgery (IGNS) of brain tumors generally have three sets of imaging data: preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) image, pre-resection US, and post-resection US. The MR image is usually acquired days before the surgery, the pre-resection US is obtained after the craniotomy but before the resection, and finally, the post-resection US scan is performed after the resection of the tumor. The craniotomy and tumor resection both cause brain deformation, which significantly reduces the accuracy of the MR-US alignment. Three unknown transformations exist between the three sets of imaging data: MR to pre-resection US, pre- to post-resection US, and MR to post-resection US. We use two algorithms that we have recently developed to perform the first two registrations (i.e., MR to pre-resection US and pre- to post-resection US). Regarding the third registration (MR to post-resection US), we evaluate three strategies. The first method performs a registration between the MR and pre-resection US, and another registration between the pre- and post-resection US. It then composes the two transformations to register MR and post-resection US; we call this method compositional registration. The second method ignores the pre-resection US and directly registers the MR and post-resection US; we refer to this method as direct registration. The third method is a combination of the first and second: it uses the solution of the compositional registration as an initial solution for the direct registration method. We call this method group-wise registration. We use data from 13 patients provided in the MNI BITE database for all of our analysis. Registration of MR and pre-resection US reduces the average of the mean target registration error (mTRE) from 4.1 to 2.4 mm. Registration of pre- and post-resection US reduces the average mTRE from 3.7 to 1.5 mm. Regarding the registration of MR and post-resection US, all three strategies reduce the mTRE. The initial average mTRE is 5.9 mm, which reduces to 3.3 mm with the compositional method, 2.9 mm with the direct technique, and 2.8 mm with the group-wise method. Deformable registration of MR and pre- and post-resection US images significantly improves their alignment. Among the three methods proposed for registering the MR to post-resection US, the group-wise method gives the lowest TRE values. Since the running time of all registration algorithms is less than 2 min on one core of a CPU, they can be integrated into IGNS systems for interactive use during surgery.

Both surgical treatment and study of PD require delineation of basal ganglia nuclei morphology. While many automatic volumetric segmentation methods have been proposed for the lentiform nucleus, few have attempted to identify the key brainstem substructures including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra (SN), and red nucleus (RN) due to their small size and poor contrast in conventional T1W MRI. A dual-contrast patch-based label fusion method was developed to segment the SN, STN, and RN using multivariate cross-correlation. Two different MRI contrasts (T2*w and phase) are produced from a multi-contrast multi-echo FLASH MRI sequence, enabling visualization of these nuclei. T1-T2* fusion MRI was used to resolve the issue of poor nuclei (i.e., the STN, SN, and RN) contrast on T1w MRI, and to mitigate susceptibility artifacts that may hinder accurate nonlinear registration on T2*w MRI. Unbiased group-wise registration was used for anatomical normalization between the atlas library and the target subject. The performance of the proposed method was compared with a state-of-the-art single-contrast label fusion technique. The proposed method outperformed a state-of-the-art single-contrast patch-based method in segmenting the STN, RN and SN, and the results were better than those reported in previous literature. Our dual-contrast patch-based label fusion method was superior to a single-contrast method for segmenting brainstem nuclei using a multi-contrast multi-echo FLASH MRI sequence. The method is promising for the treatment and research of Parkinson's disease. This method can be extended for multiple alternative image contrasts and other fields of applications.

Here, we evaluated whether [C-11]ABP688, a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand that binds to the allosteric site of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5), is sensitive to glutamate fluctuations after a pharmacological challenge. For this, we used ceftriaxone (CEF) administration in rats, an activator of the GLT-1 transporter (EAAT2), which is known to decrease extracellular levels of glutamate. MicroPET [C-11]ABP688 dynamic acquisitions were conducted in rats after a venous injection of either saline (baseline) or CEF 200 mg/kg (challenge). Binding potentials (BPND) were obtained using the simplified reference tissue method. Between-condition statistical parametric maps indicating brain regions showing the highest CEF effects guided placement of microdialysis probes for subsequent assessment of extracellular levels of glutamate. The CEF administration increased [C-11]ABP688 BPND in the thalamic ventral anterior (VA) nucleus bilaterally. Subsequent microdialysis assessment revealed declines in extracellular glutamate concentrations in the VA. The present results support the concept that availability of mGluR5 allosteric binding sites is sensitive to extracellular concentrations of glutamate. This interesting property of mGluR5 allosteric binding sites has potential applications for assessing the role of glutamate in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric conditions.

METHODS All patients who underwent EDT were included while those involving either prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy or operating room thoracotomy were excluded. Quantitative synthesis via meta-analysis was not possible because no comparison or control group (i.e., survival or neurologically intact survival data for similar patients who did not undergo EDT) was available for the PICO questions of interest. RESULTS The 72 included studies provided 10,238 patients who underwent EDT. Patients presenting pulseless after penetrating thoracic injury had the most favorable EDT outcomes both with (survival, 182 [21.3%] of 853; neurologically intact survival, 53 [11.7%] of 454) and without (survival, 76 [8.3%] of 920; neurologically intact survival, 25 [3.9%] of 641) signs of life. In patients presenting pulseless after penetrating extrathoracic injury, EDT outcomes were more favorable with signs of life (survival, 25 [15.6%] of 160; neurologically intact survival, 14 [16.5%] of 85) than without (survival, 4 [2.9%] of 139; neurologically intact survival, 3 [5.0%] of 60). Outcomes after EDT in pulseless blunt injury patients were limited with signs of life (survival, 21 [4.6%] of 454; neurologically intact survival, 7 [2.4%] of 298) and dismal without signs of life (survival, 7 [0.7%] of 995; neurologically intact survival, 1 [0.1%] of 825). CONCLUSION We strongly recommend that patients who present pulseless with signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury undergo EDT. We conditionally recommend EDT for patients who present pulseless and have absent signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury, present or absent signs of life after penetrating extrathoracic injury, or present signs of life after blunt injury. Lastly, we conditionally recommend against EDT for pulseless patients without signs of life after blunt injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Systematic review/guideline, level III.

The detection of the nonproteinogenic amino acid beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) and two of its conformation isomers, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB) and N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine (AEG), as well as three alkaloid cyanotoxins, anatoxin-a (ANA-a), cylindrospermopsin (CYN), and saxitoxin (STX), is presented. The use of a chemical derivatization with dansyl chloride (DNS) allows easier separation with reversed phase liquid chromatography. Detection with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with the Q-Exactive enables high selectivity with specific fragmentation as well as exact mass detection, reducing considerably the possibilities of isobaric interferences. Previous to analysis, a solid phase extraction (SPE) step is used for purification and preconcentration. After DNS derivatization, samples are submitted to ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with heated electrospray ionisation and the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (UHPLC-HESI-HRMS). With an internal calibration using isotopically-labeled DAB-D-3, the method was validated with good linearity (R (2) > 0.998), and method limits of detection and quantification (MLD and MLQ) for target compounds ranged from 0.007 to 0.01 mu g L-1 and from 0.02 to 0.04 mu g L-1, respectively. Accuracy and within-day/between-days variation coefficients were below 15 %. SPE recovery values ranged between 86 and 103 %, and matrix effects recovery values ranged between 75 and 96 %. The developed analytical method was successfully validated with 12 different lakes samples, and concentrations were found ranging between 0.009 and 0.3 mu g L-1 except for STX which was not found in any sample.

Identification of adhesion molecules used by autoaggressive CD8(+) T lymphocytes to enter the CNS would allow further characterization of this pathogenic subset and could provide new therapeutic targets in MS. We propose that melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) is a surface marker and adhesion molecule used by pathogenic CD8(+) T lymphocytes to access the CNS. MethodsFrequency, phenotype, and function of MCAM(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes was characterized using a combination of ex vivo, in vitro, in situ, and in vivo approaches in humans and mice, including healthy controls, MS subjects, and EAE animals. ResultsHerein, we report that MCAM is expressed by human effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes and it is strikingly upregulated during MS relapses. We further demonstrate that MCAM(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes express more interleukin 17, interferon , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor than MCAM(-) lymphocytes, and exhibit an enhanced killing capacity toward oligodendrocytes. MCAM blockade restricts the transmigration of CD8(+) T lymphocytes across human blood-brain barrier endothelial cells in vitro, and blocking or depleting MCAM in vivo reduces chronic neurological deficits in active, transfer, and spontaneous progressive EAE models. InterpretationOur data demonstrate that MCAM identifies encephalitogenic CD8(+) T lymphocytes, suggesting that MCAM could represent a biomarker of MS disease activity and a valid target for the treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions.

Somatosensory evoked potentials in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated with hypothermia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Somatosensory evoked potentials; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Hypothermia; Neonatal; MRI; Prognosis	ASPHYXIATED TERM INFANTS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; PREDICTIVE-VALUE; BIRTH ASPHYXIA; PULSED DOPPLER; CLASSIFICATION; NEWBORNS	Objective: Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are reported to have high positive predictive value (PPV) for neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in neonates with moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our objective was to assess if this predictive value remains high with the use of therapeutic hypothermia. Methods: A cohort of HIE neonates treated with hypothermia was recruited between September 2008 and September 2010. SEPs were elicited after hypothermia and classified as bilateral absent N19, abnormal N19 (i.e., delayed or unilateral absent), or normal. Qualitative evaluation of MRI was also performed. The primary outcome was moderate or severe NDI around 2 years of age. Results: SEPs were performed after hypothermia in 26 of 34 neonates submitted to hypothermia with adequate follow-up at a median day of life 11 (IQR 9,13). Twenty-three (88%) had moderate encephalopathy. Eleven neonates (42%) had bilateral absent N19, 4 of whom had NDI, while fifteen neonates (58%) had either abnormal or normal N19, of whom only one had NDI. SEPs thus had a PPV of 0.36 (4/11) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.93 (14/15). Eighteen neonates (69%) had brain injury on MRI. MET thus had a PPV of 0.28 (5/18) and an NPV of 1.00 (8/8). Conclusions: Neonates with HIE treated with hypothermia with bilateral absent N19 potentials may have a better prognosis than reported in the pre-hypothermia era. MRI also had a low PPV and high NPV. SEPs should be interpreted with caution in this new population and need to be re-evaluated in larger studies. (C) 2015 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pediatric Cerebral Palsy in Africa: Where Are We?	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						cerebral palsy; etiologies; review; consensus	NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS; CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; NIGERIA; INTERVENTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISABILITIES; ETIOLOGY; ETHIOPIA; TRIAL	Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of physical disability in children worldwide. However, little is reported on this condition in the African context. Doctors from 22 countries in Africa, and representatives from a further 5 countries outside Africa, met to discuss the challenges in the evaluation and management of children with cerebral palsy in Africa and to propose service needs and further research. Basic care is limited by the poor availability of diagnostic facilities or medical personnel with experience and expertise in managing cerebral palsy, exacerbated by lack of available interventions such as medications, surgical procedures, or even regular therapy input. Relevant guidelines are lacking. In order to guide services for children with existing disabilities, to effectively target the main etiologies and to develop preventive strategies for the continent, research priorities must include multicenter collaborative studies looking at the prevalence, risk factors, and treatment of cerebral palsy.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Congenital Visual Impairment and Progressive Microcephaly Due to Lysyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Synthetase (KARS) Mutations: The Expanding Phenotype of Aminoacyl-Transfer RNA Synthetase Mutations in Human Disease	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						lysyl-tRNA synthetase; aminoacyl-tRNA; microcephaly; epilepsy; vision disorders	SPINAL-CORD INVOLVEMENT; BRAIN-STEM; PERRAULT SYNDROME; HEARING-LOSS; GENE; LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; NEUROPATHY; BINDING	Aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthetases (ARSs) are a group of enzymes required for the first step of protein translation. Each aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase links a specific amino acid to its corresponding transfer RNA component within the cytoplasm, mitochondria, or both. Mutations in ARSs have been linked to a growing number of diseases. Lysyl-transfer RNA synthetase (KARS) links the amino acid lysine to its cognate transfer RNA. We report 2 siblings with severe infantile visual loss, progressive microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, and abnormal subcortical white matter. Exome sequencing identified mutations within the KARS gene (NM_005548.2):c.1312C>T; p.Arg438Trp and c.1573G>A; p.Glu525Lys occurring within a highly conserved region of the catalytic domain. Our patients' phenotype is remarkably similar to a phenotype recently reported in glutaminyl-transfer RNA synthetase (QARS), another bifunctional ARS gene. This finding expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in KARS and draws attention to aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase as a group of enzymes that are increasingly being implicated in human disease.

Anencephaly and spina bifida are severe NTDs that affect reproductive fitness and suggest a role for de novo mutations (DNMs) in their aetiology. Methods We used whole-exome sequencing in 43 sporadic cases affected with myelomeningocele or anencephaly and their unaffected parents to identify DNMs in their exomes. Results We identified 42 coding DNMs in 25 cases, of which 6 were loss of function (LoF) showing a higher rate of LoF DNM in our cohort compared with control cohorts. Notably, we identified two protein-truncating DNMs in two independent cases in SHROOM3, previously associated with NTDs only in animal models. We have demonstrated a significant enrichment of LoF DNMs in this gene in NTDs compared with the gene specific DNM rate and to the DNM rate estimated from control cohorts. We also identified one nonsense DNM in PAX3 and two potentially causative missense DNMs in GRHL3 and PTPRS. Conclusions Our study demonstrates an important role of LoF DNMs in the development of NTDs and strongly implicates SHROOM3 in its aetiology.
