One of these studies, suggests a modular structure, MOSAIC, to learn and control variant dynamic conditions by switching multiple modules. In this paper, we present an easy understandable fuzzy mechanism to select appropriate module which is an important problem about the switching, according to the dynamic condition. Although there have been some extensions of original MOSAIC, the previously proposed approaches either result in unstable module switching or exploit biologically unjustifiable probabilistic methods. In addition to the fact that fuzzy approach is greatly compatible with human brain behavior, the simulation results show that fuzzy module selection outperforms the probabilistic approach used in original MOSAIC.

These new bioelectric signals are contaminated by the electrical activity of the atrial muscle just underneath. These atrial waveforms may mask relevant neuronal activity. In this paper. we evaluate the application of a principal component analysis technique to suppress atrial activity ( AA) and reveal hidden neuronal activity. Neuronal signals were recorded in situ using a 16-channel electrode in an open-chest. anesthetized dog in sinus rhythm. Validation of AA cancellation was performed by comparing neuron spike waveforms extracted from within AA with those found in AA-free time intervals. Results showed that consistent neuronal waveforms can be identified within AA in order to improve the detection of neuron firings.

A few hardware approaches have recently been introduced for a new family of associative memories based on Sparse-Clustered Networks (SCN) that show attractive features. These architectures are suitable for implementations with low retrieval latency, but are limited to small networks that store a few hundred data entries. In this paper, a new hardware architecture of SCNs is proposed that features a new data-storage technique as well as a method we refer to as Selective Decoding (SD-SCN). The SD-SCN has been implemented using a similar FPGA used in the previous efforts and achieves two orders of magnitude higher capacity, with no error-performance penalty but with the cost of few extra clock cycles per data access.

Also, in cognitive settings cognitive nodes may receive signals from primary users and from other cognitive users simultaneously. For such scenario, we propose primary user signal detection using modulation class identification method. We consider multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas for cognitive nodes. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the modulation identification purpose. The proposed algorithm works as higher order moments and cumulants are calculated from the received signal samples at each of the receiving branches of cognitive nodes. After this step, these features are fed to the ANN to determine the presence of primary users. Final identification decision is drawn using the decision from all receiving branches. We also present numerical results of our algorithm and compare these results with the theoretical results of the energy detection algorithm.

In order to better understand human " thought", owing to the development of the hybrid brain/muscle interface technique, in this paper, we present a real-time hybrid brain/muscle interface to control a wheelchair directly to keep the disables recovering several motion capabilities by using noninvasive motor imagery Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG). The EMG and EEG signals from the users are extracted to control the motion of an intelligent wheelchair. Both signals processing consists of off-line training, online control evaluation, and real-time control. An algorithm called the common spatial patterns (CSP) is used in this human-robot system to extract the most discriminative spatial patterns pairs as features. The extensive experiments were conducted on the developed human-wheelchair systems to verify the proposed approaches.

Applying a [C-11]Raclopride Template to Automated Binding Potential Estimation in HRRT Brain PET	2013 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	60th IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) / Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) / 20th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors	OCT 27-NOV 02, 2013	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc			HIGH-RESOLUTION; ECAT HRRT; RECONSTRUCTION; SEGMENTATION; SYSTEM; ATLAS; SPACE; MODEL	Performing kinetic analysis of [C-11] raclopride PET data typically involves user intervention to identify key volumes of interest, such as the cerebellum for the reference region and the caudate and putamen for regions where the binding potential (BP) needs to be estimated. In many PET centres, this process is neither automated nor standardized, possibly producing discrepancies between centres. Conventionally, MR anatomical images are used to identify the key volumes of interest, but this is difficult to automate robustly, and user intervention can sometimes be required. This work considers instead the use of an anatomically labeled [C-11] raclopride template, formed from multiple subjects, which has the key advantages of low noise, good resolution and having a highly similar spatiotemporal intensity distribution to any given single subject raclopride scan. This makes the template an excellent target for automated image registration and segmentation. We present a methodology which works on post-reconstruction images, demonstrating an automated and consistent way of identifying key regions of interest (ROIs) and determining binding potential without any MR image or user intervention. The performance of the methodology is evaluated using simulated and real [C-11] raclopride data. The simplified reference tissue model with the basis function method (SRTM-BFM) was used for the kinetic modeling.

Spatial uniformity of the images is of paramount importance, as many radioligand studies require either accurate regional dynamic quantification or, at the very least, accurate measurement of relative activities between regions. Often uniform cylinders, of Ge-68 or F-18, are used for quality control and calibration purposes. This work examines the spatial uniformity obtained in reconstructed images of uniform cylinders from seven different HRRT centres, using either Ge-68 or F-18, and also considering a head and brain phantom filled with F-18 scanned at three of the centres. To account for varying activity levels used in each centre's data acquisition, and possibly different image reconstruction parameters, a progressive smoothing method was used to analyze image uniformity, with metrics designed to assess non-uniformity in image planes as well as in randomly selected region of interest pairs. Unusually high image non-uniformities were found for germanium cylinders at two centres, but of greater concern was the fact that uniformity for the brain phantom was found to be notably inferior at two of the three centres which scanned the phantom. A change of mu-map reconstruction parameters, and minor adjustment of a parameter used in the single scatter simulation, was shown to remedy the issue (reducing relative region errors to <5%).

Usually a time series of images is acquired in order to apply a kinetic model to the time-changing concentrations of the radiotracer within different volumes of interest. Whether fully quantitative kinetic modeling methods are employed or simpler reference tissue methods, it is of paramount importance to ensure that the regional distributions of the radiotracer concentration are accurate. However, it is common practice to use simple uniform cylinders as a form of routine quality control to assess reconstruction accuracy, or perhaps simplified phantoms (like the Hoffman brain phantom), but these do not have attenuation and scatter properties which are comparable to the case of imaging the human head. Instead, this work uses an anthropomorphic head and brain phantom with realistically complex attenuation and scatter (yet with a simple large uniform emission region) to assess regional uniformity of reconstructed images for the HRRT (when using 3D OP-OSEM reconstruction) and for the HR+ (using DIFT reconstruction). For the HRRT it was found necessary to change the reconstruction parameters for the mu map and also to specially tune a parameter for the single scatter simulation in order to improve the uniformity of the HRRT images such that a relative region analysis produced errors below 5%. For the HR+, the importance of transmission scanning without radioactivity present in the FOV is emphasized, in order to carry out reliable relative region analyses (with errors <5%). Relative region analyses are expected to indicate performance for the task of kinetic modeling when using a reference region, such as the cerebellum for imaging of raclopride kinetics.

Through the design of specialized optical sensors, for the first time, we are able to synchronously capture a cellist's acoustic performance and musical gestures within the MRI scanner. The electromagnetic constraints and confined space of the scanner were overcome through the design of a minimalist composite cello body, a bridge and transparent fingerboard embedded with optical fibers, and a sensorized shortened bow. Using an array of fibers embedded in the fingerboard, we captured finger position and vibrato. Bending losses in fibers placed between the bridge and string, as a contact microphone, allowed us to capture the acoustic performance. Bow displacement was acquired separately using an optical flow sensor and by measuring Faraday rotation in an optical crystal within the magnetic field of the scanner.

It requires optimal selection of machining parameters and is essential for the process automation and implementation of a computer-integrated manufacturing system. In this research, a brief review of recent progress on the optimization of machining parameters is introduced. Some new machining practices developed in recent years are discussed including hard turning, dry cutting, high speed machining, and machining of difficult-to-machine materials. Modeling skills for creating relations between input parameters and output performances of machining processes and optimization techniques for solving optimal or near-optimal solutions are summarized and analyzed.

Research has shown that chaotic neural networks are exquisitely sensitive to small perturbations making them unreliable and unpredictable. Here, we examine how neuronal oscillations (i.e., temporal waves of activity) may be tuned to enhance the discrimination performance of chaotic neural networks. Using a computational model of randomly connected leaky integrateand-fire (LIF) neurons, we examine the possibility that oscillations enhance the reliability of spike times across several repetitions of the same stimuli. Compared to networks with no oscillations, networks injected with oscillations yielded markedly superior stimulus discrimination. Furthermore, the discrimination performance of the model was sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of oscillations, as well as the phase at which stimuli were presented. In sum, our work suggests that oscillations augment spike timing reliability, thus leading to enhanced stimulus discrimination performance. Overall, results highlight the importance of background rhythmic activity on information processing in neuronal circuits.

The first scheme uses a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller tuned by a genetic algorithm (GA) to control the speed of the diesel engine (DE) for regulating the frequency of the power system and uses a classical MRAC for controlling the voltage amplitude of the synchronous machine (SM). The second scheme uses a MRAC with a PID controller tuned by a GA to control the speed of the DE, and a MRAC with an artificial neural network (ANN) and a PID controller tuned by a GA for controlling the voltage amplitude of the SM. Different operating conditions of the microgrid and fault scenarios in the diesel engine generator (DEG) were tested: 1) decrease in the performance of the diesel engine actuator (40% and 80%), 2) sudden connection of 0.5 MW load, and 3) a 3-phase fault with duration of 0.5 seconds. Dynamic models of the microgrid components are presented in detail and the proposed microgrid and its fault-tolerant control (FTC) are implemented and tested in the Simpower Systems of MATLAB/Simulink (R) simulation environment. The simulation results showed that the use of ANNs in combination with model-based adaptive controllers improves the FTC system performance in comparison with the baseline controller.

Developmental intervention programs for preterm children have a positive impact on early motor, cognitive and socio-emotional development as well as on parental well-being. However, their application in a real-life setting is hindered by significant costs and resource needs which limits intervention delivery by health care professionals. Therefore, the goal of our project is to develop and test the feasibility of a family-focused educational program of developmentally-supportive care for preterm infants to improve infant development and parental outcomes through a multi-modal approach using web-based technologies. The educational program, which takes place during the first year of life, addresses five themes: (1) interpretation of behavioural cues and environmental modification; (2) adapted positioning; (3) oral feeding support; (4) enhancement of parent-infant interactions; (5) anticipatory guidance of preterm infant development. Central to our intervention program is a web-based platform that contains material on the five topics in a written and videotaped format as well as online access to an expert in child development. As a complement to the web-based structure, person-to-person learning-teaching encounters are offered along with group workshops in the neonatal intensive care unit delivered by a single intervener. To document the effects of this program on infant development and parental wellbeing, we are conducting a prospective exploratory clinical trial with a historical comparison cohort during the first year following neonatal discharge. Interim outcomes are performed at 4 and 8 months corrected age and include motor development using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale, neurological status using the Amiel-Tison & Gosselin neurological assessment, infant temperament, sensory profile and parental well-being. At 12 months corrected age, primary outcomes consist of cognitive, language and motor development measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Secondary outcomes at 12 months are neurological status, physiologic stress, feeding and sleeping behaviour, parenting stress, maternal depression, and parental self-efficacy and sense of competence. This paper will present the rationale and details of our educational program of developmentally-supportive care for families of preterm infants as well as the study protocol of our clinical trial.

The current study demonstrates that pathological cortical cholinergic deafferentation can be quantified in vivo with [F-18]FEOBV PET, yielding analogous results to postmortem histological techniques. Methods: Fifteen male rats (3 months old) underwent a cerebral infusion of 192 IgG-saporin at the level of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. They were scanned using [F-18]FEOBV PET, then sacrificed, and their brain tissues collected for immunostaining and quantification of cholinergic denervation using optical density (OD). Results: For both PET binding and postmortem OD, the highest losses were found in the cortical areas, with the highest reductions in the orbitofrontal, sensorimotor, and cingulate cortices. In addition, OD quantification in the affected areas accurately predicts [F-18]FEOBV uptake in the same regions when regressed linearly. Conclusions: These findings support [F-18]FEOBV as a reliable imaging agent for eventual use in human neurodegenerative conditions in which cholinergic losses are an important aspect.

The AR is a ligand-activated transcription factor, but plays roles in other cellular pathways. In SBMA, selective motor neuron degeneration occurs in the brainstem and spinal cord, thus the causes of neuronal dysfunction have been studied. However, pathogenic pathways in muscles may also be involved. Cultured cells, fly and mouse models are used to study the molecular mechanisms leading to SBMA. Both the structure of the polyglutamine-expanded AR (polyQ AR) and its interactions with other proteins are altered relative to the normal AR.The ligand-dependent translocation of the polyQ AR to the nucleus appears to be critical, as are interdomain interactions. The polyQ AR, or fragments thereof, can form nuclear inclusions, but their pathogenic or protective nature is unclear. Other data suggests soluble polyQ AR oligomers can be harmful. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination influence AR function and modulate the deleterious effects of the polyQ AR. Transcriptional dysregulation is highly likely to be a factor in SBMA; deregulation of non-genomic AR signaling may also be involved. Studies on polyQ AR-protein degradation suggest inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system and changes to autophagic pathways may be relevant. Mitochondrial function and axonal transport may also be affected by the polyQ AR. Androgens, acting through the AR, can be neurotrophic and are important in muscle development; hence both loss of normal AR functions and gain of novel harmful functions by the polyQ AR can contribute to neurodegeneration and muscular atrophy. Thus investigations into polyQ AR function have shown that multiple complex mechanisms lead to the initiation and progression of SBMA.

Ataxin-3 and its E3 partners: implications for Machado-Joseph disease	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						parkin; ataxin-3; CHIP; Machado Joseph disease; Parkinson's disease; polyglutamine expansion		Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is the most common dominant inherited ataxia worldwide, caused by an unstable CAG trinucleotide expansion mutation within the SCA3 gene resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract within the ataxin-3 protein. Ataxin-3 functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), within the Ub system and whilst many DUBs are known to partner with and deubiquitinate specific E3-Ub ligases, ataxin-3 had no identified E3 partner until recent studies implicated parkin and CHIP two neuroprotective E3 ligases. MJD often presents with symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), which led to identification of parkin as a novel E3-Ub ligase whose activity was regulated by ataxin-3-mediated deubiquitination. Findings from these studies also revealed an unexpected convergence upon the E2-Ub-conjugating enzyme in the regulation of an E3/DUBenzyme pair. Moreover, mutant but not wild-type ataxin-3 promotes the clearance of parkin via the autophagy pathway, raising the intriguing possibility that increased turnover of parkin may contribute to the pathogenesis of MJD and help explain some of the Parkinsonian features in MJD. In addition to parkin, the U-box E3 ligase CHIP a neuroprotective E3 implicated in protein quality control, was identified as a second E3 partner of ataxin-3, with ataxin-3 regulating the ability of CHIP to ubiquitinate itself. Indeed, ataxin-3 not only deubiquitinated CHIP but also trimmed Ub conjugates on CHIP substrates, thereby regulating the length of Ub chains. Interestingly, when expanded ataxin-3 was present, CHIP levels were also reduced in the brains of MJD transgenic mice, raising the possibility that loss of one or both E3 partners may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of SCA3. In this review we discuss the implications from these studies and describe the importance of these findings in helping us understand the molecular processes involved in SCA3 and other neurodegenerative disorders.

FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						autophagy; Mitochondria; mitophagy; neurons; parkin; Parkinson's disease; PINK1		Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by massive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Whereas the majority of PD cases are sporadic, about 5-10% of cases are familial and associated with genetic factors. The loss of parkin or PINK1, two such factors, leads to an early onset form of PD. Importantly, recent studies have shown that parkin functions downstream of PINK1 in a common genetic pathway affecting mitochondrial homeostasis. More precisely, parkin has been shown to mediate the autophagy of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) in a PINK1-dependent manner. However, much of the work characterizing this pathway has been carried out in immortalized cell lines overexpressing high levels of parkin. In contrast, whether or how endogenous parkin and PINK1 contribute to mitophagy in neurons is much less clear. Here we review recent work addressing the role of parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy in neurons. Clearly, it appears that mitophagy pathways differ spatially and kinetically in neurons and immortalized cells, and therefore might diverge in their ultimate outcome and function. While evidence suggests that parkin can translocate to mitochondria in neurons, the function and mechanism of mitophagy downstream of parkin recruitment in neurons remains to be clarified. Moreover, it is noteworthy that most work has focused on the downstream signaling events in parkin/PINK1 mitophagy, whereas the upstream signaling pathways remain comparatively poorly characterized. Identifying the upstream signaling mechanisms that trigger parkin/PINK1 mitophagy will help to explain the nature of the insults affecting mitochondrial function in PD, and a better understanding of these pathways in neurons will be the key in identifying new therapeutic targets in PD.

These genes encode for proteins with distinct enzymatic activities that may work together to confer neuroprotection. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been shown to ubiquitinate substrates and to trigger proteasome-dependent degradation or autophagy, two crucial homeostatic processes in neurons. PINK1 is a mitochondrial protein kinase whose activity is required for Parkin-dependent mitophagy, a process that has been linked to neurodegeneration. Finally, DJ-1 is a protein homologous to a broad class of bacterial enzymes that may function as a sensor and modulator of reactive oxygen species, which have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review the literature on the structure and biochemical functions of these three proteins.

The relationship between the age of onset of musical training and rhythm synchronization performance: validation of sensitive period effects	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						musical training; sensitive period; brain development; early training; working memory	WHITE-MATTER PLASTICITY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; HUMAN BRAIN; COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; DEAF-CHILDREN; MUSICIANS; TRACTOGRAPHY; ACQUISITION; TOPOGRAPHY	A sensitive period associated with musical training has been proposed, suggesting the influence of musical training on the brain and behavior is strongest during the early years of childhood. Experiments from our laboratory have directly tested the sensitive period hypothesis for musical training by comparing musicians who began their training prior to age seven with those who began their training after age seven, while matching the two groups in terms of musical experience (Watanabe et al., 2007; Bailey and Penhune; 2010, 2012). Using this matching paradigm, the early-trained groups have demonstrated enhanced sensorimotor synchronization skills and associated differences in brain structure (Bailey et al., 2013; Steele et al., 2013). The current study takes a different approach to investigating the sensitive period hypothesis for musical training by examining a single large group of unmatched musicians (N = 77) and exploring the relationship between age of onset of musical training as a continuous variable and performance on the Rhythm Synchronization Task (RST), a previously used auditory-motor RST. Interestingly, age of onset was correlated with task performance for those who began training earlier, however, no such relationship was observed among those who began training in their later childhood years. In addition, years of formal training showed a similar pattern. However, individual working memory scores were predictive of task performance, regardless of age of onset of musical training. Overall, these results support the sensitive period hypothesis for musical training and suggest a non-linear relationship between age of onset of musical training and auditory-motor rhythm synchronization abilities, such that a relationship exists early in childhood but then plateaus later on in development, similar to maturational growth trajectories of brain regions implicated in playing music.

Metabolic disturbances connecting obesity and depression	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						mood disorders; abdominal obesity; saturated fatty acids; leptin; insulin; adiponectin; resistin; inflammation	POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACID; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; AWAKENING CORTISOL RESPONSE; STRESS-INDUCED DEPRESSION; CHRONIC SOCIAL STRESS; SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS; MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y NPY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; INSULIN-RESISTANCE	Obesity markedly increases the odds of developing depression. Depressed mood not only impairs motivation, quality of life and overall functioning but also increases the risks of obesity complications. Abdominal obesity is a better predictor of depression and anxiety risk than overall adipose mass. A growing amount of research suggests that metabolic abnormalities stemming from central obesity that lead to metabolic disease may also be responsible for the increased incidence of depression in obesity. As reviewed here, a higher mass of dysfunctional adipose tissue is associated with several metabolic disturbances that are either directly or indirectly implicated in the control of emotions and mood. To better comprehend the development of depression in obesity, this review pulls together select findings addressing the link between adiposity, diet and negative emotional states and discusses the evidence that alterations in glucocorticoids, adipose-derived hormones, insulin and inflammatory signaling that are characteristic of central obesity may be involved.

This places them at higher risk of physical restriction and functional impairment as well as potentially contributing to observed increases in cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance in later life. The mechanisms underlying these changes in skeletal muscle are unknown but chemotherapy drugs used in treatment for ALL are strongly implicated. Normal skeletal muscle growth, development, and function are dependent on correctly functioning muscle satellite cells, muscle motor neurons, and muscle mitochondria. Each of these key components is potentially susceptible to damage by chemotherapy in childhood, particularly prolonged courses including repeated administration of combination chemotherapy. If this chemotherapy-induced damage is not fully reversible, impairment of satellite cells, muscle motor innervation, and mitochondria could, either singly or together, lead to the emergence of delayed or persistent skeletal muscle dysfunction many years later. The known effects of individual drugs used in the treatment of ALL are outlined and the need for specific targeted studies to investigate the mechanisms underlying persistent muscle dysfunction in survivors of ALL and other childhood cancers is highlighted.

The challenge is to classify the emotions expressed by the primary human subject in short video clips extracted from feature length movies. This involves the analysis of video clips of acted scenes lasting approximately one-two seconds, including the audio track which may contain human voices as well as background music. Our approach combines multiple deep neural networks for different data modalities, including: (1) a deep convolutional neural network for the analysis of facial expressions within video frames; (2) a deep belief net to capture audio information; (3) a deep autoencoder to model the spatio-temporal information produced by the human actions depicted within the entire scene; and (4) a shallow network architecture focused on extracted features of the mouth of the primary human subject in the scene. We discuss each of these techniques, their performance characteristics and different strategies to aggregate their predictions. Our best single model was a convolutional neural network trained to predict emotions from static frames using two large data sets, the Toronto Face Database and our own set of faces images harvested from Google image search, followed by a per frame aggregation strategy that used the challenge training data. This yielded a test set accuracy of 35.58%. Using our best strategy for aggregating our top performing models into a single predictor we were able to produce an accuracy of 41.03% on the challenge test set. These compare favorably to the challenge baseline test set accuracy of 27.56%.

Epidemiological research on aging provides evidence that social factors (i.e. large social network, good social support) could play a protective role against cognitive decline in old age. However, the link between social factors and specific cognitive skills was not thoroughly investigated to date given that the cognitive functioning was usually assessed by using general cognitive measures, such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Objective. Current study examined the link between different social factors and specific cognitive skills in a group of older adults. Design. We employed a cross-sectional design where the contribution of social factors on cognitive variables were assessed using regression models. Methods. We recruited sixty-six participants with a mean age of 61.47 years (SD=2.35; range 55-66), 65.2% women, with an average of 15.38 years of education and an MMSE score of 29.06. These individuals participated in an extensive neuropsychological assessment comprising of 13 tests measuring: working memory, semantic memory, abstraction, attentional flexibility, shifting, divided attention, perceptual speed, vocabulary, verbal fluency and spatial processing. In addition, questionnaires were used to measure both quantitative (i.e. size of social network, frequency of social interactions) as well as qualitative aspects (i.e. subjective perception of the quality of social interactions) of social life. We used hierarchical step-wise regression models to assess the contribution of social variables on cognitive performance controlling for age, education and depression levels. Results. The results indicated that both quantitative and qualitative facets of social life were associated with some specific cognitive skills in the long-term memory and executive processes domains. The link between subjective aspect of social life and these cognitive skills was stronger than that between objective measures and cognition. Also, the cognitive performance in complex cognitive tasks was enhanced when the objective and subjective factors were concordant (either high or both low), whereas for some executive functions measures (i.e. attentional flexibility), the performance was worse among individuals with large social networks, but with a poor quality of social interactions. Conclusion. Our study indicates that social factors are linked to specific cognitive skills in the memory and executive functions domains in older adults. In addition, our findings highlight the importance of the perceived quality of social interactions, rather than the size of social network or social support in determining the cognitive performance in this age group. The findings have implications for elucidating the social determinants of cognitive aging.

The proposed study presents the synthesis and characterization of a peptide-based chitosan nanoparticle for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery, in-vitro. Specifically, the synthesis included polyethylene glycol (PEG), a hydrophilic polymer, and trans-activated transcription (TAT) peptide, which were chemically conjugated on the chitosan polymer. The conjugation was achieved using N-Hydroxysuccinimide-PEG-maleimide (heterobifunctional PEG) as a cross-linker, with the bifunctional PEG facilitating the amidation reaction through its N-Hydroxysuccinimide group and reacting with the amines on chitosan. At the other end of PEG, the maleimide group was chemically conjugated with the cysteine-modified TAT peptide. The degree of substitution on chitosan with PEG and on PEG with TAT was confirmed using colorimetric assays. The resultant polymer was used to form nanoparticles complexing siRNA, which were then characterized for particle size, morphology, cellular uptake, and cytotoxicity. The nanoparticles were tested in-vitro on mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a). Particle size and surface charge were characterized and an optimal pH condition and PEG molecular weight were determined to form sterically stable nanoparticles. Results indicate 7.5% of the amines in chitosan polymer were conjugated to the PEG and complete conjugation of TAT peptide was observed on the synthesized PEGylated chitosan polymer. Compared with unmodified chitosan nanoparticles, the nanoparticles formed at pH 6 were monodispersed and of,100 nm in size, exhibiting maximum cell transfection ability and very low cytotoxicity. Thus, this research may be of significance in translocating biotherapeutic molecules for intracellular delivery applications.

This study evaluates the efficacy of a specific pain management program, the Bonapace Method (BM), to reduce the perception of pain during childbirth. The BM involves the father, or a significant partner, in the use of several pain control techniques based on three neurophysiological pain modulation models: (1) controlling the central nervous system through breathing, relaxation, and cognitive structuring; (2) using non-painful stimuli as described in the Gate Control Theory; and (3) recruiting descending inhibition by hyperstimulation of acupressure trigger points. Methods: A multicenter case control study in Quebec on pain perception during labor and delivery compared traditional childbirth training programs (TCTPs) and the BM. Visual analog scales were used to measure pain perception during labor. In all, 25 women (TCTP: n = 12; BM: n = 13) successfully reported their perceptions of pain intensity and unpleasantness every 15 minutes. Results: A positive correlation between the progression of labor and pain was found (pain intensity: P < 0.01; pain unpleasantness: P < 0.01). When compared to TCTP, the BM showed an overall significant lower pain perception for both intensity (45%; P < 0.01) and unpleasantness (46%; P < 0.01). Conclusion: These significant differences in pain perception between TCTP and the BM suggest that the emphasis on pain modulation models and techniques during labor combined with the active participation of a partner in BM are important variables to be added to the traditional childbirth training programs for childbirth pain management.

Nocturnal rodents, including rats, hamsters, and mice, are active during the night and relatively inactive during the day. Many other behavioral and physiological measures also exhibit daily rhythms, but in rodents, running-wheel activity serves as a particularly reliable and convenient measure of the output of the master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. In general, through a process called entrainment, the daily pattern of running-wheel activity will naturally align with the environmental light-dark cycle (LD cycle; e.g. 12 hr-light: 12 hr-dark). However circadian rhythms are endogenously generated patterns in behavior that exhibit a similar to 24 hr period, and persist in constant darkness. Thus, in the absence of an LD cycle, the recording and analysis of running-wheel activity can be used to determine the subjective time-of-day. Because these rhythms are directed by the circadian clock the subjective time-of-day is referred to as the circadian time (CT). In contrast, when an LD cycle is present, the time-of-day that is determined by the environmental LD cycle is called the zeitgeber time (ZT). Although circadian rhythms in running-wheel activity are typically linked to the SCN clock(6-8), circadian oscillators in many other regions of the brain and body(9-14) could also be involved in the regulation of daily activity rhythms. For instance, daily rhythms in food-anticipatory activity do not require the SCN15,16 and instead, are correlated with changes in the activity of extra-SCN oscillators(17-20). Thus, running-wheel activity recordings can provide important behavioral information not only about the output of the master SCN clock, but also on the activity of extra-SCN oscillators. Below we describe the equipment and methods used to record, analyze and display circadian locomotor activity rhythms in laboratory rodents.

Catherine; Fitzcharles, Mary-Ann; Schweinhardt, Petra			Fibromyalgia interacts with age to change the brain	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Chronic pain; Age; MRI; Insula; Cingulate; VBM		Although brain plasticity in the form of gray matter increases and decreases has been observed in chronic pain, factors determining the patterns of directionality are largely unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that fibromyalgia interacts with age to produce distinct patterns of gray matter differences, specifically increases in younger and decreases in older patients, when compared to age-matched healthy controls. The relative contribution of pain duration was also investigated. Regional gray matter was measured in younger (n = 14, mean age 43, range 29-49) and older (n = 14; mean age 55, range 51-60) female fibromyalgia patients and matched controls using voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness analysis of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. To examine their functional significance, gray matter differences were compared with experimental pain sensitivity. Diffusion-tensor imaging was used to assess whether white matter changed in parallel with gray matter, and resting-state fMRI was acquired to examine whether pain-related gray matter changes are associated with altered functional connectivity. Older patients showed exclusively decreased gray matter, accompanied by compromised white matter integrity. In contrast, younger patients showed exclusively gray matter increases, namely in the basal ganglia and insula, which were independent of pain duration. Associated white matter changes in younger patients were compatible with gray matter hypertrophy. In both age groups, structural brain alterations were associated with experimental pain sensitivity, which was increased in older patients but normal in younger patients. Whereas more pronounced gray matter decreases in the posterior cingulate cortex were related to increased experimental pain sensitivity in older patients, insular gray matter increases in younger patients correlated with lower pain sensitivity, possibly indicating the recruitment of endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms. This is supported by the finding that the insula in younger patients showed functional decoupling from an important pain-processing region, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that brain structure and function shift from being adaptive in younger to being maladaptive in older patients, which might have important treatment implications.

Impaired structural correlates of memory in Alzheimer's disease mice	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Mouse model; Magnetic resonance imaging; Memory; Neuroanatomical plasticity; Pioglitazone-treatment		The healthy adult brain demonstrates robust learning-induced neuroanatomical plasticity. While altered neuroanatomical plasticity is suspected to be a factor mitigating the progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is not known to what extent this plasticity is affected by AD. We evaluated whether spatial learning and memory-induced neuroanatomical plasticity are diminished in an adult mouse model of AD (APP mice) featuring amyloid beta-driven cognitive and cerebrovascular dysfunction. We also evaluated the effect of early, long-termpioglitazone-treatment on functional hyperemia, spatial learning and memory, and associated neuroanatomical plasticity. Using high-resolution post-mortem MRI and deformation-based morphometry, we demonstrate spatial learning and memory-induced focal volume increase in the hippocampus of wild-type mice, an effect that was severely attenuated in APP mice, consistent with their unsuccessful performance in the spatial Morris water maze. These findings implicate impaired neuroanatomical plasticity as an important contributing factor to cognitive deficits in the APP mouse model of AD. Pioglitazone-treatment in APP mice completely rescued functional hyperemia and exerted beneficial effects on spatial learning and memory-recall, but it did not improve hippocampal plasticity.

Intra-individual variability in information processing speed reflects white matter microstructure in multiple sclerosis	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Diffusion tensor imaging; Tract-based spatial statistics; Information processing speed; Intra-individual variability; Multiple sclerosis	SUBJECT DIFFUSION DATA; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; REACTION-TIME; HEALTHY-ADULTS; SPATIAL STATISTICS; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; VOXELWISE ANALYSIS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ATROPHY	Slowed information processing speed is commonly reported in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), and is typically investigated using clinical neuropsychological tests, which provide sensitive indices of mean-level information processing speed. However, recent studies have demonstrated that within-person variability or intra-individual variability (IIV) in information processing speed may be a more sensitive indicator of neurologic status than mean-level performance on clinical tests. We evaluated the neural basis of increased IIV in mildly affected relapsing-remitting MS patients by characterizing the relation between IIV (controlling for mean-level performance) and white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty women with relapsing-remitting MS and 20 matched control participants completed the Computerized Test of Information Processing (CTIP), from which both mean response time and IIV were calculated. Other clinical measures of information processing speed were also collected. Relations between IIV on the CTIP and DTI metrics of white matter microstructure were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. We observed slower and more variable responses on the CTIP in MS patients relative to controls. Significant relations between white matter microstructure and IIV were observed for MS patients. Increased IIV was associated with reduced integrity in more white matter tracts than was slowed information processing speed as measured by either mean CTIP response time or other neuropsychological test scores. Thus, despite the common use of mean-level performance as an index of cognitive dysfunction in MS, IIV may be more sensitive to the overall burden of white matter disease at the microstructural level. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential value of considering within-person fluctuations, in addition to mean-level performance, for uncovering brain-behavior relationships in neurologic disorders with widespread white matter pathology.

The film cooling performance is assessed using the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, while the aerodynamic penalty is measured with a mass-averaged total pressure loss coefficient. Two design variables are selected; the coolant to mainstream temperature ratio and total pressure ratio. Two staggered rows of discrete cylindrical film cooling holes on the suction surface of a turbine vane are considered. The effect of varying the coolant flow parameters on the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and the aerodynamic loss is analyzed using the optimization method and three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. The CFD predictions of the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and aerodynamic performance are assessed and validated against corresponding experimental measurements. The optimal solutions are reproduced in the experimental facility and the Pareto front is substantiated with experimental data. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN) to perform a multiple objective optimization of the film coolant flow parameters on the suction surface of a high pressure gas turbine vane. The numerical predictions are employed to construct the artificial neural network that produces low-fidelity predictions of the objectives during the optimization. The Pareto front of optimal solutions is generated by the optimization methodology.

Participants (n = 20) were trained on six single task practice sessions and dual-task was assessed with reaction time performance on a psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Neuropsychological test scores were also acquired. Furthermore, one of the known variables that can influence performances on neuropsychological tests is gender, which was added as a potential predictor. Results show that the small PRP group was associated with better performances in processing speed, inhibition, flexibility and working memory on neuropsychological tests. Gender also had an impact on the PRP, males having a lower PRP than females. A multiple regression was performed to determine which variables explained the most PRP duration, which showed that 49.1% of the variance of the PRP length could be explained by gender, reaction times of the PRP practice trials at the sixth session, the denomination and flexibility conditions of the Modified Stroop Task as well as results on the Symbol Search Test. Gender was the variable that explained the PRP variance the most (23%). Processing speed also seemed to be a great determinant of the PRP as well as the ability to alternate between task-sets as assessed by the Flexibility condition of the Modified Stroop Task. Thus, this study reveals that good performances on certain neuropsychological tests could predict one's ease to manage two tasks simultaneously with a higher chance for males to perform better.

J	Schlechtingen, M; Santos, IF; Achiche, S				Schlechtingen, Meik; Santos, Ilmar Ferreira; Achiche, Sofiane			Wind turbine condition monitoring based on SCADA data using normal behavior models. Part 1: System description	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						ANFIS models; Condition monitoring; Wind turbine; SCADA data; Normal behavior models		This paper proposes a system for wind turbine condition monitoring using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference Systems (ANFIS). For this purpose: (1) ANFIS normal behavior models for common Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data are developed in order to detect abnormal behavior of the captured signals and indicate component malfunctions or faults using the prediction error. 33 different standard SCADA signals are used and described, for which 45 normal behavior models are developed. The performance of these models is evaluated in terms of the prediction error standard deviations to show the applicability of ANFIS models for monitoring wind turbine SCADA signals. The computational time needed for model training is compared to Neural Network (NN) models showing the strength of ANFIS in training speed. (2) For automation of fault diagnosis Fuzzy Interference Systems (FIS) are used to analyze the prediction errors for fault patterns. The outputs are both the condition of the component and a possible root cause for the anomaly. The output is generated by the aid of rules that capture the existing expert knowledge linking observed prediction error patterns to specific faults. The work is based on continuously measured wind turbine SCADA data from 18 turbines of the 2 MW class covering a period of 30 months. The system proposed in this paper shows a novelty approach with regard to the usage of ANFIS models in this context and the application of the proposed procedure to a wide range of SCADA signals. The applicability of the set up ANFIS models for anomaly detection is proved by the achieved performance of the models. In combination with the FIS the prediction errors can provide information about the condition of the monitored components. In this paper the condition monitoring system is described. Part two will entirely focus on application examples and further efficiency evaluation of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The patient experiences perceptual alternations in which the two stimulus components alternate in clarity or salience. We used fMRI at 3T to image brain activity while participants perceived monocular rivalry passively or indicated their percepts with a task. The stimulus patterns were left/right oblique gratings, face/house composites, or a nonrivalrous control stimulus that did not support the perception of transparency or image segmentation. All stimuli were matched for luminance, contrast, and color. Compared with the control stimulus, the cortical activation for passive viewing of grating rivalry included dorsal and ventral extrastriate cortex, superior and inferior parietal regions, and multiple sites in frontal cortex. When the BOLD signal for the object rivalry task was compared with the grating rivalry task, a similar whole-brain network was engaged, but with significantly greater activity in extrastriate regions, including V3, V3A, fusiform face area (FFA), and parahippocampal place area (PPA). In addition, for the object rivalry task, FFA activity was significantly greater during face-dominant periods whereas parahippocampal place area activity was greater during house-dominant periods. Our results demonstrate that slight stimulus changes that trigger monocular rivalry recruit a large whole-brain network, as previously identified for other forms of bistability. Moreover, the results indicate that rivalry for complex object stimuli preferentially engages extrastriate cortex. We also establish that even with natural viewing conditions, endogenous attentional fluctuations in monocular pattern rivalry will differentially drive object-category-specific cortex, similar to binocular rivalry, but without complete suppression of the nondominant image.

Validation was performed on 16 tumor cases in 2 ways: (1) manually selected tags on pre- and postresection ultrasounds were used to compute the mean Euclidean distance between corresponding points in the 2 volumes before and after registration; and (2) the surgeon was asked to rank and rate the quality of the alignment before and after registration. The mean distance was 2.7 mm after a rigid registration and 1.7 mm after a nonlinear registration. Of 16 cases, the surgeon determined that initially only 2 were satisfactorily aligned; after the rigid registration, 5 were satisfactory, and after the nonlinear registration, 13 were satisfactory. According to both the distance and the ranking metrics, the nonlinear registration approach significantly improved the alignment of the ultrasound images.

Corticospinal control strategies underlying voluntary and involuntary wrist movements	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Threshold position control; Unloading reflex; Corticospinal excitability; Primary motor cortex; TMS	HUMAN STRETCH REFLEX; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; MUSCLE; STIMULATION; CONTRACTION; RESPONSES; ADAPTATION; MECHANISMS; HYPOTHESIS; POSTURE	The difference between voluntary and involuntary motor actions has been recognized since ancient times, but the nature of this difference remains unclear. We compared corticospinal influences at wrist positions established before and after voluntary motion with those established before and after involuntary motion elicited by sudden removal of a load (the unloading reflex). To minimize the effect of motoneuronal excitability on the evaluation of corticospinal influences, motor potentials from transcranial magnetic stimulation of the wrist motor cortex area were evoked during an EMG silent period produced by brief muscle shortening. The motoneuronal excitability was thus equalized at different wrist positions. Results showed that the unloading reflex was generated in the presence of a corticospinal drive, rather than autonomously by the spinal cord. Although the tonic EMG levels were substantially different, the corticospinal influences remained the same at the pre- and post-unloading wrist positions. These influences however changed when subjects voluntarily moved the wrist to another position. Previous studies showed that the corticospinal system sets the referent position (R) at which neuromuscular posture-stabilizing mechanisms begin to act. In self-initiated actions, the corticospinal system shifts the R to relay these mechanisms to a new posture, thus converting them from mechanisms resisting to those assisting motion. This solves the classical posture-movement problem. In contrast, by maintaining the R value constant, the corticospinal system relies on these posture-stabilizing mechanisms to allow involuntary responses to occur after unloading. Thus, central control strategies underlying the two types of motor actions are fundamentally different. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kasparian, K				Kasparian, Kristina			Hemispheric differences in figurative language processing: Contributions of neuroimaging methods and challenges in reconciling current empirical findings	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Review						Figurative language processing; Right hemisphere; Metaphors; Idioms; fMRI; Divided visual field experiments; Familiarity	BRAIN-DAMAGED PATIENTS; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; RIGHT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE; METAPHOR COMPREHENSION; IDIOMATIC EXPRESSIONS; WORD MEANINGS; MECHANISMS; DISSOCIATION; SENTENCES; FAMILIAR	The following review critically synthesizes the literature on hemispheric differences in idiom and metaphor comprehension. It has long been debated whether figurative language is inherently different from literal language and is processed specifically in the right hemisphere (RH), or rather, whether figurative and literal language form a continuum rather than a dichotomy, and call upon a similar network of brain areas. In this paper, a number of neuropsychological, behavioral and neuroimaging studies are reviewed in the context of major theoretical accounts of metaphor and idiom comprehension. Specifically, the role played by the RH in metaphor and idiom processing is evaluated, and advancements that neuroimaging methods have made to our understanding of figurative language comprehension are assessed. This review also highlights a number of critical methodological discrepancies between studies, and emphasizes how such inconsistencies in operational definitions, stimuli and tasks pose a serious challenge to reconciling the debate on hemispheric differences, and do not allow for a clear-cut conclusion of which neural networks underlie figurative language processing.

J	Singh, M; Chandra, A				Singh, Mukhtiar; Chandra, Ambrish			Real-Time Implementation of ANFIS Control for Renewable Interfacing Inverter in 3P4W Distribution Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Distributed generation; grid interconnection; neuro-fuzzy control; nonlinear load; power quality; renewable energy; unbalanced load	POWER DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM; GRID SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE	Power electronics plays an important role in controlling the grid-connected renewable energy sources. This paper presents a novel adaptive neuro-fuzzy control approach for the renewable interfacing inverter. The main objective is to achieve smooth bidirectional power flow and nonlinear unbalanced load compensation simultaneously, where the conventional proportional-integral controller may fail due to the rapid change in the dynamics of the highly nonlinear system. The combined capability of neuro-fuzzy controller in handling the uncertainties and learning from the processes is proved to be advantageous while controlling the inverter under fluctuating operating conditions. The inverter is actively controlled to compensate the harmonics, reactive power, and the current imbalance of a three-phase four-wire (3P4W) nonlinear load with generated renewable power injection into the grid simultaneously. This enables the grid to always supply/absorb a balanced set of fundamental currents at unity power factor even in the presence of the 3P4W nonlinear unbalanced load at the point of common coupling. The proposed system is developed and simulated in MATLAB/SimPowerSystem environment under different operating conditions. The digital signal processing and control engineering-based laboratory experimental results are also provided to validate the proposed control approach.

These studies have used the presentation of discrete visual stimulus; the change from closed eyes to open also represents a simple visual stimulus, however, and has been shown to induce changes in local brain activity and in functional connectivity between regions. We thus aimed to investigate the role of the GABA system, specifically GABA(A) receptors, in the changes in brain activity between the eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) state in order to provide detail at the receptor level to complement previous studies of GABA concentrations. We conducted an fMRI study involving two different modes of the change from EC to EO: an EO and EC block design, allowing the modeling of the haemodynamic response, followed by longer periods of EC and EO to allow the measuring of functional connectivity. The same subjects also underwent [F-18]Flumazenil PET to measure GABA(A) receptor binding potentials. It was demonstrated that the local-to-global ratio of GABA(A) receptor binding potential in the visual cortex predicted the degree of changes in neural activity from EC to EO. This same relationship was also shown in the auditory cortex. Furthermore, the local-to-global ratio of GABA(A) receptor binding potential in the visual cortex also predicted the change in functional connectivity between the visual and auditory cortex from EC to EO. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of GABA(A) receptors in stimulus-induced neural activity in local regions and in inter-regional functional connectivity.

Thirty two patients with schizophrenia and 29 matched healthy participants were tested individually on their ToM ability using a task involving attribution and comprehension of a speaker's ironic intent. This task made it possible to determine whether the degree of incongruity between contextual information and a target sentence has an impact on the attribution of ironic intent to the protagonists of a story. Participants were also assessed on their cognitive flexibility and working memory. The main results revealed that participants with schizophrenia correctly perceived contextual information cueing attribution of ironic intent to the protagonist of the stimulus, but they showed difficulty to correctly integrate this information, performing significantly worse than healthy participants when they attributed mental states. However, some participants with schizophrenia performed like healthy control participants on the ToM task while others did not. A lack of flexibility seems to differentiate the two schizophrenia subgroups thereby obtained, suggesting that cognitive flexibility has an impact on ToM performances in schizophrenia. These difficulties were not associated with clinical symptoms. Such results will have an impact on cognitive remediation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, we recruited 65 gamblers differing in problem gambling severity and 35 normal controls. Decision-making under ambiguity was assessed with the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Card Playing Task (CPT). Decision-making under risk was assessed with the Coin Flipping Task (CFT) and the Cups Task. In addition, we included an examination of two working memory components (verbal storage and dual tasking). Results show that problem gamblers performed worse than normal controls on both ambiguous and risky decision-making. Higher problem gambling severity scores were associated with poorer performance on ambiguous decision-making tasks (IGT and CPT) but not decision-making under risk. Additionally, we found that dual task performance correlated positively with decision-making under risk (CFT and Cups tasks) but not with decision-making under ambiguity (IGT and CPT). These results suggest that impairments in decision-making under uncertain conditions of problem gamblers may represent an important neurocognitive mechanism in the maintenance of their problem gambling.

Here we describe optimization of the use of the NTS-polyplex, a gene carrier system taking advantage of neurotensin receptor internalization, to transfect mouse DA neurons in primary culture. The plasmids DsRed2 (4.7 kbp) and VGLUT2-Venus (11 kbp) were used to compare the ability of this carrier system to transfect plasmids of different sizes. We examined the impact of age of the neurons (1, 3, 5 and 8 days after seeding), of culture media used during the transfection (Neurobasal with B27 vs. conditioned medium) and of three molar ratios of plasmid DNA to carrier. While the NTS-polyplex successfully transfected both plasmids in a control N1E-115 cell line, only the pDsRed2 plasmid could be transfected in primary cultured DA neurons. We achieved 20% transfection efficiency of pDsRed2 in DA neurons, with 80% cell viability. The transfection was demonstrated pharmacologically to be dependent on activation of neurotensin receptors and to be selective for DA neurons. The presence of conditioned medium for transfection was found to be required to insure cell viability. Highest transfection efficiency was achieved in the most mature neurons. In contrast, transfection with the VGLUT2-Venus plasmid produced cell damage, most likely due to the high molar ratios required, as evidenced by a 15% cell viability of DA neurons at the three molar ratios tested (1: 36, 1: 39 and 1: 42). We conclude that, when used at molar ratios lower than 1: 33, the NTS-polyplex can selectively transfect mature cultured DA neurons with only low levels of toxicity. Our results provide evidence that the NTS-polyplex has good potential for targeted gene delivery in cultured DA neurons, an in vitro system of great use for the screening of new therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease.

J	White, EJ; Genesee, F; Steinhauer, K				White, Erin Jacquelyn; Genesee, Fred; Steinhauer, Karsten			Brain Responses before and after Intensive Second Language Learning: Proficiency Based Changes and First Language Background Effects in Adult Learners	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; ACQUISITION; ERP; ACTIVATION; EXPLICIT; IMPLICIT; CHINESE; SYNTAX; AGE	This longitudinal study tracked the neuro-cognitive changes associated with second language (L2) grammar learning in adults in order to investigate how L2 processing is shaped by a learner's first language (L1) background and L2 proficiency. Previous studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have argued that late L2 learners cannot elicit a P600 in response to L2 grammatical structures that do not exist in the L1 or that are different in the L1 and L2. We tested whether the neuro-cognitive processes underlying this component become available after intensive L2 instruction. Korean- and Chinese late-L2- learners of English were tested at the beginning and end of a 9-week intensive English-L2 course. ERPs were recorded while participants read English sentences containing violations of regular past tense (a grammatical structure that operates differently in Korean and does not exist in Chinese). Whereas no P600 effects were present at the start of instruction, by the end of instruction, significant P600s were observed for both L1 groups. Latency differences in the P600 exhibited by Chinese and Korean speakers may be attributed to differences in L1-L2 reading strategies. Across all participants, larger P600 effects at session 2 were associated with: 1) higher levels of behavioural performance on an online grammaticality judgment task; and 2) with correct, rather than incorrect, behavioural responses. These findings suggest that the neuro-cognitive processes underlying the P600 (e.g., "grammaticalization'') are modulated by individual levels of L2 behavioural performance and learning.

We have studied the modulation of the HSR by the scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) and amyloid beta peptide (A beta) and investigated whether an activated HSR or the ectopic expression of individual chaperones can interfere with PrPSc- or A beta-induced toxicity. First, we observed different effects on the HSR under acute or chronic exposure of cells to PrPSc or A beta. In chronically exposed cells the threshold to mount a stress response was significantly increased, evidenced by a decreased expression of Hsp72 after stress, whereas an acute exposure lowered the threshold for stress-induced expression of Hsp72. Next, we employed models of PrPSc- and A beta-induced toxicity to demonstrate that the induction of the HSR ameliorates the toxic effects of both PrPSc and A beta. Similarly, the ectopic expression of cytosolic Hsp72 or the extracellular chaperone clusterin protected against PrPSc- or A beta-induced toxicity. However, toxic signaling induced by a pathogenic PrP mutant located at the plasma membrane was prevented by an activated HSR or Hsp72 but not by clusterin, indicating a distinct mode of action of this extracellular chaperone. Our study supports the notion that different pathological protein conformers mediate toxic effects via similar cellular pathways and emphasizes the possibility to exploit the heat shock response therapeutically.

This article identifies the importance of NGS and further analyses the social and ethical implications of this approach when used in research projects studying BD, as well as other psychiatric ailments, with a view to ensuring the protection of research participants. Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies through PubMed, followed by a manual search through the titles and abstracts of original articles, including the reviews, commentaries and letters published in the last five years and dealing with the ethical and social issues raised by NGS technologies and genomics studies of mental disorders, especially BD. A total of 217 studies contributed to identify the themes discussed herein. Results: The amount of information generated by NGS renders individuals suffering from BD particularly vulnerable, and increases the need for educational support throughout the consent process, and, subsequently, of genetic counselling, when communicating individual research results and incidental findings to them. Our results highlight the importance and difficulty of respecting participants' autonomy while avoiding any therapeutic misconception. We also analysed the need for specific regulations on the use and communication of incidental findings, as well as the increasing influence of NGS in health care. Conclusions: Shared efforts on the part of researchers and their institutions, Research Ethics Boards as well as participants' representatives are needed to delineate a tailored consent process so as to better protect research participants. However, health care professionals involved in BD care and treatment need to first determine the scientific validity and clinical utility of NGS-generated findings, and thereafter their prevention and treatment significance.

The present study examined the electrophysiological activity of trauma-exposed patients with or without a PTSD during a modified Stroop task. The PTSD group showed a reduced P2 and P3 amplitude relative to the non-PTSD group under both the earthquake-related and earthquake-unrelated words conditions. Importantly, the earthquake-related words elicited a greater P3 amplitude (350-450ms after stimulus) than did unrelated words in the non-PTSD group, whereas no significant difference was found in the PTSD group. This indicates that PTSD patients had some attention deficits compared with non-PTSD individuals, and that these attention deficits were not just limited to earthquake-related words.

In a recent genome-wide association metaanalysis of alcohol intake, we identified a suggestive association of SNP rs26907 in the ras-specific guanine-nucleotide releasing factor 2 (RASGRF2) gene, encoding a protein that mediates Ca2+-dependent activation of the ERK pathway. We performed functional characterization of this gene in relation to alcohol-related phenotypes and mesolimbic dopamine function in both mice and adolescent humans. Ethanol intake and preference were decreased in Rasgrf2(-/-) mice relative to WT controls. Accordingly, ethanol-induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum was blunted in Rasgrf2(-/-) mice. Recording of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area revealed reduced excitability in the absence of Ras-GRF2, likely because of lack of inhibition of the I-A potassium current by ERK. This deficit provided an explanation for the altered dopamine release, presumably linked to impaired activation of dopamine neurons firing. Functional neuro-imaging analysis of a monetary incentive-delay task in 663 adolescent boys revealed significant association of ventral striatal activity during reward anticipation with a RASGRF2 haplotype containing rs26907, the SNP associated with alcohol intake in our previous-metaanalysis. This finding suggests a link between the RASGRF2 haplotype and reward sensitivity, a known risk factor for alcohol and drug addiction. Indeed, follow-up of these same boys at age 16 y revealed an association between this haplotype and number of drinking episodes. Together, these combined animal and human data indicate a role for RASGRF2 in the regulation of mesolimbic dopamine neuron activity, reward response, and alcohol use and abuse.

Perisaccadic Remapping and Rescaling of Visual Responses in Macaque Superior Colliculus	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; UPDATING SPATIAL REPRESENTATIONS; PARIETAL CORTEX; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; AREA LIP; DYNAMIC CIRCUITRY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MONKEY STRIATE; V4 NEURONS; BRAIN	Visual neurons have spatial receptive fields that encode the positions of objects relative to the fovea. Because foveate animals execute frequent saccadic eye movements, this position information is constantly changing, even though the visual world is generally stationary. Interestingly, visual receptive fields in many brain regions have been found to exhibit changes in strength, size, or position around the time of each saccade, and these changes have often been suggested to be involved in the maintenance of perceptual stability. Crucial to the circuitry underlying perisaccadic changes in visual receptive fields is the superior colliculus (SC), a brainstem structure responsible for integrating visual and oculomotor signals. In this work we have studied the time-course of receptive field changes in the SC. We find that the distribution of the latencies of SC responses to stimuli placed outside the fixation receptive field is bimodal: The first mode is comprised of early responses that are temporally locked to the onset of the visual probe stimulus and stronger for probes placed closer to the classical receptive field. We suggest that such responses are therefore consistent with a perisaccadic rescaling, or enhancement, of weak visual responses within a fixed spatial receptive field. The second mode is more similar to the remapping that has been reported in the cortex, as responses are time-locked to saccade onset and stronger for stimuli placed in the postsaccadic receptive field location. We suggest that these two temporal phases of spatial updating may represent different sources of input to the SC.

Therefore, the effects of CuO NPs should be carefully investigated to determine the most sensitive processes for CuO NP toxicity. In this study, the genotoxicity of CuO NPs was investigated in vitro, using the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro-2A Genotoxic effects related to DNA fragmentation, DNA methylation and chromosomal damage, as well as lipid peroxidation, were investigated and compared to cytotoxic effects, measured by the mitochondria! reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide into formazan. Based on mitochondrial activity, CuO NPs were found to be cytotoxic At the highest concentration tested (400 mg l(-1)), 63% of cell viability was found in Neuro-2A cells after 24 h of treatment to CuO NPs. CuO NPs were also found to induce DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation and micronucleus formation. The micronucleus assay was the most sensitive to evaluate CuO NP genotoxicity and micronucleus frequency was increased significantly at 12.5 mg l(-1) CuO NPs after 24 h of treatment. At this concentration, no significant change of cell viability was found using the mitochondrial activity assay. These results highlight the important risk of genotoxic effects of CuO NPs and show that genotoxicity assays are a sensitive approach to evaluate the risk of CuO NP toxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Tandem PHD Fingers of MORF/MOZ Acetyltransferases Display Selectivity for Acetylated Histone H3 and Are Required for the Association with Chromatin	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						plant homeodomain finger; MORF; histone; binding; NMR	ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; ZINC-FINGER; PLANT HOMEODOMAIN; GENE REPRESSION; PROTEIN MOZ; RECOGNITION; LYSINE-4; METHYLATION; BINDING; DOMAIN	MORF [MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein)-related factor] and MOZ are catalytic subunits of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes essential in hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, skeletogenesis and other developmental programs and implicated in human leukemias. The canonical HAT domain of MORF/MOZ is preceded by a tandem of plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers whose biological roles and requirements for MORF/MOZ activity are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the tandem PHD1/2 fingers of MORF recognize the N-terminal tail of histone H3. Acetylation of Lys9 (H3K9ac) or Lys14 (H3K14ac) enhances binding of MORF PHD1/2 to unmodified H3 peptides twofold to threefold. The selectivity for acetylated H3 tail is conserved in the double PHD1/2 fingers of MOZ. This interaction requires the intact N-terminus of histone H3 and is inhibited by trimethylation of Lys4. Biochemical analysis using NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy and mutagenesis identified key amino acids of MORF PHD1/2 necessary for the interaction with histones. Fluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that both PHD fingers are required for binding to H3K14ac in vivo and localization to chromatin. The HAT assays indicate that the interaction with H3K14ac may promote enzymatic activity in trans. Together, our data suggest that the PHD1/2 fingers play a role in MOZ/MORF HATs association with the chromatic regions enriched in acetylated marks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automated design of ligands to polypharmacological profiles	NATURE			English	Article							DE-NOVO DESIGN; DRUG-DISCOVERY; MEDIAN MOLECULES; ADME PROPERTIES; IN-SILICO; OPTIMIZATION; INHIBITORS; IDENTIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FINGERPRINTS	The clinical efficacy and safety of a drug is determined by its activity profile across many proteins in the proteome. However, designing drugs with a specific multi-target profile is both complex and difficult. Therefore methods to design drugs rationally a priori against profiles of several proteins would have immense value in drug discovery. Here we describe a new approach for the automated design of ligands against profiles of multiple drug targets. The method is demonstrated by the evolution of an approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug into brain-penetrable ligands with either specific polypharmacology or exquisite selectivity profiles for G-protein-coupled receptors. Overall, 800 ligand-target predictions of prospectively designed ligands were tested experimentally, of which 75% were confirmed to be correct. We also demonstrate target engagement in vivo. The approach can be a useful source of drug leads when multi-target profiles are required to achieve either selectivity over other drug targets or a desired polypharmacology.

Hence, studying the neural correlates of the integration of multiple senses constitutes an important tool in understanding perception within an ecologically valid framework. The present study used magnetoencephalography in human subjects to identify the neural correlates of an audiovisual incongruency response, which is not generated due to incongruency of the unisensory physical characteristics of the stimulation but from the violation of an abstract congruency rule. The chosen rule-"the higher the pitch of the tone, the higher the position of the circle"-was comparable to musical reading. In parallel, plasticity effects due to long-term musical training on this response were investigated by comparing musicians to non-musicians. The applied paradigm was based on an appropriate modification of the multifeatured oddball paradigm incorporating, within one run, deviants based on a multisensory audiovisual incongruent condition and two unisensory mismatch conditions: an auditory and a visual one. Results indicated the presence of an audiovisual incongruency response, generated mainly in frontal regions, an auditory mismatch negativity, and a visual mismatch response. Moreover, results revealed that long-term musical training generates plastic changes in frontal, temporal, and occipital areas that affect this multisensory incongruency response as well as the unisensory auditory and visual mismatch responses.

However, it is not known whether postnatal exposure to these hormones has a similar effect. This study compares prenatal and postnatal sex steroid hormone levels in relation to autistic traits in 18 to 24-month-old children. Fetal testosterone (fT) and fetal estradiol (fE) levels were measured in amniotic fluid from pregnant women (n = 35) following routine second-trimester amniocentesis. Saliva samples were collected from these children when they reached three to four months of age and were analyzed for postnatal testosterone (pT) levels. Mothers were asked to complete the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT), a measure of autistic traits in children 18 to 24 months old. Finding: fT (but not pT) levels were positively associated with scores on the Q-CHAT. fE and pT levels showed no sex differences and no relationships with fT levels. fT levels were the only variable that predicted Q-CHAT scores. Conclusions: These preliminary findings are consistent with the hypothesis that prenatal (but not postnatal) androgen exposure, coinciding with the critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain, is associated with the development of autistic traits in 18 to 24 month old toddlers. However, it is recognized that further work with a larger sample population is needed before the effects of postnatal androgen exposure on autistic traits can be ruled out. These results are also in line with the fetal androgen theory of autism, which suggests that prenatal, organizational effects of androgen hormones influence the development of autistic traits in later life.

Subicular neuronal networks are indeed under potent control by local inhibition. However, information about the properties of GABAergic currents generated by neurons of this parahippocampal area in normal tissue is still missing. Here, we describe GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated phasic and tonic currents generated by principal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INs) of the rat subiculum. We show that in spite of similar synaptic current densities, INs generate spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) that occur less frequently and exhibit smaller charge transfer, thus receiving less synaptic total current than PCs. Further distinction of PCs between intrinsically bursting (IB) and regular-spiking (RS) neurons suggested that sIPSCs generated by the two PC sub-types are likely to be similar. PCs and INs are also controlled by a similar tonic inhibition. However, whereas a comparable tonic current density is found in RS cells and INs, IB neurons are constrained by a greater inhibitory tone. Finally, pharmacological blockade of GABA(A)R did not promote functional switch of RS neurons to IB mode, but influenced the bursting propensity of IB cells and released fast spiking activity in INs. Our findings reveal differences in GABAergic currents between PCs and INs as well as within PC sub-types. We propose that GABAergic inhibition may shape hippocampal output activity by providing cell type-specific fine-tuning of subicular excitatory and inhibitory drives.

The core phenotype of this HSP syndrome consists of very early-onset (<2 years) spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, and a specific pattern of brain abnormalities on cerebral imaging. An essential role for DDHD2 in the human CNS, and perhaps more specifically in synaptic functioning, is supported by a reduced number of active zones at synaptic terminals in Ddhd-knockdown Drosophila models. All identified mutations affect the protein's DDHD domain, which is vital for its phospholipase activity. In line with the function of DDHD2 in lipid metabolism and its role in the CNS, an abnormal lipid peak indicating accumulation of lipids was detected with cerebral magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which provides an applicable diagnostic biomarker that can distinguish the DDHD2 phenotype from other complex HSP phenotypes. We show that mutations in DDHD2 cause a specific complex HSP subtype (SPG54), thereby linking a member of the PLA(1) family to human neurologic disease.	[Schuurs-Hoeijmakers, Janneke H.

We examined the heuristic value of various PNS definitions and their respective prevalence in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP). We also contrasted those definitions to the Proxy for the Deficit Syndrome (PDS) to identify deficit syndrome (DS) in the same FEP cohort. Methods: One hundred and fifty-eight FEP patients were separated into PNS and non-PNS groups based on ratings from the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). PNS was defined in the following ways: 1) having a score of 3 or greater on at least 1 global subscale of the SANS (PNS_1); 2) having a score of 3 or more on at least 2 global subscales of the SANS (PNS_2); and 3) having a score of 3 or more on a combination of specific SANS subscales and items (PNS_H). For all three definitions, symptoms had to be present for a minimum of six consecutive months. Negative symptoms were measured upon entry to the program and subsequently at 1,2,3,6,9 and 12 months. Functional outcome was quantified at first assessment and month 12. Results: PNS prevalence: PNS_1 (27%); PNS_2 (13.2%); PNS_H (13.2%). The prevalence of DS was found to be 3% when applying the PDS. Regardless of the definition being applied, when compared to non-PNS, patients in the PNS group were shown to have significantly worse functioning at month 12. All three PNS definitions showed similar associations with functional outcome at month 12. Conclusion: Persistent negative symptoms are present in about 27% of FEP patients with both affective and non-affective psychosis. Although there has previously been doubt as to whether PNS represents a separate subdomain of negative symptoms, the current study suggests that PNS may be more applicable to FEP when compared to DS. Although all three PNS definitions were comparable in predicting functional outcome, we suggest that the PNS definition employed is dependent on the clinical or research objective at hand.

The BAF53a subunit of SWI/SNF-like BAF complexes is essential for hemopoietic stem cell function	BLOOD			English	Article							CHROMATIN REMODELING COMPLEX; ACTIN-RELATED PROTEINS; SELF-RENEWAL; NEURAL DEVELOPMENT; PROGENITOR CELLS; NUCLEAR ACTIN; IN-VIVO; BINDING; TRANSCRIPTION; EXPRESSION	ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complexes are emerging as key regulators of embryonic and adult stem cell function. Particularly intriguing are the findings that specialized assemblies of BAF complexes are required for establishing and maintaining pluripotent and multipotent states in cells. However, little is known on the importance of these complexes in normal and leukemic hemopoiesis. Here we provide the first evidence that the actin-related protein BAF53a, a subunit of BAF complexes preferentially expressed in longterm repopulating stem cells, is essential for adult hemopoiesis. Conditional deletion of BAF53a resulted in multilineage BM failure, aplastic anemia, and rapid lethality. These severe hemopoietic defects originate from a proliferative impairment of BM HSCs and progenitors and decreased progenitor survival. Using hemopoietic chimeras, we show that the impaired function of BAF53a-deficient HSCs is cell-autonomous and independent of the BM microenvironment. Altogether, our studies highlight an unsuspected role for BAF chromatin remodeling complexes in the maintenance of HSC and progenitor cell properties.

Neto2 Interacts with the Scaffolding Protein GRIP and Regulates Synaptic Abundance of Kainate Receptors	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOSSY-FIBER SYNAPSES; RAT-BRAIN; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; GLUR6-DEFICIENT MICE; AUXILIARY SUBUNIT; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; AMPA; EXPRESSION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	Kainate receptors (KARs) are a class of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are expressed throughout the central nervous system. The function and subcellular localization of KARs are tightly regulated by accessory proteins. We have previously identified the single-pass transmembrane proteins, Neto1 and Neto2, to be associated with native KARs. In the hippocampus, Neto1, but not Neto2, controls the abundance and modulates the kinetics of postsynaptic KARs. Here we evaluated whether Neto2 regulates synaptic KAR levels in the cerebellum where Neto1 expression is limited to the deep cerebellar nuclei. In the cerebellum, where Neto2 is present abundantly, we found a,similar to 40% decrease in GluK2-KARs at the postsynaptic density (PSD) of Neto2-null mice. No change, however, was observed in total level of GluK2-KARs, thereby suggesting a critical role of Neto2 on the synaptic localization of cerebellar KARs. The presence of a putative class II PDZ binding motif on Neto2 led us to also investigate whether it interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins previously implicated in regulating synaptic abundance of KARs. We identified a PDZ-dependent interaction between Neto2 and the scaffolding protein GRIP. Furthermore, coexpression of Neto2 significantly increased the amount of GRIP associated with GluK2, suggesting that Neto2 may promote and/or stabilize GluK2: GRIP interactions. Our results demonstrate that Neto2, like Neto1, is an important auxiliary protein for modulating the synaptic levels of KARs. Moreover, we propose that the interactions of Neto1/2 with various scaffolding proteins is a critical mechanism by which KARs are stabilized at diverse synapses.

Characterizing the cytoprotective activity of Sarracenia purpurea L., a medicinal plant that inhibits glucotoxicity in PC12 cells	BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Diabetic neuropathy; Glucose toxicity; Traditional medicine; Quercetin-3-O-galactoside; Morroniside	GLUCOSE DEPRIVATION; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; VACCINIUM-ANGUSTIFOLIUM; OXIDATIVE STRESS; EXTRACTS; GLYCATION; MORRONISIDE; QUERCETIN; APOPTOSIS; COMPLICATIONS	Background: The purple pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea L., is a widely distributed species in North America with a history of use as both a marketed pain therapy and a traditional medicine in many aboriginal communities. Among the Cree of Eeyou Istchee in northern Quebec, the plant is employed to treat symptoms of diabetes and the leaf extract demonstrates multiple anti-diabetic activities including cytoprotection in an in vitro model of diabetic neuropathy. The current study aimed to further investigate this activity by identifying the plant parts and secondary metabolites that contribute to these cytoprotective effects. Methods: Ethanolic extracts of S. purpurea leaves and roots were separately administered to PC12 cells exposed to glucose toxicity with subsequent assessment by two cell viability assays. Assay-guided fractionation of the active extract and fractions was then conducted to identify active principles. Using high pressure liquid chromatography together with mass spectrometry, the presence of identified actives in both leaf and root extracts were determined. Results: The leaf extract, but not that of the root, prevented glucose-mediated cell loss in a concentration-dependent manner. Several fractions elicited protective effects, indicative of multiple active metabolites, and, following subfractionation of the polar fraction, hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-galactoside) and morroniside were isolated as active constituents. Phytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of hyperoside in the leaf but not root extract and, although morroniside was detected in both organs, its concentration was seven times higher in the leaf. Conclusion: Our results not only support further study into the therapeutic potential and safety of S. purpurea as an alternative and complementary treatment for diabetic complications associated with glucose toxicity but also identify active principles that can be used for purposes of standardization and quality control.

However, some studies indicate that even excluding GSW-related errors, IGE patients perform poorly on sustained attention task, the deficit being worse as a function of disease duration. We hypothesized that at least in a subset of structures which are normally involved in sustained attention, resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is different in IGE patients compared to controls and that some of the changes are related to disease duration. Method: Seeds were selected based on a sustained attention study in controls. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was obtained from 14 IGE patients and 14 matched controls. After physiological noise removal, the mean time-series of each seed was used as a regressor in a general linear model to detect regions that showed correlation with the seed. In patients, duration factor was defined based on epilepsy duration. Between-group differences weighted by the duration factor were evaluated with mixed-effects model. Correlation was then evaluated in IGE patients between the FC, averaged over each significant cluster, and the duration factor. Results: Eight of 18 seeds showed significant difference in FC across groups. However, only for seeds in the medial superior frontal and precentral gyri and in the medial prefrontal area, average FC taken over significant clusters showed high correlation with the duration factor. These 3 seeds showed changes in FC respectively with the premotor and superior frontal gyrus, the dorsal premotor, and the supplementary motor area plus precentral gyrus. Conclusion: Alterations of FC in IGE patients are not limited to the frontal areas. However, as indicated by specificity analysis, patients with long history of disease show changes in FC mainly within the frontal areas.

Research in recent years has focused on assessing the reliability of FC across younger subjects within and between scan-sessions. Test-retest reliability in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has not yet been examined in older adults. In this study, we investigated age-related differences in reliability and stability of RSFC across scans. In addition, we examined how global signal regression (GSR) affects RSFC reliability and stability. Three separate resting-state scans from 29 younger adults (18-35 yrs) and 26 older adults (55-85 yrs) were obtained from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) dataset made publically available as part of the 1000 Functional Connectomes project www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon_1000.92 regions of interest (ROIs) with 5 cubic mm radius, derived from the default, cingulo-opercular, fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks, were previously defined based on a recent study. Mean time series were extracted from each of the 92 ROIs from each scan and three matrices of z-transformed correlation coefficients were created for each subject, which were then used for evaluation of multi-scan reliability and stability. The young group showed higher reliability of RSFC than the old group with GSR (p-value = 0.028) and without GSR (p-value < 0.001). Both groups showed a high degree of multi-scan stability of RSFC and no significant differences were found between groups. By comparing the test-retest reliability of RSFC with and without GSR across scans, we found significantly higher proportion of reliable connections in both groups without GSR, but decreased stability. Our results suggest that aging is associated with reduced reliability of RSFC which itself is highly stable within-subject across scans for both groups, and that GSR reduces the overall reliability but increases the stability in both age groups and could potentially alter group differences of RSFC.

J	Nozaradan, S; Peretz, I; Mouraux, A				Nozaradan, Sylvie; Peretz, Isabelle; Mouraux, Andre			Selective Neuronal Entrainment to the Beat and Meter Embedded in a Musical Rhythm	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							STATE EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; RESONANCE; MOVEMENT; SOUND	Fundamental to the experience of music, beat and meter perception refers to the perception of periodicities while listening to music occurring within the frequency range of musical tempo. Here, we explored the spontaneous building of beat and meter hypothesized to emerge from the selective entrainment of neuronal populations at beat and meter frequencies. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while human participants listened to rhythms consisting of short sounds alternating with silences to induce a spontaneous perception of beat and meter. We found that the rhythmic stimuli elicited multiple steady state-evoked potentials (SS-EPs) observed in the EEG spectrum at frequencies corresponding to the rhythmic pattern envelope. Most importantly, the amplitude of the SS-EPs obtained at beat and meter frequencies were selectively enhanced even though the acoustic energy was not necessarily predominant at these frequencies. Furthermore, accelerating the tempo of the rhythmic stimuli so as to move away from the range of frequencies at which beats are usually perceived impaired the selective enhancement of SS-EPs at these frequencies. The observation that beat- and meter-related SS-EPs are selectively enhanced at frequencies compatible with beat and meter perception indicates that these responses do not merely reflect the physical structure of the sound envelope but, instead, reflect the spontaneous emergence of an internal representation of beat, possibly through a mechanism of selective neuronal entrainment within a resonance frequency range. Taken together, these results suggest that musical rhythms constitute a unique context to gain insight on general mechanisms of entrainment, from the neuronal level to individual level.

Most of the physiological actions of MLT in the brain are mediated by two high-affinity G-protein-coupled receptors, denoted MT1 and MT2. However, the particular role of these receptors in anxiety remains to be defined. Here we used a novel MT2-selective partial agonist. UCM765 to evaluate the involvement of MT2 receptors in anxiety. Adult male rats were acutely injected with UCM765 (5-10-20 mg/kg), MLT (20 mg/kg) or diazepam (DZ, 1 mg/kg). Anxiety-related behaviors were assessed in the elevated plus maze test (EPMT), novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and open field test (OFT). UCM765 at the dose of 10 mg/kg showed anxiolytic-like properties by increasing the time spent in the open arm of the EPMT, and by reducing the latency to eat in a novel environment in the NSFT. In the EPMT, animals treated with UCM765 (10 mg/kg) or MLT (20 mg/kg) spent more time in the open arms compared to vehicle-treated animals, but to a lesser extent compared to DZ (1 mg/kg). In the NSFT, all treatments similarly decreased the latency to eat in a novel environment compared to vehicle. UCM765 and MLT did not affect the total time and the number of entries into the central area of the OFT, but unlike DZ, did not impair locomotion. The anxiolytic effects of UCM765 and MLT in the EPMT and the NSFT were blocked using a pre-treatment with the MT1/MT2 antagonist luzindole (10 mg/kg) or the MT2 antagonist 4P-PDOT (10 mg/kg). These results demonstrated, for the first time, the anxiolytic properties of UCM765 and suggest that MT2-receptors may be considered a novel target for the development of anxiolytic drugs.

P-glycoproteins and other multidrug resistance transporters in the pharmacology of anthelmintics: Prospects for reversing transport-dependent anthelmintic resistance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-DRUGS AND DRUG RESISTANCE			English	Review						Multidrug ABC transporters; P-glycoproteins; Anthelmintic resistance; Macrocyclic lactones	NEMATODE CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; MESSENGER-RNA STABILITY; HIGH-AFFINITY BINDING; PROTEIN BCRP ABCG2; HAEMONCHUS-CONTORTUS; ONCHOCERCA-VOLVULUS; IN-VITRO; BREAST-CANCER	Parasitic helminths cause significant disease in animals and humans. In the absence of alternative treatments, anthelmintics remain the principal agents for their control. Resistance extends to the most important class of anthelmintics, the macrocyclic lactone endectocides (MLs), such as ivermectin, and presents serious problems for the livestock industries and threatens to severely limit current parasite control strategies in humans. Understanding drug resistance is important for optimizing and monitoring control, and reducing further selection for resistance. Multidrug resistance (MDR) ABC transporters have been implicated in ML resistance and contribute to resistance to a number of other anthelmintics. MDR transporters, such as P-glycoproteins, are essential for many cellular processes that require the transport of substrates across cell membranes. Being overexpressed in response to chemotherapy in tumour cells and to ML-based treatment in nematodes, they lead to therapy failure by decreasing drug concentration at the target. Several anthelmintics are inhibitors of these efflux pumps and appropriate combinations can result in higher treatment efficacy against parasites and reversal of resistance. However, this needs to be balanced against possible increased toxicity to the host, or the components of the combination selecting on the same genes involved in the resistance. Increased efficacy could result from modifying anthelmintic pharmacokinetics in the host or by blocking parasite transporters involved in resistance. Combination of anthelmintics can be beneficial for delaying selection for resistance. However, it should be based on knowledge of resistance mechanisms and not simply on mode of action classes, and is best started before resistance has been selected to any member of the combination. Increasing knowledge of the MDR transporters involved in anthelmintic resistance in helminths will play an important role in allowing for the identification of markers to monitor the spread of resistance and to evaluate new tools and management practices aimed at delaying its spread.

Recognizing cognitive and psychiatric changes in the post-highly active antiretroviral therapy era. Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol 2012;23(4):209-215. Amid numerous complications that plague the health and quality of life of people living with HIV, neurocognitive and psychiatric illnesses pose unique challenges. While there remains uncertainty with respect to the pathophysiology surrounding these disorders, their adverse implications are increasingly recognized. Left undetected, they have the potential to significantly impact patient well being, adherence to antiretroviral treatment and overall health outcomes. As such, early identification of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and psychiatric illnesses will be paramount in the proactive management of affected patients. The present review focuses on strategies to ensure optimal screening and detection of HAND, depression and substance abuse in routine practice. For each topic, currently available screening methods are discussed. These include identification of risk factors, recognition of relevant symptomatology and an update on validated screening tools that can be efficiently implemented in the clinical setting. Specifically addressed in the present review are the International HIV Dementia Scale, a novel screening equation and algorithm for HAND, as well as brief, validated, verbal questionnaires for detection of depression and substance abuse. Adequate understanding and usage of these screening mechanisms can ensure effective use of resources by distinguishing patients who require referral for more extensive diagnostic procedures from those who likely do not.

Eating Right: Linking Food-Related Decision-Making Concepts From Neuroscience, Psychology, and Education	MIND BRAIN AND EDUCATION			English	Article							SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS; CHILDHOOD OBESITY; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SURGICAL INTERVENTION; HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; NUTRIENT INTAKE; SEVERELY OBESE; DIETARY-INTAKE; ENERGY-INTAKE; BODY-WEIGHT	This literature review uses four dimensions to classify and compare how food-related decision-making is conceptualized and experimentally assessed in neuroscience and other disciplines: (1) food-related decision-making other than the decision of what to eat that is part of each eating episode, (2) decision complexes other than the eating episode itself, (3) the evolution of food-related decision-making over time, and (4) the nature of food related decisions. In neuroscience in particular, food-related decision-making research has been dominated by studies exploring the influence of a wide range of factors on the final outcome, the type and amount of foods eaten. In comparison, the steps that are leading up to this outcome have only rarely been discussed. Neuroscientists should broaden their historically narrow conceptualization of food-related decision-making. Then neuroscience research could help group the numerous hypothesized influences for each of the decision complexes into meaningful clusters that rely on the same or similar brain mechanisms and that thus function in similar ways. This strategy could help researchers improve existing broad models of human food-related decision-making from other disciplines. The integration of neuroscientific and behavioral science approaches can lead to a bettermodel of food-related decision-making grounded in the brain and relevant to the design of more effective school and nonschool lifestyle interventions to prevent and treat obesity in children, adolescents, and adults.

After an analysis of relevant studies evaluating the effectiveness of various treatment modalities, the Comite de l'evolution des pratiques en oncologie (CEPO) made recommendations on MSCC management. Method A review of the scientific literature published up to February 2011 considered only phase II and III trials that included assessment of neurologic function. A total of 26 studies were identified. Recommendations Considering the evidence available to date, CEPO recommends that cancer patients with MSCC be treated by a specialized multidisciplinary team. dexamethasone 16 mg daily be administered to symptomatic patients as soon as MSCC is diagnosed or suspected. high-loading-dose corticosteroids be avoided. histopathologic diagnosis and scores from scales evaluating prognosis and spinal instability be considered before treatment. corticosteroids and chemotherapy with radiotherapy be offered to patients with spinal cord compression caused by myeloma, lymphoma, or germ cell tumour without sign of spinal instability or compression by bone fragment. short-course radiotherapy be administered to patients with spinal cord compression and short life expectancy. long-course radiotherapy be administered to patients with inoperable spinal cord compression and good life expectancy. decompressive surgery followed by long-course radiotherapy be offered to appropriate symptomatic MSCC patients (including spinal instability, displacement of vertebral fragment); and patients considered for surgery have a life expectancy of at least 3-6 months.

We investigated the contribution of cognitive impairment to color discrimination deficits in PD and correlated them with cortical anomalies. Sixty-six PD patients without dementia and 20 healthy controls performed the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment for mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. In a subgroup of 26 PD patients, we also used high-definition neuroanatomical magnetic resonance imaging for cortical thickness and diffusion tensor analysis. PD patients with mild cognitive impairment performed poorly on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test compared with PD patients without mild cognitive impairment and controls. In PD patients, performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test was correlated with measures of visuospatial abilities and executive functions. Neuroimaging analysis revealed higher mean and radial diffusivity values in right posterior white-matter structures that correlated with poor performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test. No cortical thickness correlation reached significance. This study showed that cognitive impairment makes a major contribution to the color discrimination deficits reported in PD. Thus, performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test may reflect cognitive impairment more than color discrimination deficits in PD. Poor performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test was also associated with white-matter alterations in right posterior brain regions.

Efforts have been made to understand the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this disease. As SORL1 (sortilin-related receptor) and SIRT1 (sirtuin I) genes have been linked to AD pathogenesis, we aimed to investigate their mRNA expression and promoter DNA methylation in post mortem brain tissues (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus) from healthy elderly subjects and AD patients. We also evaluated these levels in peripheral blood leukocytes from young, healthy elderly and AD patients, investigating whether there was an effect of age on these profiles. The comparative CT method by Real Time PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used to analyze gene expression and DNA methylation, respectively. SORL1 gene was differently expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes and might act as a marker of aging in this tissue Furthermore, we found that SORL1 promoter DNA methylation might act as one of the mechanisms responsible for the differences in expression observed between blood and brain for both healthy elderly and AD patients groups. The impact of these studied genes on AD pathogenesis remains to be better clarified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we evaluated changes in concentration of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and of 5-HT1A receptors in control monkeys, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkeys, dyskinetic MPTP monkeys treated chronically with L-DOPA, low dyskinetic MPTP monkeys treated with L-DOPA and drugs of various pharmacological activities: Ro 61-8048 (an inhibitor of kynurenine hydroxylase) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and dyskinetic MPTP monkeys treated with L-DOPA + naltrexone (an opioid receptor antagonist). Striatal serotonin concentrations were reduced in MPTP monkeys compared to controls. Higher striatal 5-HIAA/serotonin concentration ratios in L-DOPA-treated monkeys compared to untreated monkeys suggest an intense activity of serotonin axon terminals but this value was similar in dyskinetic and nondyskinetic animals treated with or without adjunct treatment with L-DOPA. As measured by autoradiography with [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl) aminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a decrease of 5-HT1A receptor specific binding was observed in the posterior/dorsal region of the anterior cingulate gyrus and posterior/ventral area of the superior frontal gyrus of MPTP monkeys compared to controls. An increase of 5-HT1A receptor specific binding was observed in the hippocampus of MPTP monkeys treated with L-DOPA regardless to their adjunct treatment. Cortical 5-HT1A receptor specific binding was increased in the L-DOPA-treated MPTP monkeys alone or with DHA or naltrexone and this increase was prevented in low dyskinetic MPTP monkeys treated with L-DOPA and Ro 61-8048. These results highlight the importance of 5-HT1A receptor alterations in treatment of PD with L-DOPA. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experimental research on laboratory animals has demonstrated a variety of physical and behavioral effects among offspring exposed to prenatal maternal stress (PNMS). However, these studies cannot elucidate the relative effects of the objective stress exposure and the subjective distress in a way that would parallel the stress experience in humans. PNMS research with humans is also limited because there are ethical challenges to designing studies that involve the random assignment of pregnant women to varying levels of independent stressors. Natural disasters present opportunities for natural experiments of the effects of pregnant women's exposure to stress on child development. In this review, we present an overview of the human and animal research on PNMS, and highlight the results of Project Ice Storm which has been following the cognitive, behavioral, motor and physical development of children exposed in utero to the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. We have found that both objective degree of exposure to the storm and the mothers' subjective distress have strong and persistent effects on child development, and that these effects are often moderated by the timing of the ice storm in pregnancy and by the child's sex.

It modulates an array of pliable mechanisms that are readily and durably modified by intracellular or extracellular factors. In the fast-moving field of neuroepigenetics, it is emerging that faulty epigenetic gene regulation can have dramatic consequences on the developing CNS that can last a lifetime and perhaps even affect future generations. Mounting evidence suggests that environmental factors can impact the developing brain through these epigenetic mechanisms and this report reviews and examines the epigenetic effects of one of the most common neurotoxic pollutants of our environment, which is believed to have no safe level of exposure during human development: lead.

We show how the registration robustness and accuracy can be improved by restricting the evaluation of gradient orientation alignment to locations where the uncertainty of fixed image gradient orientations is minimal, which we formally demonstrate correspond to locations of high gradient magnitude. We also embed a computationally efficient technique for estimating the gradient orientations of the transformed moving image (rather than resampling pixel intensities and recomputing image gradients). We have applied our method to different rigid multi-modal registration contexts. Our approach outperforms mutual information and other competing metrics in the context of rigid multi-modal brain registration, where we show sub-millimeter accuracy with cases obtained from the retrospective image registration evaluation project. Furthermore, our approach shows significant improvements over standard methods in the highly challenging clinical context of image guided neurosurgery, where we demonstrate misregistration of less than 2 mm with relation to expert selected landmarks for the registration of pre-operative brain magnetic resonance images to intra-operative ultrasound images.

Most intriguingly, the passive viewing of uninformative number symbols can shift visuo-spatial attention to different target locations according to the number magnitude, i.e., small/large numbers facilitate processing of left/right targets, respectively. The brain architecture dedicated to these attention shifts associated with numbers remains unknown. Evoked potential recordings indicate that both early and late stages are involved in this spatio-numerical interaction, but the neuro-functional anatomy needs to be specified. Here we use, for the first time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate attentional orienting following uninformative Arabic digits. We show that BOLD response in occipital visual regions is modulated by the congruency between digit magnitude (small/large) and target side (left/right). Additionally, we report higher BOLD responses following large (8, 9) compared to small (1.2) digits in two bilateral parietal regions, yielding a significant effect of digit magnitude. We propose and discuss the view that encoding of semantic representations related to number symbols in parietal cortex leads to shifts in visuo-spatial attention and enhances visual processing in the occipital cortex according to number-space congruency rules.

Here we used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate semantic, morphological and formal (orthographic) processing conjointly in a masked priming paradigm. We directly compared morphological to both semantic and formal/orthographic priming (shared letters) on verbs. Masked priming was used to reduce strategic effects related to prime perception and to suppress semantic priming effects. The three types of priming led to distinct ERP and behavioral patterns: semantic priming was not found, while formal and morphological priming resulted in diverging ERP patterns.

Our goal was to explore whether sex and gender roles would predict both allostatic load and physical complaints. Objective: This study investigated whether sex- and gender-based factors would correspond to objective and subjective health outcomes. Methods: Thirty Montreal workers (mean [SE] age, 45.4 [2.1] years) participated. The 30-item Bern Sex Role Inventory was administered to assess scores for masculinity and femininity, which were then transformed into an androgyny index representing gender roles along a continuum. Fifteen biomarkers representing neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular systems were aggregated into an allostatic load index measuring physiological dysregulations. The 42-item Wahler Physical Symptoms Inventory was used to measure self-rated physical complaints. Results: Results using logistic and linear regressions controlling for age revealed that increased masculinity predicted inclusion in the high allostatic load group (P = 0.010; odds ratio = 0.715), and sex did not; increased masculinity and female sex together predicted increased physical complaints (P = 0.008; adjusted r(2)= 0.30); and high allostatic load group membership corresponded to increased physical complaints adjusted (P = 0.001; adjusted r(2) = 0.301). Conclusions: That higher masculinity was related to increased objective physiological dysregulations and subjective physical complaints suggests an increased vulnerability to hyperarousal pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease, among masculine-typed individuals.

Animal models can contribute to a better understanding of the role of immunogenetics in leprosy through comparative studies helping to confirm the significance of various identified traits and in deciphering the underlying mechanisms that may be involved in expression of different disease related phenotypes. Genetically engineered mice, with specific immune or biochemical pathway defects, are particularly useful for investigating granuloma formation and resistance to infection and are shedding new light on borderline areas of the leprosy spectrum which are clinically unstable and have a tendency toward immunological complications. Though armadillos are less developed in this regard, these animals are the only other natural hosts of M. leprae and they present a unique opportunity for comparative study of genetic markers and mechanisms associable with disease susceptibility or resistance, especially the neurological aspects of leprosy. In this paper, we review the recent contributions of genetically engineered mice and armadillos toward our understanding of the immunogenetics of leprosy.

Involvement of ATP in noxious stimulus-evoked release of glutamate in rat medullary dorsal horn: A microdialysis study	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Pain; Excitatory amino acids; Trigeminal dorsal horn; Adenosine; Tooth pulp inflammation; Purinergic receptors	TRIGEMINAL SUBNUCLEUS CAUDALIS; P2X RECEPTORS; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; ENDOGENOUS ATP; MICE; PULP; PAIN	Our electrophysiological studies have shown that both purinergic and glutamatergic receptors are involved in central sensitization of nociceptive neurons in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH). Here we assessed the effects of intrathecal administration of apyrase (a nucleotide degrading enzyme of endogenous adenosine 5-triphosphate [ATP]) a combination of apyrase and 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX, an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist), or 2,3-O-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-adenosine triphosphate (TNP-ATP, a P2X1, P2X3, P2X2/3 receptor antagonist) on the release of glutamate in the rat MDH evoked by application of mustard oil (MO) to the molar tooth pulp. In vivo microdialysis was used to dialyse the MDH every 5 min, and included 3 basal samples, 6 samples after drug treatment and 12 samples following application of MO. Tooth pulp application of MO induced a significant increase in glutamate release in the MDH. Superfusion of apyrase or TNP-ATP alone significantly reduced the MO-induced glutamate release in the MDH, as compared to vehicle. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of apyrase on glutamate release were reduced by combining it with DPCPX. This study demonstrates that application of an inflammatory irritant to the tooth pulp induces glutamate release in the rat MDH in vivo that may be reduced by processes involving endogenous ATP and adenosine.

The negative feedback on 5-HT transmission exhibited by the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptors has been postulated as a possible delaying factor. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of the acute and subchronic treatment with pindolol, a 5-HTIN1A/1B, beta(1) and beta(2) adrenoceptor antagonist, on 5-HT synthesis, one of the key parameters of 5-HT neurotransmission. Male Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats (180-220 g) were treated with pindolol or an adequate volume of saline, administered either acutely (15 mg/kg i.p.; SPD-AC-SAL, SPD-AC-TR) or subchronically (15 mg/kg day i.p. for 7 days; SPD-SUBCHR-SAL, SPD-SUBCHR-TR). Thirty minutes following the single i.p. injection (acute experiment) or at the 8th day following the commencement of the subchronic treatment (subchronic experiment), 5-HT synthesis was measured using alpha-[14C]methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiography. The analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, revealed: (1) a significant increase of 5-HT synthesis in the SPD-AC-TR rats, relative to the SPD-AC-SAL rats in all brain regions examined except the substantia nigra - pars reticularis, dorsal subiculum, inferior olive, raphe magnus and raphe obscurus and (2) a significant increase of 5-HT synthesis in the SPD-SUBCHR-TR rats, relative to the SPD-SUBCHR-SAL rats in all brain regions except the median raphe, hypothalamus and raphe pontine. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that the antagonism of the 5-HT1A/1B receptors prevents the negative feedback mediated by these receptors on 5-HT synthesis, resulting in a persistent increase of 5-HT synthesis. The results accord with clinical reports on the utility of pindolol in the augmentation of antidepressant treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigate whether IGF-1 signaling was suppressed by glutamate in vivo, and whether this effect of glutamate was implicated in ischemic brain damage. Our results showed that exogenous glutamate injected by i.c.v. decreased phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors and Akt, and this effect of glutamate was reversed by NMDA antagonist MK-801 but not by non-NMDA antagonist DNQX. NMDA exhibited similar effects of glutamate. Endogenous glutamate, which was induced by focal cerebral ischemia, gradually reduced the phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors and Akt in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, IGF-1 injected by i.c.v. failed to stimulate phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors and Akt after 180 min MCAO, and the protective effect was abolished. Pre-treatment of MK-801 restored the phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors and Akt by IGF-1. In parallel, IGF-1 successfully rescued infarct area after 180 min MCAO. These findings suggest that glutamate interferes with IGF-1 signaling in vivo by activating NMDA receptors, and thereby shorten the therapeutic window of IGF-1 against focal cerebral ischemia.

Even before this step, the access of cholesterol to this enzyme system is both rate-limiting and the site of acute regulation via the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) which interacts with a complex multi-component 'transduceosome' on the outer mitochondria! membrane (OMM). The components of the transduceosome include the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3 for acyl-CoA-binding-domain 3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1 alpha (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these,proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for P450scc. Mitochondria also contain several 'downstream' steroidogenic enzymes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These studies represented each pattern category by a single density. However, the patterns in a category can be so complex as to require a representation spread over several densities to more accurately account for the shape of their distribution in the feature space. The purpose of the present study is to investigate a representation of visual pattern category by several Gibbs densities using a Kohonen neural structure. In this Gibbs density based Kohonen network, which we call a Gibbsian Kohonen network, each node stores the parameters of a Gibbs density. Collectively, these Gibbs densities represent the pattern category. The parameters are learned by a gradient update rule so that the corresponding Gibbs densities maximize entropy subject to reproducing observed feature statistics of the training patterns. We verified the validity of the method and the efficiency of the ensuing Gibbs density pattern representation on a handwritten character recognition application.

Ferritins and metallothioneins are known to sequester intracellular iron and copper respectively. The Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi does not require iron, but its genome encodes a ferritin-like Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved bacteria) molecule, which has been shown to be important for the spirochaete's persistence in the tick and subsequent transmission to a new host. Here, we show that the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich (CCR) domain of this protein functions as a copper-binding metallothionein. This novel fusion between Dps and metallothionein is unique to and conserved in all Borrelia species. We term this molecule BicA for Borrelia iron- and copper-binding protein A. An isogenic mutant lacking BicA had significantly reduced levels of iron and copper and was more sensitive to iron and copper toxicity than its parental strain. Supplementation of the medium with iron or copper rendered the spirochaete more susceptible to peroxide killing. These data suggest that an important function of BicA is to detoxify excess iron and copper the spirochaete may encounter during its natural life cycle through a tick vector and a vertebrate host.

The central requirements for diagnosis of MS are dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time (DIT) of lesions in the CNS, with the proviso that there should be no alternate diagnosis that better explains the clinical presentation. The most definitive diagnosis is the purely clinical one, with 2 separate attacks of symptoms (fulfilling DIT criteria) involving at least 2 different areas of the CNS (fulfilling DIS criteria). In patients who have had a first but not a second clinical attack, the McDonald criteria provide guidance on how paraclinical evidence can be used to support a diagnosis of MS. Recently, the McDonald criteria were revised and new definitions for DIS and DIT proposed. In response to that revision, a panel of Canadian MS neurologists and one neuroradiologist created this commentary regarding the clinical implications and applications of the 2010 McDonald criteria.

However, the proportion of patients with COPD with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is still unknown, and no screening test has been validated to date for detecting MCI in this population. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency and subtypes of MCI in patients with COPD and to assess the validity of two cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in detecting MCI in patients with COPD. Methods: Forty-five patients with moderate to severe COPD and 50 healthy control subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychologic assessment using standard MCI criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained to assess the validity of the MMSE and the MoCA to detect MCI in patients with COPD. Results: MCI was found in 36% of patients with COPD compared with 12% of healthy subjects. Patients with COPD with MCI had mainly the nonamnestic MCI single domain subtype with predominant attention and executive dysfunctions. The optimal MoCA screening cutoff was 26 (<= 25 indicates impairment, with 81% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and 76% correctly diagnosed). No MMSE cutoff had acceptable validity. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, a substantial proportion of patients with COPD were found to have MCI, a known risk factor for dementia. Longitudinal follow-up on these patients is needed to determine the risk of developing more severe cognitive and functional impairments. Moreover, the MoCA is superior to the MMSE in detecting MCI in patients with COPD.

We aimed to identify functional brain imaging patterns predicting the emergence of PD and DLB in patients with IRBD, using SPECT with Tc-99m-ethylene cysteinate dimer (ECD). Methods: Twenty patients with IRBD were scanned at baseline during wakefulness using Tc-99m-ECD SPECT. After a follow-up of 3 years on average, patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they developed defined neurodegenerative disease (PD, DLB). SPECT data analysis comparing regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between groups assessed whether specific brain perfusion patterns were associated with subsequent clinical evolution. Regression analysis between rCBF and clinical markers of neurodegeneration (motor, color vision, olfaction) looked for neural structures involved in this process. Results: Of the 20 patients with IRBD recruited for this study, 10 converted to PD or DLB during the follow-up. rCBF at baseline was increased in the hippocampus of patients who would later convert compared with those who would not (p < 0.05 corrected). Hippocampal perfusion was correlated with motor and color vision scores across all IRBD patients. Conclusions: Tc-99m-ECD SPECT identifies patients with IRBD at risk for conversion to other neurodegenerative disorders such as PD or DLB; disease progression in IRBD is predicted by abnormal perfusion in the hippocampus at baseline. Perfusion within this structure is correlated with clinical markers of neurodegeneration, further suggesting its involvement in the development of presumed synucleinopathies.

However, its complex structure and high molecular weight limit its usefulness as an in vivo pharmacological tool. Alternatively, the novel and brain penetrant Y-2 receptor antagonist, JNJ-31020028 is a useful tool to investigate the in vivo function of the Y-2 receptor. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of chronic intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of JNJ-31020028 in a battery of behavioral tests in an animal model that mimics several deficits observed in the human depression, the OBX rat. Chronic administration of JNJ-31020028 induced a decrease in immobility time in the forced swim test in OBX while had no effect in control animals. Additionally, it decreased number of grooming events in OBX animals, but had no effects on some other behavioral deficits observed such as rearing and hyperlocomotion. Furthermore, JNJ-31020028 had no effect on behavior tests that are commonly used to evaluate anxiety, namely the social interaction test in both OBX and control animals. These data indicate that similar to BIIE0246, JNJ-31020028 also has antidepressant like effects in the OBX model. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, the type of NPY receptor implicated could be different in NPY-induced secretion in hLEECs and hREECs. Using immunofluorescence coupled to real 3D confocal microscopy and ELISA, our results showed that stimulation of secretion by NPY induced the release of ET-1 from both right and left human ventricular endocardial endothelial cells (hEECs) in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the secretory capacity of hREECs was higher than that of hLEECs. In addition, our results showed that the effect of NPY on ET-1 secretion in hLEECs was only due to activation of Y-5 receptors. However, the effect of NPY on ET-1 secretion in hREECs was due to mainly Y-2 and partially Y-5 receptors activation. In conclusion, our results suggest that differences in excitation-secretion coupling exist between hREECS and hLEECs which may contribute to the functional differences between right and left ventricular muscle. Furthermore, high NPY level contributes to ET-1 release by hEECs and Y-2 and Y-5 receptors antagonists may be used for regulation of ET-1 secretion in the heart. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Sexual function and autonomic dysreflexia in men with spinal cord injuries: how should we treat?	SPINAL CORD			English	Review						spinal cord injury; ejaculation; autonomic dysreflexia; adalat; nifedipine	PENILE VIBRATORY STIMULATION; SYMPATHETIC PREGANGLIONIC NEURONS; RECTAL PROBE ELECTROSTIMULATION; SHOCK-WAVE LITHOTRIPSY; BLOOD-PRESSURE; NIFEDIPINE PRETREATMENT; INDUCED HYPERTENSION; MANAGEMENT; EJACULATION; ELECTROEJACULATION	Study design: Systematic review. Objectives: Review the literature on the acute or prophylactic treatment of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in the context of sexual activities. Setting: International Methods: Medline search using AD and spinal cord injury (SCI). Selected titles for AD treatment included all levels of evidence (randomized placebo control studies, case reports, literature reviews) and all years of publication. Results: Thirty-seven papers on the specific treatment of AD showed that nifedipine, prazosin, captopril and clonidine are candidates in the context of sexual activities. Prazosin, however, has an initial hypotensive effect requiring to begin treatment 12h before intercourse, which makes it less ideal for spontaneous sexual activities. Captopril has an initial hypotensive effect and was only studied in acute AD. Its usefulness in prophylaxis remains to be demonstrated. Clonidine has successfully been used clinically for decades, but never studied in randomized control trials. Nifedipine remains the most widely studied and significant treatment of AD whether in acute or prophylactic conditions. Recent concerns suggest increased cardiovascular risks with sublingual nifedipine in non-SCI populations, but negative long-term effects have not been reported in the SCI population. Conclusion: Sexual function is a priority for men with SCI. As sexual activities, in particular ejaculation, can be a source of AD, adequate treatments and prophylaxis must be considered in the context of sexual activities. Experts must meet and conclude on the thresholds, parameters and treatments that should be considered in the long-term management of AD in the context of sexual function in men with SCI.

Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Lipid Accumulation in the Human Diaphragm during Mechanical Ventilation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction; oxidative stress; mitochondrial DNA; metabolic oversupply; diaphragmatic fatigue	INSULIN-RESISTANCE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; WEANING FAILURE; DNA DELETIONS; HUMAN-CELLS; DISEASE; ACTIVATION; EXERCISE	Rationale: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with adverse effects on the diaphragm, but the cellular basis for this phenomenon, referred to as ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD), is poorly understood. Objectives: To determine whether mitochondrial function and cellular energy status are disrupted in human diaphragms after MV, and the role of mitochondria-derived oxidative stress in the development of VIDD. Methods: Diaphragm and biceps specimens obtained from brain-dead organ donors who underwent MV (15-176 h) and age-matched control subjects were compared regarding mitochondrial enzymatic function, mitochondrial DNA integrity, lipid content, and metabolic gene and protein expression. In addition, diaphragmatic force and oxidative stress after exposure to MV for 6 hours were evaluated in mice under different conditions. Measurements and Main Results: In human MV diaphragms, mitochondrial biogenesis and content were down-regulated, with a more specific defect of respiratory chain cytochrome-c oxidase. Laser capture microdissection of cytochrome-c oxidase deficient fibers revealed mitochondrial DNA deletions, consistent with damage from oxidative stress. Diaphragmatic lipid accumulation and responses of master cellular metabolic sensors (AMP-activated protein kinase and sirtuins) were consistent with energy substrate excess as a possible stimulus for these changes. In mice, induction of hyper-lipidemia worsened diaphragmatic oxidative stress during MV, whereas transgenic overexpression of a mitochondria-localized antioxidant (peroxiredoxin-3) was protective against VIDD. Conclusions: Our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction lies at the nexus between oxidative stress and the impaired diaphragmatic contractility that develops during MV. Energy substrate oversupply relative to demand, resulting from diaphragmatic inactivity during MV, could play an important role in this process.

Pitch deafness provides an interesting opportunity to test for the independence of perception and production abilities in the speech domain. We tested eight amusics and eight matched controls for their ability to perceive pitch shifts in sentences and to imitate those same sentences. Congenital amusics were impaired in their ability to discriminate, but not to imitate different intonations in speech. These findings support the idea that, when we hear a vocally-imitatable sound, our brains encode it in two distinct ways- an abstract code, which allows us to identify it and compare it to other sounds, and a vocal-motor code, which allows us to imitate it.

First published September 19, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.01071.2011.-It is often suggested that decisions are made when accumulated sensory information reaches a fixed accuracy criterion. This is supported by many studies showing a gradual build up of neural activity to a threshold. However, the proposal that this build up is caused by sensory accumulation is challenged by findings that decisions are based on information from a time window much shorter than the build-up process. Here, we propose that in natural conditions where the environment can suddenly change, the policy that maximizes reward rate is to estimate evidence by accumulating only novel information and then compare the result to a decreasing accuracy criterion. We suggest that the brain approximates this policy by multiplying an estimate of sensory evidence with a motor-related urgency signal and that the latter is primarily responsible for neural activity build up. We support this hypothesis using human behavioral data from a modified random-dot motion task in which motion coherence changes during each trial.

JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						SCI; spine; surgery; traumatic SCI	SURGICAL INTERVENTION; FRACTURE FIXATION; STABILIZATION; MANAGEMENT; HEALTH; DECOMPRESSION; OUTCOMES; IMPACT	Although there is a trend toward performing early surgery for traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), it remains unclear whether this tendency leads to decreased costs and length of stay (LOS) for acute care. This study determined the impact of surgical timing on costs and LOS after a traumatic SCI. A total of 477 consecutive patients sustaining an acute traumatic SCI and receiving surgery at a level I trauma center were included. A general linear model was used to assess the relationship among costs, LOS, and surgical delay, while accounting for various sociodemographic and clinical covariables. The analysis was also repeated with surgical delay dichotomized within 24 h or later after the trauma. Mean costs and LOS for all patients were respectively 24,156 +/- 17,244 $CAD and 35.0 +/- 39.4 days. The costs of acute care hospitalization were related to the surgical delay between the trauma and the surgery, in addition to age, injury severity score (ISS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, and neurological level. LOS was associated with the surgical delay dichotomized into two groups (<24 vs. >= 24 h), as well as with age, ISS, ASIA grade, and neurological level. This study suggests that resource utilization in terms of costs and LOS for the acute hospitalization is decreased with early surgery after an acute traumatic SCI, particularly if the procedure is performed within 24 h following the trauma. Performing the surgery as early as possible when the patient is cleared for surgery could lower the financial burden on the healthcare system, while optimizing the neurological recovery.

Results One SNP (rs1329650) from a non-coding RNA (LOC100188947) was significantly associated with overall ADHD diagnosis with the C* risk allele being over-transmitted from parents to children with ADHD (p=0.02). It was also over-transmitted to children with higher scores on Conners' Parents (p=0.01) and Conners' Teacher (p=0.002) index scores, and Child Behaviour Checklist withdrawn (p=0.001) and aggressive (p=0.007) behaviours. Children with poorer performances on executive and attention tasks were more likely to inherit the risk allele. Conclusions The C* allele of rs1329650 may be increasing the risk for ADHD and smoking behaviour through a common mechanism, possibly externalising behaviours and specific cognitive deficits that manifest as ADHD in childhood and are the gateway to smoking behaviour later in life. This exploratory study illustrates the use of comorbid disorders to investigate ADHD genetics. In spite of its relatively large sample size, replication in future studies is warranted.

Highly Penetrant Alterations of a Critical Region Including BDNF in Human Psychopathology and Obesity	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR GENE; COPY NUMBER VARIATION; KNOCKOUT MICE; TARGETED DISRUPTION; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; SOCIAL DEFEAT; WAGR SYNDROME; HUMAN GENOME; BRAIN; ASSOCIATION	Context: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is suspected of being a causative factor in psychiatric disorders based on case reports or studies involving large structural anomalies. Objective: To determine the involvement of BDNF in human psychopathology. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization data from 7 molecular diagnostic centers including 38 550 affected subjects and 28 705 unaffected subjects. Patients: Subjects referred to diagnostic screening centers for microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization for physical or cognitive impairment. Main Outcome Measures: Genomic copy number gains and losses. Results: We report 5 individuals with psychopathology and genomic deletion of a critical region including BDNF. The defined critical region was never disrupted in control subjects or diagnostic cases without developmental abnormalities. Conclusion: Hemizygosity of the BDNF region contributes to variable psychiatric phenotypes including anxiety, behavioral, and mood disorders.

The first discovery, published in 1967, revealed that peptide hormones are derived from endoproteolytic cleavages of larger precursor polypeptides. It was the foundation of the prohormone theory. Initially thought to apply to a few hormones, the theory rapidly extended to many proteins, including neuropeptides, neurotrophins, growth and transcription factors, receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, bacterial toxins, and viral glycoproteins. Its endoproteolytic activation mechanism has become a fundamental cellular process, affecting many biological functions. It implied the existence of specific endoproteolytic enzymes. These proprotein convertases were discovered in 1990. They have been shown to play a wide range of important roles in health and disease. They have opened up novel therapeutic avenues. Inactivation of PCSK9 to reduce plasma cholesterol is currently the most promising. To make this good thing even better, I recently discovered in a French Canadian family a potent PCSK9 (Gln152His) mutation that significantly lowers plasma cholesterol and should confer cardiovascular longevity. The discovery helped me to complete the loop: "From the bedside to the bench and back to the bedside."

Mitotoxicity and bortezomib-induced chronic painful peripheral neuropathy	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Acetyl-L-carnitine; Chemotherapy neuropathy; Proteasome inhibitor; Sensory neuropathy	ACETYL-L-CARNITINE; RAT SCIATIC-NERVE; CELL LUNG-CANCER; MULTIPLE-MYELOMA; MITOCHONDRIAL APOPTOSIS; PROTEASOME INHIBITOR; MUSCLE MITOCHONDRIA; LANGERHANS CELLS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; SENSORY NEURONS	Many of the most effective anti-cancer drugs induce a dose-limiting peripheral neuropathy that compromises therapy. Evidence from animal models of chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy produced by the taxane agent, paclitaxel, and the platinum-complex agent, oxaliplatin, indicate that they produce neuropathy via a common mechanism a toxic effect on the mitochondria in primary afferent sensory neurons. Bortezomib is from the proteasome-inhibitor class of chemotherapeutics. It also produces a close-limiting peripheral neuropathy, but its effects on neuronal mitochondria are unknown. To investigate this, we developed a model of bortezomib-induced painful peripheral neuropathy in the rat and assessed mitochondrial function (respiration and ATP production) in sciatic nerve samples harvested at two time points: day 7, which is three days after treatment and before pain appears, and day 35, which is one month post-treatment and the time of peak pain severity. We found significant deficits in Complex l-mediated and Complex II-mediated respiration, and in ATP production at both time points. Prophylactic treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine, which has previously been shown to prevent paclitaxel- and oxaliplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and pain, completely blocked bortezomib's effects on mitochondria and pain. These results suggest that mitotoxicity may be the core pathology for all chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and that drugs that protect mitochondrial function may be useful chemotherapy adjuncts.

Additionally, relationships between specific beliefs about uncertainty (Uncertainty Has Negative Behavioral and Self-Referent Implications [IUS-NI], and Uncertainty Is Unfair and Spoils Everything [IUS-US]) and interpretations were explored. The first hypothesis (that the clinical groups would report more concern for negative, positive, and ambiguous situations than would the CTRL group) was supported. The second hypothesis (that the GAD group would report more concern for ambiguous situations than would the ANX group) was not supported; both groups reported similar levels of concern for ambiguous situations. Exploratory analyses revealed no differences between the GAD and ANX groups in their interpretations of positive and negative situations. Finally, the IUS-US predicted interpretations of negative and ambiguous situations in the full sample, whereas the IUS-NI did not. Clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A prospective study of physician-observed concussion during a varsity university hockey season: metabolic changes in ice hockey players. Part 4 of 4	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Article						concussion; ice hockey; magnetic resonance imaging; magnetic resonance spectroscopy; sex; Canada	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SPORTS CONCUSSION; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MILD; ASSOCIATION; STATEMENT	Object. Despite negative neuroimaging findings using traditional neuroimaging methods such as MRI and CT, sports-related concussions have been shown to cause neurometabolic changes in both the acute and subacute phases of head injury. However, no prospective clinical study has used an independent physician-observer design in the monitoring of these changes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of repetitive concussive and subconcussive head impacts on neurometabolic concentrations in a prospective study of two Canadian Interuniversity Sports (CIS) ice hockey teams using MR spectroscopy (MRS). Methods. Forty-five ice hockey players (25 men and 20 women) participated in this study. All participants underwent pre- and postseason MRI, including spectroscopy imaging, using a 3-T MRI machine. The linear combination model was used to quantify the following ratios: glutamate/creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr), myoinositol/Cr, and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr. Individuals sustaining a medically diagnosed concussion were sent for MRI at 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 2 months after injury. Results. No statistically significant differences were observed between athletes who were diagnosed with a concussion and athletes who were not clinically diagnosed as sustaining a concussion. Although no statistically significant longitudinal metabolic changes were observed among athletes who were diagnosed with a concussion, the results demonstrated a predictable pattern of initial impairment, followed by a gradual return to ratios that were similar to, but lower than, baseline ratios. No significant pre- to postseason changes were demonstrated among men who were not observed to sustain a concussion. However, a substantively significant decrease in the NAA/Cr ratio was noted among the female hockey players (t((13)) = 2.58, p = 0.02, eta(2) = 0.34). Conclusions. A key finding in this study, from the standpoint of future research design, is the demonstration of substantively significant metabolic changes among the players who were not diagnosed with a concussion. In addition, it may explain why there are few statistically significant differences demonstrated between players who were diagnosed with a concussion and players who were not diagnosed with a concussion (that is, the potency of the independent variable was diminished by the fact that the group of players not diagnosed with a concussion might be better described as a subgroup of the players who may have sustained a concussion but were not observed and diagnosed with a concussion). This result suggests that definitions of concussion may need to be revisited within sports with high levels of repetitive subconcussive head impacts. Future analysis of these data will examine the relationships between the modes of MRI (diffusion tensor imaging, MRS, and susceptibility-weighted MR imaging) used in this study, along with other more sensitive evaluative techniques. This type of intermodal comparison may improve the identification of concussions that were previously dependent on the unreliable self-reporting of recognized concussion symptomatology by the athlete or on poorly validated neuropsychological tests.

Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), often referred to as concussion when it occurs in sports, produces persistent cognitive problems in at least 15% of patients. Unfortunately, conventional neuropsychological tests usually yield results within normal limits in this population. The main objective of this event-related potential (ERP) study was to understand brain functioning during the performance of a working memory (WM) task in patients who have sustained an MTBI, mostly due to motor vehicle accident or sports concussion. This study also aimed for a better understanding of the association between brain functioning as measured with ERP, behavioral performance on the WM task, postconcussion symptoms, type of injury (that is, sports concussion vs other types), and time since the injury. Methods. Forty-four patients with MTBI (7.6 +/- 8.4 months postinjury) were tested on a visual WM task with simultaneous recording of ERP, and were compared with 40 control volunteers who were their equivalent for age and sex. Amplitude and latency of frontal (N200 and N350) and parietal (P200 and P300) ERP waves were measured and were compared between groups. Correlation analyses were also performed between ERP characteristics, clinical variables, and behavioral performance. Results. A significant group difference was found for behavioral performance on the WM task, in which the MTBI group had a lower percentage of correct answers than the control group (p < 0.05). The patients with MTBI also had smaller amplitudes of both frontal N350 and parietal P300 ERP components when compared with control volunteers (p < 0.05). No changes were found for latency of ERP components. Smaller ERP amplitudes were associated with slower reaction times and worse accuracy on the WM task among patients with MTBI (p < 0.05). Types of injury (that is, sports concussion vs other mechanisms) were not associated with different ERP characteristics. Conclusions. Abnormal ERP results are observed in patients after MTBI or sports concussion, even for those in the nonacute stage after their injury. Current standard clinical evaluations most often fail to detect cerebral dysfunction after MTBI, even when patients or athletes report symptoms. Clinicians should be aware that patients with MTBI, including sports concussion, probably have underlying mild but persistent cerebral dysfunctions that require further investigation.

A structured review was conducted to identify assessment tools used to measure executive function in relation to driving and to describe these tools according to: (i) specific executive function components assessed; (ii) the tools validity in predicting safe driving; and (iii) clinical utility. Methods: Sixty-nine articles were reviewed, identifying 53 executive function tools/assessments used in driving research. Each tool was critically appraised and the findings were compiled in a Driving Executive Function Tool Guide. Results: Among the 53 tools, there were 27 general assessments of cognition, 19 driving-specific and seven activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living assessments. No single tool measured all executive function components: working memory was the most common (n = 20/53). Several tools demonstrated strong predictive validity and clinical utility. For example, tools, such as the Trail Making Test and the Maze Task, have the shortest administration time (i.e. often less than 10 minutes) and the most easily accessible method of administration (i.e. pen and paper or verbal). Driving-specific tools range from short questionnaires, such as the 10-minute Manchester Driving Behaviour Questionnaire, to more complex tools requiring about 45 minutes to administer. Conclusions and significance of the study: The appropriateness of a tool depends on the individual being assessed and on practical constraints of the clinical context. The Driving Executive Function Tool Guide provides useful information that should facilitate decision-making and selection of appropriate executive function tools in relation to driving.

The intrinsic molecular and signaling mechanisms involved are, however, poorly documented. Drug targeting of such translocation event performed by circulating microbes and immune cells may prevent secondary cerebral infections and development of brain pathologies. In this study, we specifically investigated the in vitro targeting efficacy of the chemopreventive and dietary-derived epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) molecule on the NF-kappa B-mediated transcriptional regulation of a panel of 89 biomarkers associated with promyelocytic HL-60 differentiation into macrophages. NF-kappa B-mediated signaling during HL-60 macrophage differentiation was reversed by EGCG, in part through reduced I kappa B phosphorylation and led to the inhibition of moderately to highly expressed NF-kappa B gene targets among which the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. In contrast, EGCG exhibited low efficacy in reversing NF-kappa B-regulated genes and showed selective antagonism toward COX-2 expression while that of MMP-9 remained high in terminally differentiated macrophages. Decreased expression of the 67-kDa non-integrin Laminin Receptor in terminally differentiated macrophages may explain such differential EGCG efficacy. Our results suggest that terminally differentiated macrophage transendothelial migration associated with neuroinflammation may not be pharmacologically affected by such a specific class of flavonoid. The differentiation status of a given in vitro cell model must therefore be carefully considered for optimized assessment of therapeutic drugs.

Preliminary evidence using retinal explant cultures qualitatively suggested that Ikaros-positive RPCs might share a common lineage with Ikaros-negative RPCs. Results: To explore further this question in vivo in a quantitative manner, we generated BAC transgenic mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase under the regulatory elements of the Ikaros gene, and crossed them with Cre reporter lines. Different transgenic lines labeled a variable number of RPCs, resulting in either dense or sparse radial arrays of reporter-positive progenies. Analysis of over 800 isolated cell arrays, which are most likely clones, confirmed that Ikaros-expressing RPCs generate both early- and late-born cell types in the same lineage, and that the overall cell composition of the arrays closely resembles that of the population of the mature retina. Interestingly, another sparse line did not label arrays, but appeared to specifically reflect Ikaros postmitotic expression in amacrine and ganglion cells. Conclusions: These mouse lines confirm the unbiased potential of the Ikaros lineage in vivo and provide novel tools for clonal lineage tracing and single neuron tracking in the retina.

The response rate was 73% for pediatric and 49% for adult neurologists. Most pediatric neurologists do not have a patient transition program or policy in place. Although a transfer summary is commonly provided, critical information is often lacking. Nearly half of neurologists believed that patients experience a gap in care during the transition process, and most agreed that the transition process is often poorly coordinated, highlighting patient, family, and health care factors. Current practice does not follow existing consensus statements for transition of care with respect to timing, communication, and preparation, and many pediatric neurologists experience difficulty in finding an appropriate adult health care provider for their patients. Neurologists reported many challenges in the current transition of care process.

Failure of rewarding and locomotor stimulant doses of morphine to promote adult rat 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Ultrasonic vocalizations; Rat; Morphine; Opioid; Amphetamine; Reward; Conditioned place preference; Locomotor activity	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; FEMALE RATS; AMPHETAMINE; COCAINE; DRUGS; CALLS; RECEPTORS; CONTEXT; BRAIN	Frequency-modulated 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are emitted by adult rats in response to psychostimulants and non-pharmacological appetitive stimuli and thus have been proposed to model positive affect. The main aim was to determine whether rewarding doses of morphine increase 50-kHz call rate or alter the relative prevalence of the trill call subtype. In experiment 1, USVs were recorded from adult male Long-Evans rats after subchronic morphine (1 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC)) administration, acute challenge with morphine (1 and 3 mg/kg SC) or amphetamine (1 mg/kg IP, positive control), and in conjunction with locomotor activity tests with morphine (1 and 3 mg/kg SC). In experiments 2 and 3, the USV altering, rewarding, and locomotor effects of morphine were examined using a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure. In experiment 1, morphine (1 mg/kg) initially suppressed calling; rats became tolerant to this effect with repeated exposure. Tested subsequently in singly- and pair-tested rats, morphine markedly decreased USVs but significantly increased locomotor activity. In experiments 2 and 3, morphine produced a significant CPP without increasing either unconditioned or conditioned USV emission. Morphine did not detectably alter the relative prevalence of 50-kHz call subtypes. Although 50-kHz calls, and the trill call subtype in particular, have been proposed as an animal model of positive mood, not all euphoriant drugs acutely increase the rate of 50-kHz calling or consistently promote trill calls.

To achieve this goal we sought to investigate NGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and its role in the C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts and myotubes. RT-PCR and western blotting experiments demonstrated expression of p75(NTR), alpha 9 beta 1 integrin, and its regulator ADAM12, but not trkA in the cells, as also found in gastrocnemius and quadriceps mice muscles. Both proNGF and beta NGF induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, a process blocked by (a) the specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059; (b) VLO5, a MLD-disintegrin with relative selectivity towards alpha 9 beta 1 integrin; and (c) p75(NTR) antagonists Thx-B and LM-24, but not the inactive control molecule backbone Thx. Upon treatment for 4 days with either anti-NGF antibody or VLO5 or Thx-B, the proliferation of myoblasts was decreased by 60-70%, 85-90% and 60-80% respectively, indicative of trophic effect of NGF which was autocrinically released by the cells. Exposure of myotubes to ischemic insult in the presence of beta NGF, added either 1 h before oxygen-glucose-deprivation or concomitant with reoxygenation insults, resulted with about 20% and 33% myoprotection, an effect antagonized by VLO5 and Thx-B, further supporting the trophic role of NGF in C2C12 cells. Cumulatively, the present findings propose that proNGF and beta NGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells by functional cooperation between p75(NTR) and alpha 9 beta 1 integrin, which are involved in myoprotective effects of autocrine released NGF. Furthermore, the present study establishes an important trophic role of alpha 9 beta 1 in NGF-induced signaling in skeletal muscle model, resembling the role of trkA in neurons. Future molecular characterization of the interactions between NGF receptors in the skeletal muscle will contribute to the understanding of NGF mechanism of action and may provide novel therapeutic targets.

Examining the neural impact of pediatric concussion: a scoping review of multimodal and integrative approaches using functional and structural MRI techniques	CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS			English	Review						brain injury; concussion; neuroimaging	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; HEAD-INJURY; WORKING-MEMORY; ABNORMALITIES; INHIBITION; CHILDREN; RETURN; FMRI	Purpose of review This study presents the findings from a scoping review of recent, original research investigating changes in brain structure and/or function following pediatric concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using MRI and functional MRI techniques. Recent findings Our scoping review identified only five studies, two of which were focused specifically on sports-related concussion. A common finding across studies was that traditional structural methods such as anatomical T1, T2, and even susceptibility-weighted MRI failed to reveal abnormalities in brain structure following pediatric concussion/mTBI. Although data suggest alterations in brain function associated with concussion, correlation with changes in performance is inconsistently found, possibly because of the use of compensatory cerebral mechanisms or alternate pathways while the brain is still dysfunctional. Summary In conclusion, the literature describing neuroimaging investigations of pediatric concussion is too scarce to allow the formulation of definitive conclusions regarding the impact of concussion on the developing brain. There is a dire need for longitudinal, multisite investigations focused on a wider age range and recovery period.	[Keightley, M.

The treatment of spasticity involves a multifaceted approach that includes pharmacological treatment with antispasmodics, physical therapy to maintain range of motion and prevent contractures, as well as a variety of orthopedic and neurosurgical interventions. Pharmacological agents currently used in clinical practice to treat spasticity in children have existed for almost two decades and continue to be used despite lack of solid evidence for their efficacy. Studies detailing safety profiles and optimal dosing in the pediatric population are greatly warranted. Intramuscular injection of botulinum neurotoxin is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of segmental spasticity and current literature suggests it is safe and effective (Level A). Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are emerging as effective interventions in improving motor function in hemiplegic CP. However, the role of these as of yet > interventions in reducing spasticity remains to be clarified.

CNTF is a cytoplasmic factor believed to be released upon cellular damage, while CLC requires interaction with a soluble cytokine receptor, cytokine-like factor 1 (CLF), to be efficiently secreted. Both cytokines activate a receptor complex comprising the cytokine binding CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR alpha) and two signaling chains namely, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFR beta) and gp130. Human CNTF can recruit and activate an alternative receptor in which CNTFR alpha is substituted by IL-6R alpha. As both CNTF and CLC have immune-regulatory activities in mice, we compared their ability to recruit mouse receptors comprising both gp130 and LIFR beta signaling chains and either IL-6R alpha or IL-11R alpha which, unlike CNTFR alpha, are expressed by immune cells. Our results indicate that 1) mouse CNTF, like its human homologue, can activate cells expressing gp130/LIFR beta with either CNTFR alpha or IL-6R alpha and, 2) CLC/CLF is more restricted in its specificity in that it activates only the tripartite CNTFR. Several gp130 signaling cytokines influence T helper cell differentiation. We therefore investigated the effect of CNTF on CD4T cell cytokine production. We observed that CNTF increased the number of IFN-gamma producing CD4T cells. As IFN-gamma is considered a mediator of the therapeutic effect of IFN-beta in multiple sclerosis, induction of IFN-gamma by CNTF may contribute to the beneficial immunomodulatory effect of CNTF in mouse multiple sclerosis models. Together, our results indicate that CNTF activates the same tripartite receptors in mouse and human cells and further validate rodent models for pre-clinical investigation of CNTF and CNTF derivatives. Furthermore, CNTF and CLC/CLF differ in their receptor specificities. The receptor alpha chain involved in the immunomodulatory effects of CLC/CLF remains to be identified.

As such, rTMS can be used in conjunction with conventional physiotherapy or occupational therapy to facilitate rehabilitation of motor function in patients with focal brain lesions. This review summarizes the rationale for using rTMS in the rehabilitation of motor deficits as derived from imaging and electrophysiological studies of the human motor system. rTMS methodology and its various stimulation modalities are introduced and current evidence for rTMS as supportive therapy for the rehabilitation of chronic motor deficits is discussed.

J	Gamache, K; Pitman, RK; Nader, K				Gamache, Karine; Pitman, Roger K.; Nader, Karim			Preclinical Evaluation of Reconsolidation Blockade by Clonidine as a Potential Novel Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						clonidine; memory; reconsolidation; fear conditioning; alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist; posttraumatic stress disorder	FEAR MEMORY RECONSOLIDATION; ALPHA(2A)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTORS; CAMBODIAN PATIENTS; AMYGDALA; INHIBITION; SUBTYPE; PERFORMANCE; DISRUPTION; GUANFACINE	Exposure to traumatic events can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current PTSD treatments typically only produce partial improvement. Hence, there is a need for preclinical research to identify new candidate drugs and to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Animal studies have indicated that fear memories can be weakened by blocking restabilization after retrieval, a process known as reconsolidation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that there are important alterations of the noradrenergic system in PTSD, and hence it may be of interest to study drugs that target this pathway. Here, we investigated the efficacy of clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, to block reconsolidation in an animal model of persistent traumatic memories. Using an auditory fear conditioning paradigm in rats, we tested the efficacy of clonidine to weaken fear memory retention when administered systemically after retrieval. We evaluated dosage, number of treatments, and specificity in reconsolidation blockade. We found that postretrieval administration of clonidine disrupts fear-related memories in a dose-dependent manner and that two treatments are sufficient for maximal memory impairment. Furthermore, we determined that this effect is long lasting and specific to reconsolidation processes as shown by the selectivity to affect reactivated memories and the absence of spontaneous recovery and of postreactivation short-term memory impairment. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of systemic administration of clonidine following retrieval to persistently disrupt fear memory retention through reconsolidation blockade. This study provides important preclinical parameters for future therapeutic strategies involving clonidine to block reconsolidation as a novel treatment for PTSD symptoms.

Data Sources: A thorough search for English-language publications and "in process'' articles dating from 1948 to December 2011 was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE. Study Selection: The principal criteria were patients having had microsurgery or radiation therapy as their sole treatment, with a follow-up of at least 5 years, and a useful hearing level at diagnosis. Data Extraction: Sixteen studies met our criteria. Hearing preservation outcome (worse or preserved) and tumor outcome (failure, control) data, as well as all other significant observations, were collected from the articles. Stereotactic radiation was the only radiation therapy analyzed. Data Synthesis: The Pearson chi(2) test was our primary statistical analysis. Conclusion: Stereotactic radiation showed significantly better long-term hearing preservation outcome rates than microsurgery (p < 0.001). However, long-term tumor outcome was not significantly different in stereotactic radiation as compared with microsurgery (p = 0.122). Although stereotactic radiation demonstrates a more favorable long-term hearing preservation outcome as compared with microsurgery, additional studies are required to provide the medical field with a better understanding of vestibular schwannoma treatment.

He additionally proposed that social safeness, characterized by feelings of warmth and connectedness, plays an especially important role in psychosocial functioning. We tested various aspects of this theory through a 7-day daily diary study in which 51 male and 51 female students completed measures of social safeness, NA, PA, perceived social support (PSS), and received social support (RSS) every evening. First, social safeness emerged as operationally distinct from low NA, PA, and PSS. Second, participants who endorsed higher mean levels of RSS over the week had higher mean levels of safeness, and social safeness was higher on days when participants reported higher RSS than their mean. Third, social safeness was more strongly related to numerous indicators of vulnerability and psychopathology than NA, PA, and PSS, and it predicted these variables controlling for NA, PA, and PSS. Results support the theory that social safeness is a distinct affective experience that responds to affiliation and offers unique protection from psychosocial suffering.

The association of psychotropic medication use with the cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric trajectory of Alzheimer's disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; antidepressants; antipsychotics; SSRI; cognition; psychosocial function; neuropsychiatric symptoms; epidemiology; pharmacoepidemiology	ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS; CACHE COUNTY; DEMENTIA; PROGRESSION; DEPRESSION; PLACEBO; RISK; AD; BENEFICIARIES; METAANALYSIS	Objective The use of psychotropic medications in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with both deleterious and potentially beneficial outcomes. We examined the longitudinal association of psychotropic medication use with cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) trajectories among community-ascertained incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study. Methods A total of 230 participants were followed for a mean of 3.7?years. Persistency index (PI) was calculated for all antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics (atypical and typical), and benzodiazepines as the proportion of observed time of medication exposure. Mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between PI for each medication class and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Total (NPI-Total) trajectories, controlling for appropriate demographic and clinical covariates. Results At baseline, psychotropic medication use was associated with greater severity of dementia and poorer medical status. Higher PI for all medication classes was associated with a more rapid decline in MMSE. For antidepressant, SSRI, benzodiazepine, and typical antipsychotic use, a higher PI was associated with a more rapid increase in CDR-Sum. For SSRIs, antipsychotics, and typical antipsychotics, a higher PI was associated with more rapid increase in NPI-Total. Conclusions Psychotropic medication use was associated with more rapid cognitive and functional decline in AD, and not with improved NPS. Clinicians may tend to prescribe psychotropic medications to AD patients at risk of poorer outcomes, but one cannot rule out the possibility of poorer outcomes being caused by psychotropic medications.

A Compartmental Model of Linear Resonance and Signal Transfer in Dendrites	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; LOCATION-DEPENDENT VARIABILITY; RAT HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; IN-VIVO; FREQUENCY PREFERENCES; SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; ORGANIZATION; INPUT	Dendrites carry signals between synapses and the soma and play a central role in neural computation. Although they contain many nonlinear ion channels, their signal-transfer properties are linear under some experimental conditions. In experiments with continuous-time inputs, a resonant linear two-port model has been shown to provide a near-perfect fit to the dendrite-to-soma input-output relationship. In this study, we focused on this linear aspect of signal transfer using impedance functions that replace biophysical channel models in order to describe the electrical properties of the dendritic membrane. The membrane impedance model of dendrites preserves the accuracy of the two-port model with minimal computational complexity. Using this approach, we demonstrate two membrane impedance profiles of dendrites that reproduced the experimentally observed two-port results. These impedance profiles demonstrate that the two-port results are compatible with different computational schemes. In addition, our model highlights how dendritic resonance can minimize the location-dependent attenuation of signals at the resonant frequency. Thus, in this model, dendrites function as linear-resonant filters that carry signals between nonlinear computational units.

Current estimates put the prevalence of amblyopia at approximately 1-3% 1-3, the majority of cases being monocular(2). Amblyopia is most frequently caused by ocular misalignment (strabismus), blur induced by unequal refractive error (anisometropia), and in some cases by form deprivation. Although amblyopia is initially caused by abnormal visual input in infancy, once established, the visual deficit often remains when normal visual input has been restored using surgery and/or refractive correction. This is because amblyopia is the result of abnormal visual cortex development rather than a problem with the amblyopic eye itself(4,5). Amblyopia is characterized by both monocular and binocular deficits(6,7) which include impaired visual acuity and poor or absent stereopsis respectively. The visual dysfunction in amblyopia is often associated with a strong suppression of the inputs from the amblyopic eye under binocular viewing conditions(8). Recent work has indicated that suppression may play a central role in both the monocular and binocular deficits associated with amblyopia(9,10). Current clinical tests for suppression tend to verify the presence or absence of suppression rather than giving a quantitative measurement of the degree of suppression. Here we describe a technique for measuring amblyopic suppression with a compact, portable device(11,12). The device consists of a laptop computer connected to a pair of virtual reality goggles. The novelty of the technique lies in the way we present visual stimuli to measure suppression. Stimuli are shown to the amblyopic eye at high contrast while the contrast of the stimuli shown to the non-amblyopic eye are varied. Patients perform a simple signal/noise task that allows for a precise measurement of the strength of excitatory binocular interactions. The contrast offset at which neither eye has a performance advantage is a measure of the "balance point" and is a direct measure of suppression. This technique has been validated psychophysically both in control(13,14) and patient(6,9,11) populations. In addition to measuring suppression this technique also forms the basis of a novel form of treatment to decrease suppression over time and improve binocular and often monocular function in adult patients with amblyopia(12,15,16). This new treatment approach can be deployed either on the goggle system described above or on a specially modified iPod touch device(15).

The advantages of using an IVSA paradigm to study the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse such as cocaine include the fact that the drug is self-administered instead of experimenter-administered, the schedule of reinforcement can be altered, and accurate measurement of the quantities of drug consumed as well as the timing and pattern of IV injections can be obtained. Furthermore, the intravenous route of administration avoids potential confounds related to first pass metabolism or taste, and produces rapid increases in blood and brain drug levels. As outlined in this video, intravenous self-administration can be obtained without prior food restriction or prior drug training following careful catheter placement during surgery and meticulous daily catheter flushing and maintenance. Experimental procedures outlined in this paper include a description of animal housing and acclimation methods, operant training using sweetened milk solutions, and catheter implantation surgery.

However, the effect of set shifting on the frontostriatal activity observed during the later trials within a series of same-set classifications has yet to be determined. Here, young healthy adults underwent the functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a card-sorting task in which the classification rule was provided prior to each trial. We observed a significant activation in the dorsolateral PFC, regardless of whether a set shift occurred or not. By contrast, the ventrolateral PFC and caudate nucleus showed an increased activity in both the shifting trials versus the control and in trials where the same rule was applied for a few trials before a set shift occurred, unlike trials where the same rule was applied for a longer period. Finally, decreased activity in the caudate nucleus correlated with an increasing trial position in trials where no set shift occurred, suggesting that the more a rule is executed, the better it is established. We argue that a new rule needs to be performed multiple times until the brain areas usually associated with the set shifting are no longer significantly required anymore.

Failure to do so may underlie some of the disabling social-emotional deficits common in a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been implicated in these processes, but the particular contributions of subregions within PFC remain unclear. We used a sensitive facial emotion rating task in patients with focal lesions to different regions within PFC to identify distinct contributions of 2 prefrontal regions to recognizing emotions from facial expressions. A combination of region-of-interest and voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping established that damage to ventromedial PFC impaired the detection of subtle facial expressions of emotion. Such patients had difficulty distinguishing emotional from neutral expressions. In contrast, patients with left ventrolateral PFC were able to detect the presence of emotional signals but had difficulty discriminating between specific emotions. These effects were regionally specific: Dorsomedial prefrontal damage had no effect on either aspect of emotion recognition. These findings suggest that separable processes relying critically on distinct regions within PFC responsible, on the one hand, for detecting emotional signals from facial expressions and, on the other, for correctly classifying such signals.

The relationship between cognition and NPS in PDD has not been well studied. Methods: Patients diagnosed with PDD were assessed for cognitive function and NPS. The instruments used were the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and semantic verbal fluency according to the recommendation of the Movement Disorder Society Task Force. Results: We evaluated 127 PDD patients (76 males/51 females; mean age 77 +/- 6.3 years). Their mean MMSE score was 17 +/- 6.5 and the mean NPI score was 19 +/- 20.4. The most prevalent NPI items were anxiety (57.5%), sleep problems (53.5%), and apathy (52.0%). Principal component factor analysis revealed that 12 items formed three factors, namely "mood and psychosis" (delusion, hallucination, agitation, depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability), "vegetative" (sleep and appetite problems), and "frontal" (euphoria, disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior). Symptoms of hallucination were significantly associated with MMSE score, even after controlling for the confounding variables. Conclusion: NPS are common and diverse among patients with PDD. Three specific subgroups of NPS were identified. Hallucination was significantly correlated with cognitive impairment, and could be a predictor of cognition in PDD patients.

However, the unique role of distinct parietal cortical subregions and their underlying white matter (WM) remains in question. In this study, we collected both magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data in normal participants, and evaluated their attention performance using attention network test (ANT), which could isolate three different attention components: alerting, orienting and executive control. Cortical thickness, surface area and DTI parameters were extracted from predefined PPL subregions and correlated with behavioural performance. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used for the voxel-wise statistical analysis. Results indicated structure-behaviour relationships on multiple levels. First, a link between the cortical thickness and WM integrity of the right inferior parietal regions and orienting performance was observed. Specifically, probabilistic tractography demonstrated that the integrity of WM connectivity between the bilateral inferior parietal lobules mediated the orienting performance. Second, the scores of executive control were significantly associated with the WM diffusion metrics of the right supramarginal gyrus. Finally, TBSS analysis revealed that alerting performance was significant correlated with the fractional anisotropy of local WM connecting the right thalamus and supplementary motor area.

Convergent Effects of Acute Stress and Glucocorticoid Exposure upon MAO-A in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MONOAMINE-OXIDASE-A; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; QUANTITATIVE ENZYME AUTORADIOGRAPHY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; HUMAN BRAIN; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; BINDING; SEROTONIN	Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), a key brain enzyme which metabolizes monoamines, is implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related illnesses, including major depressive disorder, addiction, and violent behavior. Chronic stressors and glucocorticoid-administration typically associate with elevated MAO-A levels/activity. However, the relationship of shorter stress or glucocorticoid exposures and MAO-A levels/activity is not well established. Our objectives are to assess effects of acute stress upon MAO-A V-T, an index of MAO-A density, in human brain and acute glucocorticoid exposure upon MAO-A levels in human neuronal and glial cell lines. Twelve healthy, non-smoking participants aged 18-50 underwent [C-11] harmine positron emission tomography to measure brain MAO-A VT on two different days: One under acute psychosocial stress (via Trier Social Stress and Montreal Imaging Stress Tasks) and one under a non-stress condition. MAO-A density (by Western blot) and activity (by [C-14]-5-HT metabolism and liquid scintillation spectroscopy) were measured in human neuronal and glial cell lines after 4 h exposure to dexamethasone. We observed a significant reduction in whole-brain MAO-A binding as reflected by reductions in 10 of 11 brain regions. Acute dexamethasone exposure in neuronal and glial cells significantly decreased MAO-Aactivity and protein levels. We observed a highly consistent relationship between acute stressors and glucocorticoid administration and decreased MAO-A binding, activity and protein levels. Since MAO-A metabolizes monoamines, this phenomenon may explain why acute stressors benefit healthy animals even though chronic stress is associated with illness.

While much work has recently focused on the mechanisms controlling self-renewing asymmetric divisions producing a differentiating daughter and a progenitor, little is known about mechanisms regulating how distinct differentiating cell types are produced at terminal divisions. Here we study the role of the endocytic adaptor protein Numb in the developing mouse retina. Using clonal numb inactivation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), we show that Numb is required for normal cell-cycle progression at early stages, but is dispensable for the production of self-renewing asymmetric cell divisions. At late stages, however, Numb is no longer required for cell-cycle progression, but is critical for the production of terminal asymmetric cell divisions. In the absence of Numb, asymmetric terminal divisions that generate a photoreceptor and a non-photoreceptor cell are decreased in favor of symmetric terminal divisions generating two photoreceptors. Using live imaging in retinal explants, we show that a Numb fusion protein is asymmetrically inherited by the daughter cells of some late RPC divisions. Together with our finding that Numb antagonizes Notch signaling in late-stage RPCs, and that blocking Notch signaling in late RPCs almost completely abolishes the generation of terminal asymmetric divisions, these results suggest a model in which asymmetric inheritance of Numb in sister cells of terminal divisions might create unequal Notch activity, which in turn drives the production of terminal asymmetric divisions.

Drosophila Vap-33 Is Required for Axonal Localization of Dscam Isoforms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; NETRIN RECEPTOR; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; GUIDANCE RECEPTORS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; PROTEIN VAPB; BINDING; DIVERSITY; MORPHOGENESIS	Mutations in VAPB have been identified in a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and reduced VAPB levels have been found in patients with sporadic ALS. Vap protein family members from different species and cell types have been implicated in a number of cellular functions, but how Vap dysfunction in neurons and/or muscles contributes to motor neuron degeneration and death is poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model organism, we show that Vap physically interacts with and affects the axonal functions of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam). Dscam is a cell-surface receptor involved in axon and dendritic patterning and neuron self-recognition and avoidance. Alternative splicing of the Dscam transcript leads to the production of Dscam isoforms that contain one of two possible transmembrane (TM) domain and flanking sequences that either restrict the isoform to dendrites and cell bodies(TM1) or target the isoform to axon processes (TM2). We find that Vap specifically interacts with Dscam isoforms that contain the TM2 cytoplasmic juxtamembrane flanking sequences. Using loss-of-function genetics, we further show that Vap is required for localization of Dscam isoforms containing TM2 to axons and that Vap loss suppresses Dscam gain-of-function axon phenotypes. We propose that Vap function is required in neurons to selectively traffic proteins to axons, and disruption of this function may contribute to the pathology of ALS.

How and when glutamate release by DA neurons might play this role remains unclear. Considering evidence for early expression of the type 2 vesicular glutamate transporter in mesencephalic DA neurons, we hypothesized that this cophenotype is particularly important during development. Using a conditional gene knock-out approach to selectively disrupt the Vglut2 gene in mouse DA neurons, we obtained in vitro and in vivo evidence for reduced growth and survival of mesencephalic DA neurons, associated with a decrease in the density of DA innervation in the nucleus accumbens, reduced activity-dependent DA release, and impaired motor behavior. These findings provide strong evidence for a functional role of the glutamatergic cophenotype in the development of mesencephalic DA neurons, opening new perspectives into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders involving the mesostriatal DA system.

J	Cousineau, M; McDermott, JH; Peretz, I				Cousineau, Marion; McDermott, Josh H.; Peretz, Isabelle			The basis of musical consonance as revealed by congenital amusia	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						music perception; aesthetic preferences; roughness	TONE-DEAFNESS; PITCH; PERCEPTION; DISSONANCE; INTERVALS; PREFERENCE; FUSION; DISCRIMINATION; FREQUENCY; DISORDER	Some combinations of musical notes sound pleasing and are termed "consonant," but others sound unpleasant and are termed "dissonant." The distinction between consonance and dissonance plays a central role in Western music, and its origins have posed one of the oldest and most debated problems in perception. In modern times, dissonance has been widely believed to be the product of "beating": interference between frequency components in the cochlea that has been believed to be more pronounced in dissonant than consonant sounds. However, harmonic frequency relations, a higher-order sound attribute closely related to pitch perception, has also been proposed to account for consonance. To tease apart theories of musical consonance, we tested sound preferences in individuals with congenital amusia, a neurogenetic disorder characterized by abnormal pitch perception. We assessed amusics' preferences for musical chords as well as for the isolated acoustic properties of beating and harmonicity. In contrast to control subjects, amusic listeners showed no preference for consonance, rating the pleasantness of consonant chords no higher than that of dissonant chords. Amusics also failed to exhibit the normally observed preference for harmonic over inharmonic tones, nor could they discriminate such tones from each other. Despite these abnormalities, amusics exhibited normal preferences and discrimination for stimuli with and without beating. This dissociation indicates that, contrary to classic theories, beating is unlikely to underlie consonance. Our results instead suggest the need to integrate harmonicity as a foundation of music preferences, and illustrate how amusia may be used to investigate normal auditory function.

([Dmt(1)-DALDA) was examined. Additionally, to increase the overall lipophilicity of [Dmt(1)]-DALDA and to investigate the Phe(3) side chain flexibility, the final amide bond was N-methylated and Phe(3) was replaced by a constrained aminobenzazepine analogue. The in vitro receptor binding and activity of the peptides, as well as their in vivo transport (brain in- and efflux and tissue biodistribution) and antinociceptive properties after peripheral administration (ip and sc) in mice were determined. The structural modifications result in significant shifts of receptor binding, activity, and transport, properties. Strikingly, while [Dmt(1)]-DALDA and its N-methyl analogue, Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-NMeLys-NH2, showed a long-lasting antinociceptive effect (>7 h), the peptides with D-Cit(2) generate potent antinociception more rapidly (maximal effect at 1h postinjection) but also lose their analgesic activity faster when compared to [Dmt(1)]-DALDA. and [Dmit(1),NMeLys(4)]-DALDA.

Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) attracts spinal cord commissural axons ventrally toward the floorplate. We show that after crossing the floorplate, commissural axons switch their response to Shh from attraction to repulsion, so that they are repelled anteriorly by a posterior-high/anterior-low Shh gradient along the longitudinal axis. This switch is recapitulated in vitro with dissociated commissural neurons as they age, indicating that the switch is intrinsic and time dependent. 14-3-3 protein inhibition converted Shh-mediated repulsion of aged dissociated neurons to attraction and prevented the correct anterior turn of postcrossing commissural axons in vivo, an effect mediated through PKA. Conversely, overexpression of 14-3-3 proteins was sufficient to drive the switch from Shh-mediated attraction to repulsion both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-dependent mechanism for a cell-intrinsic temporal switch in the polarity of axon turning responses.

In parallel, single-cell recording and functional neuroimaging studies have highlighted the importance of basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA) for timing. In a placebo-controlled, within-subject design, we combined event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging with aDA manipulation (acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion; APTD) in healthy volunteers to pinpoint the neuroanatomical and functional substrates of the DA modulation of timing. Behaviorally, APTD selectively impaired accuracy of perceptual timing, with no effect on performance of a color-control task matched for difficulty, working memory (WM), and attentional demands. Neurally, APTD attenuated timing-specific activity in the putamen and SMA. Notably, APTD-induced decreases in brain activity were directly correlated to APTD-induced impairments in timing performance. Moreover, APTD modulated timing-specific activity selectively during initial storage of the sample duration, but had no effect during its subsequent retrieval or comparison to a probe. Our results do not simply reflect DA modulation of WM since the color task controlled for the WM updating process necessary for timing of durations in the seconds range. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicated APTD effects on putamen and SMA were greater for subsecond (540 ms) than suprasecond (1080 ms) durations, when WM demands would actually be lower. Instead, we show for the first time in healthy humans that DA manipulation perturbs timing by attenuating the activity in putamen and SMA that mediates initial storage of temporal information into WM.

Wehypothesized that combining these strategies would augment the benefits. Objective To compare protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption in critically ill patients. Design, Setting, and Patients Randomized controlled trial of 430 critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults conducted in 16 tertiary care medical and surgical ICUs in Canada and the United States between January 2008 and July 2011. Intervention Continuous opioid and/or benzodiazepine infusions and random allocation to protocolized sedation (n=209) (control) or to protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption (n=214). Using validated scales, nurses titrated infusions to achieve light sedation. For patients receiving daily interruption, nurses resumed infusions, if indicated, at half of previous doses. Patients were assessed for delirium and for readiness for unassisted breathing. Main Outcome Measure Time to successful extubation. Secondary outcomes included duration of stay, doses of sedatives and opioids, unintentional device removal, delirium, and nurse and respiratory therapist clinical workload (on a 10-point visual analog scale [VAS]). Results Median time to successful extubation was 7 days in both the interruption and control groups (median [IQR], 7 [4-13] vs 7 [3-12]; interruption group hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.86-1.35; P=.52). Duration of ICU stay (median [IQR], 10 [5-17] days vs 10 [6-20] days; P=.36) and hospital stay (median [IQR], 20 [10-36] days vs 20 [10-48] days; P=.42) did not differ between the daily interruption and control groups, respectively. Daily interruption was associated with higher mean daily doses of midazolam (102 mg/d vs 82 mg/d; P=.04) and fentanyl (median [IQR], 550 [50-1850] vs 260 [0-1400]; P<.001) and more daily boluses of benzodiazepines (mean, 0.253 vs 0.177; P=.007) and opiates (mean, 2.18 vs 1.79; P<.001). Unintentional endotracheal tube removal occurred in 10 of 214 (4.7%) vs 12 of 207 patients (5.8%) in the interruption and control groups, respectively (relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.36-1.84; P=.64). Rates of delirium were not significantly different between groups (53.3% vs 54.1%; relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82-1.17; P=.83). Nurse workload was greater in the interruption group (VAS score, 4.22 vs 3.80; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66; P=.001). Conclusion For mechanically ventilated adults managed with protocolized sedation, the addition of daily sedation interruption did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU stay.

Surface roughness enhances the osseointegration of titanium headposts in non-human primates	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Non-human primate; Skull anchored headpost; Titanium implant; Surface texture; Osseointegration	RABBIT INTRAMEDULLARY MODEL; TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; BEHAVING MONKEYS; IMPLANT FIXATION; DENTAL IMPLANTS; BONE INGROWTH; TOPOGRAPHY; DEFECTS; ALLOY; ACID	It is well recognized that micrometer and nanometer sized surface features enhance the skeletal attachment of implants within bone. However, little is known regarding the integration of implants placed outside the bone but in contact with the surface. Loosening of chronic skull anchored headposts in non-human primate based experiments can be a factor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a simple and easily applied surface texture on bone apposition to titanium implants fixed to the periosteal surface of the skull. Implants possessed either a polished surface or a textured surface created by grit-basting followed by acid etching. The percent of bone in contact with the implant surface (bone apposition) to three polished and three textured implants was evaluated in one adult female monkey after 14 weeks. Upon harvest, implants were processed for undecalcified histology and regions of bone apposition were quantified using backscatter electron microscopy and digital image analysis. The bone apposition to textured implants was 62 +/- 20% and to polished implants was 42 +/- 21%. The application of a peak-and-pit like texture to the surface of titanium implants significantly increased bone apposition to titanium implants placed on the periosteal surface of the skull. This study demonstrates that titanium headposts can easily be modified to improve osseointegration using equipment and supplies available to most neurophysiological laboratories. In addition, implant texturing may have utility in areas including skeletal trauma and reconstruction where devices are placed in contact with the bone surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

They are also better markers of seizure onset zones compared to interictal spikes. There is thus an increasing number of studies analysing HFOs in vitro, in vivo and in the EEG of human patients with refractory epilepsy. However, most of these studies have focused on HFOs during interictal events or at seizure onset, and few have analysed HFOs during seizures. In this study, we are comparing three different automated methods of HFO detection to two methods of visual analysis, during the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal periods on multiple channels using the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The first method (method 1) detected HFOs using the average of the normalised period, the second (method 2) detected HFOs using the average of the normalised period in 1 s windows and the third (method 3) detected HFOs using the average of a reference period before seizure onset. Overall, methods 2 and 3 showed higher sensitivity compared to method 1. When dividing the analysed traces in pre-, ictal and post-ictal periods, method 3 showed the highest sensitivity during the ictal period compared to method 1, while method 2 was not significantly different from method 1. These findings suggest that method 3 could be used for automated and reliable detection of HFOs on large data sets containing multiple channels during the ictal period. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Inflammatory Cascades Driven by Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Play a Major Role in the Progression of Acute Liver Failure and Its Neurological Complications	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; ACETAMINOPHEN HEPATOTOXICITY; PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES; EXPERIMENTAL-MODEL; BRAIN EDEMA; MOUSE MODEL; MECHANISMS; INJURY; ENCEPHALOPATHY; ETANERCEPT	Background/aims: Acute liver failure (ALF) due to ischemic or toxic liver injury is a clinical condition that results from massive loss of hepatocytes and may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a serious neuropsychiatric complication. Although increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in liver, plasma and brain has been observed, conflicting results exist concerning its roles in drug-induced liver injury and on the progression of HE. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic value of etanercept, a TNF-alpha neutralizing molecule, on the progression of liver injury and HE in mice with ALF resulting from azoxymethane (AOM) hepatotoxicity. Methods/Principal Findings: Mice were administered saline or etanercept (10 mg/kg; i.p.) 30 minutes prior to, or up to 6 h after AOM. Etanercept-treated ALF mice were sacrificed in parallel with vehicle-treated comatose ALF mice and controls. AOM induced severe hepatic necrosis, leading to HE, and etanercept administered prior or up to 3 h after AOM significantly delayed the onset of coma stages of HE. Etanercept pretreatment attenuated AOM-induced liver injury, as assessed by histological examination, plasma ammonia and transaminase levels, and by hepatic glutathione content. Peripheral inflammation was significantly reduced by etanercept as shown by decreased plasma IL-6 (4.1-fold; p<0.001) and CD40L levels (3.7-fold; p<0.001) compared to saline-treated ALF mice. Etanercept also decreased IL-6 levels in brain (1.2-fold; p<0.05), attenuated microglial activation (assessed by OX-42 immunoreactivity), and increased brain glutathione concentrations. Conclusions: These results indicate that systemic sequestration of TNF-alpha attenuates both peripheral and cerebral inflammation leading to delayed progression of liver disease and HE in mice with ALF due to toxic liver injury. These results suggest that etanercept may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the management of ALF patients awaiting liver transplantation.

However, many individuals infected with resistant strains had not received antivirals. Whether drug-resistant viruses are initially present as minor variants in untreated individuals before they emerge as the dominant strain in a virus population is of great importance for predicting the speed at which resistance will arise. To address this issue, we used ultra-deep sequencing of viral populations from serial nasopharyngeal specimens from an immunocompromised child and from 2 individuals in a household outbreak. We observed that the Y275 mutation was present as a minor variant in infected hosts before the onset of therapy. We also found evidence for the transmission of this drug-resistant variant with drug-susceptible viruses. These observations provide important information on the relative fitness of the Y275 mutation in the absence of oseltamivir treatment.

We tested, in particular, the response of the rACC to the detection of different types of feedback, and to varying levels of outcome expectancy. We used a problem-solving task in which subjects had to discover, in successive trials, which one of the four presented stimuli was associated with a positive feedback, the other ones being associated with error feedback. In this task, two periods alternated: 1. an exploratory period in which error feedback indicated to adapt the following response appropriately (and continue to explore), and first positive feedback indicated to change strategy (i.e. to shift from explorative to exploitative behavior), and 2. an exploitative period in which subjects had to repeat the correct choice. The rACC is recruited in the exploratory period during the analysis of both error and first correct positive feedback. In addition, the rACC activity was modulated by positive reward prediction error values (i.e. the difference between obtained and expected feedback). Altogether, these results reveal the critical role of the rACC in the evaluation of salient feedback for learning optimal strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The usual approach proceeds by normalizing brain volumes to a common three-dimensional template. However, a large part of the data acquired in fMRI aims at localizing cortical activity, and methods working on the cortical surface may provide better inter-subject registration than the standard procedures that process the data in the volume. Nevertheless, few assessments of the performance of surface-based (2D) versus volume-based (3D) procedures have been shown so far, mostly because inter-subject cortical surface maps are not easily obtained. In this paper we present a systematic comparison of 2D versus 3D group-level inference procedures, by using cluster-level and voxel-level statistics assessed by permutation, in random effects (RFX) and mixed-effects analyses (MFX). We consider different schemes to perform meaningful comparisons between thresholded statistical maps in the volume and on the cortical surface. We find that surface-based multi-subject statistical analyses are generally more sensitive than their volume-based counterpart, in the sense that they detect slightly denser networks of regions when performing peak-level detection; this effect is less clear for cluster-level inference and is reduced by smoothing. Surface-based inference also increases the reliability of the activation maps. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To form these connections, olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons respond to axon guidance molecules that direct their growth and coalescence. We have previously implicated the axon guidance receptor Robo-2 in the accurate coalescence of OSN axons within the dorsal region of the OB (Cho et al., 2011). Herein, we have examined whether Robo-2 and its ligands, the Slits, contribute to the formation of an accurate glomerular map within more ventral regions of the OB. We have ablated expression of Robo-2 in OSNs and assessed the targeting accuracy of axons expressing either the P2 or MOR28 olfactory receptors, which innervate two different regions of the ventral OB. We show that P2-positive axons, which express Robo-2, coalesce into glomeruli more ventrally and form additional glomeruli in the OB of robo-2(lox/lox);OMP-Cre mice. We also demonstrate that Robo-2-mediated targeting of P2 axons along the dorsoventral axis of the OB is controlled by Slit-1 and Slit-3 expression. Interestingly, although MOR28-positive OSNs only express low levels of Robo-2, a reduced number of MOR28-positive glomeruli is observed in the OB of robo-2(lox/lox);OMP-Cre mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Slits and Robo-2 are required for the formation of an accurate glomerular map in the ventral region of the OB. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The FUS about arginine methylation in ALS and FTLD	EMBO JOURNAL			English	Editorial Material							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MUTATIONS; FUS/TLS; PRMT1; TDP-43; GENE	In a time where links between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) neurodegeneration are becoming increasingly clear, it is important to establish the convergent and divergent mechanisms responsible for this. Accordingly, Dormann et al (2012) have identified that methylation of the Fused in sarcoma (FUS) RGG3 domain is involved in the cytoplasmic mislocalisation of ALS-FUS mutants, through a transportin-dependent mechanism. By contrast, hypomethylation in this domain may play a role in the aberrant accumulation of FUS in FTLD-FUS. This work showcases arginine methylation as a phenomenon to watch out for in neurodegenerative pathology. [GRAPHICS] .

Mouse mutations that serve as models for genetic deafness can be utilized for developing and enhancing therapies for hereditary deafness. A mouse with Pou4f3 loss of function has no hair cells and a subsequent, progressive degeneration of auditory neurons. Here we tested the influence of neurotrophin gene therapy on auditory nerve survival and peripheral sprouting in Pou4f3 mouse ears. BDNF gene transfer enhanced preservation of auditory neurons compared to control ears, in which nearly all neurons degenerated. Surviving neurons in treated ears exhibited pronounced sprouting of nerve fibers into the auditory epithelium, despite the absence of hair cells. This enhanced nerve survival and regenerative sprouting may improve the outcome of cochlear implant therapy in patients with hereditary deafness.	[Fukui, H.; Wong, H. T.; Beyer, L. A.; Case, B.

Learning to play an instrument is a highly complex task that involves the interaction of several modalities and higher-order cognitive functions and that results in behavioral, structural, and functional changes on time scales ranging from days to years. While early work focused on comparison of musical experts and novices, more recently an increasing number of controlled training studies provide clear experimental evidence for training effects. Here, we review research investigating brain plasticity induced by musical training, highlight common patterns and possible underlying mechanisms of such plasticity, and integrate these studies with findings and models for mechanisms of plasticity in other domains.

Chronic pain is also commonly associated with anxiety and depression. It is currently not known if the pain causes these co-morbidities, or if they are pre-disposing risk factors for the development of chronic pain. Animal studies suggest a possible causative effect of pain on cognition, but usually tests are conducted during acute ongoing pain when the pain may act as a distracter to normal cognitive and emotional processing. Here we examine long-term effects of nerve injury on cognitive functioning in a rat model, which contributes to better understanding of the relationship between cognitive impairment and chronic pain experience in human populations. This study investigated attentional capability, anxiety-like behavior and sensory functioning 6 months after spared nerve injury (SNI) surgery a time-point well beyond the acute pain phase and akin to decades of pain experience in humans. Male Long Evans rats subjected to nerve injury remained hypersensitive to sensory stimuli from the time of injury to the 6-month post-injury assessment. At 6 months they were impaired on a visual non-selective, non-sustained attention task and displayed anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze. These findings show that cognitive disturbances observed during acute pain persist for months in a rodent chronic pain model and suggest that cognitive alterations in chronic pain patients are at least partially caused by the chronic pain state.

The aim of the study is to investigate whether MER combined with intraoperative evaluation of stimulation effects improve clinical outcome in PD patients undergoing STN DBS surgery. Material and Methods Prior to final DBS electrode implantation, we performed multiple trajectories MER and intraoperative test stimulations after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided planning in 32 PD patients. In further 10 patients no MER (only intraoperative test stimulation) was used. Results We found a significantly better clinical outcome (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] III) in patients undergoing MER compared with non-MER patients. In MER patients, DBS electrode placement was performed using the central trajectory in 73%. Another than the central trajectory was taken in 27% of the patients. No difference in clinical outcome between DBS electrodes implanted on the central or a decentral trajectory was observed. Conclusions DBS surgery based on intraoperative multiple trajectories MER and test stimulation improves clinical outcome if compared with intraoperative test stimulation alone. The data suggest that DBS surgery solely based on MRI and intraoperative test stimulation without MER may lead to nonoptimal placement of DBS electrodes and consequently poorer clinical outcome.

Conversely, although functional imaging studies suggest that the neural reward circuitry is involved in parental affection, little is known about mothers' interpersonal qualities in relation to their children's brain structure and function. Moreover, gender differences concerning the effect of maternal qualities have rarely been investigated systematically. In 63 adolescents, we assessed structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as interpersonal affiliation in their mothers. This allowed us to associate maternal affiliation with gray matter density and neural responses during different phases of the well-established Monetary Incentive Delay task. Maternal affiliation was positively associated with hippocampal and orbitofrontal gray matter density. Moreover, in the feedback of reward hit as compared with reward miss, an association with caudate activation was found. Although no significant gender effects were observed in these associations, during reward feedback as compared with baseline, maternal affiliation was significantly associated with ventral striatal and caudate activation only in females. Our findings demonstrate that maternal interpersonal affiliation is related to alterations in both the brain structure and reward-related activation in healthy adolescents. Importantly, the pattern is in line with typical findings in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, suggesting that a lack of maternal affiliation might have a role in the genesis of mental disorders.

J	Menez, C; Sutra, JF; Prichard, R; Lespine, A				Menez, Cecile; Sutra, Jean-Francois; Prichard, Roger; Lespine, Anne			Relative Neurotoxicity of Ivermectin and Moxidectin in Mdr1ab (-/-) Mice and Effects on Mammalian GABA(A) Channel Activity	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							GATED CHLORIDE CHANNEL; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; A RECEPTOR; MACROCYCLIC LACTONES; XENOPUS OOCYTES; LOA-LOA; PHARMACOKINETICS; MODULATION; EXPRESSION	The anthelmintics ivermectin (IVM) and moxidectin (MOX) display differences in toxicity in several host species. Entrance into the brain is restricted by the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, while toxicity is mediated through the brain GABA(A) receptors. This study compared the toxicity of IVM and MOX in vivo and their interaction with GABA(A) receptors in vitro. Drug toxicity was assessed in Mdr1ab(-/-) mice P-gp-deficient after subcutaneous administration of increasing doses (0.11-2.0 and 0.23-12.9 mu mol/kg for IVM and MOX in P-gp-deficient mice and half lethal doses (LD50) in wild-type mice). Survival was evaluated over 14-days. In Mdr1ab(-/-) mice, LD50 was 0.46 and 2.3 mu mol/kg for IVM and MOX, respectively, demonstrating that MOX was less toxic than IVM. In P-gp-deficient mice, MOX had a lower brain-to-plasma concentration ratio and entered into the brain more slowly than IVM. The brain sublethal drug concentrations determined after administration of doses close to LD50 were, in Mdr1ab(-/-) and wild-type mice, respectively, 270 and 210 pmol/g for IVM and 830 and 740-1380 pmol/g for MOX, indicating that higher brain concentrations are required for MOX toxicity than IVM. In rat alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 GABA channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, IVM and MOX were both allosteric activators of the GABA-induced response. The Hill coefficient was 1.52+/-0.45 for IVM and 0.34+/-0.56 for MOX (p<0.001), while the maximum potentiation caused by IVM and MOX relative to GABA alone was 413.7+/-66.1 and 257.4+/-40.6%, respectively (p<0.05), showing that IVM causes a greater potentiation of GABA action on this receptor. Differences in the accumulation of IVM and MOX in the brain and in the interaction of IVM and MOX with GABA(A) receptors account for differences in neurotoxicity seen in intact and Mdr1-deficient animals. These differences in neurotoxicity of IVM and MOX are important in considering their use in humans.

Method: Sixteen individuals with PD were randomized to an immediate (n = 8) or a delayed (n = 8) treatment group. They participated in 9 LSVT LOUD sessions and 7 Companion sessions, independently administered at home. Acoustic, listener perception, and voice and speech rating data were obtained immediately before (pre), immediately after (post), and at 6 months post treatment (follow-up). System usability ratings were collected immediately post treatment. Changes in vocal sound pressure level were compared to data from a historical treatment group of individuals with PD treated with standard, in-person LSVT LOUD. Results: All 16 participants were able to independently use the Companion. These individuals had therapeutic gains in sound pressure level, pre to post and pre to follow-up, similar to those of the historical treatment group. Conclusions: This study supports the use of the Companion as an aid in treatment of hypokinetic dysarthria in individuals with PD. Advantages and disadvantages of the Companion, as well as limitations of the present study and directions for future studies, are discussed.

Using unbiased molecular dynamics with the OPEP coarse-grained potential, we focus here on the onset of aggregation in a 20-mer system. With a total of 16.9 mu s of simulations at 280 K and 300 K, we show that the GNNQQNY aggregation follows the classical nucleation theory (CNT) in that the number of monomers in the aggregate is a very reliable descriptor of aggregation. We find that the critical nucleus size in this finite-size system is between 4 and 5 monomers at 280 K and 5 and 6 at 300 K, in overall agreement with experiment. The kinetics of growth cannot be fully accounted for by the CNT, however. For example, we observe considerable rearrangements after the nucleus is formed, as the system attempts to optimize its organization. We also clearly identify two large families of structures that are selected at the onset of aggregation demonstrating the presence of well-defined polymorphism, a signature of amyloid growth, already in the 20-mer aggregate.

Pulsatile Movement of the Optic Nerve Head and the Peripapillary Retina in Normal Subjects and in Glaucoma	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA; BLOOD-FLOW; OCULAR HYPERTENSION; PERFUSION-PRESSURE	PURPOSE. To measure the pulsatile movement of neuroretinal tissue at the optic nerve head synchronous with the cardiac cycle. METHODS. We used a noninvasive imaging device based on Fourier domain low-coherence interferometry to measure the pulsatile movements of the optic nerve head, peripapillary retina, and cornea with submicron accuracy along a line across the fundus. We also measured the change in the Axial Distance between the peripapillary Retina and the base of the optic disc Cup (ADRC) during the cardiac cycle. Twelve normal subjects and 20 subjects with open-angle glaucoma were tested. RESULTS. In normal subjects, the mean fundus pulsation amplitude (defined as the fundus movement minus the simultaneous corneal movement) were 13.0 +/- 2.5 mu m, 9.0 +/- 2.1 mu m, and 8.7 +/- 2.9 mu m at the base of the optic nerve head cup, the nasal peripapillary retina, and the temporal peripapillary retina, respectively, compared with 16.7 +/- 6.8 mu m, 17.3 +/- 10.9 mu m, and 12.7 +/- 6.2 mu m for the corresponding values in the glaucoma group (P = 0.26, P = 0.008, and P = 0.12, respectively). The mean changes in ADRC during the cardiac cycle in normal subjects were 10.7 +/- 2.1 mu m and 11.6 +/- 1.8 mu m for the nasal and temporal side of the optic disc, respectively, compared to 14.9 +/- 5.6 mu m and 14.0 +/- 4.9 mu m in glaucoma subjects (P = 0.03 and P = 0.10, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. There was an approximately 11-mu m pulsatile change in the ADRC in normal subjects, and on the nasal side of the disc, this amount was significantly greater in glaucoma patients.

Recent work highlighted that PGC1 alpha can also modulate the composition and functions of individual mitochondria. Therefore, it is emerging that PGC1 alpha is controlling global oxidative metabolism by performing two types of remodelling: (1) cellular remodelling through mitochondrial biogenesis, and (2) organelle remodelling through alteration in the intrinsic properties of mitochondria. The elevated oxidative metabolism associated with increased PGC1 alpha activity could be accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are primarily generated by mitochondria. However, increasing evidence suggests that this is not the case, as PGC1 alpha is also a powerful regulator of ROS removal by increasing the expression of numerous ROS-detoxifying enzymes. Therefore, PGC1 alpha, by controlling both the induction of mitochondrial metabolism and the removal of its ROS by-products, would elevate oxidative metabolism and minimize the impact of ROS on cell physiology. In this Commentary, we discuss how the biogenesis and remodelling of mitochondria that are elicited by PGC1 alpha contribute to an increase in oxidative metabolism and the preservation of ROS homeostasis. Finally, we examine the importance of these findings in ageing and neurodegenerative disorders, conditions that are associated with impaired mitochondrial functions and ROS balance.

Animal models suggest that only gamma-aminobutyric acidic drugs are effective in the treatment of febrile seizures, but there is limited clinical evidence to support this. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of phenytoin, a sodium channel blocker, in the treatment of febrile status epilepticus in children. Methods: This study is a retrospective chart review of 56 children (62 episodes) who presented to our emergency department with febrile status epilepticus and received phenytoin. The clinical parameters were evaluated by reviewing the charts. The efficacy of phenytoin was classified into 3 categories: positive, negative, and nonevaluable response. Results: The primary outcome was to evaluate the efficacy rate of phenytoin; there were 9 (14.5%) of 62 episodes with a positive response, 25 (40.3%) with a negative response, and 28 (45.2%) with a nonevaluable response because phenytoin was given simultaneously with gamma-aminobutyric acidic (GABAergic) drug (P < .001). The secondary outcome was to measure the mean seizure duration for each treatment category, which were 52.8, 109.9, and 52.6 minutes, respectively (P < .01). Conclusion: Phenytoin is rarely effective in controlling febrile status epilepticus. Children exposed to phenytoin have more prolonged febrile seizures, increasing the risk of brain injury.

Predictive tools for prostate cancer staging, treatment response and outcomes	ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Prostate cancer; Nomogram; Prediction; Recurrence; Decision analysis	LYMPH-NODE INVASION; SEMINAL-VESICLE INVASION; BEAM RADIATION-THERAPY; BIOPSY GLEASON SCORE; UROLOGICAL RESEARCH ENDEAVOR; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; PREOPERATIVE NOMOGRAM; PATHOLOGICAL STAGE	OBJECTIVES: Numerous predictive models relating to prostate cancer staging and outcomes have been described. We sought to review and categorize these predictive tools to create a comprehensive reference for physicians who treat prostate cancer. METHODS: We performed a search of MEDLINE literature from January 1966 to April 2012 to identify predictive models relating to prostate cancer staging, treatment, and outcomes in the pre-treated patient. For each model identified, we describe the outcome predicted, the variables comprising the model, the size of the cohort on which the tool was developed, predictive discrimination estimates, and whether internal and/or external validation has been performed. RESULTS: We identified BO predictive tools applicable to pre-treated prostate cancer patients, 30 of which had been externally validated. Tools designed to predict pathologic stage were the most common; several models focused on accurately predicting clinically insignificant prostate cancer while another large proportion focused on the prediction of locally advanced disease (i.e. extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement, lymph node invasion). Other models described studied biochemical outcomes following radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. Very few models addressed the prediction of metastasis and survival. Finally, several tools incorporated novel pre-treatment serum biomarkers or magnetic resonance imaging findings into base models to enhance the accuracy of standard clinicopathologic variables. CONCLUSION: To deliver optimal, individualized prostate cancer care, treatment should be tailored to the specific characteristics of each patient and each tumor. Predictive models may facilitate such an approach and are numerously described in the literature. While the performance of predictive models is encouraging, further improvement through inclusion of biomarkers as well as evaluation of their clinical utility is imperative. Optimally, predictive models should be further studied in the prospective setting.

The latter two of these genes have been involved in PraderWilli syndrome (PWS), which includes hyperphagia, repetitive and compulsive behaviors, and cognitive impairment. Here, we show that Maged1-deficient mice develop progressive obesity associated with hyperphagia and reduced motor activity. Loss of Maged1 also results in a complex behavioral syndrome that includes reduced social interactions and memory, deficient sexual behavior, as well as increased anxiety and self-grooming. Oxytocin (OT), which is produced in the hypothalamus, can act as a neurotransmitter that reduces anxiety, promotes social behaviors and regulates food intake. Growing evidences indicate that OT is involved in autism. We found that Maged1 mutants showed a severe reduction in the levels of mature OT, but not of its precursors, in the hypothalamus. Moreover, the administration of OT rescued the deficit in social memory of these mice. We conclude that Maged1 is required for OT processing or stability. A decrease in mature OT levels in Maged1 mutants affects social interactions and possibly other behavioral processes. Our observations suggest that, in human, MAGED1 could play a role in autism or cause a neurodevelopmental condition that is reminiscent of the PWS.

Spatiotemporal structure of visual receptive fields in macaque superior colliculus. J Neurophysiol 108: 2653-2667, 2012. First published August 29, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00389.2012.-Saccades are useful for directing the high-acuity fovea to visual targets that are of behavioral relevance. The selection of visual targets for eye movements involves the superior colliculus (SC), where many neurons respond to visual stimuli. Many of these neurons are also activated before and during saccades of specific directions and amplitudes. Although the role of the SC in controlling eye movements has been thoroughly examined, far less is known about the nature of the visual responses in this area. We have, therefore, recorded from neurons in the intermediate layers of the macaque SC, while using a sparse-noise mapping procedure to obtain a detailed characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of visual receptive fields. We find that SC responses to flashed visual stimuli start roughly 50 ms after the onset of the stimulus and last for on average similar to 70 ms. About 50% of these neurons are strongly suppressed by visual stimuli flashed at certain locations flanking the excitatory center, and the spatiotemporal pattern of suppression exerts a predictable influence on the timing of saccades. This suppression may, therefore, contribute to the filtering of distractor stimuli during target selection. We also find that saccades affect the processing of visual stimuli by SC neurons in a manner that is quite similar to the saccadic suppression and postsaccadic enhancement that has been observed in the cortex and in perception. However, in contrast to what has been observed in the cortex, decreased visual sensitivity was generally associated with increased firing rates, while increased sensitivity was associated with decreased firing rates. Overall, these results suggest that the processing of visual stimuli by SC receptive fields can influence oculomotor behavior and that oculomotor signals originating in the SC can shape perisaccadic visual perception.

J Neurophysiol 108: 2717-2724, 2012. First published July 5, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00196.2012.-Because acoustic landscapes are complex and rapidly changing, auditory systems have evolved mechanisms that permit rapid detection of novel sounds, sound source segregation, and perceptual restoration of sounds obscured by noise. Perceptual restoration is particularly important in noisy environments because it allows organisms to track sounds over time even when they are masked. The continuity illusion is a striking example of perceptual restoration with sounds perceived as intact even when parts of them have been replaced by gaps and rendered inaudible by being masked by an extraneous sound. The mechanisms of auditory filling-in are complex and are currently not well-understood. The present study used the high temporal resolution of EEG to examine brain activity related to continuity illusion perception. Masking noise loudness was adjusted individually for each subject so that physically identical sounds on some trials elicited a continuity illusion ( failure to detect a gap in a sound) and on other trials resulted in correct gap detection. This design ensured that any measurable differences in brain activity would be due to perceptual differences rather than physical differences among stimuli. We found that baseline activity recorded immediately before presentation of the stimulus significantly predicted the occurrence of the continuity illusion in 10 out of 14 participants based on power differences in gamma-band EEG (34-80 Hz). Across all participants, power in the beta and gamma (12-to 80-Hz range) was informative about the subsequent perceptual decision. These data suggest that a subject's baseline brain state influences the strength of continuity illusions.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between pain, performance on a working memory task, gray matter density, and mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (mid-DLPFC) activation in subjects with a MTBI. For comparison purposes, we performed identical correlation analyses with a group of subjects without MTBI who sustained sports injuries. Twenty-four subjects who experienced a MTBI in the past 12 months, 16 control subjects, and 29 subjects with sport injuries were included. One hour prior to entering the magnetic resonance scanner, the subjects were asked to fill out the pain Visual Analogue Scale. Subsequently, a high-resolution T1-weighted image was acquired followed by a functional magnetic resonance imaging session using the visual externally ordered working memory task. Results showed that MTBI subjects reporting severe pain in the hour preceding the testing had reduced mid-DLPFC activation during the working memory task and poorer performance on the task. Subjects with sport injuries and severe levels of pain showed the reverse pattern: pain was associated with higher activation in the mid-DLPFC and did not correlate with performance. Gray matter density measures were independent of pain level. This study showed that behavioral performance and cerebral functioning are affected by pain after a MTBI. Moreover, this study suggests that pain, cognition, and cerebral functioning interactions could not easily be generalized from one clinical population to another.

This multi-faceted construct includes considerations of both time and risk; determining how these more specific processes are affected by PD and dopaminergic treatment can inform neurobiological models. We examined the effects of PD and its treatment on temporal discounting and risky decision-making in a cohort of 23 mild-moderate PD patients and 20 healthy participants. Patients completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and a temporal discounting paradigm both on and off their usual dopamine replacement therapy. PD patients did not differ from controls in their initial risk-taking on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, but took progressively more risks across trials when on medication. A subset of patients and controls was tested again, 1.5-3 years later, to explore the effects of disease progression. On follow-up, baseline risk-taking diminished in patients, but the tendency to take increasing risks across trials persisted. Neither disease progression nor its treatment affected the temporal discounting rate. These findings suggest a different neural basis for temporal discounting and risk-taking, and demonstrate that risk-taking can be further decomposed into initial and trial-by-trial effects, with dopamine affecting only the latter.

Somatostatin varicosities contain the vesicular GABA transporter and contact orexin neurons in the hypothalamus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						arcuate nucleus; gephyrin; median eminence; rat; synaptophysin	HORMONE-RELEASING-HORMONE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; OREXIN/HYPOCRETIN NEURONS; ARCUATE NUCLEUS; GABAERGIC SYNAPSES; HYPOCRETIN NEURONS; RECEPTOR SUBTYPE; AROUSAL SYSTEM; IN-VITRO; SLEEP	Somatostatin (SST) is a neuropeptide with known inhibitory actions in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits release of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), while also influencing the sleepwake cycle. Here we investigated in the rat whether SST neurons might additionally release GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) or glutamate in different regions and whether they might contact orexin neurons that play an important role in the maintenance of wakefulness. In dual-immunostained sections viewed by epifluorescence microscopy, we examined if SST varicosities were immunopositive for the vesicular transporter for GABA (VGAT) or glutamate (VGLUT2) in the posterolateral hypothalamus and neighboring arcuate nucleus and median eminence. Of the SST varicosities in the posterolateral hypothalamus, 18% were immunopositive for VGAT, whereas = 1% were immunopositive for VGLUT2. In the arcuate and median eminence, 26 and 64% were VGAT+ and < 3% VGLUT2 + , respectively. In triple-immunostained sections viewed by epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, SST varicosities were seen in contact with orexin somata, and of these varicosities, a significant proportion (23%) contained VGAT along with synaptophysin, the presynaptic marker for small synaptic vesicles, and a similar proportion (25%) abutted puncta that were immunostained for gephyrin, the postsynaptic marker for GABAergic synapses. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of SST varicosities in the hypothalamus have the capacity to release GABA, to form inhibitory synapses upon orexin neurons, and accordingly through their peptide and/or amino acid, to inhibit orexin neurons, as well as GHRH neurons. Thus while regulating GHRH release, SST neurons could serve to attenuate arousal and permit progression through the sleep cycle.

However, there are limited prospective clinical data available on the safety of temozolomide as a chemosensitizing agent administered with stereotactic radiosurgery. This is a phase I trial of previously irradiated patients with one to four progressive brain metastases and Karnofsky performance scale score >= 60 % enrolled in three sequential cohorts: temozolomide 100, 150 or 200 mg/(m(2) day) administered for 5 days. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was administered on day 5. The SRS dose was dependent on target diameter: 15 Gy (31-40 mm), 18 Gy (21-30 mm) or 21 Gy (<= 20 mm). The primary endpoint was safety of increasing temozolomide doses. Secondary endpoints included local control and survival. 26 subjects were enrolled and 49 total metastatic lesions were treated. The median number of brain metastases was 1.5, with a median target diameter of 21 mm. The most common grade 1-2 adverse events irrespective of causality were vomiting (23 %), nausea (23 %), edema (12 %), seizure (8 %), psychosis (4 %) and thrombocytopenia (4 %). The frequency of nausea and vomiting did not appear to be dose-dependent. Grade 3-4 toxicities were not observed. Median overall survival was 10.2 months. Crude local control was 87.5 %, with a radiological response seen in eight of 24 evaluable patients (33.3 %), and stable disease >6 months in 13 of 24 patients (54.2 %). Temozolomide, at doses up to 200 mg/(m(2) day) x 5 days, prior to SRS is well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities in patients with recurrent brain metastases. Local control of target lesions was >80 %.

J	Trepanier, PY; Fortin, I; Lambert, C; Lacroix, F				Trepanier, Pier-Yves; Fortin, Israel; Lambert, Carole; Lacroix, Frederic			A Monte Carlo based formalism to identify potential locations at high risk of tumor recurrence with a numerical model for glioblastoma multiforme	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						GBM; DTI; numerical modeling; tumor recurrence location; radiation margin	TENSOR IMAGING MATHEMATICS; GLIOMA GROWTH; GRADE GLIOMAS; BRAIN-TUMORS; DIFFUSION; RADIOTHERAPY; TEMOZOLOMIDE; CELLS; PROLIFERATION; INFILTRATION	Purpose: The strategy currently used to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients, which mostly relies on population-based failure patterns, does not consider the important variability in such patterns reported in the literature. As part of the multidisciplinary efforts being made to develop personalized therapeutic approaches, numerical models of tumor growth and treatment are increasingly being used by different groups around the world. In this study, a new formalism relying on the proliferation-invasion model is developed to identify potential locations of GBM recurrences. The authors assess the sensitivity of the location of potential tumor recurrences to the input parameter values predicted for a given patient by varying those values using a Monte-Carlo based approach. Our approach is designed to be prospective in the sense that it relies on patient-specific imaging data that can be gathered in one single preradiotherapy imaging session. Methods: The authors modeled the infiltration paths of glial cells using patient-specific diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Nine GBM patients with preradiotherapy DTI data are considered in this study. The possible locations of tumor recurrences are determined by randomly selecting many ensembles of values for each of the growth and radiobiological parameters in the GBM growth model. A novel concept, the occurrence probability (OP), is introduced to assess the sensitivity of potential tumor recurrence locations to the input parameter values. For a given patient, the OP map is derived from a superposition of all potential tumor recurrence locations obtained with all sets of parameter values. Results: For eight out of nine of patients, the authors have identified a statistically significant region where the OP is above 50%. For two patients, these high risk regions are found to be located at a distance greater than 3.9 cm from the border of the gross tumor volume highlighting the inaccuracy of current margins for some patients. The exact location and size of these volumes with OP > 50% are, however, sensitive to the number N of ensembles of parameter values for N less than or similar to 400. On the other hand, the authors have identified for each patient a threshold OP, the OPT, which defines a volume that converges more rapidly with increasing N. The OPT for each patient varies between 20% and 40%. The volume defined by OP > OPT may be an adequate candidate to define a personalized margin for radiotherapy treatment planning of GBM patients. Conclusions: A new Monte-Carlo based formalism was described and used to assess the variability of sites of potential recurrence predicted by the proliferation-invasion model to input parameter values. The authors have shown that high risk areas could be consistently identified with a limited number of sets (N less than or similar to 400) of randomly chosen parameter values. A major strength of this formalism is its potential prospective nature. Although a validation of the accuracy of the model-predicted tumor recurrence location still remains to be done, our method is potentially applicable to orient patient-specific definition of margins.

The fleeting nature of this phenomenon in daily life, and the difficulty in developing experimental paradigms to elicit it, has hindered progress in understanding deja vu. Some neurological patients with temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) consistently experience deja vu at the onset of their seizures. An investigation of such patients offers a unique opportunity to shed light on its possible underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we sought to determine whether unilateral TLE patients with deja vu (TLE+) show a unique pattern of interictal memory deficits that selectively affect familiarity assessment. In Experiment 1, we employed a Remember-Know paradigm for categorized visual scenes and found evidence for impairments that were limited to familiarity-based responses. In Experiment 2, we administered an exclusion task for highly similar categorized visual scenes that placed both recognition processes in opposition. TLE+ patients again displayed recognition impairments, and these impairments spared their ability to engage recollective processes so as to counteract familiarity. The selective deficits we observed in TLE+ patients contrasted with the broader pattern of recognition-memory impairments that was present in a control group of unilateral patients without deja vu (TLE-). MRI volumetry revealed that ipsilateral medial temporal structures were less broadly affected in TLE+ than in TLE- patients, with a trend for more focal volume reductions in the rhinal cortices of the TLE+ group. The current findings establish a first empirical link between deja vu in TLE and processes of familiarity assessment, as defined and measured in current cognitive models. They also reveal a pattern of selectivity in recognition impairments that is rarely observed and, thus, of significant theoretical interest to the memory literature at large. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First published September 12, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00363.2012.-Excessive synchronous neuronal activity is a defining feature of epileptic activity. We previously characterized the properties of distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission-dependent synchronous epileptiform discharges in mouse hippocampal slices using the 4-aminopyridine model of epilepsy. In the present study, we sought to identify the specific hippocampal neuronal populations that initiate and underlie these local field potentials (LFPs). A perforated multi-electrode array was used to simultaneously record multiunit action potential firing and LFPs during spontaneous epileptiform activity. LFPs had distinct components based on the initiation site, extent of propagation, and pharmacological sensitivity. Individual units, located in different hippocampal subregions, fired action potentials during these LFPs. A specific neuron subgroup generated sustained action potential firing throughout the various components of the LFPs. The activity of this subgroup preceded the LFPs observed in the presence of antagonists of ionotropic glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In the absence of ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, LFPs disappeared, but units with shorter spike duration and high basal firing rates were still active. These spontaneously active units had an increased level of activity during LFPs and consistently preceded all LFPs recorded before blockade of synaptic transmission. Our findings reveal that neuronal subpopulations with interneuron properties are likely responsible for initiating synchronous activity in an in vitro model of epileptiform discharges.

Methods: A cohort of 14,227 patients diagnosed with an ischemic stroke was assembled from individuals 65 years and older who were treated with AH agents from 1999 to 2007 in Quebec, Canada. A nested case-control design was used to evaluate the occurrence of nonfatal major CV outcomes and mortality. Each case was matched to 15 controls by age and cohort entry time. Medication possession ratio was used for AH agent adherence level. Adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the rate ratio of CV events. The validity of the approach was assessed by evaluating the adherence level of CV-protective and non-CV-protective drugs. Results: Mean age was 75 years, 54% were male, 38% had coronary artery disease, 23% had diabetes, 47% dyslipidemia, and 14% atrial fibrillation or flutter. High adherence to AH therapy was mirrored by similar adherence to statins and antiplatelet agents and was associated with a lower risk of nonfatal vascular events compared with lower adherence (rate ratio 0.77 [0.70-0.86]). We observed a paradoxic link between adherence to several drugs and all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Adherence to AH agents is associated with adherence to other secondary preventive therapies and a risk reduction for nonfatal vascular events after an ischemic stroke. Overestimation of all-cause mortality reduction may be related to frailty and comorbidities, which may confound the apparent benefit of different drugs.

Ganglion cysts are common hand masses. This article will answer three questions that the radiologist is often asked: A mass is palpable; is it a cyst? Pain or neurologic symptoms are present; are they related to a cyst? Surgery is being considered; where precisely are the cyst and its origin located? CONCLUSION. Ultrasound is often sufficient for assessing typical cysts. MRI is performed when atypical features or neurologic symptoms are present and in specific preoperative settings.

Studies have shown that autophagy is involved in maintaining the homeostasis of the neural system during stroke. However, molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal autophagy in ischemic stroke remain poorly understood. Previously, we and others have shown that immune-related GTPase M (IRGM; termed IRGM1 in the mouse nomenclature) can regulate the survival of immune cells through autophagy in response to infections and autoimmune conditions. Here, using a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) mouse model, we found that IRGM1 was upregulated in the ischemic side of the brain, which was accompanied by a significant autophagic response. In contrast, neuronal autophagy was almost complete lost in Irgm1 knockout (KO) mice after pMCAO induction. In addition, the infarct volume in the Irgm1-KO pMCAO mice was significantly increased as compared to wild-type mice. Histological studies suggested that, at the early stage (within 24 h) of ischemia, the IRGM1-dependent autophagic response is associated with a protection of neurons from necrosis in the ischemic core but a promotion of neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra area. These data demonstrate a novel role of IRGM1 in regulating neuronal autophagy and survival during ischemic stroke.

Methods: 156 infants with a birth weight <= 1500 g (gestational age, range: 27-31 weeks) were followed at regular intervals through neurodevelopmental (neurological and psychomotor) assessment up to 24 months of corrected age. A statistical analysis was conducted in order to look for correlations between pre- and perinatal variables and neuropsychomotor outcome at 24 months. Results: 131 children were classified as normal and the other 25 presented sequelae classified as "minor" in 17 cases and as "major" in eight. The most significant risk factors for a poor outcome were preterm premature rupture of the membranes, bronchodysplasia, late-onset sepsis, postnatal steroid therapy and male gender. The presence of severe abnormalities on brain ultrasound scan and of an abnormal neurological assessment at 40 weeks at term equivalent age were strong predictors of poor outcome. Conclusions: Our study is one of the few investigating the short-term outcome of preterm VLBW Italian children born in the second half of the 2000s. Neurodevelopmental assessment at 24 months revealed a marked reduction in major sequelae. Several risk factors for a poor neurodevelopmental outcome identified in children born in earlier periods were confirmed in these children born in recent years.

However, various factors impede investigation and publication of serious adverse events. To that end, we developed new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for spinal cord white matter quantification and used the best available physiological tests to characterize a cervical spinal cord lesion caused by inadvertent intramedullary injection of Depo-Medrol. A 29-year-old woman with mild cervical osteoarthritis had 2 years of headache and neck pain (concussion and whiplash) after 2 minor motor vehicle accidents. During C5-6 ESI, she developed new left-sided motor and sensory symptoms, and MRI demonstrated a new left dorsal spinal cord cavity. Mild left-sided motor and sensory symptoms have persisted for more than 2.5 years, during which time we performed serial neurological examinations, standard electrodiagnostics, somatosensory evoked potentials, and transcranial measurement of cortico-spinal central motor conduction time (CMCT). We used 3-Tesla MRI with a 32-channel coil developed for high-resolution cervical spinal cord structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetization transfer (MT). T-2(*)-weighted signal and DTI and MT metrics showed delayed spread of the lesion across 4 vertebral levels rostrally, consistent with Wallerian degeneration within the ascending left dorsal columns. However, only CMCT metrics detected objective correlates of her left hemiparesis and bilateral hyperreflexia. DTI and MT metrics may better distinguish between post-traumatic demyelination and axonal degeneration than conventional MRI. These tests should be considered to better characterize similar spinal cord injuries. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TSPO is present at higher levels in steroid-synthesizing and rapidly proliferating tissues and its biological role has been mainly linked to mitochondrial function, steroidogenesis and cell proliferation/apoptosis. Aberrant TSPO levels have been linked to multiple diseases, including cancer, endocrine disorders, brain injury, neurodegeneration, ischemia-reperfusion injury and inflammatory diseases. Investigation of the functions of this protein in vitro and in vivo have been mainly carried out using high-affinity drug ligands, such as isoquinoline carboxamides and benzodiazepines and more recently, gene silencing methods. To establish a model to study the regulation of Tspo transcription in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea coerulescens under control of the Tspo promoter region (Tspo-AcGFP). The expression profiles of Tspo-AcGFP, endogenous TSPO and Tspo mRNA were found to be well-correlated. Tspo-AcGFP synthesis in the transgenic mice was seen in almost every tissue examined and as with TSPO in wild-type mice, Tspo-AcGFP was highly expressed in steroidogenic cells of the endocrine and reproductive systems, epithelial cells of the digestive system, skeletal muscle and other organs. In summary, this transgenic Tspo-AcGFP mouse model recapitulates endogenous Tspo expression patterns and could be a useful, tractable tool for monitoring the transcriptional regulation and function of Tspo in live animal experiments.

Estrogen Receptors Are Found in Glia and at Extranuclear Neuronal Sites in the Dorsal Striatum of Female Rats: Evidence for Cholinergic But Not Dopaminergic Colocalization	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VESICULAR ACETYLCHOLINE TRANSPORTER; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR-30; BETA MESSENGER-RNA; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; INDUCED INCREASE; ALPHA; IMMUNOREACTIVITY	Estrogens rapidly affect dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum (dSTR) and DA-related diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. How estrogens influence DA function remains unclear, in part, because the ultrastructural localization of estrogen receptors (ER) in the dSTR is not known. Light microscopic studies of the dSTR have suggested the presence of ER. This experiment used electron microscopy to determine whether these ER are at extranuclear sites in the dSTR, providing evidence for a mechanism through which estrogen could rapidly affect DA transmission. The dSTR was labeled with antibodies for ER alpha, ER beta, and G protein-coupled ER 1 (GPER-1) to confirm whether these ER were present in this brain area. After this, the dSTR was dual labeled with antibodies for ER alpha or GPER-1 and tyrosine hydroxylase or vesicular acetylcholine transporter to determine whether ER are localized to dopaminergic and/or cholinergic processes, respectively. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immunoreactivity (IR) for ER alpha, ER beta, and GPER-1 exclusively at extranuclear sites throughout the dSTR. ER alpha-, ER beta-, and GPER-1-IR are mostly frequently observed in axons and glial profiles but are also localized to other neuronal profiles. Dual labeling revealed that ER alpha- and GPER-1-IR is not associated with DA axons and terminals but is sometimes associated with cholinergic neurons. Because these receptors are exclusively extranuclear in the dSTR, binding at these receptors likely affects neurotransmission via nongenomic mechanisms.

EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Reward; Adolescence; Striatum; Gain; Punishment; fMRI	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BRAIN; ANTICIPATION; ACTIVATION; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; DISSOCIATION; RESPONSES; CHOICE; PERIOD	Adolescence is a transition period that is assumed to be characterized by increased sensitivity to reward. While there is growing research on reward processing in adolescents, investigations into the engagement of brain regions under different reward-related conditions in one sample of healthy adolescents, especially in a target age group, are missing. We aimed to identify brain regions preferentially activated in a reaction time task (monetary incentive delay (MID) task) and a simple guessing task (SGT) in a sample of 14-year-old adolescents (N = 54) using two commonly used reward paradigms. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed during the MID with big versus small versus no win conditions and the SGT with big versus small win and big versus small loss conditions. Analyses focused on changes in blood oxygen level-dependent contrasts during reward and punishment processing in anticipation and feedback phases. We found clear magnitude-sensitive response in reward-related brain regions such as the ventral striatum during anticipation in the MID task, but not in the SGT. This was also true for reaction times. The feedback phase showed clear reward-related, but magnitude-independent, response patterns, for example in the anterior cingulate cortex, in both tasks. Our findings highlight neural and behavioral response patterns engaged in two different reward paradigms in one sample of 14-year-old healthy adolescents and might be important for reference in future studies investigating reward and punishment processing in a target age group.

However, although most studies focused on the impact of stress at the time of learning or memory testing, very little is known about how stress during critical periods of brain development affects learning and memory later in life. In this study, we asked whether prenatal stress exposure may influence the engagement of hippocampus-dependent spatial learning strategies and caudate nucleus-dependent response learning strategies in later life. To this end, we tested healthy participants whose mothers had experienced major negative life events during their pregnancy in a virtual navigation task that can be solved by spatial and response strategies. We found that young adults with prenatal stress used rigid response learning strategies more often than flexible spatial learning strategies compared with participants whose mothers did not experience major negative life events during pregnancy. Individual differences in acute or chronic stress do not account for these findings. Our data suggest that the engagement of hippocampal and nonhippocampal learning strategies may be influenced by stress very early in life. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that not all identified mechanisms may generalize to subsequent learning. For example, N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptors in the dorsal hippocampus are required for contextual fear conditioning in naive animals but not in animals previously trained in a similar task. Here we investigated how animals learn contextual fear conditioning for a second timea response which is not due to habituation or generalization. We found that dorsal hippocampus infusions of voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers or the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist impaired the first, not the second contextual learning. Only manipulations of the entire hippocampus led to an impairment in second learning. Specifically, inactivation of either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus caused the remaining portion of the hippocampus to acquire and consolidate the second learning. Thus, dorsal hippocampus seems necessary for initial contextual fear conditioning, but either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus is sufficient for subsequent conditioning in a different context. Together, these findings suggest that prior training experiences can change how the hippocampus processes subsequent similar learning. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Autophosphorylation of the C2 domain inhibits translocation of the novel protein kinase C (nPKC) Apl II	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Aplysia; lipid binding; novel protein kinase C; phosphatidic acid; phosphorylation; translocation	INTERMEDIATE-TERM FACILITATION; APLYSIA SENSORY NEURONS; PHOSPHATIDIC-ACID; MEMBRANE-BINDING; PHOSPHORYLATION SITES; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; ANCHORING PROTEINS; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; PKC-EPSILON	Protein kinase Cs (PKCs) are critical signaling molecules controlled by complex regulatory pathways. Herein, we describe an important regulatory role for C2 domain phosphorylation. Novel PKCs (nPKCs) contain an N-terminal C2 domain that cannot bind to calcium. Previously, we described an autophosphorylation site in the Aplysia novel PKC Apl II that increased the binding of the C2 domain to lipids. In this study, we show that the function of this phosphorylation is to inhibit PKC translocation. Indeed, a phosphomimetic serine-glutamic acid mutation reduced translocation of PKC Apl II while blocking phosphorylation with a serine-alanine mutation enhanced translocation and led to the persistence of the kinase at the membrane longer after the end of the stimulation. Consistent with a role for autophosphorylation in regulating kinase translocation, inhibiting PKC activity using bisindolymaleimide 1 increased physiological translocation of PKC Apl II, whereas inhibiting phosphatase activity using calyculin A inhibited physiological translocation of PKC Apl II in neurons. Our results suggest a major role for autophosphorylation-dependent regulation of translocation.

Is pre-existing dementia an independent predictor of outcome after stroke? A propensity score-matched analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Stroke; Dementia; Elderly; Outcomes; Mortality; Thrombolysis; Alteplase; Mortality; Pneumonia; Disability	CANADIAN NEUROLOGICAL SCALE; PRESTROKE DEMENTIA; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; RISK-FACTORS; CARE; MORTALITY; INFARCTION; ACCESS; OLD	With an aging population, patients are increasingly likely to present with stroke and pre-existing dementia, which may lead to greater death and disability. The aim of this work was to assess the risk of all-cause mortality and poor functional outcomes after ischemic stroke in patients with and without pre-existing dementia. We conducted a multicenter cohort study of all patients presenting to 12 tertiary care institutions participating in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN) with a first ischemic stroke between 2003 and 2008. Individuals with pre-existing dementia were matched using propensity-score methods with patients without dementia during their index hospitalization based on the following characteristics: age (within 3 years), sex, stroke severity, stroke subtype (lacunar vs. non-lacunar), level of consciousness, vascular risk factors, dysphagia, glucose and creatinine on admission, Charlson index, residence prior to hospitalization (home vs. other), pre-admission dependency, hospital arrival via ambulance, admission to stroke unit, thrombolysis, and palliative care. A propensity score for all-cause mortality and clinical outcomes was developed. Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN) and Registered Persons Database (RPDB). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included mortality at discharge and at 1 year, disability at discharge (modified Rankin scale a parts per thousand yen 3), medical complications (pneumonia), and discharge disposition. A subgroup analysis assessing the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage among those receiving thrombolysis was also conducted. We matched 877 patients with an acute ischemic stroke and pre-existing dementia to 877 stroke patients without dementia. Patients were well matched. The mean age was 82 years and 58 % were women. Mortality at discharge, 30 days, and 1 year after stroke was similar in patients with and without dementia [for mortality at discharge RR 0.88 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.05]; mortality at 30-days: RR 0.88 (95 % CI 0.75-1.03) and mortality at 1 year: RR 1.01 (95 % CI 0.92-1.11). Patients with pre-existing dementia had similar disability at discharge and home disposition. In the subgroup of patients who received thrombolysis, there were no differences between those with and without dementia in the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (RR 1.27; 95 % CI 0.69-2.35) and no differences in mortality or disability at discharge. Pre-existing dementia is not independently associated with mortality, disability, or institutionalization after ischemic stroke. Pre-existing dementia may not necessarily preclude access to thrombolytic therapy and specialized stroke care.

Incidence of cerebral ischemic events after discontinuation of clopidogrel in patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with stent-assisted techniques Clinical article	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						aspirin; clopidogrel; intracranial aneurysm; ischemia; stent; vascular disorders	ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; THROMBOSIS; PLACEMENT	Object. The optimal antiplatelet medication protocol for prevention of thrombotic complications after stent-assisted coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms is unclear. Early cessation of antiplatelet agents may be associated with an increased risk of cerebral ischemic events. In this study, the authors assess the incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) following discontinuation of a 6-week course of clopidogrel in patients with cerebral aneurysms treated with stent-assisted techniques. Methods. A retrospective review was conducted in all patients with cerebral aneurysms undergoing stent-assisted coil embolization or stent-in-stent flow diversion at the University of Iowa during a 24-month period. The antiplatelet protocol was 81 mg aspirin and 75 mg clopidogrel daily for 6 weeks, followed by 325 mg aspirin daily indefinitely. The incidence of stroke or TIA was determined by a retrospective review of medical records generated during a 3-month period following discontinuation of clopidogrel. Results. A total of 154 patients underwent aneurysm treatment with stent techniques during this interval. Documentation of neurological follow-up 3 months after discontinuation of a 6-week clopidogrel treatment was available in 121 (78.6%) of 154 patients. Of these 121 patients, 114 were treated with stern-assisted coil embolization and 7 with stent-in-stent flow diversion. Six patients (5%) suffered an ischemic event after cessation of clopidogrel, with 2 events occurring within the first 2 weeks. Specifically, the rate of ischemic events was 5 (4.3%) of 114 in the "stent-coil" treatment group and I (14.3%) of 7 in the stent-in-stent group. Treatment had been performed in the setting of a subarachnoid hemorrhage in I patient. Atypical aneurysm features and technical factors predisposing to thrombotic events were found in all but one of these patients. Similarly, cardiovascular risk factors were present in 5 of the 6 patients in whom ischemic events developed after clopidogrel discontinuation. Conclusions. Clopidogrel discontinuation is associated with a 5% risk of ischemic events in patients treated with stem techniques. Any stroke related to clopidogrel discontinuation is avoidable, and longer treatment is therefore clearly necessary. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors, high-risk aneurysm features, and those undergoing stein-in-stein flow diversion might benefit the most from longer clopidogrel therapy.

A role for non-coding RNAs in alcoholism is beginning to emerge. PCR-differential display using total RNA extracted from brain material of human alcoholics and control cases identified a cDNA fragment corresponding to a section of a known non protein-coding RNA (ncRNA), MALAT-1, (also known as NEAT2). Comparison of mRNA levels of MALAT-1 was performed by northern and dot blot experiments using different regions of brain from human alcoholics and rats chronically treated with ethanol vapours and following withdrawal. A massive increase of MALAT-1 transcripts was detected in cerebellum of human alcoholics and increases were also noted in hippocampus and brain stem, while no significant increase of MALAT-1 expression was noted in frontal or motor cortices. In the rat no significant difference of MALAT-1 ortholog mRNA could be detected in cerebellum. In addition, similarly to humans, no significant increase of MALAT-1 expression was detected in cortex of alcohol-treated rats, however, after 24 h alcohol withdrawal, a significant upregulation of MALAT-1 expression was observed in rat cortex. MALAT-1 is upregulated in specific regions of the human alcoholic brain and following alcohol withdrawal in the rat. As MALAT-1 regulates RNA processing, this suggests that alcohol-induced upregulation of MALAT-1 represents an important novel mechanism for alcohol actions in the CNS. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Occipital Cortical Thickness Predicts Performance on Pitch and Musical Tasks in Blind Individuals	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory processing; blindness; cortical thickness; crossmodal plasticity; occipital cortex; pitch processing	TERM LIGHT DEPRIVATION; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; EARLY VISUAL-CORTEX; WHITE-MATTER; MRI DATA; HESCHLS GYRUS; BRAIN MRI; HUMANS; DISCRIMINATION; REORGANIZATION	The behavioral and neurofunctional consequences of blindness often include performance enhancements and recruitment of occipital regions for nonvisual tasks. How the neuroanatomical changes resulting from this sensory loss relate to these functional changes is, however, less clear. Previous studies using cortical thickness (CT) measures have shown thicker occipital cortex in early-blind (EB) individuals compared with sighted controls. We hypothesized that this finding reflects the crossmodal plasticity often observed in blind individuals and thus could reflect behavioral adaptations. To address this issue, CT measures in blind (early and late) and sighted subjects were obtained along with several auditory behavioral measures in an attempt to relate behavioral and neuroanatomical changes. Group contrasts confirmed previous results in showing thicker occipital cortex in the EB. Regression analyses between CT measures across the whole brain of all blind individuals with the behavioral scores from 2 tasks in which EB subjects were superior (pitch and melody discrimination) showed that CT of occipital areas was directly related to behavioral enhancements. These findings constitute a compelling demonstration that anatomical changes in occipital areas are directly related to heightened behavioral abilities in the blind and hence support the idea that these anatomical features reflect adaptive compensatory plasticity.

Genesis of the cerebral cortex involves cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, all of which may be influenced by prenatal environment. Here, we show that variation in KCTD8 (potassium channel tetramerization domain 8) is associated with brain size in female adolescents (rs716890, P = 5.40 x 10(-09)). Furthermore, we found that the KCTD8 locus interacts with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking vis-a-vis cortical area and cortical folding: In exposed girls only, the KCTD8 locus explains up to 21% of variance. Using head circumference as a proxy of brain size at 7 years of age, we have replicated this gene-environment interaction in an independent sample. We speculate that KCTD8 might modulate adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy on brain development via apoptosis triggered by low intracellular levels of potassium, possibly reducing the number of progenitor cells.

Prospective associations between meth/amphetamine (speed) and MDMA (ecstasy) use and depressive symptoms in secondary school students	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							YOUNG-ADULTS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; METHAMPHETAMINE USE; PATTERNS; ADOLESCENTS; CANNABIS; ANXIETY; HEALTH; SEX	Background Research has raised significant concern regarding the affective consequences of synthetic drug use. However, little evidence from well-controlled longitudinal studies exists on these consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of meth/amphetamine (speed) and 63,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is independently predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms in adolescents. Methods A sample of 3880 adolescents from secondary schools in disadvantaged areas of Quebec, Canada, were followed over time (2003e2008). Logistic regression was used to test the association between meth/ amphetamine and MDMA use in grade 10 (ages 15-16 years) and elevated depressive symptoms on an abridged Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale in grade 11, controlling for pre-existing individual and contextual characteristics. Results After adjustment, both MDMA use (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and meth/amphetamine use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in grade 10 significantly increased the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in grade 11. These relationships did not vary by gender or pre-existing depressive symptoms. Increased risk was particularly observed in concurrent usage (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9). Conclusions Adolescent use of meth/amphetamine and MDMA (particularly concurrent use) is independently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Further enquiry must determine whether these associations reflect drug-induced neurotoxicity and whether adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to the hazards of synthetic drug exposure.

Does Antenatal Tobacco or Alcohol Exposure Influence a Child's Cerebral Palsy? A Population-Based Study	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION; PERINATAL FACTORS; PREGNANCY; CONSUMPTION; ANTECEDENTS; CLASSIFICATION; SUBTYPE; SYSTEM; RISKS	Antenatal tobacco and alcohol exposure are established risk factors for premature birth and an independent risk factor for cerebral palsy. Both exert adverse effects on fetal development. In children with cerebral palsy, whether antenatal exposure to tobacco or alcohol is associated with a difference in clinical profile remains unknown. The Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry was used to compare neurologic subtypes, gross motor functional impairment, and comorbidities in children with cerebral palsy who were or were not prenatally exposed to alcohol or tobacco. Information on in utero exposure was available in 249 children with cerebral palsy born from 1999-2002, of whom 77 were exposed to alcohol and 62 to tobacco in utero. No association was evident between exposure to tobacco or alcohol during pregnancy and neurologic subtype, Gross Motor Function Classification System score, mean number of comorbidities experienced, or each of eight comorbidities explored. Adjusting for prematurity or low birth weight exerted no effect on these results. In utero exposure to tobacco or alcohol does not assist in predicting clinical profiles of cerebral palsy.

We recently identified frequent alterations in chromatin remodelling pathways including recurrent mutations in H3F3A and mutations in ATRX (alpha-thalassemia/mental-retardation-syndrome-X-linked) in pediatric and young adult glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV astrocytoma). H3F3A mutations were specific to pediatric high-grade gliomas and identified in only 3.4 % of adult GBM. Using sequencing and/or immunohistochemical analyses, we investigated ATRX alterations (mutation/loss of expression) and their association with TP53 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in 140 adult WHO grade II, III and IV gliomas, 17 pediatric WHO grade II and III astrocytomas and 34 pilocytic astrocytomas. In adults, ATRX aberrations were detected in 33 % of grade II and 46 % of grade III gliomas, as well as in 80 % of secondary and 7 % of primary GBMs. They were absent in the 17 grade II and III astrocytomas in children, and the 34 pilocytic astrocytomas. ATRX alterations closely overlapped with mutations in IDH1/2 (p < 0.0001) and TP53 (p < 0.0001) in samples across all WHO grades. They were prevalent in astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas, but were absent in oligodendrogliomas (p < 0.0001). No significant association of ATRX mutation/loss of expression and alternative lengthening of telomeres was identified in our cohort. In summary, our data show that ATRX alterations are frequent in adult diffuse gliomas and are specific to astrocytic tumors carrying IDH1/2 and TP53 mutations. Combined alteration of these genes may contribute to drive the neoplastic growth in a major subset of diffuse astrocytomas in adults.

The MAPT H1 haplotype is associated with tangle-predominant dementia	ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA			English	Article						Dementia; Neurofibrillary tangle; Tau; Amyloid; MAPT; 3 ' Untranslated region; Aging; Alzheimer's disease; sAPP alpha	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; ONSET ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SENILE-DEMENTIA; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; TAU GENE; NEUROPATHOLOGIC ASSESSMENT; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; CORTICOBASAL DEGENERATION	Tangle-predominant dementia (TPD) patients exhibit cognitive decline that is clinically similar to early to moderate-stage Alzheimer disease (AD), yet autopsy reveals neurofibrillary tangles in the medial temporal lobe composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau without significant amyloid-beta (A beta)-positive plaques. We performed a series of neuropathological, biochemical and genetic studies using autopsy brain tissue drawn from a cohort of 34 TPD, 50 AD and 56 control subjects to identify molecular and genetic signatures of this entity. Biochemical analysis demonstrates a similar tau protein isoform composition in TPD and AD, which is compatible with previous histological and ultrastructural studies. Further, biochemical analysis fails to uncover elevation of soluble A beta in TPD frontal cortex and hippocampus compared to control subjects, demonstrating that non-plaque-associated A beta is not a contributing factor. Unexpectedly, we also observed high levels of secretory amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPP alpha) in the frontal cortex of some TPD patients compared to AD and control subjects, suggesting differences in APP processing. Finally, we tested whether TPD is associated with changes in the tau gene (MAPT). Haplotype analysis demonstrates a strong association between TPD and the MAPT H1 haplotype, a genomic inversion associated with some tauopathies and Parkinson disease (PD), when compared to age-matched control subjects with mild degenerative changes, i.e., successful cerebral aging. Next-generation resequencing of MAPT followed by association analysis shows an association between TPD and two polymorphisms in the MAPT 3' untranslated region (UTR). These results support the hypothesis that haplotype-specific variation in the MAPT 3' UTR underlies an A beta-independent mechanism for neurodegeneration in TPD.

Superior Analgesic Effect of H-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2 ([Dmt1]DALDA), a Multifunctional Opioid Peptide, Compared to Morphine in a Rat Model of Neuropathic Pain	CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN			English	Letter						[Dmt1]DALDA; hyperalgesia; morphine; neuropathic pain; opioid	IN-VITRO; MITOCHONDRIAL; INHIBITORS; RECEPTORS; AGONISTS; BINDING; DALDA	H-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2 ([Dmt1]DALDA) is a synthetic tetrapeptide with extraordinary selectivity for the mu-opioid receptor and is an extremely potent analgesic. [Dmt1]DALDA is unusual in the way that the greater part of its analgesic potency appears to be produced by its actions in the spinal cord. Furthermore, [Dmt1]DALDA inhibits norepinephrine re-uptake and is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant. Such characteristics may make [Dmt1]DALDA particularly effective against neuropathic pain. The present study was designed to compare the effects of [Dmt1]DALDA and morphine on thermal hyperalgesia in an experimental neuropathic pain model. Neuropathic pain was induced in rats by surgical ligation of the L5 spinal nerve, and thermal pain thresholds were assessed by latencies of paw withdrawal to radiant heat. The increase in paw withdrawal latency was greater after the administration of [Dmt1]DALDA than that of morphine in neuropathic rats at doses that were equianalgesic in naive animals. We conclude that [Dmt1]DALDA is more effective than morphine against thermal hyperalgesia in this experimental model of neuropathic pain.

In this regard, much of the research on cannabis and psychosis is currently focusing on gene-environment interactions. The present review will focus on the interaction between genes and cannabis exposure in the development of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia and the biological mechanisms of cannabis. Cannabis use has been shown to act together with other environmental factors such as childhood trauma or urbanicity producing synergistic dopamine sensitization effects. Studies on gene-environment interaction have mainly included genetic variants involved in the regulation of the dopaminergic system. The most promising genetic variants in this field are COMT, CNR1, BDNF, AKT1 and NRG1. Additionally, the interaction with other environmental factors and possible gene-gene interactions are considered in the etiological model.

Azobenzene photomechanics: prospects and potential applications	POLYMER BULLETIN			English	Article						Azobenzene; Photomechanics; Thin films; Light harvesting; Liquid crystals; Photochemistry	SURFACE-RELIEF GRATINGS; LIQUID-CRYSTALLINE POLYMER; CIS-TRANS-ISOMERIZATION; AROMATIC AZO CHROMOPHORES; LANGMUIR-BLODGETT-FILMS; OPTICAL NEAR-FIELD; DIRECTIONAL PHOTOFLUIDIZATION LITHOGRAPHY; AMPHIPHILIC SEQUENTIAL POLYPEPTIDE; FORMING ORGANIC MATERIALS; LIGHT-INDUCED DEFORMATION	The change in shape inducible in some photo-reversible molecules using light can effect powerful changes to a variety of properties of a host material. This class of reversible light-switchable molecules includes molecules that photo-dimerize, such as coumarins and anthracenes; those that allow intra-molecular photo-induced bond formation, such as fulgides, spiro-pyrans, and diarylethenes; and those that exhibit photo-isomerization, such as stilbenes, crowded alkenes, and azobenzenes. The most ubiquitous natural molecule for reversible shape change, however, and perhaps the inspiration for all artificial bio-mimics, is the rhodopsin/retinal protein system that enables vision, and this is the quintessential reversible photo-switch for performance and robustness. Here, the small retinal molecule embedded in a cage of rhodopsin helices isomerizes from a cis geometry to a trans geometry around a C=C double bond with the absorption of just a single photon. The modest shape change of just a few angstroms is quickly amplified and sets off a cascade of larger shape and chemical changes, eventually culminating in an electrical signal to the brain of a vision event, the energy of the input photon amplified many thousands of times in the process. Complicated biochemical pathways then revert the trans isomer back to cis, and set the system back up for another cascade upon subsequent absorption. The reversibility is complete, and many subsequent cycles are possible. The reversion mechanism back to the initial cis state is complex and enzymatic, hence direct application of the retinal/rhodopsin photo-switch to engineering systems is difficult. Perhaps the best artificial mimic of this strong photo-switching effect however in terms of reversibility, speed, and simplicity of incorporation, is azobenzene. Trans and cis states can be switched in microseconds with low-power light, reversibility of 10(5) and 10(6) cycles is routine before chemical fatigue, and a wide variety of molecular architectures is available to the synthetic materials chemist, permitting facile anchoring and compatibility, as well as chemical and physical amplification of the simple geometric change. This review article focuses on photo-mechanical effect taking place in various material systems incorporating azobenzene. The photo-mechanical effect can be defined as reversible change in shape by absorption of light, which results in a significant macroscopic mechanical deformation, and reversible mechanical actuation, of the host material. Thus, we exclude simple thermal expansion effects, reversible but non-mechanical photo-switching or photo-chemistry, as well as the wide range of optical and electro-optical switching effects for which good reviews exist elsewhere. Azobenzene-based material systems are also of great interest for light energy harvesting applications across much of the solar spectrum, yet this emerging field is still in an early enough stage of research output as to not yet warrant review, but we hope that some of the ideas put forward here toward promising future directions of research, will help guide the field.

Self and peer perceptions of childhood aggression, social withdrawal and likeability predict adult personality factors: A prospective longitudinal study	PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES			English	Article						Self and peer perceptions; Five Factor Model of personality; Aggression; Social withdrawal and likeability	PUPIL EVALUATION INVENTORY; 2 DECADES LATER; HEALTH OUTCOMES; LIFE-COURSE; CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; DISCREPANCIES; ADOLESCENCE; TEMPERAMENT; CONTINUITY	Self and peer perceptions of childhood aggression, social withdrawal and likeability were compared as predictors of adult personality factors from the Five Factor Model. Peer perceived aggression, self perceived social withdrawal and peer and self perceived likeability in childhood were anticipated to be the most closely linked with later personality factors. Participants, initially recruited from grade school in 1976-1978, completed self and peer evaluations of these childhood behaviours. In 1999-2003, participants, now in mid-adulthood, completed the NEO-FFI. Self perceived social withdrawal was associated with lower levels of Conscientiousness, but peer perceived social withdrawal was associated with lower levels of adult Extraversion. Peer perceived likeability was associated with higher levels of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, and lower levels of Neuroticism. Overall, these findings supported the use of peer. rather than self ratings of childhood behaviour patterns in the prediction of adult personality outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To our knowledge, no study has yet used fNIRS to investigate overt reading of irregular words and nonwords with a full coverage of the cerebral regions involved in reading processes. The aim of our study was to design and validate a protocol using fNIRS for the assessment of overt reading. Twelve healthy French-speaking adults underwent one session of fNIRS recording while performing an overt reading of 13 blocks of irregular words and nonwords. Reading blocks were separated by baseline periods during which participants were instructed to fixate a cross. Sources (n = 55) and detectors (n = 16) were placed bilaterally over frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Two wavelengths were used: 690 nm, more sensitive to deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) concentration changes, and 830 nm, more sensitive to oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration changes. For all participants, total hemoglobin (HbT) concentrations (HbO + HbR) were significantly higher than baseline for both irregular word and nonword reading in the inferior frontal gyri, the middle and superior temporal gyri, and the occipital cortices bilaterally. In the temporal gyri, although the difference was not significant, [HbT] values were higher in the left hemisphere. In the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, higher [HbT] values were found in nonword than in irregular word reading. This activation could be related to the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion characterizing the phonological pathway of reading. Our findings confirm that fNIRS is an appropriate technique to assess the neural correlates of overt reading.

Mouse Model of Intraluminal MCAO: Cerebral Infarct Evaluation by Cresyl Violet Staining	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Medicine; Issue 69; Neuroscience; Biochemistry; Anatomy; Physiology; transient ischemic stroke; middle cerebral artery occlusion; intraluminal model; neuroscore; cresyl violet staining; mice; imaging		Stroke is the third cause of mortality and the leading cause of disability in the World. Ischemic stroke accounts for approximately 80% of all strokes. However, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only treatment of acute ischemic stroke that exists. This led researchers to develop several ischemic stroke models in a variety of species. Two major types of rodent models have been developed: models of global cerebral ischemia or focal cerebral ischemia. To mimic ischemic stroke in patients, in whom approximately 80% thrombotic or embolic strokes occur in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model is quite relevant for stroke studies. This model was first developed in rats by Koizumi et al. in 1986 (1). Because of the ease of genetic manipulation in mice, these models have also been developed in this species (2-3). Herein, we present the transient MCA occlusion procedure in C57/Bl6 mice. Previous studies have reported that physical properties of the occluder such as tip diameter, length, shape, and flexibility are critical for the reproducibility of the infarct volume (4). Herein, a commercial silicon coated monofilaments (Doccol Corporation) have been used. Another great advantage is that this monofilament reduces the risk to induce subarachnoid hemorrhages. Using the Zeiss stereo-microscope Stemi 2000, the silicon coated monofilament was introduced into the internal carotid artery (ICA) via a cut in the external carotid artery (ECA) until the monofilament occludes the base of the MCA. Blood flow was restored (1) hour later by removal of the monofilament to mimic the restoration of blood flow after lysis of a thromboembolic clot in humans. The extent of cerebral infarct may be evaluated first by a neurologic score and by the measurement of the infarct volume. Ischemic mice were thus analyzed for their neurologic score at different post-reperfusion times. To evaluate the infarct volume, staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was usually performed. Herein, we used cresyl violet staining since it offers the opportunity to test many critical markers by immunohistochemistry. In this video, we report the MCAO procedure; neurological scores and the evaluation of the infarct volume by cresyl violet staining.

This magnetic resonance imaging research aims to assess the effects of aging on the organization of gray matter structural covariance networks. Here, we used voxel-based morphometry on high-definition brain scans to compare the patterns of gray matter structural covariance networks that sustain different sensorimotor and high-order cognitive functions among young (n = 88, mean age = 23.5 +/- 3.1 years, female/male = 55/33) and older (n = 88, mean age = 67.3 +/- 5.9 years, female/male = 55/33) participants. This approach relies on the assumption that functionally correlated brain regions show correlations in gray matter volume as a result of mutually trophic influences or common experience-related plasticity. We found reduced structural association in older adults compared with younger adults, specifically in high-order cognitive networks. Major differences were observed in the structural covariance networks that subserve the following: a) the language-related semantic network, b) the executive control network, and c) the default-mode network. Moreover, these cognitive functions are typically altered in the older population. Our results indicate that healthy aging alters the structural organization of cognitive networks, shifting from a more distributed (in young adulthood) to a more localized topological organization in older individuals.

Such patterns are typically analysed using either univariate or multivariate statistical techniques. In this work we combined voxel-based group analysis and independent component analysis to extract differential characteristic patterns from PET data of glucose metabolism in a large cohort of normal elderly controls and patients with AD. The patterns were used in conjunction with a support vector machine to discriminate between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at risk or not of converting to AD. The method was applied to baseline fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET images of subjects from the ADNI database. Our approach achieved improved early detection and differentiation of typical versus pathological metabolic patterns in the MCI population, reaching 80% accuracy (85% sensitivity and 75% specificity) when using selected regions. The method has the potential to assist in the advance diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and to identify early in the development of the disease those individuals at high risk of rapid cognitive decline who could be Candidates for new therapeutic approaches.

Lesions of the lateral habenula dissociate the reward-enhancing and locomotor-stimulant effects of amphetamine	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Lateral habenula; Medial habenula; Reward; Locomotion; Amphetamine; Posterior mesencephalon; Medial forebrain bundle	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINE NEURONS; SELF-STIMULATION; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; CONSCIOUS RAT; MIDBRAIN; COCAINE	Midbrain dopamine neurons play a key role in goal-directed behaviour as well as in some psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have provided electrophysiological, anatomical and biochemical evidence that the lateral habenula (LHb) exerts strong inhibitory control over midbrain dopamine neurons. However, the behavioural relevance of this inhibitory input is poorly understood. Our aim was to examine the contribution of the LHb to dopamine-sensitive behaviour. Here, we characterized the locomotorstimulant and reward-enhancing properties of amphetamine in rats with and without neurotoxic lesions of the LHb. Amphetamine-induced forward locomotion and reward were respectively measured in automated activity cages and with intracranial self-stimulation. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally infused with ibotenic acid in the LHb and allowed 7-10 days post-operative recovery. The locomotor-stimulant and reward-enhancing properties of amphetamine (0, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, ip) were then tested in different groups of lesioned and sham-lesioned rats. Neurotoxic lesions of the LHb caused a significant enhancement of the locomotor-stimulant effect of amphetamine, an effect not seen following lesions of the medial habenula. Conversely, the reward-enhancing properties of amphetamine did not differ between lesioned and sham-lesioned rats responding for rewarding electrical stimulation of the posterior mesencephalon or the medial forebrain bundle. The dissociation between the locomotorstimulant and reward-enhancing effects of amphetamine following LHb lesions suggests the contribution of two distinct substrates that are functionally dissociable and differentially sensitive to LHb modulation.

NT activates metabotropic receptors coupled to Gq heterotrimeric G proteins, a signaling pathway often triggering endocannabinoid (EC) production in the brain. Because ECs act as negative regulators of many glutamate synapses and have also been shown recently to gate LTP induction in the VTA, we examined the hypothesis that NT regulates glutamate-mediated synaptic inputs to VTA DA neurons. We performed whole cell patch-clamp recordings in VTA DA neurons in TH-EGFP transgenic mouse brain slices and found that NT induces a long-lasting decrease of the EPSC amplitude that was mediated by the type 1 NT receptor. An antagonist of the CB1 EC receptor blocked this decrease. This effect of NT was not dependent on intracellular calcium, but required G-protein activation and phospholipase C. Blockade of the CB1 receptor after the induction of EPSC depression reversed synaptic depression, an effect not mimicked by blocking NT receptors, thus suggesting the occurrence of prolonged EC production and release. The EC responsible for synaptic depression was identified as 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the same EC known to gate LTP induction in VIA DA neurons. However, blocking NT receptors during LTP induction did not facilitate LTP induction, suggesting that endogenously released NT is not a major source of EC production during LIP inducing stimulations.

Cholinergic depletion in nucleus accumbens impairs mesocortical dopamine activation and cognitive function in rats	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Animal model; Immunohistochemistry; Saporin; Ventral striatum; In vivo voltammetry	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPATIAL DELAYED ALTERNATION; D-1 RECEPTOR MODULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VENTRAL STRIATUM; CORTICAL DOPAMINE; ARBITRARY PARTICLES; BASAL FOREBRAIN; SEX-DIFFERENCES	In rats, selective depletion of the cholinergic interneurons in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens or N.Acc.) results in heightened behavioural sensitivity to amphetamine and impaired sensorimotor gating processes, suggesting a hyper-responsiveness to dopamine (DA) activity in the N.Acc. We hypothesized that local cholinergic depletion may also trigger distal functional alterations, particularly in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected bilaterally in the N.Acc. with an immunotoxin targeting choline acetyltransferase. Two weeks later, cognitive function was assessed using the delayed alternation paradigm in the T-maze. The rats were then implanted with voltammetric recording electrodes in the ventromedial PFC to measure in vivo extracellular DA release in response to mild tail pinch stress. The PFC was also examined for density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-labelled varicosities. In another cohort of control and lesioned rats, we measured post mortem tissue content of DA. Depletion of cholinergic neurons (restricted to N.Acc.) significantly impaired delayed alternation performance across delay intervals. While (basal) post mortem indices of PFC DA function were unaffected by N.Acc. lesions, in vivo mesocortical DA activation was markedly reduced; this deficit correlated significantly with cognitive impairments. TH-labelled varicosities however, were unaffected in cortical layer V relative to controls. These data suggest that selective depletion of cholinergic interneurons in N.Acc. triggers widespread functional impairments in mesocorticolimbic DA function and cognition. The possible relevance of these findings is also discussed in relation to schizophrenia, where reduced density of cholinergic neurons in ventral striatum has been reported. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Ixabepilone-associated peripheral neuropathy: data from across the phase II and III clinical trials	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Neuropathy; Ixabepilone; Epothilone; Breast cancer; Microtubules	METASTATIC BREAST-CANCER; EPOTHILONE-B-ANALOG; PLUS CAPECITABINE; ANTHRACYCLINE; BMS-247550; TAXANE; CHEMOTHERAPY; RESISTANT; PACLITAXEL; DOCETAXEL	Dose-limiting neuropathy is a major adverse event associated with most of the microtubule-stabilizing agent-based chemotherapy regimens. Ixabepilone, a semisynthetic analogue of the natural epothilone B, has activity against a wide range of tumor types. Peripheral neuropathy (PN), associated with ixabepilone treatment, is usually mild to moderate, predominantly sensory and cumulative. Preclinical studies demonstrate that ixabepilone and taxanes produce a similar neurotoxicity profile. We searched databases of phase II/III clinical trials involving patients receiving ixabepilone as a monotherapy or in combination with capecitabine for incidences of neuropathy. Potential risk factors for grade 3/4 PN were identified by a Cox regression analysis on a dataset of 1,540 patients with different tumor types across multiple studies. Rates for incidence of ixabepilone-induced severe PN (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3/4) ranged from 1% in early untreated breast cancer up to 24% in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer; grade 4 PN was rare (a parts per thousand currency sign1%). Common symptoms included numbness, paresthesias, and sometimes dysesthesias. Cox regression analysis identified only preexisting neuropathy as a risk factor for increased ixabepilone-associated PN. The management of PN has been primarily through dose adjustments (dose delays and/or dose reduction). Patients had resolution of their neuropathy within a median time of 5 to 6 weeks. PN is a dose-limiting toxicity associated with ixabepilone treatment, is reversible in most patients, and can be managed with dose reduction and delays.

In order to determine if these receptors are closely associated with each other, and with other components involved in G protein-mediated signal transduction, beta(2)AR, D4DR, G protein subunits (Ga-i1 and the G beta(1)gamma(2) heterodimer) and AC were tagged so that bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) could be used to monitor their interactions. All of the tagged proteins retained biological function. For the first time. FlAsH-labeled proteins were used in BRET experiments as fluorescent acceptors for the energy transferred from Renilla luciferase-tagged donor proteins. Our experiments revealed that beta(2)AR, D4DR. G proteins and AC were closely associated in a functional signaling complex in cellulo. Furthermore. BRET experiments indicated that although activation of G(i) caused a conformational change within the heterotrimeric protein, it did not cause the G beta gamma heterodimer to dissociate from the Ga-i1 subunit. Evidence for the presence of a signaling complex in vivo was obtained by purifying beta AR from detergent extracts of mouse brain with alprenolol-Sepharose and showing that the precipitate also contained both D-2-like dopamine receptors and AC.

To further address actuator saturation problem, a modified fault tolerant control law is then presented to ensure that the resulting control signal will never incur saturation. It is shown that the roll, pitch and yaw angle trajectories can globally asymptotically track the desired attitude in the face of faulty actuator, system uncertainties, external disturbances and even actuator saturation. A simulation example of a flexible spacecraft is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

The number of Chinese dementia patients reached 5 million in 2001 and will grow rapidly by 314-336% in 2040. Caring for patients with dementia is a stressful experience, which can cause the physical and mental problems in caregivers. According to the protocol, we evaluated the burden, depression and anxiety of caregivers by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale, Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). 90 caregivers of dementia patients and 90 caregivers of nondementia patients with other chronic diseases from 24 military communities in Beijing were enrolled in this investigation. The scores of burden, depression and anxiety increased from nondementia to severe dementia groups. There were associations between patient's CDR score and CBI score, as well as the average daily care time and CBI score. In addition, the scores of SDS and SAS were both positive correlated to CBI score. Comparing to general community, the caregivers of dementia veterans had lower scores in SDS and SAS. Therefore, we should pay more attentions to the caregivers of severe dementia patients. Reduction of daily care time is a possible way to releasing the burden of caregivers. Better general supports are beneficial to reducing depression and anxiety when caregivers confront the heavy burden. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To reinforce the resiliency of individuals and communities in facing extreme heat event, cities are developing reliable tools to predict the indoor thermal characteristics using available building characteristics, climate data and socio-economical factors. In this study, a novel approach is proposed to predict the indoor thermal conditions in these buildings. First, a measurement campaign is conducted to monitor indoor thermal condition within 55 buildings in most vulnerable regions on the Island of Montreal. Two models, Simplified and Advanced, are developed to predict hourly indoor dry-bulb temperatures. Both models use an advanced Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique. The Simplified ANN Model generates a correlation between airport weather observations and monitored indoor dry-bulb temperatures. On the other hand, the Advanced Model includes ten influential parameters, which represent the effect of neighboring environment, building characteristics and its usage patterns on the indoor thermal condition. Comparison of these two predictive models is conducted on different levels of simulation and validation. The Advanced Model shows better accuracy in predicting the indoor thermal conditions, thus justifying the use of neighborhood specific parameters to forecast indoor environment condition in an urban heat island area.

Similarly, pictures of faces are likely to activate social affordances, that is, interactions that would be possible with the person whose face is being presented. Most interestingly, if it is the face of a real person that is shown, one particular type of social interactions can even be carried out while event-related potentials (ERPs) are recorded. Indeed, subtle eye movements can be made to achieve an eye contact with the person with minimal artefacts on the EEG. The present study thus used the face of a real person to explore the electrophysiological correlates of affordances in a situation where some of them (i.e., eye contacts) are actually performed. The ERPs this person elicited were compared to those evoked by another 3D stimulus: a real dummy, and thus by a stimulus that should also automatically activate eye contact affordances but with which such affordances could then be inhibited since they cannot be carried out with an object. The photos of the person and of the dummy were used as matching stimuli that should not activate social affordances as strongly as the two 3D stimuli and for which social affordances cannot be carried out. The fronto-central N300s to the real dummy were found of greater amplitudes than those to the photos and to the real person. We propose that these greater N300s index the greater inhibition needed after the stronger activations of affordances induced by this 3D stimulus than by the photos. Such an inhibition would not have occurred in the case of the real person because eye contacts were carried out.	[Debruille, J.

Emotional Speech Processing at the Intersection of Prosody and Semantics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AFFECT DECISION TASK; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; ERP EVIDENCE; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; HUMAN-COMMUNICATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; WORD; LANGUAGE	The ability to accurately perceive emotions is crucial for effective social interaction. Many questions remain regarding how different sources of emotional cues in speech (e. g., prosody, semantic information) are processed during emotional communication. Using a cross-modal emotional priming paradigm (Facial affect decision task), we compared the relative contributions of processing utterances with single-channel (prosody-only) versus multi-channel (prosody and semantic) cues on the perception of happy, sad, and angry emotional expressions. Our data show that emotional speech cues produce robust congruency effects on decisions about an emotionally related face target, although no processing advantage occurred when prime stimuli contained multi-channel as opposed to single-channel speech cues. Our data suggest that utterances with prosodic cues alone and utterances with combined prosody and semantic cues both activate knowledge that leads to emotional congruency (priming) effects, but that the convergence of these two information sources does not always heighten access to this knowledge during emotional speech processing.

Particularly critical is the role of the mother. A possible mechanism is that these effects are mediated by "epigenetic" mechanisms. Studies in rodents suggest a causal relationship between early-life adversity and changes in DNA methylation in several "candidate genes" in the brain. This study examines whether randomized differential rearing (maternal vs surrogate-peer rearing) of rhesus macaques is associated with differential methylation in early adulthood. The data presented here show that differential rearing leads to differential DNA methylation in both prefrontal cortex and T cells. These differentially methylated promoters tend to cluster by both chromosomal region and gene function. The broad impact of maternal rearing on DNA methylation in both the brain and T cells supports the hypothesis that the response to early-life adversity is system-wide and genome-wide and persists to adulthood. Our data also point to the feasibility of studying the impact of the social environment in peripheral T-cell DNA methylation.

Measurement of the t-channel single top-quark production cross section in pp collisions at root s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article								We report a measurement of the cross section of single top-quark production in the t-channel using 1.04 fb(-1) of pp collision data at root s = 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Selected events feature one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets, exactly one of them identified as originating from a b quark. The cross section is measured by fitting the distribution of a multivariate discriminant constructed with a neural network, yielding sigma(t) = 83 +/- 4 (stat.)(-19)(+20) (syst.) pb, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the Standard Model. Using the ratio of the measured to the theoretically predicted cross section and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation vertical bar V-tb vertical bar >> vertical bar V-ts vertical bar, vertical bar V-td vertical bar, the coupling strength at the W-t-b vertex is determined to be vertical bar V-tb vertical bar = 1.13(-0.13)(+0.14). If it is assumed that vertical bar V-tb vertical bar <= 1 a lower limit of vertical bar V-tb vertical bar > 0.75 is obtained at the 95% confidence level. (C) 2012 CERN. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This process involves sensory inputs, central processing and motor outputs. Recent studies have made considerable progress in identifying mechanosensitive neurons and mechanosensation receptor proteins. Our understandings of molecular and cellular mechanisms that link mechanosensation with the changes in moving direction, however, remain limited. Results: In this study, we investigate the control of movement adjustment in Drosophila. In response to gentle touch at the anterior segments, Drosophila larvae reorient and select a new direction for forward movement. The extent of change in moving direction is correlated with the intensity of tactile stimuli. Sensation of gentle touch requires chordotonal organs and class IV da neurons. Genetic analysis indicates an important role for the evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily protein Turtle (Tutl) to regulate touch-initiated directional change. Tutl is required specifically in post-mitotic neurons at larval stage after the completion of embryonic development. Circuit breaking analysis identified a small subset of Tutl-positive neurons that are involved in the adjustment of moving direction. Conclusion: We identify Tutl and a small subset of CNS neurons in modulating directional change in response to gentle touch. This study presents an excellent starting point for further dissection of molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling directional adjustment after mechanical stimulation.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE FOR SYNAPTIC RELEASE OF GABA FROM MELANIN-CONCENTRATING HORMONE CONTAINING VARICOSITIES IN THE LOCUS COERULEUS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						gephyrin; noradrenaline; sleep; synaptophysin; VGAT; VGluT	RAT LATERAL HYPOTHALAMUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DENSE CORED VESICLES; SLEEP-WAKING CYCLE; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; PROTEIN DISTRIBUTION; GABAERGIC SYNAPSES; CONTAINING NEURONS; MESSENGER-RNA; MCH1 RECEPTOR	Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is synthesized by neurons located in the hypothalamus and projecting to widespread regions of the brain, including the locus coeruleus (LC), through which MCH could modulate sleep. wake states. Yet MCH does not appear to exert direct postsynaptic effects on target neurons, including the noradrenergic LC neurons. Previous studies using in situ hybridization showed that MCH neurons synthesize glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and could thus utilize GABA as a neurotransmitter. To determine whether MCH varicosities can release GABA, we examined by fluorescent microscopy in the LC, whether their terminals also contain the vesicular transporter for GABA (VGAT). In dual-immunostained sections, we found that approximately 6% of MCH varicosities was immunopositive for VGAT and a similar proportion for synaptophysin, the presynaptic marker for small synaptic vesicles, whereas < 1% was positive for the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT2). Moreover, of the MCH varicosities, similar to 5% abutted puncta that were immunostained for gephyrin, the postsynaptic marker for GABAergic synapses. In triple-immunostained sections viewed with confocal laser scanning microscopy, we established that MCH varicosities that also contained VGAT or abutted upon gephyrin puncta contacted the tyrosine hydroxylase-immunostained neurons of the LC. Our results suggest that although MCH neurons can influence noradrenergic LC neurons through paracrine release and indirect effects of their peptide, they can also do so through synaptic release and direct postsynaptic effects of GABA and thus serve to inhibit the LC neurons during sleep, when they are silent, and the MCH neurons discharge.

The interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures to toxins has long been thought to be relevant to ALS. One cellular mechanism to overcome stress is the formation of small dense cytoplasmic domains called stress granules (SG) which contain translationally arrested mRNAs. TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP) is an ALS-causative gene that we have previously implicated in the regulation of the core stress granule proteins G3BP and TIA-1. TIA-1 and G3BP localize to SG under nearly all stress conditions and are considered essential to SG formation. Here, we report that TDP-43 is required for proper SG dynamics, especially SG assembly as marked by the secondary aggregation of TIA-1. We also show that SG assembly, but not initiation, requires G3BP. Furthermore, G3BP can rescue defective SG assembly in cells depleted of endogenous TDP-43. We also demonstrate that endogenous TDP-43 and FUS do not have overlapping functions in this cellular process as SG initiation and assembly occur normally in the absence of FUS. Lastly, we observe that SG assembly is a contributing factor in the survival of neuronal-like cells responding to acute oxidative stress. These data raise the possibility that disruptions of normal stress granule dynamics by loss of nuclear TDP-43 function may contribute to neuronal vulnerability in ALS.

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling Is a Key Regulator of the Transit-Amplifying Progenitor Pool in the Adult and Aging Forebrain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURAL STEM-CELLS; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; LIFE-SPAN; OLIGODENDROCYTE DIFFERENTIATION; EPENDYMAL CELLS; VASCULAR NICHE; MTOR PATHWAY; BRAIN; NEUROGENESIS; STROKE	Adult forebrain neurogenesis is dynamically regulated. Multiple families of niche-derived cues have been implicated in this regulation, but the precise roles of key intracellular signaling pathways remain vaguely defined. Here, we show that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is pivotal in determining proliferation versus quiescence in the adult forebrain neural stem cell (NSC) niche. Within this niche, mTORcomplex-1 (mTORC1) activation displays stage specificity, occurring in transiently amplifying (TA) progenitor cells but not in GFAP+ stem cells. Inhibiting mTORC1 depletes the TA progenitor pool in vivo and suppresses epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced proliferation within neurosphere cultures. Interestingly, mTORC1 inhibition induces a quiescence-like phenotype that is reversible. Likewise, mTORC1 activity and progenitor proliferation decline within the quiescent NSC niche of the aging brain, while EGF administration reactivates the quiescent niche in an mTORC1-dependent manner. These findings establish fundamental links between mTOR signaling, proliferation, and aging-associated quiescence in the adult forebrain NSC niche.

We first examined the differences in global size and morphology of the brain among the three groups. We then constructed the T2-weighted MRI and DTI atlases and employed voxel-based analysis to investigate ethnic differences in morphological shape of the brain from the T2-weighted MRI, and white matter microstructure measured by fractional anisotropy derived from DTI. Compared with Malay neonates, the brains of Indian neonates' tended to be more elongated in anterior and posterior axis relative to the superior-inferior axis of the brain even though the total brain volume was similar among the three groups. Although most anatomical regions of the brain were similar among Chinese, Malay, and Indian neonates, there were anatomical variations in the spinal-cerebellar and cortical-striatal-thalamic neural circuits among the three populations. The population-related brain regions highlighted in our study are key anatomical substrates associated with sensorimotor functions.

However, it remains unknown whether brain amyloidosis and hypometabolism follow the same trajectories in MCI individuals. We used the concept of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) as defined by the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-Go in order to compare the biomarker profile between EMCI and LMCI. Objectives: To examine the global and voxel-based neocortical amyloid burden and metabolism among individuals who are cognitively normal (CN), as well as those with EMCI, LMCI and mild AD. Methods: In the present study, 354 participants, including CN (n = 109), EMCI (n = 157), LMCI (n = 39) and AD (n = 49), were enrolled between September 2009 and November 2011 through ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. Brain amyloid load and metabolism were estimated using [F-18]AV45 and [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose ([F-18]FDG) PET, respectively. Uptake ratio images of [F-18]AV45 and [F-18]FDG were calculated by dividing the summed PET image by the median counts of the grey matter of the cerebellum and pons, respectively. Group differences of global [F-18]AV45 and [F-18]FDG were analyzed using ANOVA, while the voxel-based group differences were estimated using statistic parametric mapping (SPM). Results: EMCI patients showed higher global [F-18]AV45 retention compared to CN and lower uptake compared to LMCI. SPM detected higher [F-18] AV45 uptake in EMCI compared to CN in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, medial and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. EMCI showed lower [F-18]AV45 retention than LMCI in the superior temporal, inferior parietal, as well as dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. Regarding to the global [F-18] FDG, EMCI patients showed no significant difference from CN and a higher uptake ratio compared to LMCI. At the voxel level, EMCI showed higher metabolism in precuneus, hippocampus, entorhinal and inferior parietal cortices, as compared to LMCI. Conclusions: The present results indicate that brain metabolism remains normal despite the presence of significant amyloid accumulation in EMCI. These results suggest a role for anti-amyloid interventions in EMCI aiming to delay or halt the deposition of amyloid and related metabolism impairment.

Object identification is processed in temporal structures (ventral stream), whereas object localization leads to activation of parietal structures (dorsal stream). To examine whether the chemical senses demonstrate a similar dissociation, we investigated odor identification and odor localization in 16 healthy young subjects using functional MRI. We used two odors-(1) eucalyptol; (2) a mixture of phenylethanol and carbon dioxide)-which were delivered to only one nostril. During odor identification subjects had to recognize the odor; during odor localization they had to detect the stimulated nostril. We used general linear model (GLM) as a classical method as well as independent component analysis (ICA) in order to investigate a possible neuroanatomical dissociation between both tasks. Both methods showed differences between tasks-confirming a dual processing stream in the chemical senses-but revealed complementary results. Specifically, GLM identified the left intraparietal sulcus and the right superior frontal sulcus to be more activated when subjects were localizing the odorants. For the same task, ICA identified a significant cluster in the left parietal lobe (paracentral lobule) but also in the right hippocampus. While GLM did not find significant activations for odor identification, ICA revealed two clusters (in the left central fissure and the left superior frontal gyrus) for this task. These data demonstrate that higher order chemosensory processing shares the general subdivision into a ventral and a dorsal processing stream with other sensory systems and suggest that this is a global principle, independent of sensory channels.

Although successful in Xenopus oocytes, single subunit counting, manually counting photobleaching steps of GFP-tagged subunits, has been hindered in mammalian cells by high background fluorescence, poor control of expression, and low GFP maturation efficiency. Here, we present a fully automated single-molecule fluorescence counting method that separates tagged proteins on the plasma membrane from background fluorescence and contaminant proteins in the cytosol or the endoplasmic reticulum and determines the protein stoichiometry. Lower GFP maturation rates observed in cells cultured at 37 degrees C were partly offset using a monomeric version of superfolder GFP. We were able to correctly identify the stoichiometry of GluK2 and alpha 1 glycine receptors. Our approach permits the elucidation of stoichiometry for a wide variety of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells with any commercially available TIRF microscope.

Comment on "Restoring Voluntary Control of Locomotion After Paralyzing Spinal Cord Injury"	SCIENCE			English	Editorial Material							PROPRIOSPINAL NEURONS; COMMAND SIGNAL; BULBOSPINAL TRANSMISSION; CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; RECEPTORS; RECOVERY; DEPENDS; PATTERN	Van den Brand et al. (Reports, 1 June 2012, p. 1182) claim to have restored voluntary control of locomotion after paralyzing spinal cord injury. They have not considered recent findings that their upright posture paradigm contributes to locomotor capability after such injuries. We propose that postural adjustments that activate the locomotor central pattern generator in the upright posture, rather than direct voluntary control of locomotion, account for their results.

Recent studies have revealed that alpha B-crystallin plays a beneficial role in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, brain ischemia, and Alexander disease. Whether alpha B-crystallin plays a role in modulating the secondary damage after CNS trauma is not known. We report here that alpha B-crystallin mediates protective effects after spinal cord injury. The levels of alpha B-crystallin are reduced in spinal cord tissue following contusion lesion. In addition, administration of recombinant human alpha B-crystallin for the first week after contusion injury leads to sustained improvement in locomotor skills and amelioration of secondary tissue damage. We also provide evidence that recombinant human alpha B-crystallin modulates the inflammatory response in the injured spinal cord, leading to increased infiltration of granulocytes and reduced recruitment of inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, the delivery of recombinant human alpha B-crystallin promotes greater locomotor recovery even when the treatment is initiated 6 h after spinal cord injury. Our findings suggest that administration of recombinant human alpha B-crystallin may be a good therapeutic approach for treating acute spinal cord injury, for which there is currently no effective treatment.

Serotonin-Induced Cleavage of the Atypical Protein Kinase C Apl III in Aplysia	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INTERMEDIATE-TERM FACILITATION; SIPHON MOTOR-NEURONS; M-ZETA; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; MEMORY; PHOSPHORYLATION; ENHANCEMENT; MAINTENANCE; SYNAPSES	A constitutively active kinase, known as protein kinase M zeta (PKM zeta), is proposed to act as a long-lasting molecular memory trace. While PKM zeta is formed in rodents through translation of a transcript initiating in an intron of the protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta) gene, this transcript does not exist in Aplysia californica despite the fact that inhibitors of PKM zeta erase memory in Aplysia in a fashion similar to rodents. We have previously shown that, in Aplysia, the ortholog of PKC zeta, PKCApl III, is cleaved by calpain to form a PKM after overexpression of PKC Apl III. We now show that kinase activity is required for this cleavage. We further use a FRET reporter to measure cleavage of PKC Apl III into PKM Apl III in live neurons using a stimulus that induces plasticity. Our results show that a 10 min application of serotonin induces cleavage of PKC Apl III in motor neuron processes in a calpain-and protein synthesis-dependent manner, but does not induce cleavage of PKC Apl III in sensory neuron processes. Furthermore, a dominant-negative PKM Apl III expressed in the motor neuron blocked the late phase of intermediate-term facilitation in sensory-motor neuron cocultures induced by 10 min of serotonin. In summary, we provide evidence that PKC Apl III is cleaved into PKM Apl III during memory formation, that the requirements for cleavage are the same as the requirements for the plasticity, and that PKM in the motor neuron is required for intermediate-term facilitation.

Neural Correlates of Sensory Substitution in Vestibular Pathways following Complete Vestibular Loss	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; EYE-HEAD COORDINATION; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; GAZE SHIFTS; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; BILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; PASSIVE HEAD	Sensory substitution is the term typically used in reference to sensory prosthetic devices designed to replace input from one defective modality with input from another modality. Such devices allow an alternative encoding of sensory information that is no longer directly provided by the defective modality in a purposeful and goal-directed manner. The behavioral recovery that follows complete vestibular loss is impressive and has long been thought to take advantage of a natural form of sensory substitution in which head motion information is no longer provided by vestibular inputs, but instead by extravestibular inputs such as proprioceptive and motor efference copy signals. Here we examined the neuronal correlates of this behavioral recovery after complete vestibular loss in alert behaving monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We show for the first time that extravestibular inputs substitute for the vestibular inputs to stabilize gaze at the level of single neurons in the vestibulo-ocular reflex premotor circuitry. The summed weighting of neck proprioceptive and efference copy information was sufficient to explain simultaneously observed behavioral improvements in gaze stability. Furthermore, by altering correspondence between intended and actual head movement we revealed a fourfold increase in the weight of neck motor efference copy signals consistent with the enhanced behavioral recovery observed when head movements are voluntary versus unexpected. Thus, together our results provide direct evidence that the substitution by extravestibular inputs in vestibular pathways provides a neural correlate for the improvements in gaze stability that are observed following the total loss of vestibular inputs.

However, it is unlikely that such effects completely capture the evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mechanisms of early adaptation to environment. Here we present DNA methylation profiles spanning 6.5 million base pairs centered at the NR3C1 gene in the hippocampus of humans who experienced abuse as children and nonabused controls. We compare these profiles to corresponding DNA methylation profiles in rats that received differential levels of maternal care. The profiles of both species reveal hundreds of DNA methylation differences associated with early life experience distributed across the entire region in nonrandom patterns. For instance, methylation differences tend to cluster by genomic location, forming clusters covering as many as 1 million bases. Even more surprisingly, these differences seem to specifically target regulatory regions such as gene promoters, particularly those of the protocadherin alpha, beta, and gamma gene families. Beyond these high-level similarities, more detailed analyses reveal methylation differences likely stemming from the significant biological and environmental differences between species. These results provide support for an analogous cross-species epigenetic regulatory response at the level of the genomic region to early life experience.

We have recently identified recurrent H3F3A mutations affecting two critical amino acids (K27 and G34) of histone H3.3 in one-third of pediatric GBM. Here, we show that each H3F3A mutation defines an epigenetic subgroup of GBM with a distinct global methylation pattern, and that they are mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutations, which characterize a third mutation-defined subgroup. Three further epigenetic subgroups were enriched for hallmark genetic events of adult GBM and/or established transcriptomic signatures.

Neural processing of sensory and emotional-communicative information associated with the perception of vicarious pain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Vicarious pain; Pain communication; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Inferior parietal lobule (IPL); Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN AMYGDALA; BRAIN-FUNCTION; EMPATHY; RESPONSES; SYSTEM; OTHERS; BODY; REACTIVITY	The specific neural processes underlying vicarious pain perception are not fully understood. In this functional imaging study, 20 participants viewed pain-evoking or neutral images displaying either sensory or emotional-communicative information. The pain images displayed nociceptive agents applied to the hand or the foot (sensory information) or facial expressions of pain (emotional-communicative information) and were matched with their neutral counterparts. Combining pain-evoking and neutral images showed that body limbs elicited greater activity in sensory motor regions, whereas midline frontal and parietal cortices and the amygdala responded more strongly to faces. The pain-evoking images elicited greater activity than their neutral counterparts in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the bilateral extrastriate body area. However, greater pain-related activity was observed in the rostral IPL when images depicted a hand or foot compared to a facial expression of pain, suggesting a more specific involvement in the coding of somato-motor information. Posterior probability maps enabling Bayesian inferences further showed that the anterior IFG (BA 45 and 47) was the only region showing no intrinsic probability of activation by the neutral images, consistent with a role in the extraction of the meaning of pain-related visual cues. Finally, inter-individual empathy traits correlated with responses in the supracallosal mid/anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula when pain-evoking images of body limbs or facial expressions were presented, suggesting that these regions regulated the observer's affective-motivational response independent from the channels from which vicarious pain is perceived.

Reduction of physiological noise with independent component analysis improves the detection of nociceptive responses with fMRI of the human spinal cord	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Spinal cord; fMRI; Physiological noise; ICA; Pain	GENERAL LINEAR-MODEL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; 1.5 T; BOLD; STIMULATION; BRAIN; LEVEL; ACTIVATION; MOTOR	The evaluation of spinal cord neuronal activity in humans with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is technically challenging. Major difficulties arise from cardiac and respiratory movement artifacts that constitute significant sources of noise. In this paper we assessed the Correction of Structured noise using spatial Independent Component Analysis (CORSICA). FMRI data of the cervical spinal cord were acquired in 14 healthy subjects using gradient-echo EPI. Nociceptive electrical stimuli were applied to the thumb. Additional data with short TR (250 ms, to prevent aliasing) were acquired to generate a spatial map of physiological noise derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Physiological noise was subsequently removed from the long-TR data after selecting independent components based on the generated noise map. Stimulus-evoked responses were analyzed using the general linear model, with and without CORSICA and with a regressor generated from the cerebrospinal fluid region. Results showed higher sensitivity to detect stimulus-related activation in the targeted dorsal segment of the cord after CORSICA. Furthermore, fewer voxels showed stimulus-related signal changes in the CSF and outside the spinal region, suggesting an increase in specificity. ICA can be used to effectively reduce physiological noise in spinal cord fMRI time series. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mammary epithelial-restricted expression of activated c-src rescues the block to mammary gland morphogenesis due to the deletion of the C-terminus of Patched-1	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Mammary gland; Patched-1; c-src; Hedgehog signalling; Estrogen receptor	ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR GENE; CELL-CYCLE PROGRESSION; SONIC HEDGEHOG; TRANSGENIC MICE; WW DOMAIN; MESENCHYMAL DYSPLASIA; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; NEURAL-TUBE; MCF-7 CELLS; CROSS-TALK	Mesenchymal dysplasia (mes) mice expressing a C-terminally truncated version of the Hedgehog (Hh)-ligand receptor, Patched-1 (Ptch1), exhibit a limited spectrum of developmental defects including blocked ductal morphogenesis of the mammary gland during puberty. Given that the Hh-ligands can stimulate signalling cascades distinct from the canonical pathway involving Smo and the Gil-family proteins and that Ptch1 binds to factors harbouring SH3-domains, we determined whether the mes mammary gland defect could be rescued by activating non-canonical signalling pathways downstream of Ptch1. We demonstrate here that expression of constitutively active c-src (c-src(Act)) in mammary epithelial cells overcomes the block to mammary epithelial morphogenesis in mes mice. Specifically, MMTV-directed expression of c-srcAct rescued blocked ductal morphogenesis in mes mice, albeit only after animals were more than 15 weeks of age. The overall morphology resembled wild type mice expressing c-src(Act) although 40% of mes/MMTV-c-src(Act) mice exhibited terminal end buds at 24 weeks of age. C-src(Act) restored the proliferative capacity of mes epithelial cells, self-renewal capacity of mammary progenitor cells and increased the expression of Esr1, Ptch1 and Gli1. These data reveal the cooperative interactions between signalling cascades involving c-src and Ptch1 and suggest that Hh-signalling may be permissive for c-src/Esr1-dependent mammary gland morphogenesis.

While rare and especially de novo genetic variation are known to affect liability, whether common genetic polymorphism plays a substantial role is an open question and the relative contribution of genes and environment is contentious. It is probable that the relative contributions of rare and common variation, as well as environment, differs between ASD families having only a single affected individual (simplex) versus multiplex families who have two or more affected individuals. Methods: By using quantitative genetics techniques and the contrast of ASD subjects to controls, we estimate what portion of liability can be explained by additive genetic effects, known as narrow-sense heritability. We evaluate relatives of ASD subjects using the same methods to evaluate the assumptions of the additive model and partition families by simplex/multiplex status to determine how heritability changes with status. Results: By analyzing common variation throughout the genome, we show that common genetic polymorphism exerts substantial additive genetic effects on ASD liability and that simplex/multiplex family status has an impact on the identified composition of that risk. As a fraction of the total variation in liability, the estimated narrow-sense heritability exceeds 60% for ASD individuals from multiplex families and is approximately 40% for simplex families. By analyzing parents, unaffected siblings and alleles not transmitted from parents to their affected children, we conclude that the data for simplex ASD families follow the expectation for additive models closely. The data from multiplex families deviate somewhat from an additive model, possibly due to parental assortative mating. Conclusions: Our results, when viewed in the context of results from genome-wide association studies, demonstrate that a myriad of common variants of very small effect impacts ASD liability.

Huntington's disease, for example, is related to the misfolding of the Huntingtin protein which occurs when the polyQ segment has more than approximately 36 glutamines. Experimentally, it is known that the polyQ segment alone aggregates into beta-rich conformations such as amyloid fibrils. Its aggregation is modulated by the number of glutamine residues as well as by the surrounding amino acid sequences such as the 17-amino-acid N-terminal fragment of Huntingtin which increases the aggregation rate. Little structural information is available, however, regarding the first steps of aggregation and the atomistic mechanisms of oligomerization are yet to be described. Following previous coarse-grained replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations that show the spontaneous formation of a nanotube consisting of two intertwined antiparallel strands (Laghaei, R; Mousseau, N. J. Chem. Phys. 2010, 132, 165102), we study this configuration and some extensions of it using all-atom explicit solvent MD simulations. We compare two different lengths for the polyQ segment, 40 and 30 glutamines, and we investigate the impact of the Huntingtin N-terminal residues (htt(NT)). Our results show that the dimeric nanotubes can provide a building block for the formation of longer nanotubes (hexamers and octamers). These longer nanotubes are characterized by large beta-sheet propensities and a small solvent exposure of the main-chain atoms. Moreover, the oligomerization between two nanotubes occurs through the formation of protein/protein H-bonds and can result in an elongation of the water-filled core. Our results also show that the htt(NT) enhances the structural stability of the beta-rich seeds, suggesting a new mechanism by which it can increase the aggregation rate of the amyloidogenic polyQ sequence.

There Is No News Like Bad News: Women Are More Remembering and Stress Reactive after Reading Real Negative News than Men	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOCIAL-EVALUATIVE THREAT; HEALTHY ELDERLY SUBJECTS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; LEARNING STRESS; RESPONSES; CORTISOL; YOUNG; AROUSAL; AXIS	With the advent of specialized television channels offering 24-hour coverage, Internet and smart phones, the possibility to be constantly in contact with the media has increased dramatically in the last decades. Despite this higher access to knowledge, the impact media exposure has on healthy individuals remains poorly studied. Given that most information conveyed in the media is negative and that upon perception of threat, the brain activates the stress system, which leads to cortisol secretion, we decided to determine how healthy individuals react to media information. Accordingly, we investigated whether reading real negative news (1) is physiologically stressful, (2) modulates one's propensity to be stress reactive to a subsequent stressor and (3) modulates remembrance for these news. Sixty participants (30 women, 30 men) were randomly assigned to either twenty-four real neutral news excerpts or to twenty-four real negative excerpts for 10 minutes. They were then all exposed to a well-validated psychosocial stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), which consists of an anticipation phase of 10 minutes and a test phase of 10 minutes. A total of eight salivary cortisol samples were collected, at 10-minutes intervals, throughout the experimental procedure. One day later, a free recall of the news was performed. Results showed that although reading negative news did not lead to change in cortisol levels (p>0.05), it led to a significant increase in cortisol to a subsequent stressor in women only (p<0.001). Also, women in the negative news condition experienced better memory for these news excerpts compared to men (p<0.01). These results suggest a potential mechanism by which media exposure could increase stress reactivity and memory for negative news in women.

Combinatorial Pharmacogenetic Interactions of Bucindolol and beta(1), alpha(2C) Adrenergic Receptor Polymorphisms	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHRONIC HEART-FAILURE; BETA(1)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; MERIT-HF; BLOCKER BUCINDOLOL; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CIBIS-II; SURVIVAL; MYOCARDIUM; CARVEDILOL; METOPROLOL	Background: Pharmacogenetics involves complex interactions of gene products affecting pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, but there is little information on the interaction of multiple genetic modifiers of drug response. Bucindolol is a beta-blocker/sympatholytic agent whose efficacy is modulated by polymorphisms in the primary target (beta(1) adrenergic receptor [AR] Arg389 Gly on cardiac myocytes) and a secondary target modifier (alpha(2C) AR Ins [wild-type (Wt)] 322-325 deletion [Del] on cardiac adrenergic neurons). The major allele homozygotes and minor allele carriers of each polymorphism are respectively associated with efficacy enhancement and loss, creating the possibility for genotype combination interactions that can be measured by clinical trial methodology. Methodology: In a 1,040 patient substudy of a bucindolol vs. placebo heart failure clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that combinations of beta(1)389 and alpha(2C)322-325 polymorphisms are additive for both efficacy enhancement and loss. Additionally, norepinephrine (NE) affinity for b1389 AR variants was measured in human explanted left ventricles. Principal Findings: The combination of beta(1)389 Arg+alpha(2C)322-325 Wt major allele homozygotes (47% of the trial population) was non-additive for efficacy enhancement across six clinical endpoints, with an average efficacy increase of 1.70-fold vs. 2.32-fold in beta(1)389 Arg homozygotes+alpha(2C)322-325 Del minor allele carriers. In contrast, the minor allele carrier combination (13% subset) exhibited additive efficacy loss. These disparate effects are likely due to the higher proportion (42% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.009) of high-affinity NE binding sites in beta(1)389 Arg vs. Gly ARs, which converts alpha(2C)Del minor allele-associated NE lowering from a therapeutic liability to a benefit. Conclusions: On combination, the two sets of AR polymorphisms 1) influenced bucindolol efficacy seemingly unpredictably but consistent with their pharmacologic interactions, and 2) identified subpopulations with enhanced (beta(1)389 Arg homozygotes), intermediate (beta(1)389 Gly carriers+alpha(2C)322-325 Wt homozygotes), and no (beta(1)389 Gly carriers+alpha(2C)322-325 Del carriers) efficacy.

SOCS3 is an endogenous inhibitor of pathologic angiogenesis	BLOOD			English	Article							OXYGEN-INDUCED RETINOPATHY; FACTOR-I RECEPTOR; RETINAL NEOVASCULARIZATION; PROLIFERATIVE RETINOPATHY; CYTOKINE SIGNALING-3; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; SUPPRESSOR; BRAIN	Inflammatory cytokines and growth factors drive angiogenesis independently; however, their integrated role in pathologic and physiologic angiogenesis is not fully understood. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is an inducible negative feedback regulator of inflammation and growth factor signaling. In the present study, we show that SOCS3 curbs pathologic angiogenesis. Using a Cre/Lox system, we deleted SOCS3 in vessels and studied developmental and pathologic angiogenesis in murine models of oxygen-induced retinopathy and cancer. Conditional loss of SOCS3 leads to increased pathologic neovascularization, resulting in pronounced retinopathy and increased tumor size. In contrast, physiologic vascularization is not regulated by SOCS3. In vitro, SOCS3 knockdown increases proliferation and sprouting of endothelial cells costimulated with IGF-1 and TNF alpha via reduced feedback inhibition of the STAT3 and mTOR pathways. These results identify SOCS3 as a pivotal endogenous feedback inhibitor of pathologic angiogenesis and a potential therapeutic target acting at the converging crossroads of growth factor-and cytokine-induced vessel growth.

Opposite Roles of Furin and PC5A in N-Cadherin Processing	NEOPLASIA			English	Article							CELL-CELL-ADHESION; COLON-CARCINOMA CELLS; PROPROTEIN CONVERTASES; CANCER-CELLS; TUMOR PROGRESSION; PROSTATE-CANCER; EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN; SIGNALING PATHWAY; TISSUE INHIBITORS; MEDIATED ADHESION	We recently demonstrated that lack of Furin-processing of the N-cadherin precursor (proNCAD) in highly invasive melanoma and brain tumor cells results in the cell-surface expression of a nonadhesive protein favoring cell migration and invasion in vitro. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of malignant human brain tumor cells revealed that of all proprotein convertases (PCs) only the levels of Furin and PC5A are modulated, being inversely (Furin) or directly (PC5A) correlated with brain tumor invasive capacity. Intriguingly, the N-terminal sequence following the Furin-activated NCAD site (RQKR down arrow D (W) under bar (161), mouse nomenclature) reveals a second putative PC-processing site (RIRSDR down arrow DK189) located in the first extracellular domain. Cleavage at this site would abolish the adhesive functions of NCAD because of the loss of the critical Trp(161). This was confirmed upon analysis of the fate of the endogenous prosegment of proNCAD in human malignant glioma cells expressing high levels of Furin and low levels of PC5A (U343) or high levels of PC5A and negligible Furin levels (U251). Cellular analyses revealed that Furin is the best activating convertase releasing an similar to 17-kDa prosegment, whereas PC5A is the major inactivating enzyme resulting in the secretion of an similar to 20-kDa product. Like expression of proNCAD at the cell surface, cleavage of the NCAD molecule at RIRSDR down arrow DK189 renders the U251 cancer cells less adhesive to one another and more migratory. Our work modifies the present view on posttranslational processing and surface expression of classic cadherins and clarifies how NCAD possesses a range of adhesive potentials and plays a critical role in tumor progression.

The use of transcranial Doppler pulsatility index to guide hyperosmolar therapy	NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article							OPTIC-NERVE SONOGRAPHY; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; BRAIN-INJURY; ULTRASOUND	Management of intracranial hypertension is a major cornerstone of neurocritical care. Apart from traumatic brain injury, there are no clear guidelines for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. The insertion of ICP monitors is an invasive procedure with inherent risks and could be contraindicated in case of severe coagulopathy. The transcranial Doppler (TCD) pulsatility index (PI) has emerged as a surrogate marker for ICP. This is a technical report with illustrative cases on the use of PI in the management of high ICP, as a guide for optimal dosing of hyperosmolar agents we use in our institution. The use of TCD PI is a useful adjunct to guide the use of hyperosmolar therapy in various conditions with raised intracranial hypertension. We will discuss the combination of the PI determination with an anatomical evaluation of the optic nerve diameter to eliminate confounding factors in PI determination.

Auditory global-local processing: Effects of attention and musical experience	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							TEMPORAL INFORMATION; MELODIC CONTOUR; VISUAL ANGLE; MUSICIANS; BRAIN; PRECEDENCE; AUTISM; NONMUSICIANS; INTERVAL; FEATURES	In vision, global (whole) features are typically processed before local (detail) features ("global precedence effect"). However, the distinction between global and local processing is less clear in the auditory domain. The aims of the present study were to investigate: (i) the effects of directed versus divided attention, and (ii) the effect musical training on auditory global-local processing in 16 adult musicians and 16 non-musicians. Participants were presented with short nine-tone melodies, each comprised of three triplet sequences (three-tone units). In a "directed attention" task, participants were asked to focus on either the global or local pitch pattern and had to determine if the pitch pattern went up or down. In a "divided attention" task, participants judged whether the target pattern (up or down) was present or absent. Overall, global structure was perceived faster and more accurately than local structure. The global precedence effect was observed regardless of whether attention was directed to a specific level or divided between levels. Musicians performed more accurately than non-musicians overall, but non-musicians showed a more pronounced global advantage. This study provides evidence for an auditory global precedence effect across attention tasks, and for differences in auditory global-local processing associated with musical experience.

Here, we investigated whether maternal deprivation (MD) alters PFC-dependent executive functions, neurons and astrocytes number and synaptic plasticity in adult male Long-Evans rats. The deprivation protocol consisted of a daily separation of newborn Long-Evans pups from their mothers and littermates 3 h/day postnatal day 1-14. Cognitive performances were assessed in adulthood using the temporal order memory task (TMT) and the attentional set-shifting task (ASST) that principally implicates the PFC and the Morris water maze task (WMT) that does not essentially rely on the PFC. The neurons and astrocytes of the prelimbic (PrL) area of the medial PFC (mPFC) were immunolabelled respectively with anti-NeuN and anti-GFAP antibodies and quantified by stereology. The field potentials evoked by electrical stimulation of ventral hippocampus (ventral HPC) were recorded in vivo in the PrL area. In adulthood, MD produced cognitive deficits in two PFC-dependent tasks, the TMT and ASST, but not in the WMT. In parallel, MD induced in the prelimbic area of the medial PFC an upregulation of long-term potentiation (LTP), without any change in the number of neurons and astrocytes. We provide evidence that MD leads in adults to an alteration of the cognitive abilities dependent on the PFC, and to an exaggerated synaptic plasticity in this region. We suggest that this latter phenomenon may contribute to the impairments in the cognitive tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Vision at an attended location is faster, more accurate, of higher spatial resolution, and has an enhanced sensitivity for fine changes. Earlier hypotheses suggest that the neuronal mechanisms of these processes are based on the interactions among different neuronal groups by means of cortical oscillations in the gamma range. The aim of the current study was to modulate these oscillations externally, using a new technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). We investigated the effect of covert spatial attention within and outside its focus by probing contrast sensitivity and contrast discrimination at high resolution across the visual field of 20 healthy human subjects. While applying 40, 60, and 80 Hz tAC stimulation over the primary visual cortex (V1), subjects' contrast-discrimination thresholds were obtained using two different conditions: in the first condition we presented a black disc as a peripheral cue that automatically attracted the subject's attention, whereas there was no cue in the second condition. We found that the spatial profile of contrast sensitivity was not affected by the stimulation. Contrast-discrimination thresholds on the other hand decreased significantly during 60 Hz tACS, whereas there was no effect of 40 and 80 Hz stimulation. These results suggest that attention plays an important role in contrast discrimination based on V1 activities that are influences by gamma range tACS stimulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In popular culture and in the scientific literature on face processing, the eye area is often conceived as a very important - if not the most important - cue for the recognition of facial expressions. In support of this, an underutilization of the eye area is often observed in clinical populations with a deficit in the recognition of facial expressions of emotions. Here, we used the Bubbles technique to verify which facial cue is the most important when it comes to discriminating between eight static and dynamic facial expressions (i.e., six basic emotions, pain and a neutral expression). We found that the mouth area is the most important cue for both static and dynamic facial expressions. We conducted an ideal observer analysis on the static expressions and determined that the mouth area is the most informative. However, we found an underutilization of the eye area by human participants in comparison to the ideal observer. We then demonstrated that the mouth area contains the most discriminative motions across expressions. We propose that the greater utilization of the mouth area by the human participants might come from remnants of the strategy the brain has developed with dynamic stimuli, and/or from a strategy whereby the most informative area is prioritized due to the limited capacity of the visuo-cognitive system.

Clinical features and course of brain metastases in colorectal cancer: an experience from a single institution	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Colorectal cancer; brain metastases; radiation therapy; surgery	CARCINOMA; COLON	Objectives Brain metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) are quite rare. Here, we review the characteristics, presentation, and clinical course of such patients at our institution. Methods We reviewed the medical records of patients with brain metastases from CRC treated during 2000-2009. Associations between patient, tumour characteristics, treatment modality, and survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results We identified 48 patients (25 men, 23 women) who developed brain metastases from CRC. The median age at diagnosis of the brain metastases was 63 years (range: 37-84 years). In 23 of the patients (48%), the primary tumour occurred in the rectum. At diagnosis of brain metastases, 43 patients (90%) also had other systemic metastases (mainly pulmonary and hepatic). The median interval between diagnosis of the primary tumour and of the brain metastases was 24 months. Median survival after a diagnosis of brain metastasis from CRC was 4 months (range: 1-13 months). We observed substantially better survival (13 months, p<0.001) in patients treated with surgery followed by whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) than in those treated with radiotherapy or surgery alone. Sex, age, location and number of brain metastases, and timing of diagnosis did not affect survival. Conclusions Brain metastases from CRC develop late in the course of the disease, given that most patients already have other secondary lesions. Prognosis in these patients is poor, with those receiving treatment with surgery and WBRT having the best overall survival. Early detection and treatment of brain metastases with new systemic therapies may improve outcomes.	[Damiens, K.; Ayoub, J. P.

Cache Cty Investigators	Hormone therapy and Alzheimer disease dementia New findings from the Cache County Study	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT THERAPY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HEALTH INITIATIVE MEMORY; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; RISK; AGE; MENOPAUSE; DECLINE; SCREEN; AD	Objectives: Observational studies suggest reduced risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) in users of hormone therapy (HT), but trials show higher risk. We examined whether the association of HT with AD varies with timing or type of HT use. Methods: Between 1995 and 2006, the population-based Cache County Study followed 1,768 women who had provided a detailed history on age at menopause and use of HT. During this interval, 176 women developed incident AD. Cox proportional hazard models evaluated the association of HT use with AD, overall and in relation to timing, duration of use, and type (opposed vs unopposed) of HT. Results: Women who used any type of HT within 5 years of menopause had 30% less risk of AD (95% confidence interval 0.49-0.99), especially if use was for 10 or more years. By contrast, AD risk was not reduced among those who had initiated HT 5 or more years after menopause. Instead, rates were increased among those who began "opposed" estrogen-progestin compounds within the 3 years preceding the Cache County Study baseline (adjusted hazard ratio 1.93; 95% confidence interval 0.94-3.96). This last hazard ratio was similar to the ratio of 2.05 reported in randomized trial participants assigned to opposed HT. Conclusions: Association of HT use and risk of AD may depend on timing of use. Although possibly beneficial if taken during a critical window near menopause, HT (especially opposed compounds) initiated in later life may be associated with increased risk. The relation of AD risk to timing and type of HT deserves further study.

Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 79 children and young adults with SMA 2/3 who participated in evaluations for up to 48 months. Clinically, we evaluated motor and pulmonary function, quality of life, and muscle strength. We also measured SMN2 copy number, hematologic and biochemical profiles, muscle mass by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the compound motor action potential (CMAP) in a hand muscle. Data were analyzed for associations between clinical and biological/laboratory characteristics cross-sectionally, and for change over time in outcomes using all available data. Results: In cross-sectional analyses, certain biological measures (specifically, CMAP, DXA fat-free mass index, and SMN2 copy number) and muscle strength measures were associated with motor function. Motor and pulmonary function declined over time, particularly at time points beyond 12 months of follow-up. Conclusion: The intermediate and mild phenotypes of SMA show slow functional declines when observation periods exceed 1 year. Whole body muscle mass, hand muscle compound motor action potentials, and muscle strength are associated with clinical measures of motor function. The data from this study will be useful for clinical trial planning and suggest that CMAP and DXA warrant further evaluation as potential biomarkers.

Methods: Health insurance claims from a 5-state Medicaid database (1997Q1-2009Q2) and 55 self-insured US companies ("employer," 1999Q1 and 2008Q4) were analyzed. Adult patients with epilepsy receiving antiepileptic drugs (AED) were selected. Using a retrospective matchedcohort design, patients were categorized into cohorts of "uncontrolled" (>= 2 changes in AED therapy, then >= 1 epilepsy-related ED visit/hospitalization within 1 year) and "well-controlled" (no AED change, no epilepsy-related ED visit/hospitalization) epilepsy. Matched cohorts were compared for health care resource utilization and costs using multivariate conditional regression models and nonparametric methods. Results: From 110,312 (Medicaid) and 36,529 (employer) eligible patients, 3,454 and 602 with uncontrolled epilepsy were matched 1: 1 to patients with well-controlled epilepsy, respectively. In both populations, uncontrolled epilepsy cohorts presented about 2 times more fractures and head injuries (all p values < 0.0001) and higher health care resource utilization (ranges of adjusted incidence rate ratios [IRRs] [all-cause utilization]: AEDs = 1.8-1.9, non-AEDs = 1.3-1.5, hospitalizations = 5.4-6.7, length of hospital stays = 7.3-7.7, ED visits = 3.7-5.0, outpatient visits = 1.4-1.7, neurologist visits = 2.3-3.1; all p values < 0.0001) than well-controlled groups. Total direct health care costs were higher in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy (adjusted cost difference [95% confidence interval (CI)] Medicaid = $ 12,258 [$ 10,482-$ 14,083]; employer = $ 14,582 [$ 12,019-$ 17,097]) vs well-controlled patients. Privately insured employees with uncontrolled epilepsy lost 2.5 times more work days, with associated indirect costs of $ 2,857 (95% CI $ 1,042-$ 4,581). Conclusions: Uncontrolled epilepsy in patients requiring ED visit or hospitalization was associated with significantly greater health care resource utilization and increased direct and indirect costs compared to well-controlled epilepsy in both publicly and privately insured settings.

Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical to selection and implementation of treatments, and optimal patient outcomes. Outcomes are improved with early diagnosis via indirect immunofluorescence or cell-based assays, and the rapid and appropriate administration of immunosuppressant and anti-psychotic therapies. Three possible scenarios accounting for the immunopathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis are presented, with the most probable one being that of paraneoplastic autoimmunity. Future efforts in this disorder should focus on elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to initiation of this antibody response, as well as exploring the role of tumors, infectious triggers and immune-reactivation. Finally, accessible tools need to be developed that allow for reliable identification of specific antibody markers against synaptic proteins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, data from experimental animal studies also implicate vasopressin in social bonding processes. Preliminary work suggests that vasopressin also plays a role in social behaviors in humans. The goal of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate associations among plasma vasopressin and self-reported interpersonal functioning in a sample of married couples. During a 24-h admission to a hospital-based research unit, 37 couples completed measures of interpersonal functioning and provided blood samples for neuropeptide analyses. Results showed that vasopressin was associated with markers of interpersonal functioning, but not with general psychological distress. Specifically, greater plasma vasopressin levels were related to a larger social network, fewer negative marital interactions, less attachment avoidance, more attachment security, and marginally greater spousal social support. These results indicate that vasopressin is likely implicated in different relationship maintenance processes in humans. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using proteomic techniques, we identified expression of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) on a subset of human effector memory CD4(+) lymphocytes and on human blood-brain barrier endothelium. Herein, we demonstrate that MCAM is a stable surface marker that refines the identification of interleukin 17(+), interleukin 22(+), RAR-related orphan receptor gamma and interleukin 23 receptor(+) cells within the CD161(+)CCR6(+) subset of memory CD4(+) lymphocytes. We also show that MCAM(+) lymphocytes express significantly more granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor and granzyme B than MCAM(-) lymphocytes. Furthermore, the proportion of MCAM(+) CD4(+) lymphocytes is significantly increased in the blood and in the central nervous system of patients with multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animals compared with healthy controls or other neurological diseases, and MCAM expression is upregulated at the blood-brain barrier within inflammatory lesions. Moreover, blockade of MCAM or depletion of MCAM(+) CD4(+) T lymphocytes both restrict the migration of T(H)17 lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier endothelial cells and decrease the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our findings indicate that MCAM could serve as a potential biomarker for multiple sclerosis and represents a valuable target for the treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions.

Diabetic cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy: a distinct syndrome expanding the spectrum of diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies	BRAIN			English	Article						diabetic cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy; brachial plexus neuropathy; peripheral neuropathy; neuralgic amyotrophy; microvasculitis	BRACHIAL-PLEXUS NEUROPATHY; NEURALGIC AMYOTROPHY; MICROVASCULITIS; PLEXOPATHIES	Diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is a subacute painful, asymmetrical lower limb neuropathy due to ischaemic injury and microvasculitis. The occurrence of a cervical diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy has been postulated. Our objective was to characterize the clinical features and pathological alterations of diabetic cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy, to see if they are similar to diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy and due to ischaemic injury and microvasculitis. We identified patients with diabetic cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy by review of the Mayo Clinic database from 1996 to 2008. We systematically reviewed the clinical features, laboratory studies, neurophysiological findings, neuroimaging and pathological features and compared the findings with a previously published diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy cohort. Eighty-five patients (56 males, 67 with Type 2 diabetes mellitus) were identified. The median age was 62 years (range 32-83). The main presenting symptom was pain (53/85). At evaluation, weakness was the most common symptom (84/85), followed by pain (69/85) and numbness (56/85). Neuropathic deficits were moderate (median motor neuropathy impairment score 10.0 points) and improved at follow-up. Upper, middle and lower brachial plexus segments were involved equally and pan-plexopathy was not unusual (25/85). Over half of patients (44/85) had at least one additional body region affected (30 contralateral cervical, 20 lumbosacral and 16 thoracic) as is found in diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy. Recurrent disease occurred in 18/85. Neurophysiology showed axonal neuropathy (80/80) with paraspinal denervation (21/65), and abnormal autonomic (23/24) and sensory testing (10/13). Cerebrospinal fluid protein was elevated (median 70 mg/dl). Magnetic resonance imaging showed brachial plexus abnormality in all (38/38). Nerve biopsies (11 upper and 11 lower limbs) showed ischaemic injury (axonal degeneration, multifocal fibre loss 15/22, focal perineurial thickening 16/22, injury neuroma 5/22) and increased inflammation (epineural perivascular inflammation 22/22, haemosiderin deposition 6/22, vessel wall inflammation 14/22 and microvasculitis 5/22). We therefore conclude that (i) diabetic cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy is a predominantly monophasic, upper limb diabetic neuropathy with pain followed by weakness and involves motor, sensory and autonomic fibres; (ii) the neuropathy begins focally and often evolves into a multifocal or bilateral condition; (iii) the pathology of diabetic cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy demonstrates ischaemic injury often from microvasculitis; and (iv) diabetic cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy shares many of the clinical and pathological features of diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, providing evidence that these conditions are best categorized together within the spectrum of diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies.

Assessment of the Ototoxicity of Docusate Sodium (Colace) in a Guinea Pig Animal Model	JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY			English	Article						ceruminolytic; Colace; docusate sodium; ototoxicity	CERUMEN IMPACTION; TRIAL	Objective: Docusate sodium (Colace) is an off-label ceruminolytic agent used to soften ear wax and relieve ear canal obstruction. At present, its effect on hearing in the presence of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation is not clear. The present study aimed to assess the safety of ototopic docusate sodium on hearing in the presence of TM perforation. Study Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial in a guinea pig animal model. Materials and Methods: Ten guinea pigs underwent bilateral myringotomy. In each animal, one ear received docusate sodium, serving as the experimental ear, and the other received normal saline as the control. Auditory brain response (ABR) was performed at baseline and then 1, 7, and 14 days following the application. Results: At day 14 following application, there was no significant change in ABR thresholds at 8, 12, 16, 20, or 25 kHz. Conclusion: In guinea pigs with perforated TMs, docusate sodium does not seem to cause ototoxicity. Future clinical studies are required.

Mutations in ABCD4 cause a new inborn error of vitamin B-12 metabolism	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							C-OXIDASE DEFICIENCY; CBLD DEFECT; METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA; PEROXISOMAL MEMBRANE; COBALAMIN METABOLISM; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; LEIGH-SYNDROME; IDENTIFICATION; PROTEIN; TRANSPORTER	Inherited disorders of vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) have provided important clues to how this vitamin, which is essential for hematological and neurological function, is transported and metabolized. We describe a new disease that results in failure to release vitamin B-12 from lysosomes, which mimics the cblF defect caused by LMBRD1 mutations. Using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing, we identified causal mutations in ABCD4, a gene that codes for an ABC transporter, which was previously thought to have peroxisomal localization and function. Our results show that ABCD4 colocalizes with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and LMBD1, the latter of which is deficient in the cblF defect. Furthermore, we show that mutations altering the putative ATPase domain of ABCD4 affect its function, suggesting that the ATPase activity of ABCD4 may be involved in intracellular processing of vitamin B-12.

This follow-up study aimed to assess the impact of exposure to contaminants on visual brain development in school-age Inuit children (mean age = 10.9 years). Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) were measured in umbilical cord blood and again in blood samples at the time of testing, reflecting pre- and current exposure, respectively. Pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were scalp-recorded at the occipital cortex. Visual stimulation consisted of achromatic gratings presented at four visual contrast levels: 95%, 30%, 12% and 4%. The relation between environmental contaminant body burdens and VEPs was examined by regression analysis controlling for confounding variables, including fish nutrients and other toxicants. No significant association was found for PCB exposure after statistical adjustments. Cord blood mercury level was associated with a reduction of the N75 amplitude at the highest contrast level and with a delay of the N75 latency at the 12% contrast level. Prenatal exposure to lead was associated with a delay of the N150 latency at most contrast levels. This study suggests that heavy metal exposure, in particular during the gestational period, can impair the development of visual processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Parietal Cortex Signals Come Unstuck in Time	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material							TEMPORAL DISCRIMINATION; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; DECISION-MAKING; ELAPSED TIME; INTERVAL; MACAQUE; MOTOR; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS	Humans and other animals are surprisingly adept at estimating the duration of temporal intervals, even without the use of watches and clocks. This ability is typically studied in the lab by asking observers to indicate their estimate of the time between two external sensory events. The results of such studies confirm that humans can accurately estimate durations on a variety of time scales. Although many brain areas are thought to contribute to the representation of elapsed time, recent neurophysiological studies have linked the parietal cortex in particular to the perception of sub-second time intervals. In this Primer, we describe previous work on parietal cortex and time perception, and we highlight the findings of a study published in this issue of PLOS Biology, in which Schneider and Ghose [1] characterize single-neuron responses during performance of a novel "Temporal Production" task. During temporal production, the observer must track the passage of time without anticipating any external sensory event, and it appears that the parietal cortex may use a unique strategy to support this type of measurement.

A Phase I Study of the Metal Ionophore Clioquinol in Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies	CLINICAL LYMPHOMA MYELOMA & LEUKEMIA			English	Article						Copper; Neuropathy; Pharmacokinetics; Pharmacodynamics; Proteasome	INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP; MYELO-OPTICO-NEUROPATHY; COPPER-ZINC RATIO; RESPONSE CRITERIA; CANCER CELLS; PROTEASOME; ALZHEIMERS; DIAGNOSIS; LEUKEMIA	Clioquinol is a small-molecule metal ionophore that inhibits the proteasome through a metal-dependent mechanism. Here, we report a phase I study of clioquinol in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Neuropathy and abdominal pain were dose-limiting toxicities. Minimal pharmacodynamic effects were observed, and there were no clinical responses. Background: Clioquinol is a small-molecule metal ionophore that inhibits the enzymatic activity of the proteasome and displays preclinical efficacy in hematologic malignancies in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we conducted a phase I clinical trial of clioquinol in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies to assess its safety and determine its biological activity in this patient population. Methods: Patients with refractory hematologic malignancies were treated with increasing doses of oral clioquinol twice daily for 15 doses. Plasma and intracellular levels of clioquinol were measured. Enzymatic activity of the proteasome was measured before and after drug administration. Results: Sixteen cycles of clioquinol were administered to 11 patients with 5 patients reenrolled at the next dose level as per the permitted intrapatient dose escalation. Dose-limiting neurotoxicity and abdominal pain were observed at a dose of 1600 mg twice daily. Intracellular drug levels were low. Minimal inhibition of the proteasome was observed. No clinical responses were observed. Conclusion: In patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, the maximal tolerated dose of clioquinol was determined. Minimal inhibition of the proteasome was observed at tolerable doses, likely due to low intracellular levels of the drug.

The role of melanin-concentrating hormone in conditioned reward learning	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						antagonist; conditioned reinforcement; MCH-1R; mice; Pavlovian-instrumental transfer	PAVLOVIAN-INSTRUMENTAL TRANSFER; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; D-AMPHETAMINE; FOOD-INTAKE; MICE LEADS; RECEPTOR; OBESITY; LESIONS	The orexigenic neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is well positioned to play a key role in connecting brain reward and homeostatic systems due to its synthesis in hypothalamic circuitry and receptor expression throughout the cortico-striatal reward circuit. Here we examined whether targeted-deletion of the MCH receptor (MCH-1R) in gene-targeted heterozygote and knockout mice (KO), or systemic treatment with pharmacological agents designed to antagonise MCH-1R in C57BL/6J mice would disrupt two putative consequences of reward learning that rely on different neural circuitries: conditioned reinforcement (CRf) and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT). Mice were trained to discriminate between presentations of a reward-paired cue (CS+) and an unpaired CS-. Following normal acquisition of the Pavlovian discrimination in all mice, we assessed the capacity for the CS+ to act as a reinforcer for new nose-poke learning (CRf). Pharmacological disruption in control mice and genetic deletion in KO mice impaired CRf test performance, suggesting MCH-1R is necessary for initiating and maintaining behaviors that are under the control of conditioned reinforcers. To examine a dissociable form of reward learning (PIT), a naive group of mice were trained in separate Pavlovian and instrumental lever training sessions followed by the PIT test. For all mice the CS+ was capable of augmenting ongoing lever responding relative to CS- periods. These results suggest a role for MCH in guiding behavior based on the conditioned reinforcing value of a cue, but not on its incentive motivational value.

We report a case of a 14-year-old adolescent girl who presented with a right lower quadrant mass. At surgery, a mobile retroperitoneal mass was entirely removed. Histologic evaluation revealed 2 distinct components; the first, consisting of sheets of undifferentiated cells, was CD99+ and CD56-, whereas the second, consisting of multiple foci of neuropil and maturing neuroblasts, was CD99- and CD56+. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed the presence of EWSRI/FLII translocation in both histologic distinct components. MYCN (rnyelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived) was not amplified. The tests for t(11;22) and t(21;22) performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were negative. The final diagnosis corresponds to an extraosseous Ewing sarcoma with foci of neuroblastoma-like differentiation. This is the first case, documented by molecular studies, in which neuroblastoma-like differentiation has been noted in primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewing sarcoma without prior chemotherapy.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Mutations in TMEM231 cause Joubert syndrome in French Canadians	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							CILIARY TRANSITION ZONE; SEQUENCING DATA; CILIOPATHIES; CILIOGENESIS; VARIANTS; REVEALS; MECKEL; GENE	Background Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a predominantly autosomal recessive disorder characterised by a distinctive midhindbrain malformation, oculomotor apraxia, breathing abnormalities and developmental delay. JBTS is genetically heterogeneous, involving genes required for formation and function of non-motile cilia. Here we investigate the genetic basis of JBTS in 12 French-Canadian (FC) individuals. Methods and results Exome sequencing in all subjects showed that six of them carried rare compound heterozygous mutations in CC2D2A or C5ORF42, known JBTS genes. In addition, three individuals (two families) were compound heterozygous for the same rare mutations in TMEM231(c. 12T>A[p.Tyr4*]; c.625G> A[p.Asp209Asn]). All three subjects showed a severe neurological phenotype and variable presence of polydactyly, retinopathy and renal cysts. These mutations were not detected among 385 FC controls. TMEM231 has been previously shown to localise to the ciliary transition zone, and to interact with several JBTS gene products in a complex involved in the formation of the diffusion barrier between the cilia and plasma membrane. siRNA knockdown of TMEM231 was also shown to affect barrier integrity, resulting in a reduction of cilia formation and ciliary localisation of signalling receptors. Conclusions Our data suggest that mutations in TMEM231 cause JBTS, reinforcing the relationship between this condition and the disruption of the barrier at the ciliary transition zone.

Different spatial frequency bands selectively signal for natural image statistics in the early visual system. J Neurophysiol 108: 2160-2172, 2012. First published July 25, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00288.2012.-Early visual evoked potentials (VEPs) measured in humans have recently been observed to be modulated by the image statistics of natural scene imagery. Specifically, the early VEP is dominated by a strong positivity when participants view minimally complex natural scene imagery, with the magnitude of that component being modulated by luminance contrast differences across spatial frequency (i.e., the slope of the amplitude spectrum). For scenes high in structural complexity, the early VEP is dominated by a prominent negativity that exhibits little dependency on luminance contrast. However, since natural scene imagery is broad band in terms of spatial frequency, it is not known whether the above-mentioned modulation results from a complex interaction within or between the early neural processes tuned to different bands of spatial frequency. Here, we sought to address this question by measuring early VEPs (specifically, the C1, P1, and N1 components) while human participants viewed natural scene imagery that was filtered to contain specific bands of spatial frequency information. The results show that the C1 component is largely un-modulated by the luminance statistics of natural scene imagery (being only measurable when such stimuli were made to contain high spatial frequencies). The P1 and N1, on the other hand, were observed to exhibit strong spatial frequency-dependent modulation to the luminance statistics of natural scene imagery. The results therefore suggest that the dependency of early VEPs on natural image statistics results from an interaction between the early neural processes tuned to different bands of spatial frequency.

JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Allodynia; central sensitization; hyperalgesia; inflammatory pain; ongoing pain; spontaneous pain; summated pain	INDUCED NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PRIMARY AFFERENT NEURONS; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; POTENTIAL VANILLOID 1; PLANTAR RAT HINDPAW; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; SPONTANEOUS DISCHARGE; C-FIBERS; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION	Spontaneous pain is often discussed in the context of both chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions, and it has been suggested that spontaneous pain, rather than stimulus-evoked pain, may be the more significant clinical problem. The following issues are discussed here. First, it is suggested that the concept of spontaneous pain makes no sense when the pain is the result of an ongoing inflammatory reaction. Evidence is reviewed that indicates that spontaneous pain is present in patients with neuropathic pain, but perhaps only in a subset of such patients. Second, it is suggested that in the presence of allodynia and hyperalgesia, stimulation from the activities of daily life occurs very many times a day and that these stimulus-evoked pains may summate to give a fluctuating level of daily pain that both patients and investigators mistake for spontaneous pain. Perspective: Which is more important stimulus-evoked pain or spontaneous pain? This review suggests that to answer the question we will need to distinguish neuropathic spontaneous pain from inflammatory ongoing pain and to differentiate both from summated allodynic and hyperalgesic pains caused by the stimuli of daily life.

We examined the role of VGLUT3, an atypical transporter of glutamate present in serotonergic neurons involved in breathing and heat production, in the response to hypoxia. The respiratory responses to chemical stimuli and the turnover of serotonin in the brainstem were impaired in newborn mice lacking VGLUT3. Under cold conditions, metabolic rate, body temperature, baseline breathing and the ventilatory response to hypoxia were disrupted. Thus, VGLUT3 expression is required for optimal response to hypoxic stress in neonates. Abstract Neonates respond to hypoxia initially by increasing ventilation, and then by markedly decreasing both ventilation (hypoxic ventilatory decline) and oxygen consumption (hypoxic hypometabolism). This latter process, which vanishes with age, reflects a tight coupling between ventilatory and thermogenic responses to hypoxia. The neurological substrate of hypoxic hypometabolism is unclear, but it is known to be centrally mediated, with a strong involvement of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) system. To clarify this issue, we investigated the possible role of VGLUT3, the third subtype of vesicular glutamate transporter. VGLUT3 contributes to glutamate signalling by 5-HT neurons, facilitates 5-HT transmission and is expressed in strategic regions for respiratory and thermogenic control. We therefore assumed that VGLUT3 might significantly contribute to the response to hypoxia. To test this possibility, we analysed this response in newborn mice lacking VGLUT3 using anatomical, biochemical, electrophysiological and integrative physiology approaches. We found that the lack of VGLUT3 did not affect the histological organization of brainstem respiratory networks or respiratory activity under basal conditions. However, it impaired respiratory responses to 5-HT and anoxia, showing a marked alteration of central respiratory control. These impairments were associated with altered 5-HT turnover at the brainstem level. Furthermore, under cold conditions, the lack of VGLUT3 disrupted the metabolic rate, body temperature, baseline breathing and the ventilatory response to hypoxia. We conclude that VGLUT3 expression is dispensable under basal conditions but is required for optimal response to hypoxic stress in neonates.

An evidence-based review of the incidence of CNS bleeding with anti-VEGF therapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases	LUNG CANCER			English	Review						Anti-VEGF therapy; Bevacizumab; Brain metastases; CNS hemorrhage; CNS metastases; NSCLC	ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; PHASE-III TRIAL; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; MESSENGER-RNA; CARCINOMA; BEVACIZUMAB; SORAFENIB; SUNITINIB; SAFETY	Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of angiogenesis. Solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are dependent on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis. Anti-VEGF therapy has demonstrated clinical benefits in the first-line treatment of NSCLC. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases are a common occurrence among patients with lung cancer and confer significant morbidity and mortality. The risk of CNS hemorrhage in NSCLC patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy is still relatively unexplored because patients with CNS metastases have generally been excluded from trials of anti-VEGF therapy due to a perceived increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Recently, large prospective, randomized trials, open-label studies and observational cohort studies in NSCLC have provided data on the incidence of CNS hemorrhage in large patient populations, reflective of community practice. Methods: We conducted a literature review for the available data on the incidence of CNS hemorrhage in NSCLC patients with brain metastases receiving anti-VEGF therapy. Results: There is no significantly increased risk of CNS hemorrhage in patients with NSCLC and emerging (previously untreated) or pretreated CNS metastases receiving anti-VEGF therapy. Conclusions: We conclude that clinical trial data indicate that anti-VEGF therapy can be considered for NSCLC patients with emerging or pretreated CNS metastases.

The proposed method extends the original GSCA by incorporating a multivariate autoregressive model to account for the dynamic nature of data taken over time. Dynamic GSCA also incorporates direct and modulating effects of input variables on specific latent variables and on connections between latent variables, respectively. An alternating least square (ALS) algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. An improved bootstrap method called a modified moving block bootstrap method is used to assess reliability of parameter estimates, which deals with time dependence between consecutive observations effectively. We analyze synthetic and real data to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

However, no research has examined the role of peer attachments in the development of dependency. In this study we examined the relationship between recalled parenting and peer attachments and current levels of relatively adaptive and maladaptive forms of dependency, namely connectedness and neediness. Two hundred young adults completed measures of recalled parenting, recalled peer attachments, and current levels of Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Connectedness, and Neediness. Hierarchical regression analyses controlling for Neuroticism and Agreeableness showed that although higher levels of Connectedness and lower levels of Neediness were related to more recalled maternal care, they also were related to better quality recalled peer attachments, over and above the effects of parenting. Furthermore, recalled peer attachments interacted with recalled parenting such that peer attachments were more strongly related to Connectedness when maternal care was low and to Neediness when maternal control was low. Findings suggest the importance of peer attachment in the development of personality risk factors for depression.

Despite important improvements in current device technology and implantation techniques, specific complications still remain and warrant consideration. Vascular complications and peri-procedural neurological events were the first concerns to emerge with this new technology. Recently, significant post procedural para-valvular leak has been shown to be more frequent after TAVI than after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and its potential association with worse long-term prognostic has raised concerns. In moving toward treatment of lower risk populations, structural integrity and long-term durability of heat valve prosthesis are becoming of central importance. Emerging technologies and newer generations of devices seem promising in dealing with these matters.

In addition to atrophy, about 40% of patients present with malrotation, a developmental anomaly characterized by atypical morphologies of the hippocampus and collateral sulcus. We have recently shown that both atrophy and malrotation impact negatively the performance of volume-based techniques. Here, we propose a novel hippocampal segmentation algorithm (SurfMulti) that integrates deformable parametric surfaces, vertex-wise modeling of locoregional texture and shape, and multiple templates in a unified framework. To account for inter-subject variability, including shape variants, we used a library derived from a large database of healthy (n = 80) and diseased (n = 288) hippocampi. To quantify malrotation, we generated 3D models from manual hippocampal labels and automatically extracted collateral sulci. The accuracy of SurfMulti was evaluated relative to manual labeling and segmentation obtained through a single atlas-based algorithm (FreeSurfer) and a volume-based multi-template approach (Vol-multi) using the Dice similarity index and surface-based shape mapping, for which we computed vertex-wise displacement vectors between automated and manual segmentations. We then correlated segmentation accuracy with malrotation features and atrophy. SurfMulti outperformed FreeSurfer and Vol-multi, and achieved a level of accuracy in TLE patients (Dice = 86.9%) virtually identical to healthy controls (Dice = 87.5%). Vertex-wise shape mapping showed that SurfMulti had an excellent overlap with manual labels, with sub-millimeter precision. Its performance was not influenced by atrophy or malrotation (vertical bar r vertical bar < 0.20, p > 0.2), while FreeSurfer (vertical bar d vertical bar > 0.35, p < 0.0001) and Vol-multi (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.28, p < 0.05) were hampered by both anomalies. The magnitude of atrophy detected using SurfMulti was the closest to manual volumetry (Cohen's d: manual = 1.71, t = 7.6; SurfMulti = 1.60, t = 7.0; Vol-multi = 1.38, t = 6.1; FreeSurfer = 0.91, t = 3.9). The high performance of SurfMulti regardless of cohort, atrophy and shape variants identifies this algorithm as a robust segmentation tool for hippocampal volumetry. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of the present article is to provide guidance to clinicians on the clinical management of extrapyramidal side effects of second-generation antipsychotics. METHODS: Published literature, key informant interviews, and discussions with panel members and stakeholder partners were used to identify key clinical areas of guidance and preferences on format for the present recommendations. Draft recommendations were presented to a guideline panel. Members of the guideline panel evaluated the information gathered from the systematic review of the literature and used a nominal group process to reach a consensus on treatment recommendations. A description of the neurological abnormalities commonly seen with antipsychotic medications is provided, as well as recommendations on how to examine and quantify these abnormalities. A stepwise approach to the management of neurological abnormalities is provided. RESULTS: Several different types of extrapyramidal symptoms can be seen secondary to antipsychotic use in children including neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia, neuroleptic-induced akathisia, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia and tardive akathisia, and withdrawal dyskinesias. The overwhelming majority of evidence on the treatment of antipsychotic-induced movement disorders is derived from adult patients with schizophrenia. Given the scarcity of paediatric data, recommendations were made with reference to both the adult and paediatric literature. Given the limitations in the generalizability of data from adult subjects to children, these recommendations should be considered on the basis of expert opinion, rather than evidence based. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be aware of the potential of second-generation antipsychotics to induce neurological side effects, and should exercise a high degree of vigilance when prescribing these medications.

These physiological mechanisms are much less studied over longer periods in wild populations. Here we report the relationships among exploration, docility measured in open-field tests and trappability, taken as an index of boldness, in a wild population of eastern chipmunks and investigate whether behavioural differences among individuals are associated with differences in autonomic nervous system reactivity. We also assess the cortisol level of individuals over several months to investigate whether chipmunks with different exploration levels display different mean cortisol levels or differences in their cortisol variability. Open-field tests showed consistent individual differences in exploration patterns (ranging from fast to slow). Faster explorers were less docile when handled and were trapped more often (males) or farther from their burrows (females) than slower explorers. Fast explorers also showed a higher sympathetic activity under restraint but more stable cortisol levels over the course of the active season, suggesting a lower hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal reactivity. Our results show that chipmunks display individual behavioural variation and that these differences may have physiological implications over long periods in natural settings. Future studies should investigate the fitness consequences of such behavioural/physiological differences. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have linked small MAF function, by virtue of their heterodimerization with the Cap 'n' Collar (CNC) family of transcription factors, to the stress response and detoxification pathways. Recent analyses have revealed a complex regulatory network involving small MAF transcription factors and other cellular proteins. The expression and activity of small MAFs are tightly regulated at multiple levels. With regard to their clinical importance, small MAFs have been linked to various diseases, such as diabetes, neuronal disorders, thrombocytopenia and carcinogenesis. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the activity of small MAFs will provide novel insights into the control of mammalian transcription and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat common human disorders.

Roles for Endothelin Receptor B and BCL2A1 in Spontaneous CNS Metastasis of Melanoma	CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							BRAIN METASTASES; BREAST-CANCER; CELL PROGRESSION; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONISTS; EXPRESSION; INHIBITION; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE; MODELS	Metastatic spread of melanoma to the central nervous system (CNS) is a common and devastating manifestation of disease progression, which, despite its clinical importance, remains poorly understood with respect to underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a recently developed preclinical model of spontaneous melanoma CNS metastasis, we have identified alterations in expression of endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) as a potential factor that influences brain metastatic potential. Induced overexpression of this gene mediated enhanced overall metastatic disease, and resulted in an increased incidence of spontaneous CNS metastases. In contrast, the overexpression of other highlighted genes, such as BCL2A1, did not affect the incidence of CNS metastases but nevertheless appears to facilitate intracranial tumor growth. The prometastatic effect in the CNS associated with EDNRB appears to be mediated by the interaction with its ligands resulting in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and thus intracranial melanoma growth. That EDNRB contributes to melanoma metastasis is underscored by the fact that its therapeutic inhibition by the EDNRB-specific inhibitor A192621 translated into improved outcomes when treating mice with either visceral metastases or intracranial tumors. The identification of an influential role of EDNRB in CNS melanoma spontaneous metastasis may provide both a target for therapeutic intervention as well as a potential prognostic marker for patients having an increased predisposition for incidence of CNS melanoma metastases.

Unregulated brain iron deposition in transgenic mice over-expressing HMOX1 in the astrocytic compartment	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						aging; astrocyte; heme oxygenase-1; iron; macroautophagy; transgenic mice	HEME OXYGENASE-1 EXPRESSION; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE BRAIN; SPINAL CORD BARRIER; OXIDATIVE STRESS; RAT-BRAIN; MITOCHONDRIAL ABNORMALITIES; CHALLENGED ASTROGLIA; CELL-DEATH; IN-VIVO	The mechanisms responsible for pathological iron deposition in the aging and degenerating mammalian CNS remain poorly understood. The stress protein, HO-1 mediates the degradation of cellular heme to biliverdin/bilirubin, free iron, and CO and is up-regulated in the brains of persons with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. HO-1 induction in primary astroglial cultures promotes deposition of non-transferrin iron, mitochondrial damage and macroautophagy, and predisposes cocultured neuronal elements to oxidative injury. To gain a better appreciation of the role of glial HO-1 in vivo, we probed for aberrant brain iron deposition using Perls' method and dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry in novel, conditional GFAP.HMOX1 transgenic mice that selectively over-express human HO-1 in the astrocytic compartment. At 48 similar to weeks, the GFAP.HMOX1 mice exhibited increased deposits of glial iron in hippocampus and other subcortical regions without overt changes in iron-regulatory and iron-binding proteins relative to age-matched wild-type animals. Dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry revealed abundant FeO- signals in the transgenic, but not wild-type, mouse brain that colocalized to degenerate mitochondria and osmiophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (macroautophagy) documented by TEM. Sustained up-regulation of HO-1 in astrocytes promotes pathological brain iron deposition and oxidative mitochondrial damage characteristic of Alzheimer's disease-affected neural tissues. Curtailment of glial HO-1 hyperactivity may limit iron-mediated cytotoxicity in aging and degenerating neural tissues.

Diagnostic and ethical challenges in disorders of consciousness and locked-in syndrome: a survey of German neurologists	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						End-of-life decisions; Limitation of life-sustaining treatment; Diagnosis; Vegetative state; Minimally conscious state	PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS; OF-LIFE DECISIONS; UNRESPONSIVE WAKEFULNESS; PHYSICIANS ATTITUDES; END; MANAGEMENT; DIFFICULTIES; PERCEPTION; ACCURACY	Diagnosis and decisions on life-sustaining treatment (LST) in disorders of consciousness, such as the vegetative state (VS) and the minimally conscious state (MCS), are challenging for neurologists. The locked-in syndrome (LiS) is sometimes confounded with these disorders by less experienced physicians. We aimed to investigate (1) the application of diagnostic knowledge, (2) attitudes concerning limitations of LST, and (3) further challenging aspects in the care of patients. A vignette-based online survey with a randomized presentation of a VS, MCS, or LiS case scenario was conducted among members of the German Society for Neurology. A sample of 503 neurologists participated (response rate 16.4%). An accurate diagnosis was given by 86% of the participants. The LiS case was diagnosed more accurately (94%) than the VS case (79%) and the MCS case (87%, p < 0.001). Limiting LST for the patient was considered by 92, 91, and 84% of the participants who accurately diagnosed the VS, LiS, and MCS case (p = 0.09). Overall, most participants agreed with limiting cardiopulmonary resuscitation; a minority considered limiting artificial nutrition and hydration. Neurologists regarded the estimation of the prognosis and determination of the patients' wishes as most challenging. The majority of German neurologists accurately applied the diagnostic categories VS, MCS, and LiS to case vignettes. Their attitudes were mostly in favor of limiting life-sustaining treatment and slightly differed for MCS as compared to VS and LiS. Attitudes toward LST strongly differed according to circumstances (e.g., patient's will opposed treatment) and treatment measures.

We determined the prevalence of NPSLE in 1000 Faces of Lupus, a large multicenter Canadian cohort. Methods: Adults enrolled at 10 sites who satisfied the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were included. NPSLE was defined as (i) NPSLE by ACR classification criteria (seizures or psychosis), (ii) ACR, SLEDAI (seizure, psychosis, organic brain syndrome, cranial nerve disorder, headache, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA)), SLAM (CVA, seizure, cortical dysfunction, and headache), and SLICC (cognitive impairment, psychosis, seizures, CVA, cranial or peripheral neuropathy, and transverse myelitis) with and (iii) without minor nonspecific NPSLE manifestations (including mild depression, mild cognitive impairment, and electromyogram-negative neuropathies), and (iv) by ACR and SLEDAI neuropsychiatric (NP) indexes alone. Factors associated with NPSLE were explored using regression models. Results: Cohort size was 1253, with mean disease 12 +/- 10 years, mean age 41 +/- 16 years, and 86% female. Subgroup size was dependent on the specific definition of NPSLE. Prevalence of NPSLE was 6.4% in group (i), n = 1253 (n = 80); 38.6% in group (ii), n = 681(n = 263); 28.7% in group (iii), n = 586 (n = 168); and 10.2% in group (iv), n = 1125 (n = 115). In univariate analysis, Aboriginals had a nearly 2-fold increase in frequency of NPSLE in all groups. Education level and income were not associated with NPSLE (P = 0.32 and 0.03, respectively). As well, number of ACR criteria, SLAM, age at diagnosis, disease duration, and gender were not associated with NPSLE. Anti-Ro was significantly associated in groups (i) and (iv) and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) were increased in groups (i), (ii), and (iii); however, this lost significance when thromboembolic events were excluded from SLICC, SLEDAI, and SLAM indexes. In group (iv), absence of anti-Sm was significant. In multivariate analysis, anti-Ro and aPL (i) and anti-Ro + and lack of anti-Sm (iv) were significant. NPSLE was not increased in those with + anti-DNA, La, or ribonucleoprotein (RNP), lupus anticoagulant (LAC), or anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody. Conclusions: The prevalence and factors associated with NPSLE varied depending on the definition used, was highest in Aboriginals, and may be higher if +anti-Ro or aPL are present. SLAM and SLICC include mild subjective disease manifestations, which contributed to a 10% higher prevalence of NPSLE compared to a more strict definition. NPSLE may be less in this database than other publications as its overall prevalence may be decreasing, or because of selection bias inherent to those who enter an observational cohort. NPSLE was associated with aPL and often anti-Ro and varied by ethnicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In ubiquitination cascades involving E3s of the HECT class, ubiquitin is transferred from an associated E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to the acceptor cysteine of the HECT domain, which consists of structurally distinct N- and C-lobes connected by a flexible linker. Here, the high-resolution crystal structure of the C-lobe of the HECT domain of human UBR5 is presented. The structure reveals important features that are unique compared with other HECT domains. In particular, a distinct four-residue insert in the second helix elongates this helix, resulting in a strikingly different orientation of the preceding loop. This protruding loop is likely to contribute to specificity towards the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH4, which is an important functional partner of UBR5. Ubiquitination assays showed that the C-lobe of UBR5 is able to form a thioester-linked E3-ubiquitin complex, although it does not physically interact with UBCH4 in NMR experiments. This study contributes to a better understanding of UBR5 ubiquitination activity.

RSK phosphorylates SOS1 creating 14-3-3-docking sites and negatively regulating MAPK activation	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						14-3-3; negative feedback; phosphorylation; ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK); signal transduction; Son of Sevenless (SOS)	RIBOSOMAL S6 KINASE; FEEDBACK PHOSPHORYLATION; MURINE BRAIN; PROTEIN; RAS; SIGNAL; IDENTIFICATION; RAF-1; SPECIFICITY; SENESCENCE	The extent and duration of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling govern a diversity of normal and aberrant cellular outcomes. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of the MAPK-activated kinase RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) leads to elevated MAPK activity indicative of a RSK-dependent negative feedback loop. Using biochemical, pharmacological and quantitative MS approaches we show that RSK phosphorylates the Ras activator SOS I (Son of Sevenless homologue 1) in cultured cells on two C-terminal residues, Ser(1134) and Ser(1161) Furthermore, we find that RSK-dependent SOS I phosphorylation creates 14-3-3-binding sites. We show that mutating Ser(1134) and Ser(1161) disrupts 14-3-3 binding and modestly increases and extends MAPK activation. Together these data suggest that one mechanism whereby RSK negatively regulates MAPK activation is via site-specific SOS1 phosphorylation.

Although there have been recent advances in PNES research and various hypotheses as to the psychopathology, no theory has achieved general acceptance. In this overview of selected literature on PNES, we highlight the often contradictory findings that underline the challenges that confront both practitioner and researcher. We first provide a synopsis of the history, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, as well as patient characteristics of PNES and the relevance of communication in the clinical context. In the subsequent sections we discuss recent research that may advance the understanding and diagnosis of this disorder. These themes include the use of qualitative methods as a viable research option, the application of nonlinear methods to analyze heterogeneous observations during diagnosis, recent advances in neuroimaging of PNES, and the development of international databases.

Identification of Novel Genes Involved in Migraine	HEADACHE			English	Article						migraine; ion channel; potassium channel; genetics; KCNK18; KCNG4	FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC MIGRAINE; POTASSIUM CHANNEL; MUTATION; SCREEN; TYPE-2; AURA	Background. Migraine is a common form of headache affecting about 12% of the population. Genetic studies in the rare form of familial hemiplegic migraine have identified mutations in 3 genes (CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A) encoding proteins involved in ion homeostasis and suggesting that other such genes may be involved in the more common forms of migraine. Objectives. To test this proposition, the coding regions of 150 brain-expressed genes involved in ion homeostasis (ion channels, transporters, exchangers, and accessory subunits) were systematically screened to identify DNA variants in a group of 110 migraine probands and 250 control samples. Methods. DNA variants were analyzed using a number of complementary in silico approaches. Results. Several genes encoding potassium channels, including KCNK18, KCNG4, and KCNAB3, were identified as potentially linked to migraine. In situ hybridization studies of the mouse Kcnk18 ortholog show that it is developmentally expressed in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia, further supporting the involvement of this gene in migraine pathogenesis. Conclusions. Our study is the first to link variations in these K+ channel genes to migraine, thus expanding on the view of migraine as a channelopathy and providing potential molecular targets for further study and therapeutic applications.

Sub- and suprathreshold adaptation currents have opposite effects on frequency tuning	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Review							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; LATERAL-LINE LOBE; ACTIVATED POTASSIUM CHANNELS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; CA2+-ACTIVATED K+ CHANNELS; NEURONS IN-VIVO; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; VISUAL-CORTEX	Key points We provide the first experimental evidence that sub- and suprathreshold adaptation currents, despite having similar effects on spike frequency adaptation, have opposite effects on frequency tuning. Through a combination of computational analysis and mathematical modelling, we reveal how the differential activation properties of these currents can lead to differential effects on the neuronal transfer function. Our findings challenge the common assumption that spike frequency adaptation always attenuates the neural response to low frequency stimuli, and instead suggest that spike frequency adaptation and frequency tuning can be regulated independently of one another. Abstract Natural stimuli are often characterized by statistics that can vary over orders of magnitude. Experiments have shown that sensory neurons continuously adapt their responses to changes in these statistics, thereby optimizing information transmission. However, such adaptation can also alter the neuronal transfer function by attenuating if not eliminating responses to the low frequency components of time varying stimuli, which can create ambiguity in the neural code. We recorded from electrosensory pyramidal neurons before and after pharmacological inactivation of either calcium-activated (IAHP) or KCNQ voltage-gated potassium currents (IM). We found that blocking each current decreased adaptation in a similar fashion but led to opposite changes in the neuronal transfer function. Indeed, blocking IAHP increased while blocking IM instead decreased the response to low temporal frequencies. To understand this surprising result, we built a mathematical model incorporating each channel type. This model predicted that these differential effects could be accounted for by differential activation properties. Our results show that the mechanisms that mediate adaptation can either increase or decrease the response to low frequency stimuli. As such, they suggest that the nervous system resolves ambiguity resulting from adaptation through independent control of adaptation and the neuronal transfer function.

Methods: The acute effect of fluvoxamine, on 5-HT synthesis rates was investigated in rat brain regions, using alpha-C-14-methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer. Fluvoxamine (25 mg/kg) and saline (control) were injected intraperitoneally, one hour before the injection of the tracer (30 mu Ci). Results: There was no significant effect of fluvoxamine on plasma free tryptophan. After Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction, a significant decrease in the 5-HT synthesis rate in the fluvoxamine treated rats, was found in the raphe magnus (-32%), but not in the median (-14%) and dorsal (-3%) raphe nuclei. In the regions with serotonergic axon terminals, significant increases in synthesis rates were observed in the dorsal (+ 41%) and ventral (+ 43%) hippocampus, visual (+ 38%), auditory (+ 65%) and parietal (+ 37%) cortex, and the substantia nigra pars compacta (+ 56%). There were no significant changes in the 5-HT synthesis rates in the median (+ 11%) and lateral (+ 24%) part of the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens (+ 5%), VTA (+ 16%) or frontal cortex (+ 6%). Conclusions: The data show that the acute administration of fluvoxamine affects 5-HT synthesis rates in a regionally specific pattern, with a general elevation of the synthesis in the terminal regions and a reduction in some cell body structures. The reasons for the regional specific effect of fluvoxamine on 5-HT synthesis are unclear, but may be mediated by the presynaptic serotonergic autoreceptors. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Basic biological tests and serum NT-proBNP levels obtained from acute KD patients were compared to that of febrile controls. NT-proBNP was considered abnormal based on the following definitions: above a cut-off determined on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, above the upper limit for age, or above 2 SD calculated from healthy children. Analyses were also performed for KD cases with complete or incomplete criteria combined and separately. Results: There were 81 patients and 49 controls aged 3.60 +/- 2.77 versus 4.25 +/- 3.88 years (P= 0.69). ROC analysis yielded significant area under the curve for NT-proBNP. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 70.488.9%, 69.491.8%, 82.893.4%, and 65.279.1%. The odds ratios based on NT-proBNP definitions varied between 18.13 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.2145.57), 20.82 (95%CI: 8.1853.0), and 26.71 (95%CI: 8.6482.57; P < 0.001). Results were reproducible for cases with complete or incomplete criteria separately. Conclusion: NT-proBNP is a reliable marker for the diagnosis of KD. Prospective clinical studies with emphasis on NT-proBNP in a diagnostic algorithm are needed.

We had 269 bulimic women provide blood for genetic assays, and measured eating-disorder symptoms and psychopathological traits using structured interviews and self-report questionnaires. We observed two epistatic interactions on symptom indices: interactions (in predicted directions) of DRD2 by DAT were seen on Body Mass Index (p = .023), and of DRD4 by COMT on self-harming behaviors (p = .014) -with genetic effects that would correspond to reduced dopamine transmission coinciding with more-pathological scores. Our findings suggest that genes acting in the dopamine system interact to influence both eating-related and personality psychopathology, with the result that lower levels of dopamine neuro-transmission correspond to increased psychopathology and body mass in women with bulimia-spectrum disorders. We discuss the implications of our observations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The association between a healthy lifespan and metabolism is incompletely understood, but a central factor is glucose metabolism. Although glucose is an important cellular energy source, glucose restriction is associated with extended lifespan in simple animals and a reduced incidence of age-dependent pathologies in humans. We report here that glucose enrichment delays mutant polyglutamine, TDP-43, FUS, and amyloid-beta toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans models of neurodegeneration by reducing protein misfolding. Dysregulated metabolism is common to neurodegeneration and we show that glucose enrichment is broadly protective against proteotoxicity.

Although a strong genetic component to the disorder has been established, the molecular genetic underpinnings of this disorder remain elusive. Recently, several studies have reported an association between polymorphisms within the latrophilin 3 gene (LPHN3) and ADHD. Interestingly, the same single-nucleotide polymorphism conferring susceptibility to ADHD has also been found to predict efficacy of stimulant medication in children. The main objectives of the current article are: (i) To tackle the phenotype heterogeneity issue in ADHD by defining an objective and quantitative measure of response to treatment in a sample of ADHD children based on a hand held automatic device (Actiwatch) and (ii) to use this measure to reproduce for the first time the association between LPHN3 variants and response to methylphenidate (MPH) using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover experimental design. The results of our study confirm the hypothesis that LPHN3 is associated with response to MPH in ADHD children. Although this will require further validation, our work suggests that the use of an objective measure of response to treatment, such as the change in the child's motor activity measured by Actiwatch, has the potential to uncover genetic association signals that in some conditions might not be obtained using more subjective measures, such as the clinical consensus rating, for example.

The exact neural mechanisms underlying this treatment, as well as the specific pathophysiology of the tremor in both diseases to date remain elusive. Since tremor-related local field potentials (LFP) have been shown to cluster with a somatotopic representation in the subthalamic nucleus, we here investigated the neurophysiological correlates of tremor in the ventral thalamus in ET and PD using power and coherence analysis. Local field potentials (LFPs) at different recording depths and surface electromyographic signals (EMGs) from the extensor and flexor muscles of the contralateral forearm were recorded simultaneously in twelve ET and five PD patients. Data analysis revealed individual electrophysiological patterns of LFP-EMG coherence at single and double tremor frequency for each patient. Patterns observed varied in their spatial distribution within the Ventral lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (VLp), revealing a specific topography of 'tremor clusters' for PD and ET. The data strongly suggest that within VLp individual tremor-related electrophysiological signatures exist in ET and PD tremor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Today, useful models are available for such studies, with tools for solving the inverse dynamics problem involved by these analyses. These tools generally provide a set of model parameters that allows an accurate and locally optimal reconstruction of the original movements. Although the solutions that they generate may provide a data curve fitting that is sufficient for some pattern recognition applications, the best possible solution is often necessary in others, particularly those involving neuroscience and biomedical signal processing. To generate these solutions, we present a globally optimal parameter extractor for the delta-lognormal modeling of reaching movements based on the branch-and-bound strategy. This algorithm is used to test the impact of white noise on the delta-lognormal modeling of reaching movements and to benchmark the state-of-the-art locally optimal algorithm. Our study shows that, even with globally optimal solutions, parameter averaging is important for obtaining reliable figures. It concludes that physiologically derived rules are necessary, in addition to global optimality, to achieve meaningful Delta Lambda extractions which can be used to investigate the control patterns of these movement primitives.

The present research sought to characterize the behavioural profile and electrophysiological properties of midbrain monoaminergic neurons in adult rodents after Amph exposure during adolescence. Adolescent rats were administered vehicle, 0.5, 1.5, or 5.0 mg/kg.d Amph from postnatal day (PND) 30-50. At adulthood (PND 70), rats were tested in an open-field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM), paralleled by in-vivo extracellular recordings of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and locus coeruleus, respectively. 5-HT firing in adulthood was increased in rats that had received Amph (1.5 mg/kg.d) during adolescence. At this regimen, DA firing activity was increased, but not NE firing. Conversely, the highest Amph dose regimen (5.0 mg/kg.d) enhanced NE firing, but not DA or 5-HT firing rates. In the OFT, Amph (1.5 mg/kg.d) significantly increased the total distance travelled, while the other doses were ineffective. In the EPM, all three Amph doses increased time spent in the open arms and central platform, as well as the number of stretch-attend postures made. Repeated adolescent exposure to Amph differentially augments monoaminergic neuronal firing in a dose-specific fashion in adulthood, with corresponding alterations in locomotion, risk assessment (stretch-attend postures and central platform occupancy) and risk-taking behaviours (open-arm exploration). Thus, adolescent Amph exposure induces long-lasting neurophysiological alterations that may have implications for drug-seeking behaviour in the future.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Subtype Differentially Predicts Smoking Expectancies in Adolescents	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						Tobacco; Smoking; Nicotine; Expectancies; ADHD; Inattention; Hyperactivity; Impulsivity; Adolescence; Prevention	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; ADHD; DRINKING; SAMPLE; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; ASSOCIATION; IMPULSIVITY; MECHANISMS	Purpose: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an established risk factor for smoking; however, no studies have considered whether precursors to smoking behavior differ among adolescents with ADHD. Smoking expectancies are beliefs about the potential consequences of smoking, and they develop before smoking initiation. ADHD characteristics may contribute to the formation of expectancies and eventual smoking behavior. We evaluated whether clinical levels of ADHD subtypes differentially predicted smoking expectancies. Methods: Adolescents (n = 221; age mean = 12.67 years) completed the Smoking Expectancy Scale for Adolescents, answered standardized questions about their smoking behavior, and provided expired breath samples to verify never-smoking status. Parents completed the Conners' Parent Rating Scale for ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Results: Adolescents with clinical levels of inattention were significantly less likely to endorse negative consequences, including Expected Costs (odds ratio [OR] = .16), Appearance-Presentation Costs (OR = .29), Social Costs (OR = .19), Health Costs (OR .21), and Addiction Costs (OR = .39). Inattentive female adolescents were significantly more likely to endorse Weight Control as a consequence. Adolescents with clinical levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity were more likely to endorse positive consequences, including Expected Benefits (OR = 5.31), Affect Control (OR = 2.60), and Boredom Reduction (OR = 3.14); they were less likely to endorse Social Costs (OR = .27). Conclusions: ADHD subtype differentially predicted smoking expectancies. Adolescents with ADHD may be more vulnerable to developing pro-smoking expectancies due to subtype-related deficits in neurocognitive processing. These findings have potential implications for developing targeted smoking prevention programs. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

J	Braude, HD				Braude, Hillel D.			Conciliating cognition and consciousness: the perceptual foundations of clinical reasoning	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						clinical reasoning; cognition; consciousness; empathy; intuition; neuropsychology; perception; phronesis	PHRONESIS; ETHICS; BRAIN	Clinical reasoning has been defined as a form of cognition applied to evaluating and managing a patient's medical problem. As a kind of cognition, a product of the human psyche, it is logical to expect that clinical reasoning should be best understood through methods derived from psychology, neuropsychology and the cognitive sciences. However, the application of scientific methods to evaluating clinical reasoning is unable to analyse clinical reasoning in terms of first-person experience and consciousness. By reducing clinical reasoning to its cognitive components the cognitivist approach tends to ignore the larger context in which clinical reasoning occurs. By reducing its conception of clinical reasoning to its cognitive components, the neuropsychological approach fails to acknowledge clinical reasoning as a form of intentionality, a gestalt, grounded in human perception. A full epistemology of clinical reasoning requires a phenomenological analysis that can make sense of the relation between pre-reflective consciousness and explicit forms of knowing. In this paper I conciliate cognition and consciousness in medicine through analysing the phenomenology of perception in clinical reasoning. I compare the application of phenomenology to clinical reasoning with the attempt to model clinical reasoning on Aristotelian practical wisdom or phronesis. Finally, I analyse empathy as a type of perception critical for effective clinical interaction and exemplary for reflecting on perception as the intersubjective foundation of clinical reasoning.

We hypothesize that elevated serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are associated with vasospasm and poor outcome in SAH. Methods: In 52 consecutive SAH subjects, we compared TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels on post-SAH days 0 to 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 5, 6 to 8, and 10 to 14 with respect to vasospasm and to poor outcome at 3 and 6 months. Vasospasm was defined as more than 50% reduction in vessel caliber on angiography. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin score greater than 2. Results: Elevated TNF-alpha on post-SAH days 2 to 3 was associated with poor 3-month outcome (P = 0.0004). Global elevation of TNF-alpha over time (post-SAH days 0-14) was independently associated with poor 3-month outcome after adjusting for Hunt-and-Hess grade and age (P = 0.02). Neither cross-sectional nor IL-6 levels over time were associated with outcome. Neither TNF-alpha nor IL-6 levels were associated with vasospasm. Conclusions: Elevation in serum TNF-alpha on post-SAH days 2 to 3 and global elevation of TNF-alpha over time are associated with poor outcome but not with angiographic vasospasm in this small cohort. Future studies are needed to define the role of TNF-alpha in SAH-related brain injury and its potential as a SAH outcome biomarker.

Because of improved transfection ability, synthetic nanocarriers have become candidates for neurotrophic therapy. Neurotensin (NTS)-polyplex is a "Trojan horse" synthetic nanocarrier system that enters dopaminergic neurons through NTS receptor internalization to deliver a genetic cargo. The success of preclinical studies with different neurotrophic genes supports the possibility of using NTS-polyplex in nanomedicine. In this review, we describe the mechanism of NTS-polyplex transfection. We discuss the concept that an effective neurotrophic therapy requires a simultaneous effect on the axon terminals and soma of the remaining dopaminergic neurons. We also discuss the future of this strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. From the Clinical Editor: This review paper focuses on nanomedicine-based treatment of Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative condition with existing symptomatic but no curative treatment. Neurotensin-polyplex is a synthetic nanocarrier system that enables delivery of genetic cargo to dopaminergic neurons via NTS receptor internalization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Polymorphism in multidrug resistance-associated protein gene 3 is associated with outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia	PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL			English	Article						multidrug resistance-associated proteins; polymorphisms; pharmacogenetics; childhood leukemia; treatment; outcomes	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; ANTIFOLATE RESISTANCE; MESSENGER-RNA; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; DRUG TRANSPORTERS; ABC TRANSPORTERS; METHOTREXATE MTX; LUNG-CANCER; EXPRESSION	Multidrug resistance-related proteins (MRPs) 2, 3 and 5 are involved in the efflux of drugs used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. Polymorphisms of these genes were investigated for an association with treatment responses in 273 childhood ALL patients. The MRP3 A-189 allele of the regulatory AT polymorphism was associated with reduced event-free survival (P = 0.01). The results remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons and in the multivariate analysis. Among patients with an event, the A-189 carriers had significantly higher methotrexate plasma levels (P = 0.03). MRP3 A-189 also conferred four times higher risk of a relapse in central nervous system (P 0.01). Patients with this allele tended to have lower frequency of thrombocytopenia grade 2 (P = 0.06). Gene reporter assay showed that the haplotype tagged by the A-189 had higher promoter activity (P <= 0.01). In conclusion, MRP3 A-189 T polymorphism was associated with treatment responses in ALL, likely due to the change in MRP3 efflux.

A weight of evidence approach for the assessment of the ototoxic potential of industrial chemicals	TOXICOLOGY AND INDUSTRIAL HEALTH			English	Article						Industrial chemicals; ototoxicity; interactions; noise; database	INDUCED HEARING-LOSS; AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TERM COMBINED EXPOSURE; HAIR CELL LOSS; METHYLATED BENZENE-DERIVATIVES; NORMAL-HEXANE POLYNEUROPATHY; WEEKS INHALATION EXPOSURE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BRAIN-STEM RESPONSE; LONG-EVANS RATS	There is accumulating epidemiological evidence that exposure to some solvents, metals, asphyxiants and other substances in humans is associated with an increased risk of acquiring hearing loss. Furthermore, simultaneous and successive exposure to certain chemicals along with noise can increase the susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss. There are no regulations that require hearing monitoring of workers who are employed at locations in which occupational exposure to potentially ototoxic chemicals occurs in the absence of noise exposure. This project was undertaken to develop a toxicological database allowing the identification of possible ototoxic substances present in the work environment alone or in combination with noise exposure. Critical toxicological data were compiled for chemical substances included in the Quebec occupational health regulation. The data were evaluated only for noise exposure levels that can be encountered in the workplace and for realistic exposure concentrations up to the short-term exposure limit or ceiling value (CV) or 5 times the 8-h time-weighted average occupational exposure limit (TWA OEL) for human data and up to 100 times the 8-h TWA OEL or CV for animal studies. In total, 224 studies (in 150 articles of which 44 evaluated the combined exposure to noise and a chemical) covering 29 substances were evaluated using a weight of evidence approach. For the majority of cases where potential ototoxicity was previously proposed, there is a paucity of toxicological data in the primary literature. Human and animal studies indicate that lead, styrene, toluene and trichloroethylene are ototoxic and ethyl benzene, n-hexane and p-xylene are possibly ototoxic at concentrations that are relevant to the occupational setting. Carbon monoxide appears to exacerbate noise-induced hearing dysfunction. Toluene interacts with noise to induce more severe hearing losses than the noise alone.

In fact, memory and attention deficits can persist several months after the surgery. Recent studies with healthy older adults have shown that memory and attention can be improved through cognitive training programs. The present study examined whether memory training (method of loci and story generation) and attentional training (dual-task computerized training) could improve cognitive functions in patients aged 65 years and older who underwent CABG surgery. Participants (n = 51) were assigned to one of three groups: (1) control group (tested at 1, 3 and 6 months after the surgery), (2) attention training followed by memory training, (3) memory training followed by attention training (groups 2 and 3: tested at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after the surgery). The trainings took place between the 6th and 10th week following the surgery. The three groups were compared before and after each training program using attention and memory tests and neuropsychological tests. The results showed that attention and memory trainings lead to significant improvement in the cognitive domain that was trained. It thus seems that cognitive training can be a promising tool to enhance cognitive functions after a CABG surgery.

J	Graham, MD; Pfaus, JG				Graham, M. Dean; Pfaus, James G.			Differential effects of dopamine antagonists infused to the medial preoptic area on the sexual behavior of female rats primed with estrogen and progesterone	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Appetitive; Consummatory; Hormone; Hypothalamus; Solicitations; Lordosis; SCH-23390; Raclopride	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; TYPE-1 RECEPTORS; LORDOSIS; RECEPTIVITY; LESIONS; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; HAMSTERS; AGONISTS; REGIONS	Dopamine (DA) in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) is important for the control of appetitive aspects of sexual behavior in the female rat. Recently, following infusions of DA agonists to the mPOA of females primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) alone, we found that the ratio of D1R/D2R activity within the mPOA determines the expression of appetitive behaviors (Graham and Pfaus, 2010). To further the knowledge of this mechanism, the present experiments examined the effects of intra-mPOA infusions of selective DA receptor antagonists. Ovariectomized, sexually-experienced rats primed with EB and progesterone (P) were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the mPOA and infused with 4 doses (0, 0.25, 1.0 and 4.0 mu g) of the nonselective D1R/D2R antagonist flupenthixol (FLU), and selective D1R or D2R antagonists, SCH 23390 (SCH) or raclopride (RAC), respectively, in a randomized order prior to tests of sexual behavior in bilevel chambers. The high dose of FLU significantly decreased solicitations, hops and darts, and pacing behavior. The high dose of SCH also significantly decreased solicitations. In contrast, the high dose of RAC produced an increase in pacing, and a trend toward an increase in solicitations but no other effect on sexual behavior. These results reinforce the idea that the ratio of D1R/D2R activity within the mPOA of female rats is critical for the expression of appetitive behaviors, and further that this ratio is altered by P which shifts the DA effect to a predominantly facilitative D1R activation.

J	Seni, DA				Seni, Dan Alexander			Do the Modern Neurosciences Call for a New Model of Organizational Cognition?	SCIENCE & EDUCATION			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE CREATION; SYSTEMS; HOLISM; MIND	Our purpose in this paper is to try to make a significant contribution to the analysis of cognitive capabilities of the organization of active social systems such as the business enterprise by re-examining the concepts of organizational intelligence, organizational memory and organizational learning in light of the findings of modern neuroscience. In fact, in this paper we propose that neuroscience shows that sociocognitivity is for real. In other words, cognition, in the broad sense, is not exclusive to living organisms: Certain kinds of social organizations (e.g. the enterprise) possess elementary cognitive capabilities by virtue of their structure and their functions. The classical theory of organizational cognition is the theory of Artificial Intelligence. We submit that this approach has proven to be false and barren, and that a materialist emergentist neuroscientific approach, in the tradition of Mario Bunge (2003, 2006), leads to a far more fruitful viewpoint, both for theory development and for eventual factual verification. Our proposals for sociocognitivity are based on findings in three areas of modern neuroscience and biopsychology: (1) The theory of intelligence and of intelligent systems; (2) The neurological theory of memory as distributed, hierarchical neuronal systems; (3) The theory of cognitive action in general and of learning in particular. We submit that findings in every one of these areas are applicable to the social organization.

Unbalanced homonymous ("pen"), balanced homonymous ("panel"), metaphorically polysemous ("lip"), and metonymically polysemous words ("rabbit") were used in a visual single-word priming delayed lexical decision task. The theoretical distinction between homonymy and polysemy was reflected in the N400 component. Homonymous words (balanced and unbalanced) showed effects of dominance/frequency with reduced N400 effects predominantly observed for dominant meanings. Polysemous words (metaphors and metonymies) showed effects of core meaning representation with both dominant and subordinate meanings showing reduced N400 effects. Furthermore, the division within polysemy, into metaphor and metonymy, was supported. Differences emerged in meaning activation patterns with the subordinate meanings of metaphor inducing differentially reduced N400 effects moving from left hemisphere electrode sites to right hemisphere electrode sites, potentially suggesting increased involvement of the right hemisphere in the processing of figurative meaning.

Study design: A prospective cohort of 94 children, including 49 percent boys, were followed up to 5 years of age and assessed for developmental progress. Developmental measures included Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - cognitive; Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - receptive language; Peabody Developmental Motor Scale - motor; and Child Behaviour Checklist - behaviour. Measures of function included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale and Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). Results: The mean scores of the boys on the WeeFIM subscales, such as self-care, mobility, cognition, were significantly lower than that of the girls. There was a trend for a greater proportion of boys to have abnormalities on neurological examination (boys 37.5 percent abnormal, girls 19.5 percent abnormal). Verbal, performance, and full scale Intellectual Quotients were 5-7 points lower in boys but did not reach significance (full scale Intellectual Quotient: boys 87.7 plus or minus 22.2; girls 93.9 plus or minus 19.3). Boys were more likely to have fine motor delays (50 percent, 82.7 plus or minus 16.5) compared with girls (28.2 percent, 87.0 plus or minus 15.8). There were no gender differences in receptive language or behavioural difficulties. Conclusions: Boys born with congenital heart disease requiring early surgical repair appear to be at enhanced risk for neuromotor impairments and activity limitations. Findings support gender differences in the pathogenesis of early brain injury following hypoxic-ischaemic insults. This has implications for neuroprotective strategies to prevent brain injury.

J	Gadhoumi, K; Lina, JM; Gotman, J				Gadhoumi, Kais; Lina, Jean-Marc; Gotman, Jean			Discriminating preictal and interictal states in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy using wavelet analysis of intracerebral EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; Discriminant analysis; Wavelet energy and entropy; Continuous wavelet transform; Seizure prediction; Validation	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE PREDICTION; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; FOCAL SEIZURES; CLINICAL ONSET; REAL-TIME; 80-500 HZ; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECORDINGS	Objective: Identification of consistent distinguishing features between preictal and interictal periods in the EEG is an essential step towards performing seizure prediction. We propose a novel method to separate preictal and interictal states based on the analysis of the high frequency activity of intracerebral EEGs in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Wavelet energy and entropy were computed in sliding window fashion from preictal and interictal epochs. A comparison of their organization in a 2 dimensional space was carried out using three features quantifying the similarities between their underlying states and a reference state. A discriminant analysis was then used in the features space to classify epochs. Performance was assessed based on sensitivity and false positive rates and validation was performed using a bootstrapping approach. Results: Preictal and interictal epochs were discriminable in most patients on a subset of channels that were found to be close or within the seizure onset zone. Conclusions: Preictal and interictal states were separable using measures of similarity with the reference state. Discriminability varies with frequency bands. Significance: This method is useful to discriminate preictal from interictal states in intracerebral EEGs and could be useful for seizure prediction.

Two non-stationary stochastic simulation algorithms are implemented. Both simulation algorithms are compared using the transient response measured on hydroelectric turbine blades during startup. In both algorithms, an independent random phase shift is introduced in the analytic signal given by the Hilbert transform of each time series subcomponent. The subcomponents are obtained either by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) or by Stationary Wavelet Decomposition (SWD). The simulated realizations will invariably include some inherent variations arising from the process itself, combined with epistemic uncertainty due to the assumptions made during modeling. To ensure the quality of the simulated realizations, the following quantitative criteria are used to compare the simulated ensemble to the reference data: cumulative energy, extreme value distribution and rainflow amplitude spectra.

Perceptions of the painful body: The relationship between body perception disturbance, pain and tactile discrimination in complex regional pain syndrome	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS; VISUAL DISTORTION; SYNDROME CRPS; LIMB PAIN; HAND; STIMULATION; MOVEMENT; SCHEMA	Background Disturbances in body perception are increasingly acknowledged as a feature of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Conventional treatments have limited success particularly among those with long-standing disease. Understanding the relationship between body perception disturbance, pain and tactile acuity might provide insight into alternative avenues for treatment. The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that (1) body perception disturbance is positively related to pain and (2) decreased tactile acuity is related to increased body perception disturbance. Methods A controlled observational design was used to measure these features among those with CRPS of one arm. The extent of body perception disturbance was assessed using the Bath CRPS body perception disturbance scale and pain was measured using the neuropathic pain symptom inventory. Two-point discrimination threshold testing was performed as a measure of tactile acuity. Results Findings confirmed both hypotheses. Body perception disturbance was found to positively correlate with pain such that those in greater pain had more extensive body perception disturbance (r?=?0.57, p?<?0.01). Furthermore, a positive correlation was revealed between body perception disturbance and two-point discrimination thresholds (r?=?0.5, p?<?0.025) so those with greater body perception disturbance had worse tactile acuity. Interestingly, those with longer disease duration had significantly greater body perception disturbance (r?=?0.66, p?<?0.001). Conclusion Aberrant central processing is suggested as the neural correlate of body perception disturbance and tactile impairment. The exact relationship between body perception disturbance, pain and tactile acuity and how they may be modulated for pain relief requires further exploration.	[Lewis, J.

UBQLN2/ubiquilin 2 mutation and pathology in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Exome sequencing; Mutation; UBQLN2; Ubiquilin 2	FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; TDP-43; ALS; C9ORF72; GENE; PROTEIN; FUS; FTD	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shows clinical and pathological overlap with frontotemporal dementia that includes the presence of hallmark ubiquitinated inclusions in affected neurons. Mutations in UBQLN2, which encodes ubiquilin 2, were recently identified in X-linked juvenile and adult-onset ALS and ALS/dementia. As part of an established exome sequencing program to identify disease genes in familial ALS, we identified a novel missense UBQLN2 mutation (c. 1460C>T, p. T487I) in 2 apparently unrelated multigenerational ALS families with no evidence of frontotemporal dementia. This mutation segregated with the disease and was absent in 820 healthy controls and all public single nucleotide polymorphism databases. The UBQLN2 p. T487I mutation substitutes a highly conserved residue and is located immediately upstream of a PXX region where all previous mutations have been identified. Immunostaining of spinal cord from a patient with UBQLN2 p. T487I mutation showed colocalization of ubiquilin 2 with ubiquitin in all neuronal inclusions examined and frequent colocalization with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma protein (FUS). To examine ubiquilin 2 pathology in broader ALS, we showed that ubiquilin 2 pathology also extends to ALS with a FUS mutation. These data further support the importance of ubiquilin 2 in the pathogenesis of ALS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Deficit of cognitive inhibition in depressed elderly: A neurocognitive marker of suicidal risk	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Suicide attempts; Cognitive inhibition; Working memory; Depression; Elderly	PRIMARY-CARE PATIENTS; FRONTAL-LOBE; WORKING-MEMORY; GERIATRIC DEPRESSION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ATTEMPTERS; BEHAVIOR; DYSFUNCTION; ATTENTION	Background: Cognitive deficits, in relation to ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortex dysfunctions, have been associated with a higher risk of suicidal acts in young adult patients. Although a public health concern, much less is known about the neurocognitive basis of suicidal behavior in elderly. Here, we aimed at assessing alterations in cognitive inhibition, a suspected major mechanism of the suicidal vulnerability, in suicidal depressed elderly. Methods: We compared 20 currently depressed patients, aged 65 and older who recently attempted suicide to 20 elderly subjects with a current depression but no personal history of suicide attempt and 20 elderly controls. Using an extensive neuropsychological battery, we particularly examined different aspects of cognitive inhibition: access to relevant information (using the Reading with distraction task), suppression of no longer relevant information (Trail Making Test, Rule Shift Cards), and restraint of cognitive resources to relevant information (Stroop test, Hayling Sentence Completion test, Go/No-Go). Results: After adjustment for age, intensity of depression, Mini-Mental State Examination score and speed of information processing, suicidal depressed elderly showed significant impairments in all 3 domains of cognitive inhibition in comparison to both control groups. Limitations: Our results need replication in a larger sample size. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the inability to inhibit neutral information access to working memory, restrain and delete irrelevant information may impair the patient's capacity to respond adequately to stressful situations subsequently leading to an increased risk of suicidal behavior during late-life depression. Interventions may be developed to specifically target cognitive impairment in the prevention of suicide in depressed elderly. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neurovascular deconvolution of optical signals as a proxy for the true neuronal inputs	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						SCKS deconvolution; Biophysical models; Intrinsic optical imaging; Bayesian statistical methods	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; RESONANCE-IMAGING SIGNAL; RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVATION; LASER SPECKLE; FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; OXYGEN-METABOLISM; BALLOON MODEL; FMRI	Since the Kalman filter and Monte Carlo techniques, much theoretical work has been put into the development of signal deconvolution tools. Among recent developments taking place in neuroscience are Dynamic Expectation Maximization, Generalized Filtering and the Cubature Kalman Filter. While there are exciting prospects to use these tools for Dynamic Causal Modeling and other analyses of networks, there has been comparatively little work to validate the algorithms on controlled experimental data. In this work, the latest evolution of these tools, the square-root cubature Kalman smoother (SCKS), is tested for its effectiveness on multimodal neurovascular data. Multispectral intrinsic optical imaging and electrophysiological measurements of Wistar rats are used in combination with somatosensory stimulation. The Buxton-Friston (B-F) balloon model is then deconvolved with the SCKS algorithm to obtain the estimated neuronal inputs u(t) from the hemodynamic measurements (flow, oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin). Results: The estimated neuronal inputs are compared to the stimulation protocol and a sensitivity and specificity analysis is carried out. SCKS succeeds in recovering most of the stimulations. Next, the estimated inputs are compared to actual measures of neuronal activity: local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit activity (MUA). Good sensitivity of the technique is obtained with both LFPs and MUA over the whole recordings, with the area of the ROC curves favoring LFPs. A weak correlation between SCKS estimated inputs and LFPs is found outside stimulation periods, significant at one standard deviation. Finally, the accuracy of state reconstructions is studied and SCKS reconstructed states are highly concordant with measured states. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Perlis, RH; Ruderfer, D; Hamilton, SP; Ernst, C				Perlis, Roy H.; Ruderfer, Douglas; Hamilton, Steven P.; Ernst, Carl			Copy Number Variation in Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder Who Attempted Suicide	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RISK; METAANALYSIS; RECURRENT; BEHAVIOR	Background: Suicide is one of the top ten leading causes of death in North America and represents a major public health burden, partcularly for people with Major Depressive disorder (MD). Many studies have suggested that suicidal behavior runs in families, however, identification of genomic loci that drive this efffect remain to be identified. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using subjects collected as part of STAR*D, we genotyped 189 subjects with MD with history of a suicide attempt and 1073 subjects with Major Depressive disorder that had never attempted suicide. Copy Number Variants (CNVs) were called in Birdsuite and analyzed in PLINK. We found a set of CNVs present in the suicide attempter group that were not present in in the non-attempter group including in SNTG2 and MACROD2 - two brain expressed genes previously linked to psychopathology; however, these results failed to reach genome-wide signifigance. Conclusions: These data suggest potential CNVs to be investigated further in relation to suicide attempts in MD using large sample sizes.

Enhanced adolescent learning and hippocampal axonal projections following preadolescent spatial exposure to a water or dry maze	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mossy fiber; Spatial learning; Synaptophysin; Early experience; Water maze; Object exploration	OBJECT-RECOGNITION MEMORY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; MOSSY FIBER SYSTEM; KAINATE RECEPTORS; DORSAL HIPPOCAMPUS; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; NAVIGATION; PLACE	The present work sought to determine whether preadolescent exposure to a different task in the same spatial environment would lead to enhancement of water-maze performance and changes in hippocampal connectivity. Separate groups of preadolescent (p16-p26) Long Evans rats (LER) were exposed to the same room and arena using either a water-maze (WM) or a dry-maze (DM), while a third group received no exposure to the spatial cues (NT) but were handled. Three weeks later, rats were tested on the WM or DM task in the same room where preadolescent exposure took place. This set up conditions where the DM/WM and WM/DM groups were exposed to the same spatial cues during the preadolescent and adolescent (p40-p44) phases but performed different tests allowing for the dissociation of spatial cue exposure and task familiarity on adolescent performance. When animals experienced similar preadolescent and adolescent conditions (WM/WM or DM/DM), there was improved performance over animals with no preadolescent spatial exposure (NT/WM or NT/DM). In group DM/WM, there was enhanced adolescent performance compared to group NT/WM. In contrast, group WM/DM did not show enhanced adolescent performance. Compared to groups with no preadolescent spatial exposure, groups with both preadolescent and adolescent spatial exposure showed elevated synaptophysin staining in the hippocampal CA3 region indicating an expanded axonal projection in this region. These data suggest the possibility that exposure to spatial cues during the preadolescent period, independent from task-specific requirements, contributes to enhanced adolescent spatial performance on the WM. This appears to be linked with the reorganization of axonal inputs to the CA3 region. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These recordings allow another test of the hypothesis that there is a specialized neural ensemble for pitch within auditory cortex. Moreover, the technique allows recordings from multiple sites with millisecond temporal resolution to allow modeling of the effective connectivity between these sites. Here we argue that this takes the form of a hierarchical network of pitch-sensitive regions. Activity can be understood as reflecting predictive coding, in which perceptual predictions and error messages are continuously exchanged between a higher pitch center and lower-level auditory cortex.

Although there is a high heritability and a significant genetic component in these disorders, the genetic cause of most cases has yet to be identified. Advances in DNA sequencing allowing the analysis of the whole human genome in a single experiment have led to an acceleration of the discovery of the genetic factors associated with human disease. Recent studies using these platforms have highlighted the important role of de novo mutations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. These findings have opened new avenues into the understanding of genetic disease mechanisms. These discoveries, combined with the increasing ease with which we can sequence the human genome, have important implications for diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Here, we present an overview of the recent discovery of de novo mutations using key examples of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We also discuss the impact of technological developments on diagnosis and prevention.

FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene located on the X-chromosome. FMR1 is expected to prevent the expression of the "fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)", which results in altered structural and functional development of the synapse, including a loss of synaptic plasticity. This review aims to unveil the contribution of electrophysiological signal studies for the understanding of the information processing impairments in FXS patients. We discuss relevant event-related potential (ERP) studies conducted with full mutation FXS patients and clinical populations sharing symptoms with FXS in a developmental perspective. Specific deviances found in FXS ERP profiles are described. Alterations are reported in N1, P2, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), N2, and P3 components in FXS compared to healthy controls. Particularly, deviances in N1 and P2 amplitude seem to be specific to FXS. The presented results suggest a cascade of impaired information processes that are in line with symptoms and anatomical findings in FXS.

The present study aimed to reveal possible gene-environment interactions on decision making in a large healthy sample. Specifically, we examined how the frequently studied COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism interacted with an environmental risk factor (i.e., stressful life events) and a protective factor (i.e., parental warmth) to influence affective decision making as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task. We found that stressful life events acted as a risk factor for poor IGT performance (i.e., high reward sensitivity) among Met carriers, whereas parental warmth acted as a protective factor for good IGT performance (i.e., higher IGT score) among Val/Val homozygotes. These results shed some new light on gene-environment interactions in decision making, which could potentially help us understand the underlying etiology of several psychiatric disorders associated with decision making impairment.

However, the distribution of HFOs during seizures remains undefined. Here, we recorded from the hippocampal CA3 subfield, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, and dentate gyrus to quantify the occurrence of ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) during low-voltage fast-onset (LVF) and hypersynchronous-onset (HYP) seizures in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We discovered in LVF seizures that (1) progression from preictal to ictal activity was characterized in seizure-onset zones by an increase of ripple rates that were higher when compared with fast ripple rates and (2) ripple rates during the ictal period were higher compared with fast ripple rates in seizure-onset zones and later in regions of secondary spread. In contrast, we found in HYP seizures that (1) fast ripple rates increased during the preictal period and were higher compared with ripple rates in both seizure-onset zones and in regions of secondary spread and (2) they were still higher compared with ripple rates in both seizure-onset zones and regions of secondary spread during the ictal period. Our findings demonstrate that ripples and fast ripples show distinct time-and region-specific patterns during LVF and HYP seizures, thus suggesting that they play specific roles in ictogenesis.

Dyslexia Impairs Speech Recognition but Can Spare Phonological Competence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OBLIGATORY-CONTOUR-PRINCIPLE; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; READING IMPAIRMENTS; PERCEPTION DEFICITS; NONSPEECH SOUNDS; BRAIN RESPONSES; CHILDREN; REPRESENTATIONS; DISCRIMINATION	Dyslexia is associated with numerous deficits to speech processing. Accordingly, a large literature asserts that dyslexics manifest a phonological deficit. Few studies, however, have assessed the phonological grammar of dyslexics, and none has distinguished a phonological deficit from a phonetic impairment. Here, we show that these two sources can be dissociated. Three experiments demonstrate that a group of adult dyslexics studied here is impaired in phonetic discrimination (e. g., ba vs. pa), and their deficit compromises even the basic ability to identify acoustic stimuli as human speech. Remarkably, the ability of these individuals to generalize grammatical phonological rules is intact. Like typical readers, these Hebrew-speaking dyslexics identified ill-formed AAB stems (e. g., titug) as less wordlike than well-formed ABB controls (e. g., gitut), and both groups automatically extended this rule to nonspeech stimuli, irrespective of reading ability. The contrast between the phonetic and phonological capacities of these individuals demonstrates that the algebraic engine that generates phonological patterns is distinct from the phonetic interface that implements them. While dyslexia compromises the phonetic system, certain core aspects of the phonological grammar can be spared.

The presynaptic terminal is an important site of pathological changes in AD, leading to synaptic loss in specific brain regions, such as in the cortex and hippocampus. In this study, we investigated synaptosomal-associated protein, 25-kDa (SNAP25) mRNA levels and promoter DNA methylation in post mortem brain tissues (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus) from healthy elderly and AD subjects as well as in peripheral blood leukocytes of young, healthy elderly and AD patients. mRNA quantification was performed by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) using the Delta Delta C-T method and promoter DNA methylation was quantified by mass spectrometry using the Sequenom EpiTYPER platform. We observed a significant decrease in SNAP25 expression in AD across all the three brain regions in relation to the healthy elderly subjects, suggesting impairment in synaptic function. The changes in the auditory cortex reflected those observed in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, the primary areas affected in AD. However, no AD-associated differences in SNAP25 promoter DNA methylation were observed suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in mediating the observed gene expression changes.

In this study, we examined the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on cortical surface areas in both the native and stereotaxic spaces for a cohort of homogeneously-aged healthy pediatric twins. Bilateral hemispheric surface and all lobar surface areas except the occipital lobes in native space showed high heritable estimates, while the common environmental effect on bilateral occipital lobes reached statistical significance. The proportion of genetic variance for cortical surface areas measured in stereotaxic space was lower than that measured in native space, whereas the unique environmental influences increased. This is reasonable since whole brain volume is also known to be heritable itself and so removing that component of areal variance due to overall brain size via stereotaxic transformation will reduce the genetic proportion. These findings further suggest that cortical surface areas involved in cognitive, attention and emotional processing, as well as in creating and retaining of long-term memories are likely to be more useful for examining the relationship between genotype and behavioral phenotypes.

Missense mutations in ITPR1 cause autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Article						Congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia; Spinocerebellar ataxia type 29; Cerebellar atrophy; ITPR1; Gene identification	INOSITOL 1,4,5-TRISPHOSPHATE RECEPTOR; CEREBELLAR-ATAXIA; VERMIS; NEURODEGENERATION; HYPOPLASIA; DELETION; ATROPHY; APLASIA; GENES	Background: Congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia is characterized by early gross motor delay, hypotonia, gait ataxia, mild dysarthria and dysmetria. The clinical presentation remains fairly stable and may be associated with cerebellar atrophy. To date, only a few families with autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia have been reported. Linkage to 3pter was demonstrated in one large Australian family and this locus was designated spinocerebellar ataxia type 29. The objective of this study is to describe an unreported Canadian family with autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive spinocerebellar ataxia and to identify the underlying genetic causes in this family and the original Australian family. Methods and Results: Exome sequencing was performed for the Australian family, resulting in the identification of a heterozygous mutation in the ITPR1 gene. For the Canadian family, genotyping with microsatellite markers and Sanger sequencing of ITPR1 gene were performed; a heterozygous missense mutation in ITPR1 was identified. Conclusions: ITPR1 encodes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1, a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Deletions of ITPR1 are known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 15, a distinct and very slowly progressive form of cerebellar ataxia with onset in adulthood. Our study demonstrates for the first time that, in addition to spinocerebellar ataxia type 15, alteration of ITPR1 function can cause a distinct congenital nonprogressive ataxia; highlighting important clinical heterogeneity associated with the ITPR1 gene and a significant role of the ITPR1-related pathway in the development and maintenance of the normal functions of the cerebellum.

Recent studies indicate that phosphorylated tau might affect synaptic function. We now show that endogenous tau is found at postsynaptic sites where it interacts with the PSD95-NMDA receptor complex. NMDA receptor activation leads to a selective phosphorylation of specific sites in tau, regulating the interaction of tau with Fyn and the PSD95-NMDA receptor complex. Based on our results, we propose that the physiologically occurring phosphorylation of tau could serve as a regulatory mechanism to prevent NMDA receptor overexcitation.

Stereotyped angiogenesis is vital for both developmental growth and to restore tissue metabolic supply after ischemic events. Central neurons such as those found in the brain, spinal cord, and retina are vast consumers of oxygen and nutrients and therefore require high rates of perfusion by functional vascular networks to ensure proper sensory transmission. During a metabolic mismatch, such as that occurring during a cerebrovascular infarct or in ischemic retinopathies, there is increasing evidence that central neurons have an inherent ability to influence the vascular response to injury. With a focus on the retina and retinal ischemic disorders, this review explores the ever-growing evidence suggesting that central neurons have the propensity to impact tissue vascularization and reparative angiogenesis. Moreover, it addresses the paradoxical ability of severely ischemic neurons to hinder vascular regrowth and thus segregate the most severely injured zones of nervous tissue. The topics covered here are pertinent for future therapeutic strategies because promoting and steering vascular growth may be beneficial for ischemic disorders.

Their role in thermoregulation is, however, unknown despite the fact the B1 receptor (B1R) was found implicated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which peripheral B1R affects body core temperature in a rat model known to show up-regulated levels of B1R. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg; i.p.) to enhance B1R expression. Control rats received the vehicle only. One week later, rectal temperature was measured in awake rats after i.p. injection of increasing doses (0.01 to 5 mg/kg) of des-Arg9-Bradykinin (BK) and Sar-[D-Phe(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK (B1R agonists) or BK (B2R agonist). The mechanism of B1R-induced hyperthermia was addressed using specific inhibitors and in rats subjected to subdiaphragmatic vagal nerve ligation. B1R mRNA level was measured by quantitative Real Time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and B1R was localized by confocal microscopy. Results: B1R agonists (0.1 to 5 mg/kg) showed transient (5- to 30-minute) and dose-dependent increases of rectal temperature (+ 1.5 degrees C) in STZ-treated rats, but not in control rats. BK caused no effect in STZ and control rats. In STZ-treated rats, B1R agonist-induced hyperthermia was blocked by antagonists/inhibitors of B1R (SSR240612), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (niflumic acid) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (L-NAME), and after vagal nerve ligation. In contrast, COX-1 inhibition (indomethacin) had no effect on B1R agonist-induced hyperthermia. In STZ-treated rats, B1R mRNA was significantly increased in the hypothalamus and the vagus nerve where it was co-localized with calcitonin-gene-related peptide in sensory C-fibers. Conclusion: B1R, which is induced in inflammatory diseases, could contribute to hyperthermia through a vagal sensory mechanism involving prostaglandins (via COX-2) and nitric oxide.

We used single-molecule imaging and stepwise photobleaching in Xenopus oocytes to directly determine the subunit stoichiometry of a glycine receptor to be 3 alpha 1:2 beta. This approach allowed us to determine the receptor stoichiometry in mixed populations consisting of both heteromeric and homomeric channels, additionally revealing the quantitative proportions for the two populations.

The Cell Motility Modulator Slit2 Is a Potent Inhibitor of Platelet Function	CIRCULATION			English	Article						blood cells; blood platelets; thrombosis	REPULSIVE AXON GUIDANCE; THROMBUS FORMATION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; MICE; ACTIVATION; INFLAMMATION; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; RECEPTORS; SECRETION; MIGRATION	Background-Vascular injury and atherothrombosis involve vessel infiltration by inflammatory leukocytes, migration of medial vascular smooth muscle cells to the intimal layer, and ultimately acute thrombosis. A strategy to simultaneously target these pathological processes has yet to be identified. The secreted protein, Slit2, and its transmembrane receptor, Robo-1, repel neuronal migration in the developing central nervous system. More recently, it has been appreciated that Slit2 impairs chemotaxis of leukocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells toward diverse inflammatory attractants. The effects of Slit2 on platelet function and thrombus formation have never been explored. Methods and Results-We detected Robo-1 expression in human and murine platelets and megakaryocytes and confirmed its presence via immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. In both static and shear microfluidic assays, Slit2 impaired platelet adhesion and spreading on diverse extracellular matrix substrates by suppressing activation of Akt. Slit2 also prevented platelet activation on exposure to ADP. In in vivo studies, Slit2 prolonged bleeding times in murine tail bleeding assays. Using intravital microscopy, we found that after mesenteric arteriolar and carotid artery injury, Slit2 delayed vessel occlusion time and prevented the stable formation of occlusive arteriolar thrombi. Conclusions-These data demonstrate that Slit2 is a powerful negative regulator of platelet function and thrombus formation. The ability to simultaneously block multiple events in vascular injury may allow Slit2 to effectively prevent and treat thrombotic disorders such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

J	Saeed, AW; Ribeiro-da-Silva, A				Saeed, Abeer W.; Ribeiro-da-Silva, Alfredo			Non-peptidergic primary afferents are presynaptic to neurokinin-1 receptor immunoreactive lamina I projection neurons in rat spinal cord	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article							UNMYELINATED PRIMARY AFFERENTS; SUPERFICIAL DORSAL-HORN; SUBSTANCE-P; SENSORY NEURONS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; BINDING-SITES; RESPONSES; PAIN	Background: Pain-related (nociceptive) information is carried from the periphery to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord mostly by two populations of small diameter primary afferents, the peptidergic and the non-peptidergic. The peptidergic population expresses neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, while the non-peptidergic fibers are devoid of neuropeptides, express the purinergic receptor P2X3, and bind the isolectin B4 (IB4). Although it has been known for some time that in rat the peptidergic afferents terminate mostly in lamina I and outer lamina II and non-peptidergic afferents in inner lamina II, the extent of the termination of the latter population in lamina I was never investigated as it was considered as very minor. Because our preliminary evidence suggested otherwise, we decided to re-examine the termination of non-peptidergic afferents in lamina I, in particular with regards to their innervation of projection neurons expressing substance P receptors (NK-1r). We used retrograde labeling of neurons from the parabrachial nucleus combined with lectin IB4 binding and immunocytochemistry. Samples were examined by confocal and electron microscopy. Results: By confocal microscopy, we studied the termination of non-peptidergic afferents in lamina I using IB4 binding and P2X3 immunoreactivity as markers, in relation to CGRP immunoreactivy, a marker of peptidergic afferents. The number of IB4 or P2X3-labeled fibers in lamina I was higher than previously thought, although they were less abundant than CGRP-labeled afferents. There were very few fibers double-labeled for CGRP and either P2X3 or IB4. We found a considerable number of IB4-positive fiber varicosities in close apposition to NK-1r-positive lamina I projection neurons, which were distinct from peptidergic varicosities. Furthermore, we confirmed at the ultrastructural level that there were bona fide synapses between P2X3-immunoreactive non-peptidergic boutons and neurokinin-1 receptor-positive lamina I dendrites. Conclusions: These results indicate the presence of direct innervation by non-peptidergic nociceptive afferents of lamina I projection neurons expressing NK-1r. Further investigations are needed to better understand the role of these connections in physiological conditions and chronic pain states.

VAMP1 Mutation Causes Dominant Hereditary Spastic Ataxia in Newfoundland Families	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							MEMBRANE PROTEIN-1 VAMP-1; TARGETING SIGNAL; RAT-BRAIN; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; GENES	Our group previously described and mapped to chromosomal region 12p13 a form of dominantly inherited hereditary spastic ataxia (HSA) in three large Newfoundland (Canada) families. This report identifies vesicle-associated membrane protein 1 (VAMP1), which encodes a critical protein for synaptic exocytosis, as the responsible gene. In total, SO affected individuals from these families and three independent probands from Ontario (Canada) share the disease phenotype together with a disruptive VAMP1 mutation that affects a critical donor site for the splicing of VAMP1 isoforms. This mutation leads to the loss of the only VAMP1 isoform (VAMP1A) expressed in the nervous system, thus highlighting an association between the well-studied VAMP1 and a neurological disorder. Given the variable phenotype seen in the affected individuals examined here, we believe that VAMP1 should be tested for mutations in patients with either ataxia or spastic paraplegia.

To address this issue, we devised lineage-tracing assays in developing zebrafish embryos to reconstruct entire retinal lineage progressions in vivo and thereby provide a complete quantitative map of the generation of a vertebrate CNS tissue from individual progenitors. These lineage data are consistent with a simple model in which the retina is derived from a set of equipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that are subject to stochastic factors controlling lineage progression. Clone formation in mutant embryos reveals that the transcription factor Ath5 acts as a molecular link between fate choice and mode of cell division, giving insight into the elusive molecular mechanisms of histogenesis, the conserved temporal order by which neurons of different types exit the cell cycle.

Neurochemical data suggest that hcrt/orx cells contain several transmitters, but what hcrt/orx cells release onto their projection targets is unknown. A major pathway by which hcrt/orx neurons are thought to promote arousal is through projections to tuberomammillary histamine (HA) neurons. To study the impact of the electrical activity in hcrt/orx cells on HA neurons, we genetically targeted the light-activated excitatory ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to the plasma membrane of hcrt/orx cells, and performed patch-clamp recordings from HA cells in acute mouse brain slices. Stimulation of ChR2-containing fibers with millisecond flashes of blue light produced fast postsynaptic currents in HA neurons, with a high connection probability (approximate to 60% of HA cells were connected to approximate to 40% of hcrt/orx cells expressing ChR2). These inputs depended on tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials, had kinetics typical of glutamatergic responses mediated by AMPA receptors, were blocked by the AMPA receptor blocker CNQX, and displayed multiple forms of short-term plasticity (depression in approximate to 70% trials, facilitation in approximate to 30% trials, both often in the same cell). Furthermore, stimulation of hcrt/orx axons at physiological frequencies rapidly and reversibly increased action potential firing in HA cells, an effect that was abolished by blockade of AMPA receptors. These results provide the first functional evidence that hcrt/orx neurons are capable of fast glutamatergic control of their projection targets, and suggest that variations in electrical activity of hcrt/orx axons can induce rapid changes in long-range signals generated by HA neurons.

Taurine Release by Astrocytes Modulates Osmosensitive Glycine Receptor Tone and Excitability in the Adult Supraoptic Nucleus	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL NETWORK ACTIVITY; GLIAL-CELLS; RAT HYPOTHALAMUS; IN-SITU; EXTRACELLULAR CONCENTRATION; GUANIDINOETHYL SULFONATE; VASOPRESSIN NEURONS; VOLUME REGULATION; BRAIN-CELLS; AMINO-ACIDS	Cells can release the free amino acid taurine through volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs), and it has been hypothesized that taurine released from glial cells is capable of inhibiting action potential (AP) firing by activating neuronal glycine receptors (GlyRs) (Hussy et al., 1997). Although an inhibitory GlyR tone is widely observed in the brain, it remains unknown whether this specifically reflects gliotransmission because most neurons also express VRACs and other endogenous molecules can activate GlyRs. We found that VRACs are absent in neurons of the rat supraoptic nucleus (SON), suggesting that glial cells are the exclusive source of taurine in this nucleus. Application of strychnine to rat hypothalamic explants caused a depolarization of SON neurons associated with a decrease of chloride conductance and could excite these cells in the absence of fast synaptic transmission. This inhibitory GlyR tone was eliminated by pharmacological blockade of VRACs, by cellular taurine depletion, by metabolic inactivation of glia with fluorocitrate, and after retraction of astrocytic processes that intercalate neuronal somata and dendrites. Finally, GlyR tone varied inversely with extracellular fluid tonicity to mediate the osmotic control of AP firing by SON neurons. These findings establish taurine as a physiological gliotrans-mitter and show that gliotransmission is a spatially constrained process that can be modulated by the morphological rearrangement of astrocytes.

It originally postulated that a deficit in brain serotonin, corrected by antidepressant drugs, was the origin of the illness. Nowadays, it is generally accepted that recurring mood disorders are brain diseases resulting from the combination, to various degrees, of genetic and other biological as well as environmental factors, evolving through the lifespan. All areas of neuroscience, from genes to behaviour, molecules to mind, and experimental to clinical, are actively engaged in attempts at elucidating the pathophysiology of depression and the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of antidepressant treatments. This first of two special issues of Philosophical Transactions B seeks to provide an overview of current developments in the field, with an emphasis on cellular and molecular mechanisms, and how their unravelling opens new perspectives for future research.

Previous immuno-electron microscopic studies in rats have demonstrated an internalization of 5-HT(1A)autoR upon acute administration of the selective agonist 8-OH-DPAT or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant fluoxetine. Interestingly, it was subsequently shown in cats as well as in humans that this internalization is detectable by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the 5-HT1A radioligand [F-18]MPPF. Further immunocytochemical studies also revealed that, after chronic fluoxetine treatment, the 5-HT(1A)autoR, although present in normal density on the plasma membrane of 5-HT cell bodies and dendrites, do not internalize when challenged with 8-OH-DPAT. Resensitization requires several weeks after discontinuation of the chronic fluoxetine treatment. In contrast, the SERT internalizes in both the cell bodies and axon terminals of 5-HT neurons after chronic but not acute fluoxetine treatment. Moreover, the total amount of SERT immunoreactivity is then reduced, suggesting that SERT is not only internalized, but also degraded in the course of the treatment. Ongoing and future investigations prompted by these finding are briefly outlined by way of conclusion.

However, there are serious limitations to the current monoamine theory, and additional mechanisms, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunctions, as well as neurodegenerative and inflammatory alterations, are potentially associated with the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Moreover, new data have recently indicated that epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and DNA methylation could affect diverse pathways leading to depression-like behaviours in animal models. In a transgenic mouse model of depression, in which a downregulation of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) causes a deficit in the HPA axis feedback control, besides alterations in monoamine neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, we found modifications in the expression of many proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, as well as clock genes, in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, that might be central in the genesis of depressive-like behaviours.

Variations in maternal pup licking/grooming (LG) in the rat regulate the development of individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. The adult offspring of mothers that show an increased frequency of pup LG have increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and more modest pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. This parental effect is mediated by the epigenetic programming of a GR exon 1 promoter (exon 1(7)) through the binding of the transcription factor nerve growth factor-inducible factor A (NGFI-A). In this paper, we report that: (i) the association of NGFI-A with the exon 1(7) GR promoter is dynamically regulated by mother-pup interactions; (ii) this effect is mimicked by artificial tactile stimulation comparable to that provided by pup LG; (iii) that serotonin (5-HT) induces an NGFI-A-dependent increase in GR transcription in hippocampal neurons and NGFI-A overexpression is sufficient for this effect; and (iv) that thyroid hormones and 5-HT are key mediators of the effects of pup LG and tactile stimulation on NGFI-A binding to the exon 1(7) GR promoter in hippocampus. These findings suggest that pup LG directly activates 5-HT systems to initiate intracellular signalling pathways in the hippocampus that regulate GR transcription.

Here we provide definitive findings on this topic, using a neuro-psychological approach that takes advantage of a unique dataset accrued over several decades. We applied voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping in 344 individuals with focal lesions (165 involving the PFC) who had been tested on a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tasks. Two distinct functional-anatomical networks were revealed within the PFC: one associated with cognitive control (response inhibition, conflict monitoring, and switching), which included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and a second associated with value-based decision-making, which included the orbitofrontal, ventromedial, and frontopolar cortex. Furthermore, cognitive control tasks shared a common performance factor related to set shifting that was linked to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. By contrast, regions in the ventral PFC were required for decision-making. These findings provide detailed causal evidence for a remarkable functional-anatomical specificity in the human PFC.

We have identified a consanguineous Lebanese family with two affected members displaying progressive hearing loss, RP and cataracts, therefore clinically diagnosed as USH type 3 (USH3). Our study was aimed at the identification of the causative mutation in this USH3-like family. Methods: Candidate loci were identified using genomewide SNP-array-based homozygosity mapping followed by targeted enrichment and next-generation sequencing. Results: Using a capture array targeting the three identified homozygosity-by-descent regions on chromosomes 1q43-q44, 20p13-p12.2 and 20p11.23-q12, we identified a homozygous nonsense mutation, p.Arg65X, in ABHD12 segregating with the phenotype. Conclusion: Mutations of ABHD12, an enzyme hydrolyzing an endocannabinoid lipid transmitter, cause PHARC (polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and early-onset cataract). After the identification of the ABHD12 mutation in this family, one patient underwent neurological examination which revealed ataxia, but no polyneuropathy. ABHD12 is not known to be related to the USH protein interactome. The phenotype of our patient represents a variant of PHARC, an entity that should be taken into account as differential diagnosis for USH3. Our study demonstrates the potential of comprehensive genetic analysis for improving the clinical diagnosis.

NEUROFORUM			German	Article						attention; vision; rhesus monkeys; cortex; receptive field	CORTICAL AREA MT; NEURONS; CORTEX; MODULATION	In the visual system receptive fields represent the spatial selectivity of neurons for a given set of visual inputs. Their invariance is thought to be caused by a hardwired input configuration, which ensures a stable 'labeled line' code for the encoding of the spatial position of visual stimuli. On the other hand, changeable receptive fields can provide the visual system with flexibility for allocating processing resources in space. The allocation of spatial attention, often referred to as the spotlight of attention, is a behavioral equivalent of visual receptive fields. It dynamically modulates the spatial sensitivity to visual information as a function of the current attentional focus of the organism. Here we focus on the brain system for encoding visual motion information and review recent findings documenting interactions between spatial attention and receptive fields in the visual cortex of primates. These interactions create a careful balance between the benefits of invariance with those derived from the attentional modulation of information processing according to the current behavioral goals.

We also evaluated the addition of sodium pentobarbital injected intracoelomically 2 h after MS222 immersion to achieve euthanasia. Frogs (n = 9) weighing 105.5 +/- 8.4 g (mean +/- 1 SD) were immersed in MS222 at either 1 or 3 g/L until anesthesia was achieved; a conductive stainless steel screw then was implanted in the skull on top of the outer pial surface of the brain. Frogs were immersed again in MS222 at the same concentration as previously, and electroencephalograms, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory movements were recorded. Amplitude and mean frequency of the electroencephalographic signal were evaluated at 15-min intervals until a flat-line signal was achieved. At 2 h after induction, frogs were injected intracoelomically with sodium pentobarbital (0.5 mL; 240 mg/mL) to accelerate euthanasia. Immersion of frogs in 1 or 3 g/L of MS222 depressed cerebral activity within 30 min without a significant effect on cardiac function. Intracoelomic injection of sodium pentobarbital at 2 h after MS222 administration rapidly (3.2 +/- 1.7 min) induced cardiac arrest. In conclusion, immersion in MS222 can be used for the collection of organs from X. laevis frogs, but the addition of pentobarbital is required to achieve euthanasia.

Both behavioral and neuroimaging data have revealed the extent and plastic nature of the brain's response to musical stimulation. Furthermore, some degree of overlap has been found, both in neuro-anatomy and function, between musical processes and those of non-musical abilities (especially linguistic, motor and emotional). Concurrently, numerous studies have sought to demonstrate and explain the beneficial effects of practicing or listening to music on both the cognitive and motor abilities of healthy subjects and patients. This literature review aims to integrate these data in order to understand how music can be a relevant tool for cognitive stimulation and how it could be used as part of innovative therapeutic approaches, especially in the field of cognitive neuropsychology.

Callous-unemotional traits in childhood and psychopathic traits in adulthood characterize a distinct subgroup. Objective: To identify structural gray matter (GM) differences between persistent violent offenders who meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder and the syndrome of psychopathy (ASPD+P) and those meeting criteria only for ASPD (ASPD-P). Design: Cross-sectional case-control structural magnetic resonance imaging study. Setting: Inner-city probation services and neuroimaging research unit in London, England. Participants: Sixty-six men, including 17 violent offenders with ASPD+P, 27 violent offenders with ASPD-P, and 22 healthy nonoffenders participated in the study. Forensic clinicians assessed participants using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. Main Outcome Measures: Gray matter volumes as assessed by structural magnetic resonance imaging and volumetric voxel-based morphometry analyses. Results: Offenders with ASPD+P displayed significantly reduced GM volumes bilaterally in the anterior rostral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) and temporal poles (Brodmann area 20/38) relative to offenders with ASPD-P and nonoffenders. These reductions were not attributable to substance use disorders. Offenders with ASPD-P exhibited GM volumes similar to the nonoffenders. Conclusions: Reduced GM volume within areas implicated in empathic processing, moral reasoning, and processing of prosocial emotions such as guilt and embarrassment may contribute to the profound abnormalities of social behavior observed in psychopathy. Evidence of robust structural brain differences between persistently violent men with and without psychopathy adds to the evidence that psychopathy represents a distinct phenotype. This knowledge may facilitate research into the etiology of persistent violent behavior.

The effects of estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P) were examined on the acquisition and expression of sexual reward induced by paced copulation and clitoral stimulation (CLS) in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. In experiment 1 we examined the expression of a pacing-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Ovariectomized, hormone-primed rats were given experience with paced copulation associated with one side of a CPP apparatus. Changing hormonal status prior to the final CPP test did not alter pacing-induced CPP. However, subsequent partial extinction of CPP was observed only in rats primed with EB + P. a treatment previously shown to induce sexual desire and receptivity. In Experiment 2, significant CLS-induced CPP developed in ovariectomized rats regardless of hormone priming. Our results show that the expression of the sexual reward state induced by paced copulation, and CLS in particular, is independent of hormone priming.

Comparing structural and functional graph theory features in the human brain using multimodal MRI	IRBM			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY PATTERNS; ANATOMICAL NETWORKS; IN-VIVO; FMRI	Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are allowing neuroscientists to gain critical insights into the neural networks mediating a variety of cognitive processes. This work investigates structural and functional connectivity in the human brain under different experimental conditions through multimodal MRI acquisitions. To define the nodes of a full-brain network, a set of regions was identified from resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data using spatial independent component analysis (sICA) and a hierarchical clustering technique. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired from the same subjects and a probabilistic fiber tracking method was used to estimate the structure of this network. Using features originating from graph theory. such as small-world properties and network efficiency, we characterized the structural and functional connectivities of the full-brain network and we compared them quantitatively. We showed that structural and functional networks shared some properties in terms of topology as measured by the distribution of the node degrees, hence supporting the existence of an underlying anatomical substrate for functional networks.

The actions are selectively mediated by imidazoline type-1 receptor (I-1-receptor, also named nischarin), nonadrenergic neurotransmitter receptors mainly found in the brainstem medulla. We identified cardiac I-1-receptors/nischarin and showed that they are upregulated in cardiovascular disorders, and are functional without the central nervous system's contribution. Molecular characterization revealed that I-1-receptor/nischarin has a unique structure with multifunctional domains allowing it to perform a number of cell signalling roles as a scaffolding protein. Nischarin has been associated with integrin alpha 5 and inhibition of Rac1 and was shown to interact with insulin receptor substrates. However, very little is known about cardiac I-1-receptor/nischarin and its role(s) in normal physiology and pathophysiology, specifically in cardiac remodelling. Our studies have shown that I-1-receptor is expressed in cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes and that in vitro I-1-receptor activation inhibits norepinephrine-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation, through differential effects on mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt. Accordingly, apart from centrally-mediated sympatholytic function, I-1-receptor in the heart may control cell growth and death. I-1-receptor may be implicated in cardiac remodelling and dysfunction, through the inhibition of apoptotic pathways and/or activation of survival pathways, in a cell-specific manner. Identification of the cardioprotective mechanisms of cardiac I-1-receptor could result in specifically-tailored cell/gene-driven I-1-receptor treatments, and/or treatments that target cardiac I-1-receptor, which could eventually be important for patients with hypertrophic heart disease.

Approximately 50% of patients with REM sleep behavior disorder have mild cognitive impairment. Our objective was to investigate brain perfusion changes associated with mild cognitive impairment in REM sleep behavior disorder. Twenty patients with REM sleep behavior disorder, including 10 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 10 patients without mild cognitive impairment, and 20 healthy controls underwent a complete neuropsychological assessment and single-photon emission computerized tomography using 99mcTc-Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer. Compared with controls, both REM sleep behavior disorder groups had hypoperfusion in the frontal regions. In addition, patients with REM sleep behavior disorder and mild cognitive impairment showed cortical hypoperfusion in the occipital, temporal, and parietal regions compared with controls and patients with REM sleep behavior disorder without mild cognitive impairment. Both REM sleep behavior disorder groups had hyperperfusion in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri. However, patients with REM sleep behavior disorder and mild cognitive impairment showed more pronounced anomalies in the right hippocampus and had increased perfusion in the putamen and the left paracentral gyrus. This study showed specific patterns of posterior cortical hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion in some brain areas in patients with REM sleep behavior disorder and mild cognitive impairment, similar to those found in Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. This suggests the presence of an identifiable neuroimaging marker of synucleinopathy in REM sleep behavior disorder with mild cognitive impairment.

Unfortunately, pain in older adults is underdiagnosed, undertreated, inadequately treated or not treated at all. A solution to this problem would be to provide effective and innovative interdisciplinary continuing education to health care providers (HCPs). OBJECTIVE: To identify the educational needs of HCPs working in LTCF with regard to pain management. METHODS: A qualitative research design using the nominal group technique was undertaken. Seventy-two HCPs (21 physicians/pharmacists, 15 occupational/physical therapists, 24 nurses and 21 orderlies) were recruited from three LTCF in Quebec. Each participant was asked to provide and prioritize a list of the most important topics to be addressed within a continuing education program on chronic pain management in LTCF. RESULTS: Forty topics were generated across all groups, and six specific topics were common to at least three out of the four HCP groups. Educational need in pain assessment was ranked the highest by all groups. Other highly rated topics included pharmacological treatment of pain, pain neurophysiology, nonpharmacological treatments and how to distinguish pain expression from other behaviours. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that despite an average of more than 10 years of work experience in LTCF, HCPs have significant educational needs in pain management, especially pain assessment. These results will help in the development of a comprehensive pain management educational program for HCPs in LTCF.

We therefore conducted a genome-wide association study for facial shape phenotypes in multiple discovery and replication cohorts, considering almost ten thousand individuals of European descent from several countries. Phenotyping of facial shape features was based on landmark data obtained from three-dimensional head magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and two-dimensional portrait images. We identified five independent genetic loci associated with different facial phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of five candidate genes-PRDM16, PAX3, TP63, C5orf50, and COL17A1-in the determination of the human face. Three of them have been implicated previously in vertebrate craniofacial development and disease, and the remaining two genes potentially represent novel players in the molecular networks governing facial development. Our finding at PAX3 influencing the position of the nasion replicates a recent GWAS of facial features. In addition to the reported GWA findings, we established links between common DNA variants previously associated with NSCL/P at 2p21, 8q24, 13q31, and 17q22 and normal facial-shape variations based on a candidate gene approach. Overall our study implies that DNA variants in genes essential for craniofacial development contribute with relatively small effect size to the spectrum of normal variation in human facial morphology. This observation has important consequences for future studies aiming to identify more genes involved in the human facial morphology, as well as for potential applications of DNA prediction of facial shape such as in future forensic applications.

J	Al-Jehani, H; Essawi, W; Jacques, L				Al-Jehani, Hosam; Essawi, Wissam; Jacques, Line			Duration of Intra-Operative Stimulation as a Predictor of Success of Spinal Cord Stimulation for Chronic Pain Syndromes	TURKISH NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Dorsal column; Electrical stimulation; Failed back surgery; Gate control theory; Spinal cord		AIM: Electrical stimulation of the dorsal column of the spinal cord stands out as a major method of neuromodulation. Its popularity stems from the long lasting support to the "gate theory" in which electrical stimulation of the gate prevents passage of nociceptive impulses and reduces pain sensation. There is little known about the effect of the duration of intraoperative stimulation (IOS) trial on the success of the spinal cord stimulation trial. MATERIAL and METHODS: We present our result on 58 patients with spinal cord stimulation implantation and their IOS trials and short-term follow up. RESULTS: The major finding of this study is that the longer the IOS trial, the higher the chances for failure of SCS. Our study also suggests that tripolar spinal cord stimulation leads present a more reliable option for long-term success of the spinal cord stimulation (SCS). CONCLUSION: The duration of IOS seems to influence the result of the initial trial of SCS. IOS should be between 30-60 minutes to optimize the placement of the lead for better correlation with the SCS trial.

Prefrontal cortical anandamide signaling coordinates coping responses to stress through a serotonergic pathway	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Endocannabinoid; Forced swim test; In vivo electrophysiology; Mass spectrometry; Prefrontal cortex; Serotonin	ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITY; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; RAT; BEHAVIOR; NEURONS; CORTEX; ANXIETY; TRANSMISSION; CANNABINOIDS	The endocannabinoid system has recently emerged as a vital component of the stress response and is an appealing target for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. Additionally, corticolimbic endocannabinoid signaling is important for stress-induced regulation of emotional behavior. However, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. Combining biochemical and behavioral analyses within the forced swim test, we examined whether stress-induced regulation of endocannabinoid signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex contributes to behavioral responses to stress, and whether these responses are dependent on serotonergic neurotransmission. Forced swim stress produced a rapid and pronounced reduction in medial prefrontal anandamide content, but had no effect on 2-arachidonoylglycerol content within this region. Local administration of the anandamide hydrolysis inhibitor URB597 (0.01 mu g) into the ventromedial region of the prefrontal cortex decreased passive coping responses and increased active behavioral strategies, a phenomenon which was blocked by local antagonism of the CBI receptor. Furthermore, local inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis within the medial PFC increased the firing rate of serotonergic neurons within the dorsal raphe, suggesting that prefrontal cortical endocannabinoid signaling may modulate stress coping behaviors through a regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission. Accordingly, serotonin depletion prevented the ability of inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis within the medial PFC to promote active stress coping responses. Collectively, these data argue that stress-induced changes in endocannabinoid signaling within the medial PFC modulate stress-coping behaviors through a regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission and provide a neuroanatomical framework by which we may understand the mechanisms subserving the antidepressant potential of the endocannabinoid system.

However, it remains unclear, whether age-of-onset identifies subgroups of depression. The objective of this study was to compare cognitive inhibition in depressed women aged 60 and older, according to age of the first onset depression (before or after 60 years old). Methods: We compared 10 currently depressed women (HDRS-17 >= 18) with a late-onset depression to 10 depressed women with an early-onset depression, and to 10 healthy controls. We examined cognitive inhibition (Stroop, Hayling, Go/No-Go), shifting (TMT), updating in working memory (WAIS) and executive functions (BREF). All groups were matched for age, education level, and MMSE score (MMSE >= 24). Results: Depressed elderly women with a late and an early-onset depression had a greater impairment in executive functions and cognitive inhibition compared with healthy controls (p<0,001), but without significant differences according to the age of the first onset depression. Futhermore, late-onset depression in women was significantly correlated with a deficit of cognitive inhibition (rs=0.55; p=0.012). Conclusion: Cognitive inhibition should be assessed in late-life depression. Interventions may be developed to specifically target cognitive impairment in the prevention of late-life depression, to identify those who are the most vulnerable to relapse.

Sam68 contains a single KH domain harboring conserved N- and C-terminal sequences required for RNA binding and homodimerization. The KH domain is one of the most prevalent RNA binding domains that directly contacts single-stranded RNA. Sam68 has been implicated in numerous aspects of RNA metabolism including alternative splicing and polysomal recruitment of mRNAs. Studies in mice have revealed physiological roles linking Sam68 to osteoporosis, obesity, cancer, infertility and ataxia. Recent publications have greatly enhanced our understanding of Sam68 mechanism of action in addition to its cellular role. Herein, we will discuss the latest advances in the literature pertaining to obesity and neuronal development.

The majority of cases are caused by basilar artery occlusion leading to brainstem infarction in the ventral pons, yet numerous other etiologies have been described. The diagnosis of LIS is completely dependent on the physician's ability to know that these manifestations originate in the brainstem and the posterior circulation that supplies it. This knowledge hinges on the ability of the examining physician to conduct a rapid, yet appropriately thorough neurologic examination. With recent advances in interventional neuroradiology leading to improved patient outcomes, LIS has evolved into a critical, time-dependent diagnosis. Herein, we present the case of a male patient who initially presented to the emergency department of a community hospital with coma of unknown cause. By presenting this case and focusing on the importance of the occulomotor exam, we hope to help in the rapid identification and treatment of patients with LIS in the emergency room and avoid outcomes similar to that of our patient.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; MULTIFORME; TUMOR; CHEMOTHERAPY; ASTROCYTOMA; DISRUPTION; PROGNOSIS; REGROWTH	Background: The impact of malignant glioma resection on survival is still a matter of controversy. The lack of well-designed prospective studies as well as control of all factors in retrospective studies plays an important role in this debate. Amongst some of these uncontrolled factors, are the inclusion of different histological grades, the lack of objective methods to estimate the extent of resection and unspecified delays in post-operative imaging. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 126 consecutive patients with glioblastoma, operated on by the senior authors at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, who met the following criteria: >18 years of age, newly diagnosed glioblastoma, pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2 weeks prior to surgery, and a post-operative MRI within 72 hours after surgery. Extent of tumour resection was calculated using pre and post-operative tumour delimitation on gadolinium-enhanced T1 MRI in a volumetric analysis. Results: Applying stringent specific inclusion criteria, 126 patients were retained in the analysis. The median overall survival was 271 days and the median extent of resection was 65%. Patients with more than 90% of tumour resection had a significantly better outcome, improving median survival from 225 to 519 days (P=0.006). Other factors that significantly improved survival were the use of radiotherapy, the number of regimens and type of chemotherapy used. Conclusion: A more aggressive approach combining maximal safe resection and use of salvage chemotherapy seems to confer a survival advantage for glioblastoma patients.

Such shaping is thought to underlie important changes in the neural code, but the neural circuitry responsible is largely unknown. In this study, we investigate a stimulus-induced shaping of pairwise spike train correlations in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish. Simultaneous single unit recordings of principal electrosensory cells show that an increase in the spatial extent of stimuli increases correlations at short (similar to 10 ms) timescales while simultaneously reducing correlations at long (similar to 100 ms) timescales. A spiking network model of the first two stages of electrosensory processing replicates this correlation shaping, under the assumptions that spatially broad stimuli both saturate feedforward afferent input and recruit an open-loop inhibitory feedback pathway. Our model predictions are experimentally verified using both the natural heterogeneity of the electrosensory system and pharmacological blockade of descending feedback projections. For weak stimuli, linear response analysis of the spiking network shows that the reduction of long timescale correlation for spatially broad stimuli is similar to correlation cancellation mechanisms previously suggested to be operative in mammalian cortex. The mechanism for correlation shaping supports population-level filtering of irrelevant distractor stimuli, thereby enhancing the population response to relevant prey and conspecific communication inputs.

The use of expanded criteria donors (ECD) has become a common clinical practice. The objective of the present study was to compare outcomes of patients who underwent kidney transplantation from ECD versus standard criteria donors (SCD). Methods. We studied 1375 adult recipients of kidney transplantations from 792 deceased donors in six Quebec centers between 2003 and 2009. Patient and graft survivals were analyzed using uni- and multivariate methods in regard to the effects of donor and recipient characteristics. ECD were defined per United Network for Organ Sharing: criteria age >60 years of age or age 50 to 59 years with two of three associated risk factors history of cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, or elevated serum creatinine Mean follow-up was 3.5 +/- 2 years. Results. Among the 792 donors, 510 SCD (64%) and 282 ECD (36%) were used for 1375 kidney transplant recipients. ECD had no effect on patient (P = .47) or graft (P = 28) survival. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed female donors (relative risk [RR] 1.75, P = .008), recipient age (RR 1.07, P = .0001), and waiting time be for transplantation (RR 1.000, P = .0001) to be associated with a greater risk of death after transplantation. Donor (RR 1.018, P = .0099) and recipient (RR 1.013, P = .0387) age and recipient waiting time for transplantation (RR 1.000, P = .0048) were also associated with a greater risk of graft loss. Conclusion. The use of SCD or ECD had no impact on patient or graft survival after kidney transplantation. Donor and recipient ages as well as waiting time for transplantation were related to graft loss. Waiting time remains a significant factor affecting outcomes; efforts should aim to decrease this period.	[Carrier, M.; Lize, J.

Quebec-Transplant Programs	Impact of Expanded-Criteria Donors on Patient Survival After Heart, Lung, Liver and Combined Organ Transplantation	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	35th Annual Congress of the Italian-Society-of-Organ-Transplantation (SITO)	OCT 27-29, 2011	Rome, ITALY	Italian Soc Organ Transplantat, Cathol Univ Sch Med Policlinico A. Gemelli, Div Organ Transplantat			GRAFT-SURVIVAL	Background. The age and comorbidities of brain-dead donors have increased throughout the past decade. The use of expanded-criteria donors (ECDs) has become a common clinical practice. The objective of the present study was to compare outcomes of patients who underwent heart, lung, liver, and combined organ transplantations from expanded-versus standard-criteria donors (SCDs). Methods. We studied 867 adult patients who received deceased-donor organs in 6 Quebec centers from 2003 to 2009. Patient survival was analyzed with the use of univariate methods with respect to the effect of donor and recipient characteristics. ECDs were defined according to United Network for Organ Sharing criteria: age >60 years (or 50-59 years with 2 associated risk factors), and history of cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, or elevated serum creatinine. Results. Among the 664 donors, 438 were SCDs (66%) and 226 ECDs (34%). Two-year recipient survival averaged 78 +/- 2% versus 77 +/- 3% in SCD and ECD groups, respectively, following liver; 78 +/- 3% versus 74 +/- 10% after lung 87 +/- 3% versus 72 +/- 12% following heart, and 75 +/- 9% and 67 +/- 19% after combined organ transplantation (P > .05 for all organs). Conclusion. The current definition of SCD and ECD had no effect on patient survival after lung or liver transplantation. There was a trend toward decreased patient survival among heart and combined organ transplant recipients of ECDs. Specific donor critieria should be defined to quantify donor risk factors for each extrarenal organ.

The aim of this article was to critically review the international literature on lexical-semantic processing in aphasia, as tested through the semantic priming paradigm. Specifically, this review focused on aphasia and lexical-semantic processing, the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the semantic paradigms used, and recent evidence from neuroimaging studies on lexical-semantic processing. Furthermore, evidence on dissociations between implicit and explicit lexical-semantic processing reported in the literature will be discussed and interpreted by referring to functional neuroimaging evidence from healthy populations. There is evidence that semantic priming effects can be found both in fluent and in non-fluent aphasias, and that these effects are related to an extensive network which includes the temporal lobe, the pre-frontal cortex, the left frontal gyrus, the left temporal gyrus and the cingulated cortex.

The present study emphasized the importance of distinguishing aspects of awareness in order to determine whether learning is implicit. By decomposing awareness into awareness of contingencies, of the procedure being a learning task, and of the reinforcing stimuli, it was demonstrated that implicit operant learning modulated pain sensitivity. All of these aspects of awareness were demonstrated to not be necessary for learning. Additionally, discrimination of contingencies was not necessary on different levels of processing as demonstrated by a verbal and a behavioral method. It was demonstrated that explicit cognitive processes about one's own behavior, impaired learning, even though these cognitions were not immediately related to the learning process. The results of this study are of special interest in the context of pain, since implicit operant learning can explain the gradual development of hypersensitivity in chronic pain.

Pattern-motion selective responses in MT, MST and the pulvinar of humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dorsal pathway; fMRI; hMT; integration; plaid; V5	VISUAL AREA MT; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; INFERIOR PULVINAR; OPTIC FLOW; NEURONS; INTEGRATION	Plaid stimuli are often used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the integration and segregation of motion information. Considering the perceptual importance of such mechanisms, only a very limited number of visual brain areas have been found to be specifically involved in motion integration. These are the human (h)MT+ complex, area V3 and the pulvinar. The hMT+ complex can be functionally subdivided into two separate areas, middle temporal area (MT) and medial superior temporal area (MST); however, it is currently unclear whether these distinct sub-regions have different responses to plaid stimuli. To address this issue we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the relative response of MT and MST to component and pattern motion. Participants viewed plaid stimuli that were constrained to result in the perception of either component motion (segregation of motion information) or pattern motion (integration of motion information). MT/MST segregation was achieved using a moving dot stimulus that allowed stimulation of each visual hemifield either in unison or separately. We found pattern motion selective responses in both MT and MST. Consistent with previous reports, activity indicative of pattern motion selectivity was also found in the pulvinar as well as in other extrastriate areas. These results demonstrate that MT, MST and the pulvinar are involved in the complex motion integration mechanisms that are triggered by plaid stimuli. This reinforces the concept that integrative computations take place in a distributed neuronal circuit both in cortical and sub-cortical networks.	[Villeneuve, M.

Previously, we identified a PSEN1-binding domain in APP, encompassing half of the transmembrane domain following the amyloid beta (A beta) sequence. Based on this, we designed peptides mimicking this interaction domain with the aim to selectively block APP processing and A beta generation through interfering with enzyme-substrate binding. We identified a peptide sequence that, when fused to a virally derived translocation peptide, significantly lowered A beta production (IC50: 317 nM) in cell-free and cell-based assays using APP-carboxy terminal fragment as a direct gamma-secretase substrate. Being derived from the APP sequence, this inhibitory peptide did not affect Notch Delta E gamma-cleavage, illustrating specificity and potential therapeutic value. In cell-based assays, the peptide strongly suppressed APP shedding, demonstrating that it exerts the inhibitory effect already upstream of gamma-secretase, most likely through steric hindrance.-Esselens, C., Sannerud, R., Gallardo, R., Baert, V., Kaden, D., Serneels, L., De Strooper, B., Rousseau, F., Multhaup, G., Schymkowitz, J., Langedijk, J.

In adversarial multiplayer games, matchmaking typically consists in trying to match together players of similar skill level. However, this is usually based on a single-skill value, and assumes the only factor of "fun" is the game balance. We present a more advanced matchmaking strategy developed for Ghost Recon Online, an upcoming team-focused first-person shooter (FPS) from Ubisoft (Montreal, QC, Canada). We first show how incorporating more information about players than their raw skill can lead to more balanced matches. We also argue that balance is not the only factor that matters, and present a strategy to explicitly maximize the players' fun, taking advantage of a rich player profile that includes information about player behavior and personal preferences. Ultimately, our goal is to ask players to provide direct feedback on match quality through an in-game survey. However, because such data were not available for this study, we rely here on heuristics tailored to this specific game. Experiments on data collected during Ghost Recon Online's beta tests show that neural networks can effectively be used to predict both balance and player enjoyment.

Beginning with a sample of one hundred young females, twenty right handed participants were recruited for the study and assigned to a practice or a control group carefully matched by their general cognitive ability scores. After the first scan, the practice group played 'Professor Layton and The Pandora's Box' 4 h per week during four weeks. A second scan was obtained at the end of practice and intelligence was measured again. Image analyses revealed gray and white matter changes in the practice group. Gray matter changes theoretically relevant for intelligence were observed for the practice group mainly in frontal clusters (Brodmann areas 9 and 10) and also in smaller parietal and temporal regions.

Application of Artificial Neural Networks on North Atlantic Tropical Cyclogenesis Potential Index in Climate Change	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; CYCLONE ACTIVITY; ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES; HIGH-RESOLUTION; 21ST-CENTURY; FREQUENCY; MODELS; GCM; DISTURBANCES; VARIABILITY	A methodology using artificial neural networks is presented to project twenty-first-century changes in North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) genesis potential (GP) in a five-model ensemble of global climate models. Two types of neural networks-the self-organizing maps (SOMs) and the forward-feeding back-propagating neural networks (FBNNs)-were employed. This methodology is demonstrated to be a robust alternative to using GCM output directly for tropical cyclone projections, which generally require high-resolution simulations. By attributing the projected changes to the related environmental variables, Emanuel's revised genesis potential index is used to measure the GP. Changes are identified in the first (P1) and second (P2) half of the twenty-first century. The early and late summer GP decreases in both the P1 and P2 periods over most of the eastern half of the basin and increases off the East Coast of the United States and the north coast of Venezuela during P1. The peak summer GP over the region of frequent TC genesis is projected to decrease more substantially in P1 than in P2. Vertical wind shear (850-200 hPa), temperature (600 hPa), and potential intensity are the most important controls of TC genesis in the North Atlantic basin (NAB) under the changing climate.

J Neurophysiol 108: 1228-1243, 2012. First published June 6, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00840.2011.-From our daily experience, it is very clear that relative motion cues can contribute to correctly identifying object boundaries and perceiving depth. Motion-defined contours are not only generated by the motion of objects in a scene but also by the movement of an observer's head and body (motion parallax). However, the neural mechanism involved in detecting these contours is still unknown. To explore this mechanism, we extracellularly recorded visual responses of area 18 neurons in anesthetized and paralyzed cats. The goal of this study was to determine if motion-defined contours could be detected by neurons that have been previously shown to detect luminance-, texture-, and contrast-defined contours cue invariantly. Motion-defined contour stimuli were generated by modulating the velocity of high spatial frequency sinusoidal luminance gratings (carrier gratings) by a moving squarewave envelope. The carrier gratings were outside the luminance passband of a neuron, such that presence of the carrier alone within the receptive field did not elicit a response. Most neurons that responded to contrast-defined contours also responded to motion-defined contours. The orientation and direction selectivity of these neurons for motion-defined contours was similar to that of luminance gratings. A given neuron also exhibited similar selectivity for the spatial frequency of the carrier gratings of contrast- and motion-defined contours. These results suggest that different second-order contours are detected in a form-cue invariant manner, through a common neural mechanism in area 18.

First published June 27, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00254.2012.-In humans, the control of voluntary movement, in which the corticobasal ganglia (BG) circuitry participates, is mainly lateralized. However, several studies have suggested that both the contralateral and ipsilateral BG systems are implicated during unilateral movement. Bilateral improvement of motor signs in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been reported with unilateral lesion or high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the internal part of the globus pallidus or the subthalamic nucleus (STN-HFS). To decipher the mechanisms of production of ipsilateral movements induced by the modulation of unilateral BG circuitry activity, we recorded left STN neuronal activity during right STN-HFS in PD patients operated for bilateral deep brain stimulation. Left STN single cells were recorded in the operating room during right STN-HFS while patients experienced, or did not experience, right stimulation-induced dyskinesias. Most of the left-side STN neurons (64%) associated with the presence of right dyskinesias were inhibited, with a significant decrease in burst and intraburst frequencies. In contrast, left STN neurons not associated with right dyskinesias were mainly activated (48%), with a predominant increase 4-5 ms after the stimulation pulse and a decrease in oscillatory activity. This suggests that unilateral neuronal STN modulation is associated with changes in the activity of the contralateral STN. The fact that one side of the BG system can influence the functioning of the other could explain the occurrence of bilateral dyskinesias and motor improvement observed in PD patients during unilateral STN-HFS, as a result of a bilateral disruption of the pathological activity in the corticosubcortical circuitry.

Spatial attention enhances the selective integration of activity from area MT. J Neurophysiol 108: 1594-1606, 2012. First published June 13, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00949.2011.-Distinguishing which of the many proposed neural mechanisms of spatial attention actually underlies behavioral improvements in visually guided tasks has been difficult. One attractive hypothesis is that attention allows downstream neural circuits to selectively integrate responses from the most informative sensory neurons. This would allow behavioral performance to be based on the highest-quality signals available in visual cortex. We examined this hypothesis by asking how spatial attention affects both the stimulus sensitivity of middle temporal (MT) neurons and their corresponding correlation with behavior. Analyzing a data set pooled from two experiments involving four monkeys, we found that spatial attention did not appreciably affect either the stimulus sensitivity of the neurons or the correlation between their activity and behavior. However, for those sessions in which there was a robust behavioral effect of attention, focusing attention inside the neuron's receptive field significantly increased the correlation between these two metrics, an indication of selective integration. These results suggest that, similar to mechanisms proposed for the neural basis of perceptual learning, the behavioral benefits of focusing spatial attention are attributable to selective integration of neural activity from visual cortical areas by their downstream targets.

The modulatory influence of end-point controllability on decisions between actions. J Neurophysiol 108: 1764-1780, 2012. First published July 5, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00081.2012.-Recent work has shown that human subjects are able to predict the biomechanical ease of potential reaching movements and use these predictions to influence their choices. Here, we examined how reach decisions are influenced by specific biomechanical factors related to the control of end-point stability, such as aiming accuracy or stopping control. Human subjects made free choices between two potential reaching movements that varied in terms of path distance and biomechanical cost in four separate blocks that additionally varied two constraints: the width of the targets (narrow or wide) and the requirement of stopping in them. When movements were unconstrained (very wide targets and no requirement of stopping), subjects' choices were strongly biased toward directions aligned with the direction of maximal mobility. However, as the movements became progressively constrained, factors related to the control of the end point gained relevance, thus reducing this bias. This demonstrates that, before movement onset, constraints such as stopping and aiming participate in a remarkably adaptive and flexible action selection process that trades off the advantage of moving along directions of maximal mobility for unconstrained movements against exploiting biomechanical anisotropies to facilitate control of end-point stability whenever the movement constraints require it. These results support a view of decision making between motor actions as a highly context-dependent gradual process in which the subjective desirability of potential actions is influenced by their dynamic properties in relation to the intrinsic properties of the motor apparatus.

This study examined children's (7.9 years old) (n = 7) and adults' (n = 10) capacity to generate continuous corrective torque during a progressive perturbation. The experimental task was to maintain an upright quiet standing on a platform that gradually and slowly toes-down tilted to a maximum of 14 degrees without visual cues. The vertical forces applied on the platform and the electromyograms from the tibialis anterior and the gastrocnemius were measured. The results showed that children had a different postural response to the perturbation than adults. When the platform was stationary before the inclination, children shifted their body weight backward whereas adults had a more balanced distribution of their weight. During the inclination, children applied a stronger forward force, suggesting a larger postero-anterior displacement of their body weight. Muscular activities were higher in children for both the tibialis anterior and the gastrocnemius, and their tibialis anterior activation profile was different. In conclusion, this study showed that in children aged from 7 to 10 years old neuromuscular responses were not mature enough to generate continuous postural corrective torque in response to the perturbation.

Silent ischemic lesions in young adults with first stroke are associated with recurrent stroke	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							WHITE-MATTER LESIONS; BRAIN INFARCTS; RISK-FACTORS; CEREBRAL INFARCTION; LACUNAR INFARCTION; ROTTERDAM SCAN; METABOLIC SYNDROME; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; MRI	Objective: To determine the association between silent ischemic lesions (SILs) on baseline brain MRI and recurrent stroke in young adults with first-ever ischemic stroke. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective study of adult patients aged 18-50 years with first-ever ischemic stroke investigated by brain MRI between 2002 and 2009. Silent brain infarcts (SBIs) were defined as focal T2 hyperintensities >= 3 mm without corresponding focal symptoms, and leukoaraiosis was defined as focal, multifocal, or confluent hyperintensities on T2-weighted sequences. The primary outcome was recurrent stroke. A forward stepwise Cox regression model was used to determine whether SILs were independently associated with recurrent stroke. Results: A total of 271 eligible patients were identified in the database: 89 did not undergo MRI imaging and 12 patients had inadequate follow-up, leaving a study population of 170 patients. MRI demonstrated SILs in 48 of 170 (28.2%) patients. No patients had isolated leukoaraiosis. Hypertension (p = 0.049), migraine with aura (p = 0.02), and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.04) were associated with SIL. Mean follow-up duration was 25 +/- 7 months. Among patients with SILs, 11 of 48 (23%) had a recurrent stroke vs 8 of 122 (6.5%) patients without SIL (p = 0.003). After multivariate Cox regression, SILs remained independently associated with recurrent stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-8.6, p = 0.02), as did the combination of SBIs and leukoaraiosis (HR 7.3, 95% CI 2.3-22.9, p = 0.003). Conclusions: In adults <= 50 years old with first-ever ischemic stroke, SILs are common and independently predict recurrent stroke.

Methods: Observational study including review of brain MRI and clinical findings of a cohort of 50 patients with PNH in the temporo-occipital horns and trigones, mutation analysis of the FLNA gene, and anatomopathologic study of a fetal brain. Results: There were 28 females and 22 males. All were sporadic with the exception of an affected mother and son. Epilepsy occurred in 62%, cerebellar signs in 56%, cognitive impairment in 56%, and autism in 12%. Seventy percent were referred within the 3rd year of life. Imaging revealed a normal cerebral cortex in 76% and abnormal cortical folding in 24%. In all patients the hippocampi were under-rotated and in 10% they merged with the heterotopia. Cerebellar dysgenesis was observed in 84% and a hypoplastic corpus callosum in 60%. There was no gender bias or uneven gender distribution of clinical and anatomic severity. No mutations of FLNA occurred in 33 individuals examined. Heterotopia in the fetal brain revealed cytoarchitectonic characteristics similar to those associated with FLNA mutations; cortical pathology was not typical of polymicrogyria. Cerebellar involvement was more severe and the hippocampi appeared simple and under-rotated. Conclusions: This series delineates a malformation complex in which PNH in the trigones and occipito-temporal horns is associated with hippocampal, corpus callosum, and cerebellar dysgenesis.

Pituitary blastoma: a unique embryonal tumor	PITUITARY			English	Article						Pituitary blastoma; Folliculostellate cells; Immunohistochemistry; Ultrastructure; Cushing disease	SPINDLE-CELL-ONCOCYTOMA; FOLLICULO-STELLATE CELLS; CUSHINGS-SYNDROME; ADENOMA; ADENOHYPOPHYSIS; DIFFERENTIATION; INFANT; GLAND; ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD	Pituitary blastoma, a recently described tumor of the neonatal pituitary, exhibits differentiation to Rathke epithelium and adenohypophysial cells of folliculostellate and secretory type, a reflection of arrested pituitary development and unchecked proliferation (Scheithauer et al. in Acta Neuropathol 116(6):657-666, 2008). Herein, we report the pathologic features of three additional cases, all ACTH-producing. One involved a 9-month-old male presenting with progressive right ophthalmoplegia, MRI findings of a large suprasellar mass with cavernous sinus invasion, and elevated plasma ACTH levels. The second was nonfunctioning and occurred in a 13-month-old female with right third nerve palsy. The third had been previously published as a "pituitary adenoma" in a 2-year-old female (Min et al. in Pathol Int 57(9):600-605, 2007). The subtotally resected tumors were subject to histochemical, immunohistochemical and, in two cases, ultrastructural study. Histologically, the complex tumors consisted of glands of varying from rosettes to glandular structures resembling Rathke epithelium, small undifferentiated-appearing cells (blastema), and large secretory cells. Mucin-producing goblet cells were noted in case 3. Cell proliferation was high in two cases and low in case 3. Immunoreactivity of the secretory cells included synaptophysin, chromogranin, various keratins and, to a lesser extent, ACTH and beta endorphin. MGMT immunolabeling was 40-60%. Mitotic activity was moderate to high in cases 1 and 2 and was low in case 3. The same was true for MIB-1 labeling. Germ cell markers were lacking in all cases. One tumor ultrastructurally consisted of three cell populations including (a) small, polyhedral, primitive-appearing cells (blastema) with scant cytoplasm, abundant glycogen and few organelles, (b) folliculostellate cells and (c) large corticotroph cells containing rough endoplasmic reticulum, golgi membranes, spherical, 150-400 nm secretory granules and occasional perinuclear, intermediate filament bundles. A second example (case 3) lacked a blastema and glandular component. The clinical and morphologic features of our three cases were those of pituitary blastoma. The finding of cellular elements of adenohypophysial development is consistent with a diagnosis of pituitary blastoma and aligns it with blastomas of other organs. It also suggests an underlying specific genetic abnormality. Marked variations in cellular proliferative activity suggest blastomas occur in low- and higher-grade form. Variable MGMT reactivity suggests an incomplete response to temozolomide therapy. Literature regarding similar morphologically complex, infantile, Cushing disease-associated lesions is briefly reviewed.

Impact performance of ice hockey helmets: head acceleration versus focal force dispersion	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART P-JOURNAL OF SPORTS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Impact biomechanics; load distribution; head injury; helmets; concussion	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CONCUSSION; FOOTBALL; SPORT	Modern sport helmets certified to various international safety standards have virtually eliminated the incidence of cranial fracture and fatal brain injury in contact sports; however, the occurrence of diffuse brain injuries (mTBI) are still prevalent. Local contact mechanics between the colliding surface (helmet/head) need to be considered as global measures of acceleration and are insensitive to load distribution measures which are indicative of helmet performance. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the ability to capture localized load distribution response between the helmet and headform and to examine factors that may influence these measures. Twenty-five flexible force sensors were arranged in a 5 x 5 array about three impact sites (front, side, rear) of a 575 mm EN960 headform. Test factors included helmet model (5), impact location (3) and temperature (21 degrees C, -25 degrees C) as well as repeated impacts (3). Testing procedure followed the CSA Z262.1-09 standard at the defined locations. Average error calculated during sensor calibration was 2.8 +/- 1% with an R-2 value of 0.987 +/- 0.009. As expected, peak global force correlated well to peak acceleration (R-2 = 0.98) but weakly corresponded to peak focal force (R-2 = 0.22). Furthermore, both load distribution magnitudes and patterns were found to vary substantially with mixed effects between helmet models, impact locations, and temperatures. Given these findings, this novel approach may be used to quantify local contact mechanics between the colliding surface/helmet/head.

HFOs may be encountered under physiological or under pathological conditions (pHFO). Here we review the underlying mechanisms of oscillations, at the level of cells and networks, investigated in a variety of experimental in vitro and in vivo models. Diverse mechanisms are described, from intrinsic membrane oscillations to network processes involving different types of synaptic interactions, gap junctions and ephaptic coupling. HFOs with similar frequency ranges can differ considerably in their physiological mechanisms. The fact that in most cases the combination of intrinsic neuronal membrane oscillations and synaptic circuits are necessary to sustain network oscillations is emphasized. Evidence for pathological HFOs, particularly fast ripples, in experimental models of epilepsy and in human epileptic patients is scrutinized. The underlying mechanisms of fast ripples are examined both in the light of animal observations, in vivo and in vitro, and in epileptic patients, with emphasis on single cell dynamics. Experimental observations and computational modeling have led to hypotheses for these mechanisms, several of which are considered here, namely the role of out-of-phase firing in neuronal clusters, the importance of strong excitatory AMPA-synaptic currents and recurrent inhibitory connectivity in combination with the fast time scales of IPSPs, ephaptic coupling and the contribution of interneuronal coupling through gap junctions. The statistical behaviour of fast ripple events can provide useful information on the underlying mechanism and can help to further improve classification of the diverse forms of HFOs.

However, because of the deluge of multichannel data generated by these experiments, achieving the full potential of parallel neuronal recordings depends on the development of new data mining techniques to extract meaningful information relating to time, frequency and space. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for measurement of HFO and new analysis tools for their quantitative assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and potentially productive future directions. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in clinical epilepsy	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Epilepsy; Ripple; Fast ripple; EEG; Seizure; Infantile spasms	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SEIZURE ONSET ZONE; INTERICTAL SPIKES; 80-500 HZ; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FOCAL EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INVASIVE RECORDINGS	Epilepsy is one of the most frequent neurological diseases. In focal medically refractory epilepsies, successful surgical treatment largely depends on the identification of epileptogenic zone. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 80 and 500 Hz, which can be recorded with EEG, may be novel markers of the epileptogenic zone. This review discusses the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. HFOs are clearly linked to the seizure onset zone, and the surgical removal of regions generating them correlates with a seizure free post-surgical outcome. Moreover, HFOs reflect the seizure-generating capability of the underlying tissue, since they are more frequent after the reduction of antiepileptic drugs. They can be successfully used in pediatric epilepsies such as epileptic spasms and help to understand the generation of this specific type of seizures. While mostly recorded on intracranial EEGs, new studies suggest that identification of HFOs on scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is possible as well. Thus not only patients with refractory epilepsies and invasive recordings but all patients might profit from the analysis of HFOs. Despite these promising results, the analysis of HFOs is not a routine clinical procedure; most results are derived from relatively small cohorts of patients and many aspects are not yet fully understood. Thus the review concludes that even if HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptic tissue, there are still uncertainties about mechanisms of generation, methods of analysis, and clinical applicability. Large multicenter prospective studies are needed prior to widespread clinical application. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Frontotemporal Dementia in a Brazilian Kindred With the C9orf72 Mutation	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; ALS; NEURODEGENERATION; FTD	Objectives: To describe the clinical features of a Brazilian kindred with C9orf72 frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and compare them with other described families with C9orf72 and frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing mutations. Design: Report of a kindred. Setting: Dementia center at a university hospital. Patients: One kindred encompassing 3 generations. Results: The presence of a hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) expansion in C9orf72 was confirmed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot. The observed phenotypes were behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia, with significant variability in age at onset and duration of disease. Parkinsonian features with focal dystonia, visual hallucinations, and more posterior atrophy on neuroimaging than is typical for frontotemporal dementia were seen. Conclusions: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia due to C9orf72 expansion displays some phenotypic heterogeneity and may be associated with hallucinations, parkinsonism, focal dystonia, and posterior brain atrophy. Personality changes may precede the diagnosis of dementia by many years and may be a distinguishing feature of this mutation. Arch Neurol. 2012; 69(9): 1149-1153.

C9orf72 Hexanucleotide Repeat Expansions as the Causative Mutation for Chromosome 9p21-Linked Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							LOBAR DEGENERATION; DIAGNOSIS; ALS; DISORDERS; CRITERIA; LOCUS; GENE; FTD; 9P	Objective: To further assess the presence of a large hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene identified as the genetic cause of chromosome 9p21-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (c9ALS/FTD) in 4 unrelated families with a conclusive linkage to c9ALS/FTD. Design: Arepeat-primed polymerase chain reaction assay. Setting: Academic research. Participants: Affected and unaffected individuals from 4 ALS/FTD families. Main Outcome Measure: The amplified C9orf72 repeat expansion. Results: We show that the repeat is expanded in and segregated perfectly with the disease in these 4 pedigrees. Conclusion: Our findings further confirm the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion as the causative mutation for c9ALS/FTD and strengthen the hypothesis that ALS and FTD belong to the same disease spectrum.

A 42-year-old man presented to our outpatient orthopedic clinic 7 days after a fall during a hockey game whereby another player's skate blade struck the patient directly in the axilla without disrupting the skin. The patient denied having any symptoms of shoulder dislocation but experienced some pain and numbness, which subsided rapidly. Then he developed a cool hand with exertional claudication. Physical examination revealed absent radial and brachial pulses. Computed tomographic angiography demonstrated dissection of the distal axillary artery extending to the middle two-thirds of the brachial artery. Following urgent consultation with vascular surgery, the patient was treated operatively with reverse saphenous interpositional grafting and embolectomy. This case illustrates the need to have a heightened index of suspicion to all injuries to the axilla and the importance of performing careful soft tissue and neurovascular examinations in hockey players presenting with shoulder complaints, even when bony injury is not present.

Given that membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a plasma membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase, is a glycoprotein strongly expressed in radioresistant and chemoresistant glioblastoma that mediates pro-apoptotic signalling in brain cancer cells, we investigated whether MT1-MMP could also signal autophagy. Among the four lectins tested, we found that the mannopyranoside/glucopyranoside-binding ConA, which is also well documented to trigger MT1-MMP expression, increases autophagic acidic vacuoles formation as demonstrated by Acridine Orange cell staining. Although siRNA-mediated MT1-MMP gene silencing effectively reversed ConA-induced autophagy, inhibition of the MT1-MMP extracellular catalytic function with Actinonin or Ilomastat did not. Conversely, direct overexpression of the recombinant Wt-MT1-MMP protein triggered proMMP-2 activation and green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 puncta indicative of autophagosomes formation, while deletion of MT1-MMP's cytoplasmic domain disabled such autophagy induction. ConA-treated U87 cells also showed an upregulation of BNIP3 and of autophagy-related gene members autophagy-related protein 3, autophagy-related protein 12 and autophagy-related protein 16-like 1, where respective inductions were reversed when MT1-MMP gene expression was silenced. Altogether, we provide molecular evidence supporting the pro-autophagic mechanism of action of ConA in glioblastoma cells. We also highlight new signal transduction functions of MT1-MMP within apoptotic and autophagic pathways that often characterize cancer cell responses to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Rictor regulates phosphorylation of the novel protein kinase C Apl II in Aplysia sensory neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Aplysia; phosphorylation; protein kinase C; Rictor; synaptic plasticity; target of rapamycin complex 2	INTERMEDIATE-TERM FACILITATION; MOTIF PHOSPHORYLATION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; MTOR COMPLEX; AGC KINASES; PKC-ALPHA; ACTIVATION; AKT; TOR; GROWTH	J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 11081117. Abstract Rapamycin-insensitive companion of TOR (Rictor) is a conserved component of target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2), a complex implicated in phosphorylation of a number of signal transduction-related kinases, including protein kinase Cs (PKCs) at their hydrophobic site in the carboxy-terminal extension domain. In the marine mollusk, Aplysia californica, an increase in phosphorylation of the novel PKC, Apl II, at the hydrophobic site is associated with a protein synthesis-dependent increase in synaptic strength seen after continuous application of serotonin. To determine if Rictor plays a role in this increase, we cloned the Aplysia ortholog of Rictor (ApRictor). An siRNA-mediated decrease in ApRictor levels in Aplysia sensory neurons led to a decrease in the phosphorylation of PKC Apl II at the hydrophobic site suggesting a role for ApRictor in hydrophobic site phosphorylation. However, over-expression of ApRictor was not sufficient to increase phosphorylation of PKC Apl II. Continuous application of serotonin increased phosphorylation of PKC Apl II at the hydrophobic site in cultured sensory neurons, and this was blocked by Torin, which inhibits both TORC1 and TORC2. Over-expression of ApRictor did not lead to change in the magnitude of serotonin-mediated phosphorylation, but did lead to a small increase in the membrane localization of phosphorylated PKC Apl II. In conclusion, these studies implicate Rictor in phosphorylation of a novel PKC during synaptic plasticity and suggest an additional role for Rictor in regulating the localization of PKCs.

Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthase gene NMNAT1 encoding nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 in eight families with LCA, including the family in which LCA was originally linked to the LCA9 locus. Notably, all individuals with NMNAT1 mutations also have macular colobomas, which are severe degenerative entities of the central retina (fovea) devoid of tissue and photoreceptors. Functional assays of the proteins encoded by the mutant alleles identified in our study showed that the mutations reduce the enzymatic activity of NMNAT1 in NAD biosynthesis and affect protein folding. Of note, recent characterization of the slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(s)) mouse model, in which prolonged axonal survival after injury is observed, identified NMNAT1 as a neuroprotective protein when ectopically expressed. Our findings identify a new disease mechanism underlying LCA and provide the first link between endogenous NMNAT1 dysfunction and a human nervous system disorder.

Though not many people would disagree with the proposition that sexual behaviour depends on the brain, the neuroscientific study of human sex is still relatively taboo and much remains to be discovered. On the contrary, excellent experimental animal models (mostly rat) are available that have uncovered major behavioural, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical characteristics of sexual behaviour. Restructuring sexual behaviour into broader terms reflecting behavioural states (wanting, liking, and inhibition) facilitates species comparison, revealing many similarities between animal and human sexual pleasure cycles, some of which can serve as potential avenues of new human sex research. In particular, behavioural and brain evidence clearly shows that motivational and consummatory phases are fundamentally distinct, and that genitally-induced sexual reward is a major factor in sexual learning mechanisms.

The goal of this study was to prospectively examine the effect on cognitive outcome of a neuroprotective agent used as adjunctive therapy during treatment of the spasms. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, patients received a standardized therapy plus flunarizine or placebo. The standardized treatment consisted of vigabatrin as first-line therapy. Nonresponders were switched to intramuscular synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (sACTH depot) after 2 weeks and, if necessary, to topiramate after two additional weeks. The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) and Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) were used as outcome measures 24 months after the intervention. Key Findings: Sixty-eight of 101 children diagnosed over 3 years in seven centers in Canada received either adjunctive flunarizine or placebo. Sixty-five of the 68 children (96%) became spasm-free within 8 weeks and no late relapse occurred. Bayley and Vineland results were available at baseline and at 24 months in 45 children. There was no significant difference in the BSID developmental quotient between the flunarizine- and placebo-treated children at baseline (44.3 +/- 35.5 vs. 30.9 +/- 29.8; p = 0.18) or 24 months later (56.9 +/- 33.3 vs. 46 +/- 34.2; p = 0.29). However, the 10 flunarizine-treated children with no identified etiology had a better outcome than the eight controls at 24 months on both the Vineland Scale (84.1 +/- 11.3 vs. 72.3 +/- 9.8; p = 0.03) and the Bayley Scale (87.6 +/- 14.7 vs. 69.9 +/- 25.3; p = 0.07). Significance: Our study failed to demonstrate a protective effect of flunarizine on cognitive outcome in a cohort of children with IS. An analysis of subgroups suggested that flunarizine may further improve cognitive outcome in children with no identified etiology.

Methods: We selected patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, n = 32), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE, n = 14), and posterior quadrant epilepsy (PQE, n = 20) from our 3 Tesla EEG-fMRI database. We applied group analysis upon the blood oxygenlevel dependent (BOLD) response associated with focal IEDs. Key Findings: Patients with TLE and FLE showed activations and deactivations, whereas in PQE only deactivations occurred. In TLE and FLE, the largest activation was in the midcingulate gyri bilaterally. In FLE, activations were also found in the ipsilateral frontal operculum, thalamus, and internal capsule, and in the contralateral cerebellum, whereas in TLE, we found additional activations in the ipsilateral mesial and neocortical temporal regions, insula, and cerebellar cortex. All three groups showed deactivations in default mode network regions, the most widespread being in the TLE group, and less in PQE and FLE. Significance: These results indicate that different epileptic syndromes result in unique and widespread networks related to focal IEDs. Default mode regions are deactivated in response to focal discharges in all three groups with syndrome specific pattern. We conclude that focal IEDs are associated with specific networks of widespread metabolic changes that may cause more substantial disturbance to brain function than might be appreciated from the focal nature of the scalp EEG discharges.

We also introduce an US vessel appearance simulator that generates vessel images similar in appearance to that acquired with US from MR angiography data. Our registration uses the minimum amount of preprocessing to extract vessels from the raw volumetric images. This prevents the removal of important registration information and minimizes the introduction of artifacts that may affect robustness, while reducing the amount of extraneous information in the image to be processed, thus improving the convergence speed of the algorithm. We then completed 3 rounds of validation for our vessel registration method for robustness and accuracy using (i) a large number of synthetic trials generated with our US vessel simulator, (ii) US images acquired from a real physical phantom made from polyvinyl alcohol cryogel, and (iii) real clinical data gathered intra-operatively from 3 patients. Resulting target registration errors (TRE) of less than 2.5 mm are achieved in more than 90 % of the synthetic trials when the initial TREs are less than 20 mm. TREs of less than 2 mm were achieved when the technique was applied to the physical phantom, and TREs of less than 3 mm were achieved on clinical data. These test trials show that the proposed algorithm is not only accurate but also highly robust to noise and missing vessel segments when working with US images acquired in a wide range of real-world conditions.

Currently, this is done by manual inspection of multiple potential electrode trajectories on MR-imaging data. We propose and validate a method for computer-assisted DBS trajectory planning. Our framework integrates multi-modal MRI analysis (T1w, SWI, TOF-MRA) to compute suitable DBS trajectories that optimize the avoidance of specific critical brain structures. A cylinder model is used to process each trajectory and to evaluate complex surgical constraints described via a combination of binary and fuzzy segmented datasets. The framework automatically aggregates the multiple constraints into a unique ranking of recommended low-risk trajectories. Candidate trajectories are represented as a few well-defined cortical entry patches of best-ranked trajectories and presented to the neurosurgeon for final trajectory selection. The proposed algorithm permits a search space containing over 8,000 possible trajectories to be processed in less than 20 s. A retrospective analysis on 14 DBS cases of patients with severe Parkinson's disease reveals that our framework can improve the simultaneous optimization of many pre-formulated surgical constraints. Furthermore, all automatically computed trajectories were evaluated by two neurosurgeons, were judged suitable for surgery and, in many cases, were judged preferable or equivalent to the manually planned trajectories used during the operation. This work provides neurosurgeons with an intuitive and flexible decision-support system that allows objective and patient-specific optimization of DBS lead trajectories, which should improve insertion safety and reduce surgical time.

We report a Caucasian patient with a clinical history of HSAN, most consistent with subtype 1, whose progressive, destructive bone changes of the foot were not only controlled but to a degree reversed by the administration of bisphosphonates (Alendronate) and vitamin D (Colecalciferol). The authors believe that combined bisphosphonate and vitamin D therapy is the treatment of choice for progressive bony changes in HSAN1. This therapy may be beneficial in other neuropathic osteoarthropathies and possibly osteolytic bone disorders.	[Marik, I.

Using an automated image analysis pipeline, 33 regional cortical thickness and 15 regional volumes measures from MRI images were determined in 121 subjects with MCI, 121 patients with AD, and 113 controls from AddNeuroMed study. Correlations with years of schooling were determined and more highly and less highly educated subjects compared, controlling for intracranial volume, age, gender, country of origin, cognitive status, and multiple testing. After controlling for confounding factors and multiple testing, in the control group, subjects with more education had larger regional cortical thickness in transverse temporal cortex, insula, and isthmus of cingulate cortex than subjects with less education. However, in the AD group, the subjects with more education had smaller regional cortical thickness in temporal gyrus, inferior and superior parietal gyri, and lateral occipital cortex than the subjects with less education. No significant difference was found in the MCI group. Education may increase regional cortical thickness in healthy controls, leading to increased brain reserve, as well as helping AD patients to cope better with the effects of brain atrophy by increasing cognitive reserve.

J	Perry, JC; Bond, M				Perry, J. Christopher; Bond, Michael			Change in Defense Mechanisms During Long-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy and Five-Year Outcome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PERSONALITY-DISORDERS; IMPROVEMENT; ANXIETY; STYLES	Objective: Research suggests that defense mechanisms may underlie other aspects of functioning and psychiatric symptoms. The authors examined whether defenses change in accordance with the hierarchy of defense adaptation during long-term dynamic psychotherapy and whether such change is associated with long-term outcomes on other measures. Method: Twenty-one adults with depressive, anxiety, and/or personality disorders entered long-term dynamic psychotherapy (mean=248 weeks) and subsequent follow-along (mean duration, 5.1 years). Measures of functioning and symptoms were gathered in periodic follow-along interviews, external to the therapy. A median of eight psychotherapy sessions over 2.5 years for each participant were rated using the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales quantitative method. Results: Overall, the lowest (action) and highest (high adaptive) defense levels in the hierarchy of defenses improved significantly, as did overall defensive functioning (median effect size=0.71, 95% CI=0.01-1.83). Overall defensive functioning still remained below the healthy-neurotic range. A higher number of axis I disorders and childhood histories of sexual abuse and witnessing violence were associated with a slower rate of improvement in defenses. Change in defenses within therapy by 2.5 years was highly associated with significant levels of change at 5 years in external measures of both functioning (r(s)=0.60) and symptoms (r(s)=0.58), controlling for initial levels. Conclusions: Change in defensive functioning in long-term psychotherapy largely follows the hierarchy of defense adaptation. The relationship to long-term improvement in outcomes suggests that defenses be considered candidates for mediating improvement in functioning and symptoms.	[Perry, J.

These two features provide novel properties to these compounds. Although plasmalogens represent up to 20% of the total phospholipid mass in humans their physiological roles have been challenging to identify, and are likely to be particular to different tissues, metabolic processes and developmental stages. Their biosynthesis starts in peroxisomes, and defects at these steps cause the malformation syndrome, Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata (RCDP). The RCDP phenotype predicts developmental roles for plasmalogens in bone, brain, lens, lung, kidney and heart. Recent studies have revealed secondary plasmalogen deficiencies associated with more common disorders and allow us to tease out additional pathways dependent on plasmalogen functions.

Ammonia-Lowering Strategies for the Treatment of Hepatic Encephalopathy	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; ORNITHINE-L-ASPARTATE; PORTAL-SYSTEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SPHERICAL CARBON ADSORBENT; CHAIN AMINO-ACIDS; UREA-CYCLE DISORDERS; DOUBLE-BLIND; BRAIN EDEMA; THERAPEUTIC-EFFICACY	Hyperammonemia leads to neurotoxic levels of brain ammonia and is a major factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Ammonia-lowering treatments primarily involve two strategies: inhibiting ammonia production and/or increasing ammonia removal. Targeting the gut has been the primary focus for many years, with the goal of inhibiting the generation of ammonia. However, in the context of liver failure, extrahepatic organs containing ammonia metabolic pathways have become new potential ammonia-lowering targets. Skeletal muscle has the capacity to remove ammonia by producing glutamine through the enzyme glutamine synthetase (amidation of glutamate) and, given its large mass, has the potential to be an important ammonia-removing organ. On the other hand, glutamine can be deaminated to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase, thus releasing ammonia (ammonia rebound). Therefore, new treatment strategies are being focused on stimulating the removal of both ammonia and glutamine.

It is highly symptomatic and associated with significant impairment. This review examines the role of stimulant medications in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD. Published clinical studies that compared methylphenidate- and amfetamine-based stimulants in children and adolescents with ADHD support the therapeutic utility of stimulant treatments, and suggest robust efficacy and acceptable safety outcomes in groups treated with either stimulant. Evidence-based guidelines agree that each patient with ADHD is unique and individual treatment strategies that incorporate both drug and non-drug treatment options should be sought. In seeking to optimize individual response and outcomes to stimulant therapy, important considerations include the selection of stimulant class, the choice of long- or short-acting stimulant formulations, addressing effectively any emergent adverse effects and strategies aimed at enhancing adherence to dosing regimen and persistence on therapy.

Williams syndrome: a relationship between genetics, brain morphology and behaviour	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						cortical surface; cortical volume; gyrification; radial-unit hypothesis; structural magnetic resonance imaging; Williams syndrome	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL THICKNESS ANALYSIS; WHITE-MATTER; BEUREN SYNDROME; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; LOCAL GYRIFICATION; SURFACE-AREA; NEURAL BASIS; MRI DATA; CHILDREN	Background Genetically Williams syndrome (WS) promises to provide essential insight into the pathophysiology of cortical development because its similar to 28 deleted genes are crucial for cortical neuronal migration and maturation. Phenotypically, WS is one of the most puzzling childhood neurodevelopmental disorders affecting most intellectual deficiencies (i.e. low-moderate intelligence quotient, visuospatial deficits) yet relatively preserving what is uniquely human (i.e. language and social-emotional cognition). Therefore, WS provides a privileged setting for investigating the relationship between genes, brain and the consequent complex human behaviour. Methods We used in vivo anatomical magnetic resonance imaging analysing cortical surface-based morphometry, (i.e. surface area , cortical volume , cortical thickness , gyrification index ) and cortical complexity , which is of particular relevance to the WS genotypephenotype relationship in 22 children (2.2714.6 years) to compare whole hemisphere and lobar surface-based morphometry between WS (n = 10) and gender/age matched normal controls healthy controls (n = 12). Results Compared to healthy controls, WS children had a (1) relatively preserved Cth; (2) significantly reduced SA and CV; (3) significantly increased GI mostly in the parietal lobe; and (4) decreased CC specifically in the frontal and parietal lobes. Conclusion Our findings are then discussed with reference to the Rakic radial-unit hypothesis of cortical development, arguing that WS gene deletions may spare Cth yet affecting the number of founder cells/columns/radial units, hence decreasing the SA and CV. In essence, cortical brain structure in WS may be shaped by gene-dosage abnormalities.

A retrospective analysis of eight callosotomized patients for ventricular tumors (three males/five females; mean age: 48.7 +/- A 11.2 years; education level: 11.9 +/- A 2.9 years) and eight healthy subjects was performed. An extensive neuropsychological test battery was used to evaluate global intellectual efficiency, memory capacities, executive functions, and interhemispheric transfer of a procedural learning task (serial reaction time task/SRTT). Neuropsychological results showed that: (1) five of eight patients operated through a middle transcallosal approach had disturbances of verbal or visual memory; (2) three of eight patients displayed a dysexecutive cognitive syndrome (two of eight of whom presenting with a deficit of verbal fluency); (3) two of eight patients presented a dysexecutive behavior syndrome; and (4) with regard to the SRTT, although all participants learned the task, in contrast to controls, the callosotomized patients showed an increase in reaction times and an absence of interhemispheric transfer of learning from one hand to the other. The transcallosal approach transects a large number of callosal fibers. This damage accounts for the deficits of memory, the dysexecutive cognitive and behavioral syndrome, and disturbances in interhemispheric transfer of learning.

We examined neurological participants' performance on repeated administrations of the IGT over the course of 6 years. We found that, while non-neurological participants showed considerable improvement due to practice effects on the IGT, patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) damage persisted in showing impaired performance on each retest. These results validate the clinical observations that VMPFC dysfunction does not appear to be subject to autonomous recovery over time in real-life.

J	Touyz, LZG; Dent, M				Touyz, Louis Z. G.; Dent, M.			Prophylaxis of impacted teeth using MRI and focal Ultra-sound ablation? ... A feasible hypothesis	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							FOCUSED ULTRASOUND; BRAIN-TUMORS	Teeth start as bi-layered epithelial soft tissue follicles within bony jaws. Follicles grow into teeth and erupt. Early third molar follicles are detectable 8-9 years (+/- 9 months). Intra-oral dental arches of jaws have finite space accommodating formed crowns. The last teeth to erupt are third molars. When the space needed by all the teeth exceeds the total arch space available, wisdom teeth may become impacted in bone. Lower impactions are more prevalent due to the mandible shape, and impaction associated pathologies with erupting partially or totally impacted teeth are common. Impacted third molars are universally prevalent from 17 to 23 years. Third molar impactions are sources of infection, pain, cyst formation and contribute to malocclusions and other pathologies. Surgical removal of third molars is traumatic, invasive and painful and may produce complicating morbidities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to locate lesions with clear definition and accurate targeting, both in soft and hard tissue organs. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is used to ablate hard and soft tissue structures and stops growth of targeted pathologies. For example, FUS is used to ablate CNS brain tumours, cell causing Parkinson's disease, prostatic growths and thrombolysis in strokes. Hypothesis: Modern imaging techniques, like MRI, can accurately locate third molar follicles at age 9, before wisdom teeth form and grow. MRI in combination with FUS could be used to ablate follicles of third molars, stop tooth growth (both crown and root) and so avoid later impactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Antidepressants targeting these high-affinity transporters, however, do not provide positive treatment outcomes for all patients. Other monoamine transport systems, with lower affinity, have been detected in the brain, but their role is largely unknown. Here we report that OCT2, a member of the polyspecific organic cation transporter (OCT) family, is expressed notably in the limbic system and implicated in anxiety and depression-related behaviors in the mouse. Genetic deletion of OCT2 in mice produced a significant reduction in brain tissue concentrations of NE and 5-HT and in ex vivo uptake of both these neurotransmitters in the presence of the dual 5-HT-NE transport blocker, venlafaxine. In vivo clearance of NE and 5-HT evaluated using microiontophoretic electrophysiology was diminished in the hippocampus of OCT2(-/-) mice in the presence of venlafaxine, thereby affecting postsynaptic neuronal activity. OCT2(-/-) mice displayed an altered sensitivity to acute treatments with NE- and/or 5-HT-selective transport blockers in the forced-swim test. Moreover, the mutant mice were insensitive to long-term venlafaxine treatment in a more realistic, corticosterone-induced, chronic depression model. Our findings identify OCT2 as an important postsynaptic determinant of aminergic tonus and mood-related behaviors and a potential pharmacological target for mood disorders therapy.

NeuroTouch: A Physics-Based Virtual Simulator for Cranial Microneurosurgery Training	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Computer simulation; Craniotomy; Neurosurgery; Teaching; Training	BRAIN-TISSUE; IN-VIVO; VENTRICULOSTOMY SIMULATION; LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY; REALITY SIMULATION; HAPTIC FEEDBACK; SOFT-TISSUE; NEUROSURGERY; ENVIRONMENT; MODEL	BACKGROUND: A virtual reality neurosurgery simulator with haptic feedback may help in the training and assessment of technical skills requiring the use of tactile and visual cues. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simulator for craniotomy-based procedures with haptic and graphics feedback for implementation by universities and hospitals in the neurosurgery training curriculum. METHODS: NeuroTouch was developed by a team of more than 50 experts from the National Research Council Canada in collaboration with surgeons from more than 20 teaching hospitals across Canada. Its main components are a stereovision system, bimanual haptic tool manipulators, and a high-end computer. The simulation software engine runs 3 processes for computing graphics, haptics, and mechanics. Training tasks were built from magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients with brain tumors. RESULTS: Two training tasks were implemented for practicing skills with 3 different surgical tools. In the tumor-debulking task, the objective is complete tumor removal without removing normal tissue, using the regular surgical aspirator (suction) and the ultrasonic aspirator. The objective of the tumor cauterization task is to remove a vascularized tumor with an aspirator while controlling blood loss using bipolar electrocautery. CONCLUSION: NeuroTouch prototypes have been set up in 7 teaching hospitals across Canada, to be used for beta testing and validation and evaluated for integration in a neurosurgery training curriculum.

Materials and Methods Ninety rats were used; six as normal controls and the remaining 84 were divided as follows: Six paraplegic controls, 6 paraplegic-vehicle controls, and the remaining 72 divided into two equal groups. Group 1 was divided into six subgroups; Pregabalin was given in doses of 10?mg/kg, 20?mg/kg, or 30?mg/kg for 1 or 2 weeks. Group 2 was similarly subdivided; Lamotrigine was given in doses of 1.5?mg/kg, 3?mg/kg, or 6?mg/kg for 1 or 2 weeks. Results All paraplegic controls developed NDO within 3 weeks from spinalization. Their baseline bladder pressure (BBP) 19?+/-?4.4?cmH2O, detrusor pressure at maximum capacity (DPMaxC) 47.6?+/-?4.3?cmH2O, bladder capacity (BC) 0.45?+/-?0.1?ml, and frequency of detrusor overactivity (FDO) 3.7?+/-?0.9/min. Both Pregabalin and Lamotrigine produced significant improvement. Urodynamic values in those treated with 20?mg Pregabalin for 1 or 2 weeks were: BBP 11.7?+/-?1.3 and 9?+/-?0.2?cmH2O, BC 0.6?+/-?0.1 and 0.7?+/-?0.01?ml, DPMaxC 17.3?+/-?4.0 and 23?+/-?2.6?cmH2O, FDO 2.1?+/-?0.2/min and 1.7?+/-?0.1/min. Urodynamic values in those treated with 3?mg/kg Lamotrigine for 1 or 2 weeks were: BBP 9.7?+/-?2.2 and 8.6?+/-?1.9?cmH2O, DPMaxC 17.2?+/-?1.8 and 29?+/-?1.2?cmH2O, BC 0.7?+/-?0.1 and 0.8?+/-?0.1?ml, FDO 1.9?+/-?0.2/min and 1.9?+/-?0.2/min (P?<?0.001). Conclusions Pregabalin and Lamotrigine may represent novel alternative treatments of NDO. Clinical trials remain to be performed. Neurourol. Urodynam. 31:11971202, 2012.

Immunohistochemical Evidence of Dysregulation of the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Pathway in Primary and Metastatic Pheochromocytomas	UROLOGY			English	Article							PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; GLAND SCALED SCORE; MALIGNANT PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA; MTOR PATHWAY; CELLS; CARCINOMAS; EVEROLIMUS; THERAPY; MEMBERS	OBJECTIVE To characterize the status of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from patients with primary and metastatic pheochromocytoma. METHODS Tissue microarrays were built from 19 normal adrenal medullas, 39 primary pheochromocytomas, and 8 unrelated metastatic pheochromocytomas. In 2 of the 8 cases of metastatic pheochromocytoma tissues, samples from the primary tumor were available. The expression levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated S6, p27, and c-myc were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS The levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and p27 were greater in the nontumor tissue than in the primary and metastatic pheochromocytomas. Increasing levels of phosphorylated Akt were noted in the nontumor adrenal medulla, primary pheochromocytomas, and metastatic pheochromocytomas. Finally, the levels of phosphorylated S6 were greater in the metastatic pheochromocytomas than in the nontumor adrenal medulla and primary pheochromocytomas. CONCLUSION We found evidence of dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in primary and metastatic pheochromocytomas, with increased phosphorylated S6 and phosphorylated Akt, and decreased phosphatase and tensin homolog and p27 expression levels. Because the currently available treatment modalities are less than optimal, our findings lend additional support to continuing to explore the utility of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway-targeted therapy for pheochromocytomas.

Here, we investigated clinical and biological impacts of histone H3.3 mutations. Forty-two DIPGs were tested for H3.3 mutations. Wild-type versus mutated (K27M-H3.3) subgroups were compared for HIST1H3B, IDH, ATRX and TP53 mutations, copy number alterations and clinical outcome. K27M-H3.3 occurred in 71 %, TP53 mutations in 77 % and ATRX mutations in 9 % of DIPGs. ATRX mutations were more frequent in older children (p < 0.0001). No G34V/R-H3.3, IDH1/2 or H3.1 mutations were identified. K27M-H3.3 DIPGs showed specific copy number changes, including all gains/amplifications of PDGFRA and MYC/PVT1 loci. Notably, all long-term survivors were H3.3 wild type and this group of patients had better overall survival. K27M-H3.3 mutation defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups and is prevalent in DIPG, which will impact future therapeutic trial design. K27M- and G34V-H3.3 have location-based incidence (brainstem/cortex) and potentially play distinct roles in pediatric GBM pathogenesis. K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival. Based on prognostic and therapeutic implications, our findings argue for H3.3-mutation testing at diagnosis, which should be rapidly integrated into the clinical decision-making algorithm, particularly in atypical DIPG.

Methods The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics, or SLICC, performed a prospective inception cohort study. Demographic variables, global SLE disease activity (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000), cumulative organ damage (SLICC/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI)) and neuropsychiatric events were recorded at enrolment and annually. Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I, antiribosomal P and anti-NR2 glutamate receptor antibodies were measured at enrolment. Physician outcomes of seizures were recorded. Patient outcomes were derived from the SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) mental component summary and physical component summary scores. Statistical analyses included Cox and linear regressions. Results The cohort was 89.4% female with a mean follow-up of 3.5 +/- 2.9 years. Of 1631 patients, 75 (4.6%) had >= 1 seizure, the majority around the time of SLE diagnosis. Multivariate analysis indicated a higher risk of seizures with African race/ethnicity (HR (CI): 1.97 (1.07 to 3.63); p=0.03) and lower education status (1.97 (1.21 to 3.19); p<0.01). Higher damage scores (without neuropsychiatric variables) were associated with an increased risk of subsequent seizures (SDI=1:3.93 (1.46 to 10.55); SDI=2 or 3:1.57 (0.32 to 7.65); SDI >= 4:7.86 (0.89 to 69.06); p=0.03). There was an association with disease activity but not with autoantibodies. Seizures attributed to SLE frequently resolved (59/78 (76%)) in the absence of antiseizure drugs. There was no significant impact on the mental component summary or physical component summary scores. Antimalarial drugs in the absence of immunosuppressive agents were associated with reduced seizure risk (0.07 (0.01 to 0.66); p=0.03). Conclusion Seizures occurred close to SLE diagnosis, in patients with African race/ethnicity, lower educational status and cumulative organ damage. Most seizures resolved without a negative impact on health-related quality of life. Antimalarial drugs were associated with a protective effect.

Central nervous system influence on SCR is exerted differentially by the two hemispheres. Differences between SCR recordings from the left and right hands may therefore be expected. This study focused on emotionally expressive faces, known to be processed differently by the two hemispheres. Faces depicting neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful or disgusted expressions were presented in two tasks, one with an explicit emotion judgment and the other with an age judgment. We found stronger responses to sad and happy faces compared with neutral from the left hand during the implicit task, and stronger responses to negative emotions compared with neutral from the right hand during the explicit task. Our results suggest that basic social stimuli generate distinct responses on the two hands, no doubt related to the lateralization of social function in the brain.

Our goal was to investigate whether distinct ERP profiles reflect aspectual-thematic differences between Agent-Subject Verbs (ASVs; e.g., 'to eat') and Experiencer-Subject Verbs (ESVs; e.g., 'to love') in English. Inanimate subject noun phrases created reversal anomalies on both ASV and ESV. Animacy-based prominence effects and semantic association were controlled to minimize their contribution to any ERP effects. An N400 was elicited by the target verb in the ESV but not the ASV anomalies, supporting the hypothesis of a distinctive aspectual-thematic structure between ESV and ASV. Moreover, the N400 finding for English ESV shows that, in contrast to previous claims, the presence versus absence of N400s for this kind of anomaly cannot be exclusively explained in terms of typological differences across languages.

Update on the pathogenesis of complex regional pain syndrome: Role of oxidative stress	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Review							SYNDROME-TYPE-I; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NRF2; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; CRPS-I; ANIMAL-MODEL; VITAMIN-C; ANTIOXIDANTS; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE; SUPEROXIDE	Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic inflammatory pain syndrome that affects one or more extremities of the body. It is characterized by burning pain and abnormalities in the sensory, motor, and autonomic nervous systems. This review illustrates how oxidative stress and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) activation might contribute to understanding the etiopathogenesis of CRPS. The precise cause of CRPS remains unclear, and current treatments are not effective in many patients. The mechanism underlying CRPS may differ across patients and even within a single patient over time. Inflammatory and neuronal mechanisms have been suggested as key contributors to CRPS. Recent evidence demonstrates that oxidative stress is associated with clinical symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Oxidative stress plays a key role in CRPS pathogenesis. The Nrf2 factor is a master regulator of the transcription of multiple antioxidants, which protects against oxidative stress and inflammation by inducing antioxidant and detoxifying genes through binding with an antioxidant response element. It has antinociceptive effects against inflammatory pain in an animal model. This review summarises the effect of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CRPS. It also addresses the question of whether there is a potential role for Nrf2 (activated by pharmacological or nutritional activators) in alleviating the clinical features of CRPS or preventing its progression.

Results in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) have varied concerning the existence of a temporal gradient in retrograde amnesia. These results have important theoretical implications regarding multiple trace theory versus standard consolidation models of long-term memory (LTM). We investigated whether this variability arises from differences in the methods used in assessing autobiographical memory. We examined patterns of memory impairment in 20 healthy elderly controls, 20 MCI subjects, and 10 DAT subjects using the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) of Kopelman and the Autobiographical Interview (AI) of Levine. Both the AMI and AI were modified to allow for the test scores to be derived from a single interview without fatiguing the subjects. On the AMI, DAT subjects were significantly impaired on both components of autobiographical memoryepisodic memory and personal semanticswith episodic memory showing a significant though gentle temporal gradient sparing childhood memories. Using the AI test, subjects with DAT showed impaired recall of episodic details (but not personal semantics), again with a gentle temporal gradient. Differences between the two interview methods (fewer epochs in the AMI; fewer memories per epoch in the AI) were found to have a significant impact on the pattern of findings; fewer epochs in the AMI brought out the temporal gradient, and fewer memories per epoch (in the AI) diminished it. These data show the importance of technical details of the different tests in favouring one versus another LTM theory. The data are not purely compatible with either theory.

The answers to two basic questions - how to define a node and how to define an edge between a pair of nodes - are not obvious in the network analysis of brain imaging data. We considered the first question in the case of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based cortical thickness networks. We selected network nodes to represent vertices of a cortical surface mesh or cortical brain regions. The first network represents the maximal level of detail available in the analysis of cortical thickness networks, while the latter network represents the typical level of detail in the current network analysis studies. We compared the network analysis results between these two representations. The basic network measures behaved approximately as expected when the level of detail increased. However, the overall connectivity of nodes was greater in the vertex level, degree of clustering was smaller in the vertex level, and the node centralities were different between the levels. Further, many parameters of vertex-level network were more robust to the selection of the correlation threshold used to define the edges of network. We conclude that albeit many qualitative network properties were consistent between the two resolution levels, the vertex-level resolution revealed details that were not visible at the regional-level networks, and this additional detail could be useful for some applications. Finally, a similar methodology as the one used here could be used to study effects of the sampling density in other brain-imaging-based networks, for example, in resting-state functional MRI.

These works have characterized the neural activations related to the major brain oscillations of sleep, that is, spindles and slow waves during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep and ponto-geniculo-occipital waves during rapid-eye-movement sleep. These phasic events have been found associated with increases of brain activity in specific neural networks, which identify structures involved in the generation of sleep oscillations. Most importantly, these results confirm that, even during the deepest stages of sleep, neuronal network activities are sustained and organized by spontaneous brain oscillations of sleep. The understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sleep oscillations is fundamental since increasing evidence suggests a pivotal role for these rhythms in the functional properties of sleep. In particular, interactions between the sleeping brain and the surrounding environment are closely modulated by neuronal oscillations of sleep. Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that spindles distort the transmission of auditory information to the cortex, therefore isolating the brain from external disturbances during sleep. In contrast, slow waves evoked by acoustic stimulation-and also termed K-complexes-are associated with larger auditory cortex activation, thus reflecting an enhanced processing of external information during sleep. Future brain imaging studies of sleep should further explore the contribution of neuronal oscillations to the off-line consolidation of memory during sleep.

The proposed method uses a fuzzy logic controller to realize an online correction of the error due to the gyro sensor's bias variation with temperature. In the first phase, gyro experimental testing is performed for various speeds ranging from -150 to 150 degrees/s and temperatures between -10 degrees C and 70 degrees C, and the results obtained with classical compensation methods are evaluated. The fuzzy logic controller is developed via a fuzzy inference system (FIS), generated from the gyro testing experimental results. Further, to optimize the membership function parameters of its input-output variables, the FIS is trained with a neuro-fuzzy network. Validation by the assessment of errors shows that the proposed method gives better results than the classical algorithms based on the least squares method.	[Botez, R.

To assess, in a sample of subjects with current major depressive disorder, whether high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) is able to influence affective "theory of mind" (ToM). Methods. We conducted a pilot naturalistic trial in which 14 subjects with MDD were treated with daily HF-rTMS over their left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 4 weeks. Objective depressive symptoms and affective ToM (as assessed, respectively, by the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test [RMET]) were measured pre-post HF-rTMS treatment. Results. Our findings indicated the absence of a significant main effect for pre-post RMET scores, yet a significant interaction between pre-post RMET performance and change in depressive symptoms. Therefore, depressed subjects in our sample exhibited ToM improvements in proportion to their antidepressant response. Conclusions. We have shown that HF-rTMS is able to influence ToM in subjects with MDD. We hypothesize that this effect could be associated, at least in part, with clinical improvement over time. However, further studies with larger samples and controlled designs are needed to better clarify our preliminary findings.

The present study investigated congenital amusia with harmonic stimuli and a priming task. Amusic and control participants performed a speeded phoneme discrimination task on sung chord sequences. The target phoneme was sung either on a functionally important chord (tonic chord, referred to as "related target") or a less important one (subdominant chord, referred to as "less-related target"). Correct response times were faster when the target phoneme was sung on tonic chords rather than on subdominant chords, and this effect was less pronounced, albeit significant, in amusic participants. These data report for the first time a deficit in congenital amusia for chord processing, but also provide evidence that, despite this deficit, amusic individuals have internalized sophisticated syntactic-like functions of chords in the Western tonal musical system. This finding suggests that thanks to this musical knowledge, amusic individuals could develop expectancies for musical events, and, presumably, follow the tension-relaxation schemas in Western tonal music, which also influence emotional responses to music.

Along with physical impairments, cognition and quality of life may be affected in frail older adults. Yet, evidence is still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare frail and non-frail older adults on physical, cognitive, and psychological dimensions. Methods: Thirty-nine frail and 44 non-frail elders were compared on several measures of physical capacity, cognition, and quality of life. Frailty status was based on a geriatric examination and scored using the Modified Physical Performance Test. Results: After controlling for demographic and medical characteristics, physical capacity measures (i.e. functional capacities, physical endurance, gait speed, and mobility) were significantly lower in frail participants. Frail participants showed reduced performances in specific cognitive measures of executive functions and processing speed. On the quality of life dimension, frail elders reported poor self-perceptions of physical capacity, cognition, affectivity, housekeeping efficacy, and physical health. Conclusion: In addition to the reduced physical capacity, frailty might affect selective components of cognition and quality of life. These dimensions should be investigated in intervention programs designed for frail older adults.

Age-related cholinergic atrophy and cell loss in normal brains is apparently not complemented by reductions in the levels of NGF as could be expected. In the present work, cortical proNGF/NGF were immunoprecipitated from cortical brain homogenates from young and aged and behaviorally characterized rats and resolved with antinitrotyrosine antibodies to reveal nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins. Cortical proNGF in aged and cognitively impaired rats was found to be a target for peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative damage with correlative impact on decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity. These studies provide evidence for oxidative stress damage of NGF molecules in the cerebral cortex of cognitively impaired aged rats as previously shown in AD human brains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We also examined whether hippocampal atrophy and vascular burden were differentially related to these memory capacities in MCI. We further assessed whether memory performance and brain changes differ as a function of later development (or not) of dementia and whether they can predict progression to dementia. The study included 77 participants, 49 meeting the criteria for MCI and 28 healthy older adults. Results showed binding deficits and greater vulnerability to proactive interference in persons with MCI compared with healthy older adults. Hippocampal volume was associated with binding capacity, whereas vascular burden was associated with resistance to interference in persons with MCI. Follow-up analyses indicated that binding deficits predict progression from MCI to dementia. In conclusion, binding deficits and vulnerability to proactive interference are present in persons with MCI and are associated with different brain markers. However, only binding deficits predict progression to dementia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

UBQLN2 mutations are rare in French and French-Canadian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						UBQLN2; ALS; Dementia	FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; C9ORF72; ALS; NEURODEGENERATION; EXPANSION; GENE; FTD	Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene, which encodes a member of the ubiquitin-like protein family (ubiquilin-2), have been recently identified in patients with dominant X-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS with dementia. We report here the sequencing of the UBQLN2 gene in 590 ALS patients of French and French-Canadian ancestry. We identified two novel missense mutations (p.S155N and p.P189T) in two individuals with sporadic ALS. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that these missense mutations affect the normal protein's function. Importantly, these findings further highlight the importance of the proline residues located in the conserved domains of the ubiquilin-2 protein, suggesting that mutations affecting these residues are particularly relevant to the development of ALS. Our findings further support a causative role of the UBQLN2 gene in the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest that UBQLN2 mutations are rare in the French and French-Canadian population.

J	Young, A				Young, Allan			The Social Brain and the Myth of Empathy	SCIENCE IN CONTEXT			English	Article							MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; SHARED MANIFOLD HYPOTHESIS; MENTAL TIME-TRAVEL; ALTRUISTIC PUNISHMENT; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; SEX-DIFFERENCES; TELL US; EVOLUTION; AUTISM; MIND	Neuroscience research has created multiple versions of the human brain. The "social brain" is one version and it is the subject of this paper. Most image-based research in the field of social neuroscience is task-driven: the brain is asked to respond to a cognitive (perceptual) stimulus. The tasks are derived from theories, operational models, and back-stories now circulating in social neuroscience. The social brain comes with a distinctive back-story, an evolutionary history organized around three, interconnected themes: mind-reading, empathy, and the emergence of self-consciousness. This paper focuses on how empathy has been incorporated into the social brain and redefined via parallel research streams, employing a shared, imaging technology. The concluding section describes how these developments can be understood as signaling the emergence of a new version of human nature and the unconscious. My argument is not that empathy in the social brain is a myth, but rather that it is served by a myth consonant with the canons of science.

Induction to oxidative stress by saxitoxin investigated through lipid peroxidation in Neuro 2A cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii alga	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Saxitoxin; Oxidative stress; Lipid peroxidation; Neuro-2A cells; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii green alga	PARALYTIC SHELLFISH TOXINS; APHANIZOMENON-FLOS-AQUAE; DRINKING-WATER; CYLINDROSPERMOPSIS RACIBORSKII; CYANOBACTERIAL TOXINS; OKADAIC ACID; DNA-DAMAGE; CULTURE; HEALTH; ANTIOXIDANTS	Saxitoxin (STX) is a cyanotoxin, which can cause neurotoxic effects and induce ecological changes in aquatic environments, a potential risk to public and environmental health. Many studies of cytotoxicity on animal cells and algae have been performed, although few compare the toxic effects between the two models. In this sense, we investigated the oxidative stress induced by STX (0.4-3.0 nM) in two different cellular models: Neuro-2A (N2A) cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii alga by quantification of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as indicative of lipid peroxidation (LPO). Also was evaluated the antioxidant defense of these cells systems after exposure to SIX by the addition of antioxidants in N2A cells culture, and by the measure of antioxidants enzymes activity in C. reinhardtii cells. The MDA levels of N2A cells increased from 15% to 113% for 0.4 and 3.0 nM of STX, respectively, as compared to control. Superoxide-dismutase and catalase did not appear to protect the cell from STX effect while, in cells treated with vitamin E, the rates of MDA production decreased significantly, except for higher concentrations of SIX. No MDA productions were observed in algal cells however some effects on antioxidant enzymes activity were observed when algae were exposed to 3.0 nM STX. Our results indicate that the concentrations of SIX that may induce oxidative stress through LPO are different in animal and phytoplankton communities. A combination of algal and animal bioassays should be conducted for reliable assessment of oxidative stress induced by SIX. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Case Study: City of Syracuse, Italy	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Wavelets; Denoising; Forecasting; Water demand	PREDICTION; RIVERS	Forecasting urban water demand can be of use in the management of water utilities. For example, activities such as water-budgeting, operation and maintenance of pumps, wells, reservoirs, and mains require quantitative estimations of water resources at specified future dates. In this study, we tackle the problem of forecasting urban water demand by means of back-propagation artificial neural networks (ANNs) coupled with wavelet-denoising. In addition, non-coupled ANN and Linear Multiple Regression were used as comparison models. We considered the case of the municipality of Syracuse, Italy; for this purpose, we used a 7 year-long time series of water demand without additional predictors. Six forecasting horizons were considered, from 1 to 6 months ahead. The main objective was to implement a forecasting model that may be readily used for municipal water budgeting. An additional objective was to explore the impact of wavelet-denoising on ANN generalization. For this purpose, we measured the impact of five different wavelet filter-banks (namely, Haar and Daubechies of type db2, db3, db4, and db5) on a single neural network. Empirical results show that neural networks coupled with Haar and Daubechies' filter-banks of type db2 and db3 outperformed all of the following: non-coupled ANN, Multiple Linear Regression and ANN models coupled with Daubechies filters of type db4 and db5. The results of this study suggest that reduced variance in the training-set (by means of denoising) may improve forecasting accuracy; on the other hand, an oversimplification of the input-matrix may deteriorate forecasting accuracy and induce network instability.

The study of this phenomenon and the development of preventive/therapeutic strategies represent public health priorities. The present document reports the results of a recent meeting of the International Working Group on Sarcopenia (a task force consisting of geriatricians and scientists from academia and industry) held on June 7-8, 2011 in Toulouse (France). The meeting was specifically focused at gaining knowledge on the currently available biomarkers (functional, biological, or imaging-related) that could be utilized in clinical trials of sarcopenia and considered the most reliable and promising to evaluate age-related modifications of skeletal muscle. Specific recommendations about the assessment of aging skeletal muscle in older people and the optimal methodological design of studies on sarcopenia were also discussed and finalized. Although the study of skeletal muscle decline is still in a very preliminary phase, the potential great benefits derived from a better understanding and treatment of this condition should encourage research on sarcopenia. However, the reasonable uncertainties (derived from exploring a novel field and the exponential acceleration of scientific progress) require the adoption of a cautious and comprehensive approach to the subject.

Anticholinergics in the era of atypical antipsychotics: short-term or long-term treatment?	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Extrapyramidal symptoms; movement disorders; antipsychotics; anticholinergics; schizophrenia; cognition	ANTI-PARKINSONIAN MEDICATION; INDUCED EXTRAPYRAMIDAL REACTION; MAINTENANCE ANTIPARKINSON DRUG; CHRONIC-SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; TARDIVE-DYSKINESIA; ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL; GRADUAL WITHDRAWAL; AGENTS; ABUSE	Anticholinergic agents are usually prescribed to prevent or treat antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Their long-term benefits are questionable and they carry diverse adverse effects, including cognitive impairment and worsening of tardive dyskinesia. This literature review explores the impact of anticholinergic medication discontinuation on movement disorders, cognition and psychopathology in patients receiving antipsychotics. Medline, Embase and PsycInfo were searched from 1950 to July 2011 using "cessation /withdrawal /discontinuation /stopping" with "anticholinergic(star)" or "antiparkinson(star)" and "neuroleptic(star)" or "antipsychotic(star)". Additional articles were obtained by searching the bibliographies of relevant references. Earlier studies of anticholinergic agent discontinuation in patients receiving first-generation antipsychotics reported relapse rates of extrapyramidal symptoms between 4% and 80%, reflecting the heterogeneity of the studies. Two recent studies of patients prescribed second-generation antipsychotics obtained relapse rates of 4% and 33%. Some studies suggest improvement in tardive dyskinesia with cessation of anticholinergics. Four studies examined the effects of anticholinergic agent discontinuation on cognition and all observed an improvement post-discontinuation. Changes in symptoms of schizophrenia with anticholinergic discontinuation are conflicting, with more recent studies suggesting an improvement. Given their questionable benefit with continued use, clinicians should consider a gradual withdrawal of anticholinergic agents in stable patients receiving antipsychotics.

Mapping the After-effects of Theta Burst Stimulation on the Human Auditory Cortex with Functional Imaging	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 67; Physiology; Physics; Theta burst stimulation; functional magnetic resonance imaging; MRI; auditory cortex; frameless stereotaxy; sound; transcranial magnetic stimulation		Auditory cortex pertains to the processing of sound, which is at the basis of speech or music-related processing(1). However, despite considerable recent progress, the functional properties and lateralization of the human auditory cortex are far from being fully understood. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can transiently or lastingly modulate cortical excitability via the application of localized magnetic field pulses, and represents a unique method of exploring plasticity and connectivity. It has only recently begun to be applied to understand auditory cortical function (2). An important issue in using TMS is that the physiological consequences of the stimulation are difficult to establish. Although many TMS studies make the implicit assumption that the area targeted by the coil is the area affected, this need not be the case, particularly for complex cognitive functions which depend on interactions across many brain regions (3). One solution to this problem is to combine TMS with functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The idea here is that fMRI will provide an index of changes in brain activity associated with TMS. Thus, fMRI would give an independent means of assessing which areas are affected by TMS and how they are modulated (4). In addition, fMRI allows the assessment of functional connectivity, which represents a measure of the temporal coupling between distant regions. It can thus be useful not only to measure the net activity modulation induced by TMS in given locations, but also the degree to which the network properties are affected by TMS, via any observed changes in functional connectivity. Different approaches exist to combine TMS and functional imaging according to the temporal order of the methods. Functional MRI can be applied before, during, after, or both before and after TMS. Recently, some studies interleaved TMS and fMRI in order to provide online mapping of the functional changes induced by TMS (5-7). However, this online combination has many technical problems, including the static artifacts resulting from the presence of the TMS coil in the scanner room, or the effects of TMS pulses on the process of MR image formation. But more importantly, the loud acoustic noise induced by TMS (increased compared with standard use because of the resonance of the scanner bore) and the increased TMS coil vibrations (caused by the strong mechanical forces due to the static magnetic field of the MR scanner) constitute a crucial problem when studying auditory processing. This is one reason why fMRI was carried out before and after TMS in the present study. Similar approaches have been used to target the motor cortex (8,9), premotor cortex (10), primary somatosensory cortex (11,12) and language-related areas (13), but so far no combined TMS-fMRI study has investigated the auditory cortex. The purpose of this article is to provide details concerning the protocol and considerations necessary to successfully combine these two neuroscientific tools to investigate auditory processing. Previously we showed that repetitive TMS (rTMS) at high and low frequencies (resp. 10 Hz and 1 Hz) applied over the auditory cortex modulated response time (RT) in a melody discrimination task (2). We also showed that RT modulation was correlated with functional connectivity in the auditory network assessed using fMRI: the higher the functional connectivity between left and right auditory cortices during task performance, the higher the facilitatory effect (i.e. decreased RT) observed with rTMS. However those findings were mainly correlational, as fMRI was performed before rTMS. Here, fMRI was carried out before and immediately after TMS to provide direct measures of the functional organization of the auditory cortex, and more specifically of the plastic reorganization of the auditory neural network occurring after the neural intervention provided by TMS. Combined fMRI and TMS applied over the auditory cortex should enable a better understanding of brain mechanisms of auditory processing, providing physiological information about functional effects of TMS. This knowledge could be useful for many cognitive neuroscience applications, as well as for optimizing therapeutic applications of TMS, particularly in auditory-related disorders.

The discovery of mirror neurons in the last 15 years has strongly renewed the interest for motor theories. However, while these neurophysiological data clearly reinforce the plausibility of the role of motor properties in perception, it could lead in our view to incorrectly de-emphasise the role of perceptual shaping, crucial in speech communication. The so-called Perception-for-Action-Control Theory (PACT) aims at defining a theoretical framework connecting in a principled way perceptual shaping and motor procedural knowledge in speech multisensory processing in the human brain. In this paper, the theory is presented in details. It is described how this theory fits with behavioural and linguistic data, concerning firstly vowel systems in human languages, and secondly the perceptual organization of the speech scene. Finally a neuro-computational framework is presented in connection with recent data on the possible functional role of the motor system in speech perception. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

SYSTEMIC PREGABALIN ATTENUATES SENSORIMOTOR RESPONSES AND MEDULLARY GLUTAMATE RELEASE IN INFLAMMATORY TOOTH PAIN MODEL	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						pregabalin; tooth pulp inflammation; mustard oil; sensorimotor behavior; glutamate release	TEMPOROMANDIBULAR-JOINT REGION; ALPHA(2)DELTA LIGAND PREGABALIN; JAW ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; NMDA RECEPTOR MECHANISMS; BRAIN-STEM MECHANISMS; CHRONIC MUSCLE PAIN; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; DORSAL-HORN; PRESYNAPTIC TERMINALS	Our previous studies have demonstrated that application of inflammatory irritant mustard oil (MO) to the tooth pulp induces medullary glutamate release and central sensitization in the rat medullary dorsal horn (MDH), as well as nociceptive sensorimotor responses in craniofacial muscles in rats. There is recent evidence that anticonvulsant drugs such as pregabalin that influence glutamatergic neurotransmission are effective in several pain states. The aim of this study was to examine whether systemic administration of pregabalin attenuated glutamate release in the medulla as well as these nociceptive effects reflected in increased electromyographic (EMG) activity induced by MO application to the tooth pulp. Male adult rats were anesthetized with isofluorane (1.0-1.2%), and jaw and tongue muscle EMG activities were recorded by needle electrodes inserted bilaterally into masseter and anterior digastric muscles and into the genioglossus muscle, and also the medullary release of glutamate was assessed by in vivo microdialysis. Pregabalin or vehicle control (isotonic saline) was administered 30 min before the pulpal application of MO or vehicle control (mineral oil). Application of mineral oil to the maxillary first molar tooth pulp produced no change in baseline EMG activity and glutamate release. However, application of MO to the pulp significantly increased both the medullary release of glutamate and EMG activity in the jaw and tongue muscles for several minutes. In contrast, pre-medication with pregabalin, but not vehicle control, significantly and dose-dependently attenuated the medullary glutamate release and EMG activity in these muscles after MO application to the tooth pulp (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p < 0.05). These results suggest that pregabalin may attenuate the medullary release of glutamate and associated nociceptive sensorimotor responses in this acute inflammatory pulpal pain model, and that it may prove useful for the treatment of orofacial inflammatory pain states.

Several different but complementary imaging MS technologies have been developed allowing the analysis of a wide variety of compounds including inorganic elementals, metabolites, lipids, peptides, proteins and xenobiotics with spatial resolutions from micrometer to nanometer scales. In the past decade, an enormous collective body of work has been done to develop and improve the imaging MS technology. This article gives a historical perspective, an overview of the principle and status of the technology and lists the main fields of applications. It also enumerates some of the critical challenges we need to collectively address for imaging MS to be considered a mainstream analytical method.

Schizophrenia is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders. Accumulating evidence has indicated the involvement of the Akt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Genetic linkage and association studies have identified Akt-1 as a candidate susceptibility gene related for schizophrenia. The level of Akt-1 protein and its kinase activity decreased significantly both in white blood cells from schizophrenic patients and in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenic patients. Consistent with these findings, alterations in the upstream and downstream pathways of Akt have also been found in many psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs modify the Akt signaling pathway in a variety of conditions relative to schizophrenia. In addition as a survival kinase, Akt participates in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, protein synthesis and neurotransmission in the central nervous system. It is thought that reduced activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway could at least partially explain the cognitive impairment, synaptic morphologic abnormality, neuronal atrophy and dysfunction of neurotransmitter signaling in schizophrenia. In addition, reduced levels of Akt may increase the effects of risk factors on neurodevelopment, attenuate the effects of growth factors on neurodevelopment and reduce the response of patients to antipsychotic agents. More recently, the role of Akt signaling in the functions of schizophrenia susceptibility genes such as disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC-1), neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) and dysbindin-1 has been reported. Thus, Akt deficiency may create a context permissive for the expression of risk-gene effects in neuronal morphology and function. This paper reviews the role of Akt in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and as a potential therapeutic strategy targeting Akt. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we show that rodents may be poor predictors of P2X3 pharmacology in human. We demonstrate that monkey and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons do not express appreciable levels of P2X2 subunit, contrary to rat sensory neurons. Additionally, we report functional P2X3 activity in monkey DRG neurons and confirm the absence of functional P2X2/3 receptors. Interestingly, native P2X3 receptors in rat and monkey DRGs show similar agonist potency, but different antagonist potencies for TNP-ATP[2-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP] and RO51. This unexpected difference in antagonist potency was confirmed by comparing rat and human P2X3 receptors in HEK293 cells. Mutagenesis studies reveal that two extracellular residues, A197 and T202, are synergistically responsible for the potency drop in primate P2X3 receptors. These results uncover species-specific P2X3 pharmacology and identify key mechanisms impacting the translatability of potential analgesics targeting P2X3 receptors.

Tickling in juvenile but not adult female rats conditions sexual partner preference	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Tickling; Juvenile play; Conditioning; Place preference; Partner preference; Sexual behavior; Odors	SOCIAL PLAY-BEHAVIOR; NALOXONE; METHYLPHENIDATE; CORTEX; REWARD	Female rats display a conditioned partner preference for males that bear odors paired with different types of rewarding unconditioned stimuli (UCS). Here we examined whether tickling constitutes a rewarding UCS that supports the development of partner preferences. In Experiment 1, we tested the possibility that odors associated with a tickling UCS in prepubescent rats would induce a conditioned partner preference in adulthood. Two groups were formed with 31-day-old, single-housed females, tickled for 6 min daily for 10 days, by a hand that wore a scented glove (almond or lemon). At 47 days of age, females were ovariectomized (OVX), hormone-primed (EB + P), and tested for sexual partner preference with two scented stud males (one almond and one lemon). In each group, females displayed a sexual preference toward males bearing the odor paired with tickling, as observed with longer visits, more solicitations, hops & darts, and receiving more intromissions and ejaculations from the preferred male. In Experiment 2. we used 3-month old, OVX, hormone-primed rats conditioned every 4 days for 10 trials. In contrast to juvenile females, adult females failed to prefer males that bore the odor paired with tickling but instead preferred the novel male. These results suggest that tickling has opposite age-dependent effects in the conditioning of partner preference. Tickling in juvenile females appears to act as a rewarding UCS, whereas in adult females it may act as an aversive UCS. Further research is needed to understand brain mechanisms that might account for such differences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CDF Collaboration	Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a W-+/- boson with 7.5 fb(-1) integrated luminosity at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; MASSLESS PARTICLES; BROKEN SYMMETRIES; ROOT-S=7 TEV; UPGRADE; DETECTOR; COLLISIONS	We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a W-+/- boson. This search uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.5 fb(-1) collected by the CDF detector at the Tevatron. We select WH -> lvb (b) over bar candidate events with two jets, large missing transverse energy, and exactly one charged lepton. We further require that at least one jet be identified to originate from a bottom quark. Discrimination between the signal and the large background is achieved through the use of a Bayesian artificial neural network. The number of tagged events and their distributions are consistent with the standard model expectations. We observe no evidence for a Higgs boson signal and set 95% C.L. upper limits on the WH production cross section times the branching ratio to decay to b (b) over bar pairs, sigma(p (p) over bar -> (WH)-H-+/-) x B(H -> b (b) over bar), relative to the rate predicted by the standard model. For the Higgs boson mass range of 100 to 150 GeV/c(2) we set observed (expected) upper limits from 1.34 (1.83) to 38.8 (23.4). For 115 GeV/c(2) the upper limit is 3.64 (2.78). The combination of the present search with an independent analysis that selects events with three jets yields more stringent limits ranging from 1.12 (1.79) to 34.4 (21.6) in the same mass range. For 115 and 125 GeV/c(2) the upper limits are 2.65 (2.60) and 4.36 (3.69), respectively.

The chemokine CXCL12, and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 have been involved in tumor progression and dissemination. While CXCR4 expression is associated to undifferentiated tumors and poor prognosis, the role of CXCR7, the recently identified second CXCL12 receptor, has not yet been elucidated in NB. In this report, CXCR7 and CXCL12 expressions were evaluated using a tissue micro-array including 156 primary and 56 metastatic NB tissues. CXCL12 was found to be highly associated to NB vascular and stromal structures. In contrast to CXCR4, CXCR7 expression was low in undifferentiated tumors, while its expression was stronger in matured tissues and specifically associated to differentiated neural tumor cells. As determined by RT-PCR, CXCR7 expression was mainly detected in N-and S-type NB cell lines, and was slightly induced upon NB cell differentiation in vitro. The relative roles of the two CXCL12 receptors were further assessed by overexpressing CXCR7 or CXCR4 receptor alone, or in combination, in the IGR-NB8 and the SH-SY5Y NB cell lines. In vitro functional analyses indicated that, in response to their common ligand, both receptors induced activation of ERK1/2 cascade, but not Akt pathway. CXCR7 strongly reduced in vitro growth, in contrast to CXCR4, and impaired CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. Subcutaneous implantation of CXCR7-expressing NB cells showed that CXCR7 also significantly reduced in vivo growth. Moreover, CXCR7 affected CXCR4-mediated orthotopic growth in a CXCL12-producing environment. In such model, CXCR7, in association with CXCR4, did not induce NB cell metastatic dissemination. In conclusion, the CXCR7 and CXCR4 receptors revealed specific expression patterns and distinct functional roles in NB. Our data suggest that CXCR7 elicits anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in NB.

Transcriptome-wide Regulation of Pre-mRNA Splicing and mRNA Localization by Muscleblind Proteins	CELL			English	Article							MYOTONIC-DYSTROPHY; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; GENE-EXPRESSION; STEM-CELLS; SYNAPSE FORMATION; MBNL1; TRANSLATION; DROSOPHILA; REVEALS; BINDING	The muscleblind-like (Mbnl) family of RNA-binding proteins plays important roles in muscle and eye development and in myotonic dystrophy (DM), in which expanded CUG or CCUG repeats functionally deplete Mbnl proteins. We identified transcriptome-wide functional and biophysical targets of Mbnl proteins in brain, heart, muscle, and myoblasts by using RNA-seq and CLIP-seq approaches. This analysis identified several hundred splicing events whose regulation depended on Mbnl function in a pattern indicating functional interchangeability between Mbnl1 and Mbnl2. A nucleotide resolution RNA map associated repression or activation of exon splicing with Mbnl binding near either 30 splice site or near the downstream 50 splice site, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis of subcellular compartments uncovered a global role for Mbnls in regulating localization of mRNAs in both mouse and Drosophila cells, and Mbnl-dependent translation and protein secretion were observed for a subset of mRNAs with Mbnl-dependent localization. These findings hold several new implications for DM pathogenesis.

CMP-Neu5Gc is synthesized from CMP-Neu5Ac, with Neu5Gc representing a highly variable fraction of total Sias in various tissues and among different species. The exception may be the brain, where Neu5Ac is abundant and Neu5Gc is reported to be rare. Here, we confirm this unusual pattern and its evolutionary conservation in additional samples from various species, concluding that brain Neu5Gc expression has been maintained at extremely low levels over hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution. Most explanations for this pattern do not require maintaining neural Neu5Gc at such low levels. We hypothesized that resistance of alpha 2-8-linked Neu5Gc to vertebrate sialidases is the detrimental effect requiring the relative absence of Neu5Gc from brain. This linkage is prominent in polysialic acid (polySia), a molecule with critical roles in vertebrate neural development. We show that Neu5Gc is incorporated into neural polySia and does not cause in vitro toxicity. Synthetic polymers of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc showed that mammalian and bacterial sialidases are much less able to hydrolyze alpha 2-8-linked Neu5Gc at the nonreducing terminus. Notably, this difference was not seen with acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of polySias. Molecular dynamics modeling indicates that differences in the three-dimensional conformation of terminal saccharides may partly explain reduced enzymatic activity. In keeping with this, polymers of N-propionylneuraminic acid are sensitive to sialidases.

Microglia derive from primitive myeloid precursors that colonize the nervous system during embryonic development. In the postnatal brain, microglia are initially mitotic, rounded in shape (amoeboid), and phagocytically active. As brain development proceeds, they gradually undergo a transition to a surveillant nonphagocytic state characterized by a highly branched (ramified) morphology. This ramification process is almost recapitulated in reverse during the process of microglia activation in the adult brain, when surveillant microglia undergo a ramified-to-amoeboid morphological transformation and become phagocytic in response to injury or disease. Little is known about the mechanisms controlling amoeboid microglial cell proliferation, activation, and ramification during brain development, despite the critical role of these processes in the establishment of the adult microglia pool and their relevance to microglia activation in the adult brain. Here we show that the mouse transcription factor Runx1, a key regulator of myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation, is expressed in forebrain amoeboid microglia during the first two postnatal weeks. Runx1 expression is then downregulated in ramified microglia. Runx1 inhibits mouse amoeboid microglia proliferation and promotes progression to the ramified state. We show further that Runx1 expression is upregulated in microglia following nerve injury in the adult mouse nervous system. These findings provide insight into the regulation of postnatal microglia activation and maturation to the ramified state and have implications for microglia biology in the developing and injured brain.

This simple construct allows brain researchers to combine data from many subjects such that group-averaged signals, be they structural or functional, can be detected above the background noise that would swamp subtle signals from any single subject. Where the signal is robust enough to be detected in individuals, it allows for the exploration of inter-individual variance in the location of that signal. From a larger perspective, it provides a powerful medium for comparison and/or combination of brain mapping findings from different imaging modalities and laboratories around the world. Finally, it provides a framework for the creation of large-scale neuroimaging databases or "atlases" that capture the population mean and variance in anatomical or physiological metrics as a function of age or disease. However, while the above benefits are not in question at first order, there are a number of conceptual and practical challenges that introduce second-order incompatibilities among experimental data. Stereotaxic mapping requires two basic components: (i) the specification of the 3D stereotaxic coordinate space, and (ii) a mapping function that transforms a 3D brain image from "native" space, i.e. the coordinate frame of the scanner at data acquisition, to that stereotaxic space. The first component is usually expressed by the choice of a representative 3D MR image that serves as target "template" or atlas. The native image is re-sampled from native to stereotaxic space under the mapping function that may have few or many degrees of freedom, depending upon the experimental design. The optimal choice of atlas template and mapping function depend upon considerations of age, gender, hemispheric asymmetry, anatomical correspondence, spatial normalization methodology and disease-specificity. Accounting, or not, for these various factors in defining stereotaxic space has created the specter of an ever-expanding set of atlases, customized for a particular experiment, that are mutually incompatible. These difficulties continue to plague the brain mapping field. This review article summarizes the evolution of stereotaxic space in term of the basic principles and associated conceptual challenges, the creation of population atlases and the future trends that can be expected in atlas evolution.

However the BOLD method remains a largely qualitative approach. While the same can be said of anatomic MRI techniques, whose clinical and research impact has not been diminished in the slightest by the lack of a quantitative interpretation of their image intensity, the quantitative expression of BOLD responses as a percent of the baseline T2*-weighted signal has been viewed as necessary since the earliest days of fMRI. Calibrated MRI attempts to dissociate changes in oxygen metabolism from changes in blood flow and volume, the latter three quantities contributing jointly to determine the physiologically ambiguous percent BOLD change. This dissociation is typically performed using a "calibration" procedure in which subjects inhale a gas mixture containing small amounts of carbon dioxide or enriched oxygen to produce changes in blood flow and BOLD signal which can be measured under well-defined hemodynamic conditions. The outcome is a calibration parameter M which can then be substituted into an expression providing the fractional change in oxygen metabolism given changes in blood flow and BOLD signal during a task. The latest generation of calibrated MRI methods goes beyond fractional changes to provide absolute quantification of resting-state oxygen consumption in micromolar units, in addition to absolute measures of evoked metabolic response. This review discusses the history, challenges, and advances in calibrated MRI, from the personal perspective of the author. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Today it is the predominant functional brain imaging modality with the majority of applications being in basic cognitive neuroscience where it has primarily been used as a tool to localize brain activity. While the magnitude of the BOLD response is often used in these studies as a surrogate for the level of neuronal activity, the link between the two is, in fact, quite indirect. The BOLD response is dependent upon hemodynamic (blood flow and volume) and metabolic (oxygen consumption) responses as well as acquisition details. Furthermore, the relationship between neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response, termed neurovascular coupling, is itself complex and incompletely understood. Quantitative fMRI techniques have therefore been developed to measure the hemodynamic and metabolic responses to modulations in brain activity. These methods have not only helped clarify the behaviour and origins of the BOLD signal under normal physiological conditions but they have also provided a potentially valuable set of tools for exploring pathophysiological conditions. Such quantitative methods will be critical to realize the potential of fMRI in a clinical context, where simple BOLD measurements cannot be uniquely interpreted, and to enhance the power of fMRI in basic neuroscience research. In this article, recent advances in human quantitative fMRI methods are reviewed, outstanding issues discussed and future challenges and opportunities highlighted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Whether a similar increase in wakefulness length leads to a comparable enhancement in NREM sleep cortical synchronization in young and older subjects is still a matter of debate in the literature. Here we evaluated the impact of 25-hours of wakefulness on SW during a daytime recovery sleep episode in 29 young (27y +/-5), and 34 middle-aged (51y +/-5) subjects. We also assessed whether age-related changes in NREM sleep cortical synchronization predicts the ability to maintain sleep during daytime recovery sleep. Compared to baseline sleep, sleep efficiency was lower during daytime recovery sleep in both age-groups but the effect was more prominent in the middle-aged than in the young subjects. In both age groups, SW density, amplitude, and slope increased whereas SW positive and negative phase duration decreased during daytime recovery sleep compared to baseline sleep, particularly in anterior brain areas. Importantly, compared to young subjects, middle-aged participants showed lower SW density rebound and SW positive phase duration enhancement after sleep deprivation during daytime recovery sleep. Furthermore, middle-aged subjects showed lower SW amplitude and slope enhancements after sleep deprivation than young subjects in frontal and prefrontal derivations only. None of the SW characteristics at baseline were associated with daytime recovery sleep efficiency. Our results support the notion that anterior brain areas elicit and may necessitate more intense recovery and that aging reduces enhancement of cortical synchronization after sleep loss, particularly in these areas. Age-related changes in the quality of wake experience may underlie age-related reduction in markers of cortical synchronization enhancement after sustained wakefulness.

Despite a strong genetic basis, a gene with rare pathogenic mutations that cause ET has not yet been reported. We used exome sequencing to implement a simple approach to control for misdiagnosis of ET, as well as phenocopies involving sporadic and senile ET cases. We studied a large ET-affected family and identified a PUS p.Gln290* mutation as the cause of ET in this family. Further screening of 270 ET cases identified two additional rare missense FUS variants. Functional considerations suggest that the pathogenic effects of ET-specific PUS mutations are different from the effects observed when FUS is mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases; we have shown that the ET PUS nonsense mutation is degraded by the nonsense-mediated-decay pathway, whereas amyotrophic lateral sclerosis FUS mutant transcripts are not.

Several recent genomic studies have highlighted genetic variability in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS1/2/3) gene cluster as an important contributor to FA alterations in serum lipids as well as measures of FA desaturase index estimated by ratios of relevant FAs. The contribution to alterations of FAs within the brain by local synthesis is still a matter of debate. Thus, the impact of genetic variants in FADS genes on gene expression and brain FA levels is an important avenue to investigate. Methods: Analyses were performed on brain tissue from prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 47 (BA47) of 61 male subjects of French Canadian ancestry ranging in age from young adulthood to middle age (18-58 years old), with the exception of one teenager (15 years old). Haplotype tagging SNPs were selected using the publicly available HapMap genotyping dataset in conjunction with Haploview. DNA sequencing was performed by the Sanger method and gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. FAs in brain tissue were analysed by gas chromatography. Variants in the FADS1 gene region were sequenced and analyzed for their influence on both FADS gene expression and FAs in brain tissue. Results: Our results suggest an association of the minor haplotype with alteration in estimated fatty acid desaturase activity. Analysis of the impact of DNA variants on expression and alternative transcripts of FADS1 and FADS2, however, showed no differences. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between haplotype and age on certain brain FA levels. Discussion: This study suggests that genetic variability in the FADS genes cluster, previously shown to be implicated in alterations in peripheral FA levels, may also affect FA composition in brain tissue, but not likely by local synthesis.

Although implicated in controlling synaptic plasticity, their function is not well understood and their expression patterns are debated. We demonstrate that, in layer 5 of developing mouse visual cortex, preNMDARs specifically control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to other pyramidal cells and to Martinotti cells, while leaving those to basket cells unaffected. We also reveal a type of interneuron that mediates ascending inhibition. In agreement with synapse-specific expression, we find preNMDAR-mediated calcium signals in a subset of pyramidal cell terminals. A tuned network model predicts that preNMDARs specifically reroute information flow in local circuits during high-frequency firing, in particular by impacting frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition mediated by Martinotti cells, a finding that we experimentally verify. We conclude that postsynaptic cell type determines presynaptic terminal molecular identity and that preNMDARs govern information processing in neocortical columns.

Consequently, numerous studies have sought to determine whether neuraly-derived NO is involved in the regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Anatomically, axons, dendrites, or somata of NO neurons have been found to contact the basement membrane of blood vessels or perivascular astrocytes in all segments of the cortical miccirculation. Functionally, various experimental approaches support a role of neuronal NO in the maintenance of resting CBF as well as in the vascular response to neuronal activity. Since decades, it has been assumed that neuronal NO simply diffuses to the local blood vessels and produce vasodilation through a cGMP-PKG dependent mechanism. However, NO is not the sole mediator of vasodilation in the cerebral microcirculation and is known to interact with a myriad of signaling pathways also involved vascular control. In addition, cerebrovascular regulation is the result of a complex orchestration between all components of the neurovascular unit (i.e., neuronal, glial, and vascular cells) also known to produce NO. In this review article, the role of NO interneuron in the regulation of cortical microcirculation will be discussed in the context of the neurovascular unit.

Atomic Force Microscopy Reveals Important Differences in Axonal Resistance to Injury	BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL NERVE COMPRESSION; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; STRETCH-INJURY; CELL MECHANICS; DEGENERATION; NEUROFILAMENTS; MICROTUBULES; MECHANOTRANSDUCTION; PRESSURE; CULTURE	Axonal degeneration after traumatic brain injury and nerve compression is considered a common underlying cause of temporary as well as permanent disability. Because a proper functioning of neural network requires phase coherence of all components, even subtle changes in circuitry may lead to network failure. However, it is still not possible to determine which axons will recover or degenerate after injury. Several groups have studied the pressure threshold for axonal injury within a nerve, but difficulty accessing the injured region; insufficient imaging methods and the extremely small dimensions involved have prevented the evaluation of the response of individual axons to injury. We combined microfluidics with atomic force microscopy and in vivo imaging to estimate the threshold force required to 1), uncouple axonal transport without impairing axonal survival, and 2), compromise axonal survival in both individual and bundled axons. We found that rat hippocampal axons completely recover axonal transport with no detectable axonal loss when compressed with pressures up to 65 +/- 30 Pa for 10 min, while dorsal root ganglia axons can resist to pressures up to 540 +/- 220 Pa. We investigated the reasons for the differential susceptibility of hippocampal and DRG axons to mechanical injury and estimated the elasticity of live axons. We found that dorsal root ganglia axons have a 20% lower elastic modulus than hippocampal axons. Our results emphasize the importance of the integrity of the axonal cytoskeleton in deciding the axonal fate after damage and open up new avenues to improve injury diagnosis and to identify ways to protect axons.

Schizophrenia-Like Features in Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Human HO-1 in the Astrocytic Compartment	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN EXPRESSION; HEME OXYGENASE-1 EXPRESSION; INCREASE LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; SPINAL CORD BARRIER; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; IMMUNE ACTIVATION; OVER-EXPRESSION	Delineation of key molecules that act epigenetically to transduce diverse stressors into established patterns of disease would facilitate the advent of preventive and disease-modifying therapeutics for a host of neurological disorders. Herein, we demonstrate that selective overexpression of the stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in astrocytes of novel GFAP.HMOX1 transgenic mice results in subcortical oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage/autophagy; diminished neuronal reelin content (males); induction of Nurr1 and Pitx3 with attendant suppression of their targeting miRNAs, 145 and 133b; increased tyrosine hydroxylase and alpha-synuclein expression with down-regulation of the targeting miR-7b of the latter; augmented dopamine and serotonin levels in basal ganglia; reduced D-1 receptor binding in nucleus accumbens; axodendritic pathology and altered hippocampal cytoarchitectonics; impaired neurovascular coupling; attenuated prepulse inhibition (males); and hyperkinetic behavior. The GFAP.HMOX1 neurophenotype bears resemblances to human schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental conditions and implicates glial HO-1 as a prime transducer of inimical (endogenous and environmental) influences on the development of monoaminergic circuitry. Containment of the glial HO-1 response to noxious stimuli at strategic points of the life cycle may afford novel opportunities for the effective management of human neurodevelopmental and neuro-degenerative conditions.

J	Chudasama, Y; Doobay, VM; Liu, YC				Chudasama, Yogita; Doobay, Victoria M.; Liu, Yuchen			Hippocampal-Prefrontal Cortical Circuit Mediates Inhibitory Response Control in the Rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS-LEUKOAGGLUTININ; REACTION-TIME-TASK; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE; ANTEROGRADE TRANSPORT; PROJECTION NEURONS; VENTRAL STRIATUM; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTEX; LESIONS	We investigated the interdependent function of the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) in visuospatial attention and inhibitory control using a disconnection lesion approach. Rats were trained, and several aspects of their cognitive performance tested on the 5-choice reaction time task. The animals were prepared with unilateral lesions of both the vPFC and vHC, either in the same hemisphere ("ipsilateral") or in opposite hemispheres ("disconnection"). The disconnection lesion led to both impulsive and compulsive behavior. This deficit is reminiscent of the effects of either bilateral vPFC or bilateral vHC lesions on the same task and is thought to reflect the bihemispheric disruption of the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit. With ipsilateral lesions, behavioral deficits were transient or absent altogether, suggesting that the intact hemisphere was able to exert near normal levels of behavioral control. These behavioral effects were observed in the absence of any changes to visual attention, speed of response, or general motivation. This study provides evidence that optimal inhibitory control of behavior draws upon the functional interaction between the vHC and vPFC.
