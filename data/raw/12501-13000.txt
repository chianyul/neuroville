The health and psychosocial functioning of caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Caregivers; health status; disabled children; developmental disabilities; epidemiology	PARENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CHRONIC PHYSICAL DISORDERS; POPULATION-BASED ANALYSIS; SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; LIFE-COURSE IMPACTS; FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES; CHRONIC ILLNESS	Purpose. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (Neuro) pose complex parenting challenges, particularly if the condition co-occurs with behaviour problems. Such challenges are likely to impact caregiver health and well-being. This study explores the extent to which caregivers of children with both Neuro and behaviour problems differ in their physical and psychosocial outcomes from caregivers of children with either condition or neither condition. Method. The first wave of data collected in the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth in Canada (1994) was used to identify four groups of caregivers of 4-to 11-year-old children: caregivers of children with a Neuro disorder and externalising behaviour problems (Both; n=414), caregivers of children with a Neuro disorder only (Neuro Only; n=750), caregivers of children with an externalising behaviour problem only (Ext Only; n=1067), and caregivers of children with neither health condition (Neither; n=7236). Results. Caregivers in the Both group were least likely to report excellent or very good health, and more frequently reported chronic conditions such as asthma, arthritis, back problems, migraine headaches, and limitations in activities as compared to the Neither group. This group also exhibited higher depression scores, experienced more problematic family functioning and reported lower social support than the Neither group. Scores for caregivers in the Ext Only and Neuro Only groups tended to lie between the Both and Neither group scores and often did not differ from one another. Conclusions. Caregivers of children with both neurovelopmental disorders and behaviour problems exhibited a greater number of health and psychosocial problems. While addressing children's behaviour problems, health care professionals should also consider caregiver physical and psychosocial health, as this may also have an impact on children's well-being.

Method: 61 women recruited from public Substance abuse treatment centers in Montreal, Canada participated in the current study, 84% of whom reported past 30-day polysubstance use. Mood states, craving, and drug use were assessed by standard clinical instruments and by electronic interviews during 7-days of computerized ambulatory monitoring. Feasibility was assessed by examining compliance with intensive monitoring and equipment loss. Concurrent validity was assessed by examining the degree of correspondence of ambulatory data on craving, mood, and Substance use with clinic-based assessments of similar constructs. Result: Participants completed an average 80% of all electronic assessments and no data collection devices were lost or stolen. Relationships among mood, stress, consumption, and craving assessed in the electronic interviews conformed to well-established patterns, and evidence of concurrent validity were found between scores from standard clinical instruments and similar constructs in daily life. Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD) scores were positively related to sad mood reported during the electronic interviews (p = 0.001) and negatively related to happy mood states (p<0.001), explaining approximately 20% of the variance in each mood state. ASI drug use seventy scores were positively associated with craving (p<0.001) and substance use (p<0.001), and explained 46% and 30% of these outcomes, respectively. Conclusion: Computerized ambulatory monitoring is a feasible and valid data collection strategy in drug-dependent individuals. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Plosker, GL; Gauthier, S				Plosker, Greg L.; Gauthier, Serge			Cerebrolysin A Review of its Use in Dementia	DRUGS & AGING			English	Article						Cerebrolysin; neurotrophic; Alzheimer's disease; vascular dementia; dementia; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; therapeutic use; tolerability	NEUROTROPHIC AGENT CEREBROLYSIN(R); CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINE; GLUT1 GLUCOSE-TRANSPORTER; SEVERE ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN-TISSUE HYDROLYSATE; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; TRANSGENIC MODEL; VASCULAR DEMENTIA; DRUG CEREBROLYSIN	Cerebrolysin is a parenterally administered, porcine brain-derived peptide preparation that has pharmacodynamic properties similar to those of endogenous neurotrophic factors. In several randomized, double-blind trials of up to 28 weeks' duration in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Cerebrolysin was superior to placebo in improving global outcome measures and cognitive ability. A large, randomized comparison of Cerebrolysin, donepezil or combination therapy showed beneficial effects on global measures and cognition for all three treatment groups compared with baseline. Although not as extensively studied in patients with vascular dementia, Cerebrolysin has also shown beneficial effects on global measures and cognition in this patient population. Cerebrolysin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with dizziness (or vertigo) being the most frequently reported adverse event. Although further studies with Cerebrolysin, including longer term trials and further exploration of its use in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors, are needed to more clearly determine its place in the management of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, available data suggest that Cerebrolysin is a useful addition to the treatment options available for dementia. Pharmacological Properties Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Cerebrolysin has neurotrophic effects similar to those of endogenous neurotrophic factors. Cerebrolysin improved the viability of cultured neurons in vitro and rescued medial septal cholinergic neurons following intraperitoneal administration in rats after transections of fimbria-fornix in the brain. Peripheral administration of Cerebrolysin also produced neuroprotective effects, limiting neuronal dysfunction and maintaining the structural integrity of neurons under detrimental conditions in preclinical studies in animal models. In addition, Cerebrolysin showed effects as a synaptic modulator, potentially improving the integrity of neuronal circuits in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (mThy 1-hAPP751), and various in vitro and in vivo studies showed that Cerebrolysin promotes neurogenesis. Behavioural effects, including amelioration of performance deficits in transgenic mice (mThy1-hAPP751), have also been demonstrated with Cerebrolysin. Although its mechanism of action at a molecular level has not been fully elucidated, a potentially significant effect of Cerebrolysin is that of reduced phosphorylation of the amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta peptide production via modulation of kinases GSK3 beta and CDK5. Taken together, preclinical and radiolabelling studies indicate that, following peripheral administration, Cerebrolysin crosses the blood-brain barrier in sufficient concentrations to produce pharmacodynamic effects in the CNS. Therapeutic Efficacy Several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 28 weeks' duration in patients with Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated that, compared with placebo, intravenously administered Cerebrolysin produced a consistent, statistically significant improvement on global measures, as assessed by Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) or Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of severity or change (CGIS/C). Several of these studies also showed statistically significant improvements on cognition, as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) or its extended version (ADAS-cog-plus). Beneficial effects of Cerebrolysin on these co-primary outcomes were observed in patients with mild to moderate disease as well as in subgroups of patients with greater cognitive impairment at baseline, and when outcomes were measured at the end of the treatment period or several weeks after the final dose. A large, randomized, 28-week comparison of Cerebrolysin, donepezil or combination therapy showed beneficial effects on global measures (CIBIC-plus scores) and cognition (ADAS-cog-plus scores) for all three treatment groups compared with baseline. Although effects on cognitive improvement were most pronounced with combination therapy (-2.339), followed by Cerebrolysin (-1.708) then donepezil (-1.258), there were no statistically significant differences between groups. The proportions of CIBIC responders in the respective treatment groups were 62.7%, 64.1% and 37.8%. Beneficial effects of Cerebrolysin on other outcomes, including behaviour (as assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory), were shown in some trials. In patients with vascular dementia, Cerebrolysin was superior to placebo, as assessed by CIBIC-plus and ADAS-cog (co-primary endpoints) in a large, well designed, 24-week trial. Other studies with Cerebrolysin in patients with vascular dementia have also demonstrated beneficial effects on global outcomes and cognition. Tolerability Tolerability data from studies in patients with dementia indicate that Cerebrolysin was generally well tolerated in all clinical trials. The incidence of any treatment-emergent adverse event was 43.4-64% with Cerebrolysin compared with 38.0-73% with placebo in three larger, placebo-controlled trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Commonly reported adverse events with both Cerebrolysin and placebo included dizziness (or vertigo), headache, increased sweating, nausea, urinary tract infection, depression and fever, although there was marked variability between studies in terms of the type and incidence of adverse events. The incidence of adverse events in the large, active-comparator trial was generally similar between Cerebrolysin, donepezil and combination therapy arms. The most frequently reported adverse events with Cerebrolysin-containing regimens included aggression, agitation, anorexia, arthralgia, delusion, dizziness, headache, hypokinesia, insomnia and urinary tract infection. Donepezil was most frequently associated with diarrhoea, dysthymic disorder, muscle spasms and nausea. In general, adverse events reported with Cerebrolysin in patients with Alzheimer's disease were broadly similar to those reported in patients with vascular dementia.

Aims: The present study examined the effects of maternal anxiety during infant hospitalization in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) on the interactive behavior of mothers with their very low birthweight (VLBW) children in toddlerhood. Subjects: A sample of 56 mothers and their VLBW infants were recruited in the NICU. Study design During the infant's NICU stay, mothers completed a self-report measure of trait anxiety. These mothers and their infants were followed when the infants were 24 months corrected age, when mothers and their children were videotaped during free play at home. These videotapes were then coded using the Emotional Availability Scales. Results: Maternal anxiety was not found to be related to severity of neonatal illness. Maternal anxiety in the NICU was associated with less sensitivity and less structure in interaction with their toddlers at 24 months corrected age, even controlling for maternal education and child birthweight. Children of mothers with higher anxiety scores in the NICU were less likely to involve their mothers in their play at 24 months corrected age. Conclusions: Maternal anxiety in the NICU predicted adverse interactive behaviors when the children were 24 months corrected age. Early identification of anxious mothers in the NICU is needed in order to initiate preventive intervention to support the mother-infant relationship. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The application of these advances, as well as those in electronic amplification and recording, led to the discovery of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) by Hans Berger, a German psychiatrist. Originally received with skepticism, the EEG became a subject of intense interest, and after World War II, became a leading clinical and experimental tool in neurology. Today, it remains important especially in the study and treatment of epilepsy. Though the EEG has also given rise to more sophisticated applications, these remain based on Berger's initial work, one of the great discoveries of medical history.

We sought to determine which cells express P450cc and whether neurosteroids play a role in the regulation of epileptogenesis following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Rats experienced uninterrupted SE or SE terminated with diazepam at 60, 120, and 180 min. P450scc induction in CA3 hippocampus was determined by double immunolabeling with P450scc antiserum and monoclonal antibodies against GFAP (astrocytes), RIP (oligodendrocytes), or heme oxygenase-1 (microglia). SE was associated with P450scc induction in many astrocytes and a small number of microglia and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampal CA3 strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare. The extent of P450scc induction increased with increasing SE duration. Paradoxically, increased P450scc induction in rats experiencing SE for 180 min or more was associated with the delayed onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Treatment with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride (100 mg/kg/day for 25 days), which inhibits the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor modulating neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, was associated with a significant reduction in time to the onset of spontaneous seizures in rats exposed to 180-min but not 90-min SE. P450scc is induced by SE in a diverse population of hippocampal glia. Induction of P450scc is associated with the delayed onset of spontaneous seizures. Conversely, inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis accelerated the onset of spontaneous seizures, but only in animals exhibiting significant increases in P450scc. These findings suggest that induction of neurosteroid synthesis in reactive glial cells is associated with delayed onset of spontaneously recurrent seizures.

Dysplastic cortex can generate epileptiform discharges, which then use the connectivity retained by the abnormal tissue to propagate. We studied pieces of cortex, dysplastic or not, obtained during the surgical resection of the epileptigenic zone in patients suffering from intractable epilepsy. In slices of cortical tissue maintained in vitro, we analyzed the properties of the dysplastic cortex, which could explain its ability to generate abnormal discharges. In this brief review of our results we show that: 1) cortical tissue from the epileptogenic zone, dysplastic or not, challenged with the convulsing drug 4-aminopyridine, generates synchronous potentials that are mainly contributed by gaba-A receptor-mediated conductances; 2) slices from dysplastic cortex have an intrinsic ability to generate, either spontaneously or when challenged with 4-aminopyridine, ictal-like epileptiform events; 3) ictal-like discharges are not observed in slices obtained from cortex with no dysplastic anomaly, even when challenged with 4-aminopyridine; 4) ictal-like discharges results from the activation of glutamate receptors and notably those of the N-methyl-D aspartate type; 5) ictal-like discharges need the involvement of gap junctions.

It is not surprising that frontal lobe dysfunctions have been proposed to underlie antisocial behaviour in individuals without apparent lesions. However, physical aggression and violence have never been systematically related to acquired lesions. Whereas, traditional neuropsychological testing identifies problems in cognitive and emotional information processing, recent brain-imaging studies have revealed both the frontal structural and functional underpinnings of antisocial behaviour. Careful characterization of antisocial behaviour subtypes seems to indicate that cognitive-neuropsychological function is systematically poor in physical aggression and hyperactivity. Recent refinements point to biological and genetic moderators of that association.

In the present study, we sought to determine if such data could be obtained in rat, with a microPET (R4, Concorde Microsystems). Methods Scans from isoflurane-anaesthetised rats (n=18, including six test-retest) were co-registered with magnetic resonance imaging data, and binding potential, blood to plasma ratio and radiotracer efflux were estimated according to a simplified reference tissue model. Results Values of binding potential for hippocampus (1.2), entorhinal cortex (1.1), septum (1.1), medial prefrontal cortex (1.0), amygdala (0.8), raphe nuclei (0.6), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (0.5) and raphe obscurus (0.5) were comparable to those previously measured with PET in cats, non-human primates or humans. Test-retest variability was in the order of 10% in the larger brain regions (hippocampus, medial prefrontal and entorhinal cortex) and less than 20% in small nuclei such as the septum and the paraventricular hypothalamic, basolateral amygdaloid and raphe nuclei. Conclusions MicroPET brain imaging of 5-HT1A receptors with [F-18] MPPF thus represents a promising avenue for investigating 5-HT1A receptor function in rat.

Objective: To address the etiology, incidence, and oncologic impact of PSM and discuss technical points to help surgeons minimize their positive margin rate. An evidence-based approach to assist clinicians in counseling patients with a PSM is provided. Evidence acquisition: A literature search in English was performed using the National Library of Medicine database and the following key words: prostate cancer, surgical margins, and radical prostatectomy. Seven hundred sixty-eight references were scrutinized, and 73 were selected for rigorous review based on their pertinence, study size, and overall contribution to the field. Evidence synthesis: In contemporary series, PSM are reported in 11-38% of patients undergoing RP. Although variability exists in the pathologic interpretation of surgical margins, PSM are associated with an increased hazard of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and local disease recurrence as well as the need for secondary cancer treatment. A posterolateral PSM appears to confer the greatest risk of recurrence, whereas the prognostic significance of positive apical margins remains controversial. The role of preoperative imaging and intraoperative frozen section analysis are being investigated to reduce margin positivity rates. Level-1 evidence indicates that adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in men with PSM reduces BCR rates and clinical progression and possibly improves overall survival (OS). Conclusions: PSM in RP specimens are uniformly considered an adverse outcome. Regardless of approach (open or laparoscopic), attention to surgical detail is essential to minimize rates. For patients with a PSM destined to experience a cancer recurrence, RT is the only established treatment with curative potential. A randomized trial in patients with PSM comparing immediate postoperative RT to salvage RT is critically needed before definitive recommendations can be made.

But recent evidences have shown that the brain can rewire itself, showing an impressive range of cross-modal plasticity. Visual deprivation is one of the rare human models that allow us to explore the role of experience-dependent plasticity of a sensory cortex deprived of its natural inputs. The objective of this paper is to describe recent results regarding the spatial processing of sounds in blind subjects. These studies suggest that blind individuals may demonstrate exceptional abilities in auditory spatial processing and that such enhanced performances may be intrinsically linked to the recruitment of occipital areas deprived of their normal visual inputs. Such results highlight the brain's remarkable ability to rewire its components to compensate for the challenging neurological condition that is visual deprivation. Moreover, we shall discuss that such cross-modal recruitment may, to some extent, follow organizational principles similar to the functional topography of the region observed in the sighted. Even if such recruitment is especially present in individuals having lost their sight in early infancy, occipital regions also show impressive plastic properties when vision is lost at a later age. This observation will be related to recent results demonstrating that occipital regions play a more important role than previously expected in the spatial processing of sounds, even in sighted subjects. Putative physiological mechanisms underlying such cross-modal recruitment will then be discussed. All these results have important implications for understanding the role of visual experience in shaping the development of occipital regions and may guide the implementation of rehabilitative methods such as sensory substitution or neural implants.

They can accurately compare stimuli placed in each hand and they perform normally on lateralized recognition tasks. They, however, show impairment in tasks assessing interdependent motor control, bilateral coordination and they are also unable to intermanually transfer an implicit procedural motor skill. These deficits suggest that compensation might be limited when a motor component is involved. Alternately, it is also possible that interhemispheric transmission in callosal agenesis might be limited when implicit or unconscious processes are involved (Berlucchi et al. in Neuropsychologia 33:923-936, 1995; De Guise et al. in Brain 122:1049-1062, 1999). The aim of the present study was to assess interhemispheric transfer in two distinct nondeclarative tasks, namely visuoperceptual skill learning and perceptual priming, with a lateralized version of the fragmented picture task developed by Snodgrass et al. (Behav Res Methods Inst Comp 19:270-274, 1987) that did not involve any motor component. The performance of five acallosal and one early-callosotomized individuals was compared to that of control participants divided into four groups (n = 10) according to which hemisphere was trained (left or right) and which response mode was used (manual or verbal). Visuoperceptual skill learning was observed in all control groups except for the group submitted to training of the left hemisphere in the manual modality of response. The acallosal and early-callosotomized participants did not show any implicit learning of the visuoperceptual skill on any of the conditions. The evaluation of the perceptual priming effect in the second part of the testing revealed that the priming effect was restricted to the trained hemisphere in participants without corpus callosum, as opposed to all neurogically intact participants who presented interhemispheric transfer of the priming effect. These findings indicate that the compensatory pathways, most probably subcortical commissures, are insufficient to allow interhemispheric transfer of perceptual priming, confirming the limits of neural plasticity in the absence of the corpus callosum. They also support the dissociation between declarative and nondeclarative memory in the split-brain and acallosal participants suggested by Berlucchi et al. (1995) and observed by De Guise et al. (Brain 122:1049-1062, 1999). These results are further discussed within the context of neurobiological theories of memory systems.

While postnatal identification of spinal hamartomas has been reported, a literature search did not reveal any published reports of prenatal identification of spinal hamartomas. Here we report a 46, XX fetus who presented at 20 weeks' gestation with a lower thoracic and lumbar kyphoscoliosis, suspected spina bifida, and amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels within the normal range. Interestingly, autopsy at 22 weeks revealed a lumbosacral spinal hamartoma with kyphoscoliosis. We discuss the differential diagnosis for such spinal masses which includes congenital tumors and spinal dysraphism. This case illustrates that spinal hamartomas should be considered as part of the prenatal differential diagnosis of spinal dysraphisms, especially in the presence of normal AFP levels.

Netrins are a family of extracellular proteins that direct cell and axon migration during embryogenesis. Three secreted netrins (netrins 1, 3 and 4), and two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored membrane proteins, netrins G1 and G2, have been identified in mammals. The secreted netrins are bifunctional, acting as attractants for some cell types and repellents for others. Receptors for the secreted netrins include the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) family, the Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), and the UNC-5 homolog family: Unc5A, B, C and D in mammals. Netrin Gs do not appear to interact with these receptors, but regulate synaptic interactions between neurons by binding to the transmembrane netrin G ligands NGL1 and 2. The chemotropic function of secreted netrins has been best characterized with regard to axon guidance during the development of the nervous system. Extending axons are tipped by a flattened, membranous structure called the growth cone. Multiple extracellular guidance cues direct axonal growth cones to their ultimate targets where synapses form. Such cues can be locally derived (short-range), or can be secreted diffusible cues that allow target cells to signal axons from a distance (long-range). The secreted netrins function as short-range and long-range guidance cues in different circumstances. In addition to directing cell migration, functional roles for netrins have been identified in the regulation of cell adhesion, the maturation of cell morphology, cell survival and tumorigenesis.

J	Griffin, JL; Des Rosiers, C				Griffin, Julian L.; Des Rosiers, Christine			Applications of metabolomics and proteomics to the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: lessons from downstream of the transcriptome	GENOME MEDICINE			English	Review								Functional genomic studies are dominated by transcriptomic approaches, in part reflecting the vast amount of information that can be obtained, the ability to amplify mRNA and the availability of commercially standardized functional genomic DNA microarrays and related techniques. This can be contrasted with proteomics, metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis (fluxomics), which have all been much slower in development, despite these techniques each providing a unique viewpoint of what is happening in the overall biological system. Here, we give an overview of developments in these fields 'downstream' of the transcriptome by considering the characterization of one particular, but widely used, mouse model of human disease. The mdx mouse is a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and has been widely used to understand the progressive skeletal muscle wasting that accompanies DMD, and more recently the associated cardiomyopathy, as well as to unravel the roles of the other isoforms of dystrophin, such as those found in the brain. Studies using proteomics, metabolomics and fluxomics have characterized perturbations in calcium homeostasis in dystrophic skeletal muscle, provided an understanding of the role of dystrophin in skeletal muscle regeneration, and defined the changes in substrate energy metabolism in the working heart. More importantly, they all point to perturbations in proteins, metabolites and metabolic fluxes reflecting mitochondrial energetic alterations, even in the early stage of the dystrophic pathology. Philosophically, these studies also illustrate an important lesson relevant to both functional genomics and the mouse phenotyping in that the knowledge generated has advanced our understanding of cell biology and physiological organization as much as it has advanced our understanding of the disease.

Cis-acting differences can be specifically measured by comparing relative levels of allelic transcripts within a sample. Allelic expression (AE) mapping for cis-regulatory variant discovery has been hindered by the requirements of having informative or heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes in order to assign the allelic origin of each transcript. In this study we have developed an approach to systematically screen for heritable cis-variants in common human haplotypes across >1000 genes. In order to achieve the highest level of information per haplotype studied, we carried out allelic expression measurements by using both intronic and exonic SNPs in primary transcripts. We used a novel RNA pooling strategy in immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and primary human osteoblast cell lines (HObs) to allow for high-throughput AE. Screening hits from RNA pools were further validated by performing allelic expression mapping in individual samples. Our results indicate that >10% of expressed genes in human LCLs show genotype-linked AE. In addition, we have validated cis-acting variants in over 20 genes linked with common disease susceptibility in recent genome-wide studies. More generally, our results indicate that RNA pooling coupled with AE read-out by second generation sequencing or by other methods provides a high-throughput tool for cataloging the impact of common noncoding variants in the human genome.

Lesions restricted to either the anterior or the retrosplenial cingulate region did not impair learning of this task which is known to be very sensitive to the effects of hippocampal lesions. Complete lesions of the cingulate cortex gave rise to only a minor retardation in learning. In contrast, lesions to the retrosplenial cortex impaired performance on a spatial navigation task and the classic radial maze. These results suggest that the retrosplenial portion of the cingulate region forms part of a hippocampal circuit underlying learning about spatial responses. The dissociation between the effects of lesions of the cingulate region on different classes of behavior known to be associated with hippocampal function suggests that, although this neural structure does play a role in an extended hippocampal circuit underlying spatial learning, its role in such learning may be a selective one.

Prolonged Voluntary Wheel-Running Stimulates Neural Precursors in the Hippocampus and Forebrain of Adult CD1 Mice	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						neurogenesis; exercise; proliferation; subventricular zone; neural stem cells	MOUSE DENTATE GYRUS; ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; CELL-PROLIFERATION; STEM-CELLS; VASCULAR NICHE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; NEUROGENESIS	Voluntary wheel-running induces a rapid increase in proliferation and neurogenesis by neural precursors present in the adult rodent hippocampus. In contrast, the responses of hippocampal and other central nervous system neural precursors following longer periods of voluntary physical activity are unclear and are an issue of potential relevance to physical rehabilitation programs. We investigated the effects of a prolonged, 6-week voluntary wheel-running paradigm on neural precursors of the CD1 mouse hippocampus and forebrain. Examination of the hippocampus following 6 weeks of running revealed two to three times as many newly born neurons and 60% more proliferating cells when compared with standard-housed control mice. Among running mice, the number of newly born neurons correlated with the total running distance. To establish the effects of wheel-running on hippocampal precursors dividing during later stages of the prolonged running regime, BrdU was administered after 3 weeks of running and the BrdU-retaining cells were analyzed 18 days later. Quantifications revealed that the effects of wheel-running were maintained in late-stage proliferating cells, as running mice had two to three times as many BrdU-retaining cells within the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and these yielded greater proportions of both mature neurons and proliferative cells. The effects of prolonged wheel-running were also detected beyond the hippocampus. Unlike short-term wheel-running, prolonged wheel-running was associated with higher numbers of proliferating cells within the ventral forebrain subventricular region, a site of age-associated decreases in neural precursor proliferation and neurogenesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that (i) prolonged voluntary wheel-running maintains an increased level of hippocampal neurogenesis whose magnitude is linked to total running performance, and (ii) that it influences multiple neural precursor populations of the adult mouse brain.

Rats were exposed to two identical objects in a circular open field for 7 min on seven consecutive days. In the 1-3 days after the last day of familiarization, rats received neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation (HPC) or sham lesions. Another two groups received the same lesions 3 weeks after familiarization. The rats were then placed back in the open field with one object displaced, and the time spent in each of the quadrants as well as time spent exploring the objects was recorded. Rats that received HPC lesions 3 weeks but not 1-3 days after familiarization showed evidence of preserved remote spatial memory; however, their remote memory was expressed through different behavior than control rats. Rats with HPC lesions spent more time with the displaced object than with the object that remained in the same place, whereas control rats spent more time in the quadrant where the displaced object used to be. These results suggest that remote spatial memories may be preserved with a sufficiently long familiarization-to-surgery interval before HPC lesions, but that the nature of these memories may differ in quantity and/or quality from those of intact rats.

Hippokratia			English	Article						pancreas; islets; transplantation; diabetes	PANCREAS TRANSPLANTATION; REVERSAL	Two types of transplants are offered to patients with complicated insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: a) whole pancreas transplantation. b) pancreatic islet transplantation. A total of 29000 whole pancreas transplantations and 1500 islet transplantations have been performed worldwide until today. Patient survival for whole pancreas recipients is 85% five years after transplantation, whereas very few islet studies focus on patient survival. Graft survival for whole pancreas recipients is 90%, 70% and 45%, at one, five and ten years after transplantation respectively. On the other hand, only 44% of islet recipients are still insulin free, one year after engraftment. If the definition of a successful islet transplantation is not insulin independence but production of C-peptide, then 80% of the same islet recipients have a functioning graft by the end of the first post-transplant year. It is a known fact that whole pancreas transplantation has significant complications. The most common complications after whole organ transplantation include technical failures, acute rejection and CMV infection, whereas islet transplantation is associated with portal vein thrombosis, bleeding. emergency exploratory laparotomy, liver steatosis and rapamune-induced mouth ulcers. The cumulative cost of a whole organ transplantation is about $40,000. On the other hand, the cumulative cost of a pancreatic islet transplant is estimated to be higher than S 120,000. Whole organ transplantation halts the late complications of diabetes, namely vasculopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Although similar claims are made for islet transplantation, its impact on long-term diabetic complications is possible but not proven. Currently, in North America, lean young donors are utilized for whole organ transplants, whereas overweight or older donors are utilized for islet transplants. In conclusion, although islet transplantation is an extremely promising therapy and probably the way of the future, whole organ transplant is still the gold standard according to evidence-based medicine.

Methods: The charts of 28 patients seen between ages 12 and 18 years were reviewed. Physical and neurodevelopmental data were compared between patients diagnosed by chance (amniocentesis, group A, n = 11) or on the basis of symptoms (group B, n = 17) and the general population. Our hypothesis was that group A would have a more heterogeneous and less severe phenotype than group B. Results: All patients had spontaneous puberty. The 2 patient groups were similar in physical development. Mean testosteronemia became lower than the normal mean from age 14 years. Compared to the general population, the prevalence of gynecomastia and school delay in group A was not significantly different (gynecomastia 33 vs. 40%, p = 0.70; school delay 40 vs. 20%, p = 0.25). In contrast, gynecomastia (77%) and school delay (56%) were significantly more frequent in group B than in the general population (p = 0.01 for both). Conclusions: Although they are based on a small number of patients, our data provide the groundwork for cautious optimism in prenatal counselling for Klinefelter syndrome. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Regions of primary sensory and motor cortex, which develop earlier, both phylogenetically and ontologically, show relatively greater genetic effects earlier in childhood. Later developing regions within the dorsal prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes conversely show increasingly prominent genetic effects with maturation. The observation that regions associated with complex cognitive processes such as language, tool use, and executive function are more heritable in adolescents than children is consistent with previous studies showing that IQ becomes increasingly heritable with maturity(Plomin et al. [1997]: Psychol Sci 8:442-447).

This agent is capable of learning and remembering events and any related information such as corresponding procedures, stimuli and their emotional valences. Our proposed episodic memory and episodic learning mechanism are closer to the current multiple-trace theory in neuroscience, because they are inspired by it [5] contrary to other mechanisms that are incorporated in cognitive agents. This is because in our model emotions play a role in the encoding and remembering of events. This allows the agent to improve its behavior by remembering previously selected behaviors which are influenced by its emotional mechanism. Moreover, the architecture incorporates a realistic memory consolidation process based on a data mining algorithm.

We conducted an experimentation in which we exposed a group of 17 learners to a series of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while their electrical brain activity was recorded. We got 33.106 recordings. In an exploratory study we examined the influence of 24 picture categories from the IAPS on the amplitude variations of the 4 brainwaves frequency bands: delta, phi, alpha and beta. We used machine learning techniques to track the amplitudes in order to predict the dominant frequency band which inform about the learner mental and emotional states. Correlation and regression analyses show a significant impact of the emotional stimuli on the amplitudes of the brainwave frequency bands. Standard classification techniques were used to assess the reliability of the automatic prediction of the dominant frequency band. The reached accuracy was 90%. We discuss the prospects of extending our actual Brainwave-Sensing Multi Agent System to be integrated to an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) in the future.

Problem with such symbolic representation is that in a real environment object attributes are seldom invariant. We propose to divide images into rough parts using hierarchical, multi-valued processes. The bottom-up computation (BUC) is related to prediction where object attributes are approximated by different granules with properties similar to different brain areas: by dots as in the thalamus, by oriented lines as in the primary visual cortex, and by elementary shapes as in V4. There are a large number of possible combinations of elementary granules; therefore objects in BUC are overrepresented The top-down computation (TDC) fits prediction to hypothesis posed by more complex properties (higher brain areas). If the hypothesis check is positive, TDC verifies the object and eliminates other possible patterns. Such classifications take place in parallel at many functional units. We show an example of such hierarchical system computation on experimentally recorded data from monkey visual area (W).

The identification is based on analyzing the tip acceleration patterns induced in a metallic rod, dragged along a surface that is to be identified. Eight features in time and frequency domains are used for classification. Results show that for ten type of indoor and outdoor surfaces, reliable identification can be achieved (90.0 and 94.6 percent for a 1 and 4 seconds time-window, respectively), using a non-sophisticated classifier (artificial neural network).

A Recurrent Neural-Network-Based Sensor and Actuator Fault Detection and Isolation for Nonlinear Systems With Application to the Satellite's Attitude Control Subsystem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Attitude control subsystem (ACS); dynamic neural networks; fault detection and isolation (FDI); nonlinear systems	IDENTIFICATION; MANIPULATORS; OBSERVER	This paper presents a robust fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for a general class of nonlinear systems using a neural-network-based observer strategy. Both actuator and sensor faults are considered. The nonlinear system considered is subject to both state and sensor uncertainties and disturbances. Two recurrent neural networks are employed to identify general unknown actuator and sensor faults, respectively. The neural network weights are updated according to a modified backpropagation scheme. Unlike many previous methods developed in the literature, our proposed FDI scheme does not rely on availability of full state measurements. The stability of the overall FDI scheme in presence of unknown sensor and actuator faults as well as plant and sensor noise and uncertainties is shown by using the Lyapunov's direct method. The stability analysis developed requires no restrictive assumptions on the system and/or the FDI algorithm. Magnetorquertype actuators and magnetometer-type sensors that are commonly employed in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for attitude determination and control are considered in our case studies. The effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed fault diagnosis strategy are demonstrated and validated through extensive simulation studies.	[Talebi, H.

Effects of Restraint and Immobilization on Electrosensory Behaviors of Weakly Electric Fish	ILAR JOURNAL			English	Article						curare; distress; electric fish; electric organ discharge (EOD); electrocommunication; immobilization; jamming avoidance response (JAR); pain; restraint; stress	APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; FREQUENCY; EIGENMANNIA; ALBIFRONS; STIMULI; NEURONS; SYSTEMS; STRESS; COMMUNICATION; ANESTHESIA	Weakly electric fishes have been an important model system in behavioral neuroscience for more than 40 years. These fishes use a specialized electric organ to produce an electric field that is typically below 1 volt/cm and serves in many behaviors including social communication and prey detection. Electrical behaviors are easy to study because inexpensive and widely available tools enable continuous monitoring of the electric field of individual or groups of interacting fish. Weakly electric fish have been routinely used in tightly controlled neurophysiological experiments in which the animal is immobilized using neuromuscular blockers (e. g., curare). Although experiments that involve immobilization are generally discouraged because it eliminates movement-based behavioral signs of pain and distress, many observable electrosensory behaviors in fish persist when the animal is immobilized. Weakly electric fish thus offer a unique opportunity to assess the effects of immobilization on behaviors including those that may reflect pain and distress. We investigated the effects of both immobilization and restraint on a variety of electrosensory behaviors in four species of weakly electric fishes and observed minor effects that were not consistent between the species tested or between particular behaviors. In general, we observed small increases and decreases in response magnitude to particular electrosensory stimuli. Stressful events such as asphyxiation and handling, however, resulted in significant changes in the fishes' electrosensory behaviors. Signs of pain and distress include marked reductions in responses to electrosensory stimuli, inconsistent responses, and reductions in or complete cessation of the autogenous electric field.

Cursive scripts with complex character shapes, such as Arabic and Persian, make the recognition task even more challenging. This complexity requires sophisticated representations and learning methods, and comprehensive data samples. A direct approaches to achieve a better performance is focusing on designing more powerful building blocks of a handwriting recognition system which are pattern representation and pattern classification. in this paper we aim to scale up the efficiency of online recognition systems for Arabic characters by integrating novel representation techniques into efficient classification methods. We investigate the idea of incorporating two novel feature representations for online character data. We.; advocate the usefulness and practicality of these features in classification methods using neural networks and support vector machines. The combinations of proposed representations with related classifiers can offer a module for recognition tasks which can deal with any two-dimensional online pattern. Our empirical results confirm the higher distinctiveness and robustness to character deformations obtained by the proposed representation compared to currently available techniques.

The majority of the deformations that occur in the normal course of adult, human development result in folds changing their length or width. Current statistical shape analysis methods cannot easily discriminate between these two cases. Using discrete exterior calculus and Tikhonov regularization, we develop a method to estimate a dense orientation field in the tangent space of a surface described by a triangulated mesh, in the direction of its folds. We then use this orientation field to distinguish between shape differences in the direction parallel to folds and those in the direction across them. We test the method quantitatively on synthetic data and qualitatively on a database consisting of segmented cortical surfaces of 92 healthy subjects and 97 subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The method estimates the correct fold directions and also indicates that the healthy and diseased subjects are distinguished by shape differences that are in the direction perpendicular to the underlying hippocampi, a finding which is consistent with the neuroscientific literature. These results demonstrate the importance of direction specific computational methods for shape analysis.

This proposed algorithm (SSIP) is used to simultaneously remove unnecessary neurons or weight connections from a given feed-forward neural network (NN) in order to "Optimize" its structure. Some modifications to the previous pruning algorithms published in [1] and [4] are also reported. Two versions of the combined SSIP are considered: In the first version, SSIP1, the modified IP is first applied to the given neural network in order to prune insignificant units, and their tire modified SSM is applied to the pruned network to remove unnecessary links. In the second version. SSIP2. the above procedure is applied to each layer in turn. working from the input layer to the output layer. The performances of the algorithms are compared using two real world applications, brain disease detection and texture classification. and the superiority of the SSIP pruning algorithm is demonstrated. This new algorithm can eliminate approximately 59% of the links in the initial oversized network in order to improve performance by approximately +39% and +26% for the sensitivity of learning, and generalization, respectively.

Here we investigated the parallelism between improved clinical symptoms and grey mater density (GMD) changes in the frontal region after quetiapine treatment in 15 schizophrenia patients. We hypothesize that improvement in clinical symptoms will be associated with Change in GMD in prefrontal regions of interest. By using voxel-based morphometry, paired t-test random-effect analysis showed a significant increase in GMD bilaterally in the inferior frontal cortex/orbitofrontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex after 5.5 months of treatment with quetiapine. This GMD increase was associated with a significant improvement in negative symptoms. When GMD was correlated with psychiatric assessment score::, there was a negative correlation between GMD in the anterior cingulate cortex and the Rating Scale for Emotional Blunting score (r=-665, P=0.008) and between the orbitofrontal gyrus and the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale negative score (r=-764, P=0.001). Results suggest that increased GMD in some frontal regions are associated with an improvement of negative symptoms. Although not unique to quetiapine, it would be reasonable to attribute the GMD changes in the study to treatment.

Neural network-based adaptive control of piezoelectric actuators with unknown hysteresis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						neural networks; adaptive control; hysteresis	NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; FERROMAGNETIC HYSTERESIS; MOTION CONTROL; MODEL; FRICTION; IDENTIFICATION; COMPENSATION; OBSERVERS; OPERATOR	This paper proposes a neural network (NN)-based adaptive control of piezoelectric actuators with unknown hysteresis. Based on the classical Duhem model described by a differential equation, the explicit solution to the equation is explored and a new hysteresis model is constructed as a linear model in series with a piecewise continuous nonlinear function. An NN-based dynamic pre-inversion compensator is designed to cancel Out the effect of the hysteresis. With the incorporation of the pre-inversion compensator, an adaptive control scheme is proposed to have the position of the piezoelectric actuator track the desired trajectory. This paper has three distinct features. First, it applies the NN to online approximate complicated piecewise continuous unknown nonlinear functions in the explicit solution to Duhem model. Second, an observer is designed to estimate the Output of hysteresis of piezoelectric actuator based on the system input and output. Third, the stability of the controlled piezoelectric actuator with the observer is guaranteed. Simulation results for a practical system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The results indicated that while form-from-motion (FFM) stimuli activated both lateral occipital complex (LOC) and MT complex (MT+), only the LOC remained significantly activated when contrasted with a global motion stimulus (GMS) with different coherence levels. Because of the large number of common characteristics shared between the stimuli, this contrast enabled us to isolate the regions implicated in form processing. The GMS on the other hand only activated MT+, reaching maximal intensity for low coherence. Overall, these data illustrate how two similar motion stimuli can elicit the participation of different cortical visual regions.

Emotivists argue that emotions are really felt in response to music, whereas cognitivists believe that: music is only representative of emotions. Psychophysiological recordings of emotional feelings to music might help to resolve the debate, but past studies have failed to show clear and consistent differences between musical excerpts of different emotional valence. Here, we compared the effects of pleasant and unpleasant musical excerpts on the startle eye blink reflex and associated body markers (such as the cotrugator and zygomatic activity, skin conductance level and heart rate). The startle eye blink amplitude was larger and its latency was shorter during unpleasant compared with pleasant music, suggesting that the defensive emotional system was indeed modulated by music. Corrugator activity was also enhanced during unpleasant music, whereas skin conductance level was higher for pleasant excerpts. The startle reflex was the response that contributed the most in distinguishing pleasant and unpleasant music. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that emotions were felt in response to music, supporting the emotivist stance. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The model learns simple vowel categories using a produce-and-perceive babbling algorithm in addition to listening to ambient speech. The model is similar to that of Westermann & Miranda (2004), but adds a dynamic aspect in that it adapts in both the articulatory and acoustic domains to changes in the child's speech patterns. The training data is designed to replicate infant speech sounds and articulatory configurations. By exploring a range of articulatory and acoustic dimensions, we see how the child might learn to draw correspondences between his or her own speech and that of a caretaker, whose productions are quite different from the child's. We also design an imitation evaluation paradigm that gives insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

The filters are intended to implement a low-distortion delay element for automatic biopotential detection in neural recording implants. Continuous-time OTA-C filters are used to realize a 9(th)-order equiripple transfer function presenting a constant group delay. This analog delay allows to process neural waveforms with reduced overhead compared with digital delays. An allpass transfer function is used to implement such analog delay because it achieves wider constant-delay bandwidth than all-pole does. Two filters realizations are compared for implementing it: the Cascaded structure and the Inverse follow-the-leader feedback filter. Their respective strengths and drawbacks are assessed by modeling parasitics and non-idealities of OTAs, and using transistor-level simulations. A power budget of 200 nA is used in both filters. Experimental measurements with the chosen topology are presented and discussed.

Augmented oxidative stress has been implicated in both neural and peripheral AD tissues. In this study, we determined whether short-wavelength near-infrared (NIR) spectrophotometry of blood plasma differentiates mild sporadic AD from normal aging. NIR analysis was conducted on 75 mu l plasma samples from 19 AD, 27 amnestic MCI, and 17 normal elderly control (NEC) persons using an optical fiber-coupled, holographic grating-based NIR spectrograph. Five spectral bands associated with heme, R-CH, R-OH, H(2)O, and R-NH functional groups were sensitive to oxidative modification in pre-clinical studies and were pre-selected to develop a logistic regression model for sample classification. This model differentiated AD from NEC samples with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 77%. Fifteen and twelve MCI patients were classified with the NEC and AD groups, respectively. The spectra were not influenced by age, gender, exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors or vitamin E, or sample storage time. The NIR data further implicate oxidative stress in the systemic pathophysiology of sporadic AD and differentiate mild (and possibly pre-clinical) AD from NEC individuals with moderate-high accuracy. The procedure is minimally-invasive, rapid, relatively-inexpensive, and may provide a useful biological marker of sporadic AD.

Due to the large numbers of affected patients, even interventions bringing about a relatively small delay in disease onset could have large public health effects. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to demonstrate the effectiveness of preventive interventions, but such trials raise specific methodological questions because they are new in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, and require large numbers of elderly subjects and lengthy follow-up periods. We performed a literature search to identify primary prevention RCTs for neurodegenerative dementia. The methodology of the trials was summarized and discussed during two expert meetings. Overall, 39 trials were identified that assessed dementia incidence or cognitive decline as a primary or secondary study outcome. Age was the most common selection criteria for target populations. Follow-up periods ranged from one month to nine years and were longest in studies measuring dementia incidence as an outcome. Results of RCTs have so far been generally negative and conflicting with those of observational studies, perhaps due to methodological issues. Future trials must therefore carefully consider the target population, outcomes and duration of follow-up to be used, and should assess the problem of attrition.

The use of a monoclonal ChAT antiserum against whole rat ChAT protein allowed for an optimal visualization of the small dendritic branches and fine varicose axons of cholinergic interneurons. PHA-L-labeled thalamic afferents were heterogeneously distributed throughout the core and shelf regions of nAcb, overlapping regionally with cholinergic somata and dendrites. At the ultrastructural level, Several hundred single-section profiles of PHA-L and ChAT-labeled axon terminals were analyzed for morphology, synaptic frequency, and the nature Of their Synaptic targets. The cholinergic profiles were small and apposed to various neuronal elements, but rarely exhibited a synaptic membrane specialization (5% in single ultrathin sections). Stereological extrapolation indicated that less than 15% of these cholinergic varicosities were synaptic. The PHA-L-labeled profiles were comparatively large and often synaptic (37% in single ultrathin sections), making asymmetrical contacts primarily with dendritic spines (>90%). Stereological extrapolation indicated that all PHA-L-labeled terminals were synaptic. In (double-labeled material, some PHA-L-labeled terminals were directly apposed to ChAT-labeled somata or dendrites, but synapses were never seen between the two types of elements. These observations demonstrate that the cholinergic innervation of rat nAcb is largely asynaptic. They confirm that the afferents from midline/intralaminar/paraventricular thalamic nuclei to rat nAcb synapse mostly oil dendritic spines, presumably of medium spiny neurons, and suggest that the excitatory drive of nAcb cholinergic interneurons from thalamus is indirect, either via substance P release from recurrent collaterals of medium spiny neurons and/or by extrasynaptic diffusion Of glutamate.

In the lung, TITF1/NKX2.1 activates the expression of genes critical for lung development and function. Titf/Nkx2.1(-/-) mice have pituitary and thyroid aplasia but also impairment of pulmonary branching. Humans with heterozygous TITF1/NKX2.1 mutations present with various combinations of primary hypothyroidism, respiratory distress, and neurological disorders. Objective: The objective of the study was to report clinical and molecular studies of the first patient with lethal neonatal respiratory distress from a novel heterozygous TITF1/NKX2.1 mutation. Participant: This girl, the first child of healthy nonconsanguineous French-Canadian parents, was born at 41 wk. Birth weight was 3460 g and Apgar scores were normal. Soon after birth, she developed acute respiratory failure with pulmonary hypertension. At neonatal screening on the second day of life, TSH was 31 mU/liter (N < 15) and total T(4) 245 nmol/liter (N = 120-350). Despite mechanical ventilation, thyroxine, surfactant, and pulmonary vasodilators, the patient died on the 40th day. Results: Histopathology revealed pulmonary tissue with low alveolar counts. The thyroid was normal. Sequencing of the patient's lymphocyte DNA revealed a novel heterozygous TITF1/NKX2.1 mutation (1207F). This mutation was not found in either parent. In vitro, the mutant TITF-1 had reduced DNA binding and transactivation capacity. Conclusion: This is the first reported case of a heterozygous TITF1/NKX2.1 mutation leading to neonatal death from respiratory failure. The association of severe unexplained respiratory distress in a term neonate with mild primary hypothyroidism is the clue that led to the diagnosis.

However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.

Identification of Genetic Mutations Associated With Attenuation and Changes in Tropism of Urabe Mumps Virus	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY			English	Article						Mumps virus; attenuation; vaccine; mutations	HEMAGGLUTININ-NEURAMINIDASE PROTEIN; RECOMBINANT VACCINIA VIRUS; SIALIC-ACID-BINDING; MEASLES-VIRUS; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; POLYMERASE PROTEIN; PHOSPHOPROTEIN-P; RNA-POLYMERASE; SENDAI-VIRUS; F-GENE	Although several effective mumps virus vaccines have been developed, almost nothing is known about the genetic changes responsible for loss of virulence. One vaccine, Urabe AM9, was withdrawn from the market because of insufficient attenuation. The vaccine was found to contain a mixture of viruses that could be distinguished based on the sequence of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene (HN). Viruses containing lysine at HN amino acid position 335 were isolated from cases of post-vaccination parotitis or meningitis whereas viruses containing glutamic acid at this position were not associated with post-vaccination disease. Using a rat based model of mumps neurovirulence, we demonstrate that this latter virus is significantly attenuated compared to a virus isolated from a patient with post-vaccination meningitis. Complete sequence analysis of the genomes of the two viruses identified sixteen genetic differences, some or all of which must be responsible for differences in virulence. These same genetic differences also account for changes in tropism in cell culture. J. Med. Virol. 81:130-138, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Impact of heme oxygenase-1 on cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol efflux and oxysterol formation in cultured astroglia	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; cholesterol; heme oxygenase-1; LXR; oxidative stress; oxysterols	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CARBON-MONOXIDE; RAT ASTROGLIA; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; CELLS; HOMEOSTASIS	Up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and altered cholesterol (CH) metabolism are characteristic of Alzheimer-diseased neural tissues. The liver X receptor (LXR) is a molecular sensor of CH homeostasis. In the current study, we determined the effects of HO-1 over-expression and its byproducts iron (Fe(2+)), carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin on CH biosynthesis, CH efflux and oxysterol formation in cultured astroglia. HO-1/LXR interactions were also investigated in the context of CH efflux. hHO-1 over-expression for 3 days (similar to 2-3-fold increase) resulted in a 30% increase in CH biosynthesis and a two-fold rise in CH efflux. Both effects were abrogated by the competitive HO inhibitor, tin mesoporphyrin. CO, released from administered CORM-3, significantly enhanced CH biosynthesis; a combination of CO and iron stimulated CH efflux. Free iron increased oxysterol formation three-fold. Co-treatment with LXR antagonists implicated LXR activation in the modulation of CH homeostasis by heme degradation products. In Alzheimer's disease and other neuropathological states, glial HO-1 induction may transduce ambient noxious stimuli (e.g. beta-amyloid) into altered patterns of glial CH homeostasis. As the latter may impact synaptic plasticity and neuronal repair, modulation of glial HO-1 expression (by pharmacological or other means) may confer neuroprotection in patients with degenerative brain disorders.

First published October 29, 2008; doi:10.1152/jn.91066.2008. The distinction between sensory inputs that are a consequence of our own actions from those that result from changes in the external world is essential for perceptual stability and accurate motor control. In this study, we investigated whether linear translations are encoded similarly during active and passive translations by the otolith system. Vestibular nerve afferents innervating the saccule or utricle were recorded in alert macaques. Single unit responses were compared during passive whole body, passive head-on-body, and active head-on-body translations (vertical, fore-aft, or lateral) to assess the relative influence of neck proprioceptive and efference copy-related signals on translational coding. The response dynamics of utricular and saccular afferents were comparable and similarly encoded head translation during passive whole body versus head-on-body translations. Furthermore, when monkeys produced active head-on-body translations with comparable dynamics, the responses of both regular and irregular afferents remained comparable to those recorded during passive movements. Our findings refute the proposal that neck proprioceptive and/or efference copy inputs coded by the efferent system function to modulate the responses of the otolith afferents during active movements. We conclude that the vestibular periphery provides faithful information about linear movements of the head in the space coordinates, regardless of whether they are self-or externally generated.

Pyrethroids can be listed among the widely used pesticides. The general population is potentially chronically exposed to pyrethroids mainly through food intake, but acute or sporadic exposures can also occur by other routes. Although pyrethroids are considered among the least toxic pesticides, their neurotoxic properties can affect humans, but current exposure levels in the population of Quebec are not known. The study thus aimed at assessing pyrethroid exposure in a rural, agricultural population during summer through measurements of urinary biomarkers. A total of 163 volunteers, 49 children and 114 adults, living in the Monteregie area of Quebec, participated in the study, which took place from June to August 2006, the period of intensive application of pesticides. Participants were asked to collect all their micturitions from 6 p. m. until the next morning, including first morning void, and to fill out a questionnaire to document factors that could potentially contribute to exposure. A gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry method was used to quantify six urinary metabolites resulting from pyrethroid biotransformation: cis- and trans-2,2-(dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (cDCCA and tDCCA), 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA), chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid (CDCA), cis2,2-(dibromovinyl)-2,2- dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (DBCA) and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid (FPBA). Distributions of amounts of the six metabolites excreted per unit of body weight, during a standardized 12-hr period, followed the same decreasing pattern in adults and in children: tDCCA > PBA > cDCCA > CDCA > DBCA > FPBA. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups, but amounts of metabolites varied greatly among individuals, suggesting important interindividual variations in the absorbed doses of these compounds. No consistent associations were observed between the excretion of correlated metabolites and the various factors documented by questionnaire (personal factors, life habits, sources of exposure). Comparison of the current data with those observed in an urban population of the same province during the summer of 2005 suggests a greater summertime exposure to some pyrethroids in the rural population.

Investigating the Multimodal Nature of Human Communication Insights from ERPs	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						P200; N300; ERPs; facilitation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EMOTIONAL PROSODY; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH; VISUAL-STIMULI; PERCEPTION; FACE	The multimodal nature of human communication has been well established. Yet few empirical studies have systematically examined the widely held belief that this form of perception is facilitated in comparison to unimodal or bimodal perception. In the current experiment we first explored the processing of unimodally presented facial expressions. Furthermore, auditory (prosodic and/or lexical-semantic) information was presented together with the visual information to investigate the processing of bimodal (facial and prosodic cues) and multimodal (facial, lexic, and prosodic cues) human communication. Participants engaged in an identity identification task, while event-related potentials (ERPs) were being recorded to examine early processing mechanisms as reflected in the P200 and N300 component. While the former component has repeatedly been linked to physical property stimulus processing, the latter has been linked to more evaluative "meaning-related" processing. A direct relationship between P200 and N300 amplitude and the number of information channels present was found. The multimodal-channel condition elicited the smallest amplitude in the P200 and N300 components, followed by an increased amplitude in each component for the bimodal-channel condition. The largest amplitude was observed for the unimodal condition. These data suggest that multimodal information induces clear facilitation in comparison to unimodal or bimodal information. The advantage of multimodal perception as reflected in the P200 and N300 components may thus reflect one of the mechanisms allowing for fast and accurate information processing in human communication.

However we have found that residue from commercially obtained 'pure' ethanol dispensed in plastic bottles interferes in some biochemical assays. We have observed a volume-dependent decrease in maximally bound ligand in radioimmunoassays of progesterone. The resulting shift in the standard curve leads to an underestimation of the analyte concentrations and to altered estimation of cross reactivity by competing ligands. These effects became apparent in assays with high sensitivity (500 pg or less). All sources of ethanol obtainable in Quebec contained impurities. A similar effect was also produced by 'pure' methanol. The reduction in maximally bound ligand was amplified when the alcohol was aliquoted using plastic pipette tips. We conclude that alcohols which have had any contact with plastics are not safe to use in immunoassays of progesterone (or its metabolites as estimated according to cross-reactivity after HPLC) and may affect other assays. If the use of alcohol and plastic tips cannot be avoided, the amount of alcohol used should be reduced to 1% or less. This can be accomplished by preparing steroid standards in assay buffers containing albumin or gelatin, which enhance the solubility of steroids in aqueous media. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Much of the work achieving this recognition of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter took place in the middle third of the twentieth century; a period that witnessed the dislocation of many people as a result of National Socialist policies in Germany, that country's expansionist conquests, and the Second World War. A few of the people who were obliged to emigrate from Europe played prominent roles in these discoveries. This paper describes some of their achievements and, in a way, pays tribute to them.

By incorporating individual variability conferred by genetic polymorphisms, health conditions, and physiological changes during development and aging, PBPK models are ideal for predicting chemical disposition in various subpopulations of interest. In order to improve the parameterization of PBPK models for healthy and health-impaired elderly (herein defined as those aged 65 yr and older), physiological parameter values were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, evaluated, and entered into a Microsoft ACCESS database. Database records include values for key age-specific model inputs such as ventilation rates, organ volumes and blood flows, glomerular filtration rates, and other clearance-related processes. In total, 528 publications were screened for relevant data, resulting in the inclusion of 155 publications comprising 1051 data records for healthy elderly adults and 115 data records for elderly with conditions such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, heart disease, and renal disease. There are no consistent trends across parameters or their associated variance with age; the gross variance in body weight decreased with advancing age, whereas there was no change in variance for brain weight. The database contains some information to inform ethnic and gender differences in parameters; however, the majority of the published data pertain to Asian (mostly Japanese) and Caucasian males. As expected, the number of records tends to decrease with advancing age. In addition to a general lack of data for parameters in the elderly with various health conditions, there is also a dearth of information on blood and tissue composition in all elderly groups. Importantly, there are relatively few records for alveolar ventilation rate; therefore, the relationship between this parameter and cardiac output (usually assumed to be 1:1) in the elderly is not well informed by the database. Despite these limitations, the database represents a potentially useful resource for parameterizing PBPK models for the elderly to facilitate the prediction of dose metrics in older populations for application in risk assessment.

In particular, the VOR exhibits remarkable recovery following the loss of unilateral labyrinthine input as a result of injury or disease. The relative simplicity of the pathways that mediate the VOR, make it an excellent model system for understanding the changes (learning) that occur in the brain following peripheral vestibular loss to yield adaptive changes. This mini review considers the findings of behavioral, single unit recording and lesion studies of VOR compensation. Recent experiments have provided evidence that the brain makes use of multiple plasticity mechanisms (i.e., changes in peripheral as well as central processing) during the course of vestibular compensation to accomplish the sensory-motor transformations required to accurately guide behavior.

Low-level mechanisms may contribute to paradoxical motion percepts	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						contrast sensitivity; detection/discrimination; visual cortex; motion-2D; temporal vision	CENTER-SURROUND INTERACTIONS; VISUAL AREA MT; HUMAN VISION; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; ALERT MACAQUE; CONTRAST; ANTAGONISM; MODULATION; THRESHOLD; DISPARITY	A recent series of experiments demonstrated a surprising deterioration of visual motion discrimination with increasing stimulus size for stimuli of high contrast. This counterintuitive finding was explained as a result of surround suppression in visual area V5. Equally paradoxical was the finding that older observers showed better performance than younger observers. This second result was explained as an age-related reduction in surround suppression due to changes in GABA-mediated inhibition. Using an opponent motion stimulus, we find an analogous effect and also find that this effect is much reduced in older observers, to the point where they perform better than younger observers. Our long duration stimulus should be beyond the range at which surround-suppressed neurons in V5 are preferentially activated. Having normalized our stimuli relative to contrast threshold, we show that our results can be entirely explained by the relative contrast of the stimulus and speculate that contrast sensitivity may play a role in previously reported results. Our older observers' data similarly can be explained by the relative contrast of the stimulus. The difference between older and younger observers appears to be a result of a weakening of spatial summation at high contrast in younger observers, perhaps caused by earlier saturation of motion mechanisms.

This psychophysical surround suppression has been linked to the inhibitory spatial surrounds that have been observed throughout the primate visual system. In this work we have examined a temporal factor that may also contribute to psychophysical surround suppression. Consistent with previous work, we found that psychophysical surround suppression is strongest when a high-contrast motion stimulus is presented very briefly so that the appearance of the stimulus coincided with its motion. However, when a brief delay was inserted between the stimulus onset and the onset of motion, the counterintuitive effects of stimulus size disappeared. The effect of the motion onset asynchrony (MOA) was strongest when the stationary stimulus immediately preceded the stimulus motion and when stimulus orientation during the MOA was very similar to that during the motion presentation. We conclude that psychophysical surround suppression is partially linked to the temporal structure of the stimulus, more precisely to a masking effect caused by sudden stimulus onsets (and to a smaller degree stimulus offsets).

Here we provide psychophysical evidence for neural multiplication in human visual processing of shape. We show that the curvature of a contour is likely detected by a mechanism that multiplies rather than adds the signals from afferent sub-units that detect parts of the curve. Using a novel perceptual after-effect, in which the perceived shape of a sinusoidal-shaped contour is altered following adaptation to a contour of slightly different sinusoidal shape, a pronounced 'dip' in the size of the after-effect is found when the adapting contour is broken into segments of a particular length and spacing. Simulations reveal that the presence and shape of the dip is only expected if the afferent sub-units to curvature detectors are multiplied. The after-effect itself is then best explained in terms of the population response of a range of such curvature detectors tuned to different curvatures.	[Gheorghiu, Elena; Kingdom, Frederick A.

Shapes of intermediate complexity serve as a step in the representation of such intricate constructs. Healthy aging has adverse effects on cortical function, and we sought to determine the effects of age on the efficacy and speed of neuronal mechanisms underlying shape processing. Using deformed circular shapes, we probe object representation by varying the characteristics that define the shape and by assessing lateral interactions among shapes. Results indicate that performance declines with age for shapes defined by texture but not by luminance. However, there is no age-related slowing for the processing of shape, and probes of lateral interactions reveal spared function for complex shape combinations. Findings suggest that the effect of age on shapes defined by texture arises from lower stages of visual processing, and that the representation of shape combinations is spared because of its robust nature.

Dichoptic difference thresholds for uniform color changes applied to natural scenes	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						natural scenes; phase scrambling; dichoptic; color vision	CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL SCALE; IMAGES; ADAPTATION; STATISTICS; INHIBITION; CONTRAST	It has recently been shown that the visual system is more sensitive to uniform color and/or luminance changes applied to raw compared to phase-scrambled images of natural scenes (A. Yoonessi & F. A. A. Kingdom, 2008). Here we consider whether the mechanisms responsible for the differential sensitivity operate before or after the point at which the signals from the two eyes are combined. Knowing this should help determine the types of nonlinearities responsible. Thresholds for detecting uniform color transformations applied to raw and phase-scrambled natural scenes were measured under two conditions: monocular, in which the discriminand pairs were placed side by side, and dichoptic, in which they were dichoptically superimposed. Subjects were required to select the pair of images that were transformed from two pairs of images in which the other pair was untransformed. In the dichoptic condition, the transformed image pair was identifiable by its lustrous appearance. In line with our previous findings, thresholds in the monocular condition were higher for the phase-scrambled compared to raw scenes. However in the dichoptic condition there was no significant difference between raw and phase-scrambled thresholds, suggesting that the differential sensitivity was mediated by mechanisms lying beyond the point of binocular combination. It is suggested that cortical neurons sensitive to edges but suppressed by neighboring texture might be responsible for the higher sensitivity to transformations applied to raw compared to phase-scrambled images of natural scenes.

To test this prediction a group of 40 non-confabulatory cases with a verbal and non-verbal retention deficit (hypomnesia), subsequent to a unilateral lesion, was assembled from the literature. A group of non-amnesic cases with confabulation, paramnesia, false memories or memory-laden hallucination (dysfunctional hypermnesia), due to a unilateral lesion, was also assembled from the literature (N=72). Most of the hypomnesic patients had left hemisphere lesions (73%, p.005, two tailed) while most of the hypermnesic patients had right hemisphere lesions (78%, p.0005, two tailed). This crossed double dissociation held good despite statistical control of the lesion's locus within the hemisphere, its size or its aetiology, presence of aphasic symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, the patient's age, gender, or hand preference, and several other potentially confounding variables.

In contrast to most morphometry methods which assume one-to-one correspondence between all subjects, FBM models images as a collage of distinct, localized image features which may not, be present in all subjects. FBM thus explicitly accounts for the case where the same anatomical tissue cannot be reliably identified in all subjects due to disease or anatomical variability. A probabilistic model describes features in terms of their appearance, geometry, and relationship to subgroups of a population, and is automatically learned from a set of subject images and group labels. Features identified indicate group-related anatomical structure that can potentially be used as disease biomarkers or as a basis for computer-aided diagnosis. Scale-invariant image features are used, which reflect generic, salient patterns in the image. Experiments validate FBM clinically in the analysis of normal (NC) and Alzheimer's (AD) brain images using the freely available OASIS database. FBM automatically identifies known structural differences between NC and AD subjects in a fully data-driven fashion, and obtains an equal error classification rate of 0.78 on new subjects.

We propose to automate the Graph Cuts in order to automatically segment Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in MRI. We replace the manual interaction with a robust, EM-based approach in order to discriminate between MS lesions, and the Normal Appearing Brain Tissues (NABT). Evaluation is performed in synthetic and real images showing good agreement between the automatic segmentation and the target segmentation. We compare our algorithm with the state of the art techniques and with several manual segmentations. An advantage of our algorithm over previously published ones is the possibility to semi-automatically improve the segmentation due to the Graph Cuts interactive feature.

The methods include: 1) our ANIMAL atlas-based method that uses non-linear registration to a pre-labeled non-linear average template (ICBM152). HC and AG labels, defined on the template are mapped through the inverse transformation to segment these structures on the subject's MRI; 2) template-based se-mentation, where we select the most similar MRI from the set of 80 labeled datasets to use as a template in the standard ANIMAL segmentation scheme; 3) label fusion methods where we combine segmentations from the V most similar templates. The label fusion technique yields the best results with median kappas of 0.886 and 0.826 for HC and AG, respectively.	[Collins, D.

As our application context is that of neurosurgical visualization, the experimental goal we chose was to define a straight, vessel-free path from the cortical surface to a targeted tumor. The scene consists of a volumetric representation of the brain vasculature and a simulated tumor, as well as a separately controlled pen-like virtual probe. Under both viewing conditions, participants were able to manipulate the volume and probe using a tangible user interface, thus obtaining hand-coupled motion cues. Results indicate that on average, participants were able to perform the task in the stereographic mode in only 75% of the time and with half the error as in the monoscopic condition.

Further, genomic technologies such as microarrays and quantitative and exquisitely sensitive techniques such as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction have made it possible to reliably generate millions of data points per experiment. The data can be high quality and yield entirely new insights into how gene expression is coordinated under complex physiological situations. It can also be that the data and interpretation are meaningless because of a lack of physiological context or experimental control. Thus, functional genomics is now being applied to study metabolic physiology with varying degrees of success. From the genome sequencing projects we also have the information needed to design chemical tools that can knock down a gene transcript, even distinguishing between splice variants in mammalian cells. Use of such technologies, inspired by nature's endogenous RNAi mechanism-microRNA targeting, comes with significant caveats. While the discipline of Pharmacology taught us last century that inhibitor action specificity is dependent on the concentration used, these experiences have been ignored by users of siRNA technologies. What we provide in this chapter is some considerations and observations from functional genomic studies. We are largely concerned with the phase that follows a microarray study, where a candidate gene is selected for manipulation in a system that is considered to be simpler than the in vivo mammalian tissue and thus the methods discussed largely apply to this cell biology phase. We apologize for not referring to all relevant publications and for any technical considerations we have also failed to factor into our discussion.

However, the molecular state of the substrate (NH(3) or NH(4)(+)) has been the subject of active debate. At least for bacterial Amt proteins, the model emerging from computational, X-ray crystal and mutational analysis is that NH(4)(+) is deprotonated at the exterior, conducted through the membrane as NH(3), and reprotonated at the cytoplasmic interface. A proton concomitantly is transferred from the exterior to the interior, although the mechanism is unclear. Here we discuss recent evidence indicating that an important function of at least some eukaryotic and bacterial Amts is to act as ammonium sensors and regulate cellular metabolism in response to changes in external ammonium concentrations. This is now well documented in the regulation of yeast pseudohyphal development and filamentous growth. As well, membrane sequestration of GlnK, a PII signal transduction protein, by AmtB has been shown to regulate nitrogenase in some diazotrophs, and nitrogen metabolism in some Gram-positive bacteria. Formation of GlnK-AmtB membrane complexes might have other, as yet undiscovered, regulatory roles. This possibility is emphasized by the discovery in some genomes of genes for chimeric Amts with fusions to various regulatory elements.

Multicompartment dynamical models that describe the dynamics and interactions of the vascular and metabolic components of evoked hemodynamic responses have been developed in the literature. In this work, multimodal data using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse correlation flowmetry (DCF) is used to estimate total baseline hemoglobin concentration (HBT0) in 7 adult subjects. A validation of the model estimate and investigation of the partial volume effect is done by comparing with time-resolved spectroscopy (TRS) measures of absolute HBT0. Simultaneous NIRS and DCF measurements during hypercapnia are then performed, but are found to be hardly reproducible. The results raise questions about the feasibility of an all-optical model-based estimation of individual vascular properties.

In this paper we present an alternative account in which music originated from a more general adaptation known as a Theory of Mind (ToM). ToM allows an individual to recognise the mental and emotional state of conspecifics, and is pivotal in the cultural transmission of knowledge. We propose that a specific form of ToM, Affective Engagement, provides the foundation for the emergence of music. Underpinned by the mirror neuron system of empathy and imitation, music achieves engagement by drawing from pre-existing functions across multiple modalities. As a multimodal phenomenon, music generates an emotional experience through the broadened activation of channels that are to be empathically matched by the audio-visual mirror neuron system.

These microelectrodes are also used in clinical settings to localize the locus of seizure initiation in epilepsy or to stimulate sub-cortical structures in patients with Parkinson's disease. In neural prosthetic systems, implanted microelectrodes record the electrical potential generated by specific thoughts and relay the signals to algorithms trained to interpret these thoughts. In this paper, we describe novel elongated multi-site neural electrodes that can record electrical signals and specific neural biomarkers and that can reach depths greater than 8mm in the sulcus of non-human primates (monkeys). We hypothesize that additional signals recorded by the multimodal probes will increase the information yield when compared to standard probes that record just electropotentials. We describe integration of optical biochemical sensors with neural microelectrodes. The sensors are made using sol-gel derived xerogel thin films that encapsulate specific biomarker responsive luminophores in their nanostructured pores. The desired neural biomarkers are O2, pH, K+, and Na+ ions. As a prototype, we demonstrate direct-write patterning to create oxygen-responsive xerogel waveguide structures on the neural microelectrodes. The recording of neural biomarkers along with electrical activity could help the development of intelligent and more user-friendly neural prosthesis/brain machine interfaces as well as aid in providing answers to complex brain diseases and disorders.

In European populations, the rs1387153 T allele is associated with increased FPG (beta = 0.06 mmol/l, P = 7.6 x 10(-29), N = 16,094), type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.08-1.22, P = 6.3 x 10(-5), cases N = 6,332) and risk of developing hyperglycemia or diabetes over a 9-year period (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.06-1.36, P = 0.005, incident cases N = 515). RT-PCR analyses confirm the presence of MT2 transcripts in neural tissues and show MT2 expression in human pancreatic islets and beta cells. Our data suggest a possible link between circadian rhythm regulation and glucose homeostasis through the melatonin signaling pathway.

FX and control subjects were exposed to complex sounds while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging assessment. Whereas normally-hearing individuals show well-balanced bilateral activation patterns in response to binaural auditory stimulation, the same stimuli produced stronger activation in the left hemisphere in FX. Combined with previous data, these findings reinforce the notion that the inferior colliculus is an essential auditory relay and that its loss cannot be significantly compensated.

A slice of pi: An exploratory neuroimaging study of digit encoding and retrieval in a superior memorist	NEUROCASE			English	Article						Memory; fMRI; Mnemonics; Method of loci; Brain; Emotion	VERBAL-LEARNING STRATEGIES; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; MNEMONIC DEVICES; CINGULATE CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TAXI DRIVERS; ACTIVATION; ROUTES	Subject PI demonstrated superior memory using a variant of a Method of Loci ( MOL) technique to recite the first digits of the mathematical constant pi to more than 2(16) decimal places. We report preliminary behavioral, functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI), and brain volumetric data from PI. fMRI data collected while PI recited the first 540 digits of pi (i.e., during retrieval) revealed increased activity in medial frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Encoding of a novel string of 100 random digits activated motor association areas, midline frontal regions, and visual association areas. Volumetric analyses indicated an increased volume of the right subgenual cingulate, a brain region implicated in emotion, mentalizing, and autonomic arousal. Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) testing indicated that PI is of average intelligence, and performance on mirror tracing, rotor pursuit, and the Silverman and Eals Location Memory Task revealed normal procedural and implicit memory. PI's performance on the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III) revealed average general memory abilities (50th percentile), but superior working memory abilities (99th percentile). Surprisingly, PI's visual memory (WMS-III) for neutral faces and common events was remarkably poor (3rd percentile). PI's self-report indicates that imagining affective situations and high emotional content is critical for successful recall. We speculate that PI's reduced memory for neutral/non-emotional faces and common events, and the observed increase in volume of the right subgenual cingulate, may be related to extensive practice with memorizing highly emotional material.

The effect of FTDP-17 mutations on tau phosphorylation by different kinases has been studied previously. However, it is not known how various FTDP-17 mutations affect tau dephosphorylation by phosphoprotein phosphatases. In this study we have observed that when transfected into HEK-293 cells, tau is phosphorylated on various sites that are also phosphorylated in diseased human brains. When transfected cells are lysed and incubated, endogenously phosphorylated tau is dephosphorylated by cellular protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and phosphatase 2B (PP2B), which are also present in the lysate. By using this assay and specific inhibitors of PP1, PP2A and PP2B, we have observed that the G272V mutation promotes tau dephosphorylation by PP2A at Ser(396/404), Ser(235), Thr(231), Ser(202/205) and Ser(214) and by PP2B at Ser(214) but inhibits dephosphorylation by PP2B at Set(396/404). The P301L mutation promotes tau dephosphorylation at Thr(231) by PP1 and at Ser(396/404), Thr(231), Ser(235) and Ser(202/205) by PP2A but inhibits dephosphorylation at Ser214 by PP2B. The V337M mutation promotes tau dephosphorylation at Ser(235), Thr(231) and Ser(202/205) by PP2A and at Ser(202/205) by PP2B whereas the R406W mutation promotes tau dephosphorylation at Ser(396/404) by PP1, PP2A and PP2B but inhibits dephosphorylation at Ser(202/205) and Ser(235) by PP1 and PP2A, respectively. Our results indicate that each FTDP-17 tau mutation not only site-specifically inhibits tau dephosphorylation on some sites but also promotes dephosphorylation by phosphatases on other sites.

Incidence and Prevalence of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Canada: A Systematic Review of the Literature	NEUROEPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Motor neuron disease; Epidemiology; Incidence; Prevalence; Canada	MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; SOUTH-EAST ENGLAND; ALS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS; MORTALITY; REGISTER; CRITERIA; COUNTIES; PLAYERS	Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although known to be rare, precise information on the frequency of ALS is essential to anticipate future demands on health resources and as baseline information for epidemiological studies. As part of a new ALS epidemiological initiative in Canada, we conducted a systematic review of published incidence and prevalence research in Canada. Methods: Electronic searches and bibliographic reviews of pertinent publications were conducted. Results: We identified 6 published studies from 4 Canadian provinces conducted between 1974 and 2004; 2 were available only as abstracts. Reported annual incidence rates were similar and study quality was generally good, but there was insufficient detail to adequately assess the methodological quality of 3 of the studies. The most recent studies reported an annual ALS age-adjusted incidence of 2.13 per 100,000 in Nova Scotia (2003-2004) and a crude mean annual incidence of 2.4 per 100,000 in Newfoundland and Labrador (2000-2004). Conclusions: There are limited data on the frequency of ALS in Canada. We found no studies from 6 of the Canadian provinces or from the territories. Future research is needed to estimate the frequency of occurrence of ALS in Canada. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Such findings have figured importantly in recent theories of drug addiction proposing that sensitized nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA) overflow in particular acts in concert with other alterations in the neurochemistry of this nucleus to promote drug seeking and self-administration. Yet, experiments in rodents, non-human primates and humans have not always detected behavioral or biochemical sensitization following drug exposure, bringing into doubt the utility of this In an effort to reconcile apparent discrepancies in the literature, this review assesses conditions model. that might affect the expression of sensitization during testing. Specifically, the role played by conditioned cues is reviewed. A number of reports strongly support a potent and critical role for conditioned stimuli in the expression of sensitization. Findings suggest that stimuli associated either with the presence or absence of drug can respectively facilitate or inhibit sensitized responding. It is concluded that the presence or absence of such stimuli during testing for sensitization in animal and human studies could significantly affect the results obtained. It is necessary to consider this possibility especially when interpreting the results of studies that fail to observe sensitized responding. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This neural activity can persist even when audition is restored through the implantation of a cochlear implant, raising the possibility that cross-modal plasticity can be detrimental to auditory performance in cochlear implant users. To determine the influence of visual information on auditory performance after restoration of hearing in deaf individuals, the ability to segregate conflicting auditory and visual information was assessed in fourteen cochlear implant users with varied degree of expertise and an equal number of participants with normal-hearing matched for gender. age and hearing performance. An auditory speech recognition task was administered in the presence of three incongruent visual stimuli (color-shift, random-dot motion and lip movement). For proficient cochlear implant users, auditory performance was equal to that of controls in the three experimental conditions where visual stimuli were presented simultaneously with auditory information. For non-proficient cochlear implant users, performance did not differ from that of matched controls when the auditory stimulus was paired with a visual stimulus that was color-shifted. However, significant differences were observed between the non-proficient cochlear implant users and their matched controls when the accompanying visual stimuli consisted of a moving random-dot pattern or incongruent lip movements. These findings raise several questions with regards to the rehabilitation of cochlear implant users. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This view of WM as being independent of MTL structures has recently been challenged by a small number of patient and neuroimaging studies, which have focused primarily on visual and visuospatial WM. In the present study we investigated material-specific lateralization of WM in 96 patients with unilateral damage to MTL stemming from TLE(56 left) and 30 control subjects using a pair of matched verbal and visuospatial supraspan tasks. Patients with unilateral TLE were impaired on both verbal and visuospatial WM tasks irrespective of the affected hemisphere. Patients with unilateral right TLE showed an additional deficit for visuospatial WM capacity when contrasted with patients with left TLE, whereas patients with unilateral left TLE showed increased intrusion errors on the verbal task when compared to patients with right TLE. These findings suggest a material-specific lateralization of WM in the MTL (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Like reaction time (RT), the amplitude of this ERP is reduced by the prior presentation of a semantically related stimulus. However, results of a few studies suggest that this semantic matching effect could be reduced when using already presented stimuli, and rapidly disappear with further presentations. On the other hand, the topography of the N400 on the scalp depends on the semantic category of the stimulus. Like the semantic matching effect, this category effect also seems to be smaller for already presented stimuli. Taken together, these facts suggest that the semantic processes indexed by the N400 could be absent for stimuli that have already been presented multiple times. Here, we show that this conclusion would be premature. We used the same semantic categorization task in conditions of massive repetition and in conditions of single presentation. We found that the effects of semantic matching and of semantic category on RTs and N400s were similar in the two conditions. Moreover, the localization of the sources of the independent components accounting for the match effect revealed brain regions that were common to both conditions. These results suggest that N400s and RTs could be used to study the semantic processes triggered by one content word. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Debruille, J.

A group of 96 patients aged 16 to 65 years, with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries, was recruited from 12 rehabilitation hospitals in Quebec. The IADL Profile was administered by an occupational therapist in each subject's home and community environment. Principal axis factoring and confirmatory factor analysis provide preliminary support for six correlated factors (F): (F1) going to grocery store/shopping for groceries, (F2) having a meal with guests/cleaning up, (F3) putting on outdoor clothing, (F4) obtaining information, (F5) making a budget, (F6) preparing a hot meal for guests. Total explained variance was 73.6%. Cronbach's alpha analysis revealed high to very high internal consistency for all scales ranging from .81 to .98; internal consistency of the total scale was very high (0.95). The findings suggest that the IADL Profile is a promising means of documenting both IADL independence and the repercussions of executive function deficits on everyday tasks in real-world environments.

In several brain areas, ethanol depresses glutamatergic excitatory transmission, but how it affects excitatory synapses on dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a crucial site for the development of drug addiction, is not known. We report here that in midbrain slices from rats, clinically relevant concentrations of ethanol (10-80 mM) increase the amplitude of evoked EPSCs and reduce their paired-pulse ratio in dopamine neurons in the VTA. The EPSCs were mediated by glutamate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. In addition, ethanol increases the frequency but not the amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs. Furthermore, ethanol increases extracellular glutamate levels in the VTA of midbrain slices. The effects of ethanol are mimicked by SKF 38393, a dopamine D(1) receptor agonist, and by GBR 12935, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and they are blocked by SKF 83566, a D(1) antagonist, or by reserpine, which depletes dopamine stores. The enhancement of sEPSC frequency reaches a peak with 40 mM ethanol and declines with concentrations >= 80 mM ethanol, which is quite likely a result of D(2) receptor activation as raclopride, a D(2) receptor blocker, significantly enhanced 80mM ethanol-induced enhancement of sEPSCs. Finally, 6, 7-dinitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (DNQX), an AMPA receptor antagonist, attenuates ethanol-induced excitation of VTA DA neurons. We therefore conclude that, acting via presynaptic D(1) receptors, ethanol at low concentrations increases glutamate release in the VTA, thus raising somatodendritic dopamine release, which further activates the presynaptic D(1) receptors. Enhancement of this positive feedback loop may significantly contribute to the development of alcohol addiction.

This technique allows to measure the oxygenation of the brain tissue. The particular problems involved in detecting regional brain oxygenation (rSO(2)) are discussed. The dominant chromophore (light absorber) in tissue is water. Only in the NIR light region of 650-1000 nm, the overall absorption is sufficiently low, and the NIR light can be detected across a thick layer of tissues, among them the skin, the scull and the brain. In this region, there are many absorbing light chromophores, but only three are important as far as the oxygenation is concerned. They are the hemoglobin (HbO(2)), the deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and cytochrome oxidase (CtOx). In the last 20 years there was an enormous growth in the instrumentation and applications of NIRS. The devices that were used in our experiments were: Somanetics's INVOS Brain Oximeter (IBO) and Toomim's HEG spectrophotometer. The performances of both devices were compared including their merits and drawbacks. The IBO is based on extensive efforts of an R&D group to develop a reliable device, which measures well the rSO(2). It is now used efficiently in operating rooms, saving human lives and expenses. Its use for research however has two drawbacks: the sampling rate is too small and the readings are limited to only two significant digits. The HEG device does not have these drawbacks, but is not developed sufficiently at this time to measure rSO(2). We have measured the HEG readings and compared them with the rSO(2) readings of the IBO. Our findings show that the HEG can be used to measure relative changes of rSO(2).

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate structural brain changes after only 15 months of musical training in early childhood, which were correlated with improvements in musically relevant motor and auditory skills. These findings shed light on brain plasticity, and suggest that structural brain differences in adult experts (whether musicians or experts in other areas) are likely due to training-induced brain plasticity.

This pitch deficit can be traced down to abnormal brain responses elicited by pitch changes smaller than a semitone in conditions requiring attention. Here, we use the mismatch negativity (MMN) to investigate pre-attentive pitch change detection in 10 amusics and eight matched controls. Results indicate similar MMN in amusics and controls, even for an eighth of atone change, revealing that the amusic brain can process small pitch changes at a pre-attentive level. Thus, the pitch deficit in congenital amusia may be related to a problem of perceptual awareness.

We refer to this memory system as the musical lexicon. The goal of the study was to identify its neural correlates. The brains of students with little musical training were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while the student listened to familiar musical themes, unfamiliar music, and random tones. The familiar themes were selected from instrumental pieces well-known to the participants; the unfamiliar music was the retrograde version of the familiar themes, which the participants did not recognize; and the random sequences contained the same musical tones but in a random order. All stimuli were synthesized and played with the sound of a piano, thereby keeping low-level acoustical factors similar across conditions. The comparison of cerebral responses to familiar versus unfamiliar music reveals focal activation in the right superior temporal sulcus (STS). Re-analysis of the data obtained in a previous study by Plailly et al. also points to the STS as the critical region involved in musical memories. The neuroimaging data further suggest that these auditory memories are tightly coupled with action (singing), by showing left activation in the planum temporale, in the supplementary motor area (SMA), and in the inferior frontal gyrus. Such a cortical organization of music recognition is analogous to the dorsal stream model of speech processing proposed by Hickok and Poeppel.

In one task, we varied the pitch distance between the target and comparison tone from 4 to 9 semitones and inserted either a silence or 6 interpolated tones between the tones to be compared. In a second task, we manipulated the number of pitches to be retained in sequences of length 1, 3, or 5. Amusics' sensitivity to pitch distance was exacerbated by the presence of interpolated tones, and amusics' performance was more strongly affected by the number of pitches to maintain in memory than controls. A pitch perception deficit could not account for the pitch memory deficit of amusics.

We hypothesized that individuals hearing music in a group would experience more intense emotions than the same individuals hearing the same music on their own. The emotional reactions to 10 musical excerpts (previously shown to contain chill-inducing psychoacoustic parameters) were measured in a within-subjects design. We found, contrary to our hypothesis, that the participants (all musicians) did not experience more chills when listening to music in a group than when listening alone. These findings may be explained by a lesser degree of concentration on the music in the group condition.

We describe an electrophysiological study of listeners' brain responses to musical accents that coincided in longer musical sequences. Musically trained listeners performed a timbre-change detection task in which a single-tone timbre change was positioned within 4-bar melodies composed of 350-ms tones to coincide or not with melodic contour accents and temporal accents (induced with temporal gaps). Event-related potential responses to (task-relevant) attended timbre changes elicited an early negativity (MMN/N2b) around 200 ms and a late positive component around 350 ms (P300), reflecting updating of the timbre change in working memory. The amplitudes of both components changed systematically across the sequence, consistent with expectancy-based context effects. Furthermore, melodic contour changes modulated the MMN/N2b response (but not the P300) to timbre changes in later sequence positions. In contrast, task-irrelevant temporal gaps elicited an MMN that was not modulated by position within the context; absence of a P300 indicated that temporal-gap accents were not updated in working memory. Listeners' neural responses to musical structure changed systematically as sequential predictability and listeners' expectations changed across the melodic context.

All three kinds of deviants elicited an MMN of similar amplitude. The MMNs to vowel and pitch deviants did not show significant additivity. This suggests that vowel and pitch are processed by shared neural substrates at the preattentive level.

These alterations may lead to hyperexcitability by down-regulating the function of presynaptic GABA(B) receptors in neocortical networks as suggested by a reduction in paired-pulse depression. Here, we tested further this hypothesis by analyzing the effects induced by the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (0.1-10 mu M) on the inhibitory events recorded in vitro from neocortical slices obtained from epileptic (>180 day-old) WAG/Rij and age-matched, non-epileptic control (NEC) rats. We found that higher doses of baclofen were required to depress pharmacologically isolated, stimulus-induced IPSPs generated by WAG/Rij neurons as compared to NEC. We also obtained similar evidence by comparing the effects of baclofen on the rate of occurrence of synchronous GABAergic events recorded by WAG/Rij and NEC neocortical slices treated with 4-aminopyridine + glutamatergic receptor antagonists. In conclusion, these data highlight a decreased function of presynaptic GABA(B) receptors in the WAG/Rij rat neocortex. We propose that this alteration may contribute to neocortical hyperexcitability and thus to absence seizures. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

J	Beauregard, M				Beauregard, Mario			Effect of mind on brain activity: Evidence from neuroimaging studies of psychotherapy and placebo effect	NORDIC JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Brain; Mind; Placebo effect; Psychoneural Translation Hypothesis; Psychotherapy	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DOPAMINE RELEASE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SPIDER PHOBIA; NEUROSCIENCE; EXPECTATION; DISSOCIATION	Mentalistic variables must be considered to reach a correct understanding of the neurophysiological basis of behavior in humans. Confusion regarding the relative importance of neurophysiological and mentalistic variables can lead to important misconceptions about causes and effects in the study of human behavior. In this article, we review neuroimaging studies of the effect of psychotherapy in patients suffering from diverse forms of psychopathology (obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, unipolar major depressive disorder, spider phobia). We also review neuroimaging studies of the placebo effect in healthy individuals (placebo analgesia, psychostimulant expectation) and patients with Parkinson's disease or unipolar major depressive disorder. Mental functions and processes involved in diverse forms of psychotherapy exert a significant influence on brain activity. With regard to the placebo effect, beliefs and expectations can markedly modulate neurophysiological and neurochemical activity in brain regions involved in perception, movement, pain and various aspects of emotion processing. The findings of the neuroimaging studies reviewed here strongly support the view that the subjective nature and the intentional content of mental processes significantly influence the various levels of brain functioning (e.g. molecular, cellular, neural circuit) and brain plasticity.

We compare the effiency of an homogeneous and a two-layered model to recover flow changes. By simulating a realistic human head with MRI anatomical data, we show that the two-layered model allows distinction between superficial layers and brain hemodynamic changes. The results show that the two-layered model provides a better estimate for the flow change than the homogeneous one. Experimental measurements with a two-layered dynamical phantom confirm the ability of the two-layered analytical model to distinguish flow increase in each layer.

The sample consisted of 90 (44 women and 46 men) work-disabled individuals with chronic low back pain. Participants were asked to lift a series of 18 canisters that varied according to weight (2.9 kg, 3.4 kg, 3.9 kg) and distance from the body. The canisters were arranged in a 3 x 6 matrix and the weights were distributed such that each 'column' of three canisters was equated in terms of physical demands. Participants rated their pain after each lift, and in a separate trial, estimated the weight of each canister. Mean activity-related pain ratings were computed for each Column of the task. An index of repetition-induced summation of pain was derived as the change in pain ratings across the six 'columns' of the task. Pain catastrophizing, fear of movement and depression were significantly correlated with condition-related pain (e.g., MPQ) and activity-related pain ratings. Women rated their pain as Mote intense than men, and estimated weights to be greater than men. A repetition-induced Summation of pain effect was observed where pain ratings increased as participants lifted successive canisters. Fear of movement, but not pain catastrophizing or depression, was associated with greater repetition-induced summation of pain. The findings point to possible neurophysiological mechanisms that could help explain why fear of pain is a robust predictor of pain-related disability. Mechanisms of repetition-induced summation of activity-related pain are discussed. (C) 2008 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data Source: A MEDLINE-based literature search using the keywords MODS and child, without any restriction to the idiom. Main Results: Critically ill children may frequently develop multisystemic manifestations during the course of severe infections, multiple trauma, surgery for congenital heart defects, or transplantations. Descriptive scores to estimate the severity of pediatric MODS have been validated. Young age and chronic health conditions have also been recognized as important contributors to the development of MODS. Unbalanced inflammatory processes and activation of coagulation may lead to the development of capillary leak and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Neuroendocrine and metabolic responses may result in insufficient adaptive immune response and the development of nosocomial infections, which may further threaten host homeostasis. Conclusions. Over the last 20 yrs, there has been an increasing knowledge on the epidemiology of pediatric MODS and on the physiologic mechanisms involved in the genesis of organ dysfunction. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to more clearly evaluate what is the long-term outcome of pediatric MODS.

Malignant histology is common, with persistently poor outcomes despite accessible neuroimaging and evolving adjuvant therapy. There remains scant literature about the natural history of these patients because of rarity and varied institutional experiences. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of congenital brain tumor patients surgically treated at the Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH) over a 22-year period. Patients presenting in the first year of life were evaluated for demographic information, presenting symptoms, lesion location, and management. Analysis was by median rank test and chi(2) statistics. Results: 13 cases of congenital brain tumors were identified: 5 supratentorial and 8 infratentorial. Median age (p = 0.93) and gender (p = 0.57) did not differ by location, and predominant histologies were choroid plexus papilloma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Seizure activity was exclusive to supratentorial lesions (40%, p = 0.03), with hypotonia observed only among infratentorial lesions (50%, p = 0.02). There was equal incidence of hydrocephalus (69%, p = 0.57) and increasing head circumference (38%, p = 0.27) by lesion location. Supratentorial lesions were treated by total resection (n = 3), subtotal resection (n = 1), and biopsy (n = 1). Infratentorial lesions were treated by total resection (n = 1), subtotal resection (n = 2), biopsy (n = 1), no operation (n = 2), and decompressive laminectomy for two spinal lesions. Conclusions: Congenital brain tumor patients represent fewer than 2% of patients treated at MCH. An evolving understanding of management objectives for these lesions requires understanding institutional experiences. Patients with supratentorial lesions frequently present with seizures, hydrocephalus, and macrocrania, and more frequently underwent total resection at surgery. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

They are generally used for microscopy or endoscopy, in vivo and in vitro, but they are also usable with fluorescent sensors such as fiber optic sensors. Among these tools, fluorescent ion indicators have been widely used to understand ionic dynamics into living cells. Indicators are mainly designed for Ca2+, although K+ is also an important target for its role in maintaining cellular membrane potential and regulating many other electrophysiological phenomena. Here we propose a technique to improve the use of a miniature fiber optic sensor to sense potassium dynamics in vivo. Due to the lack of commercially available potassium indicators, we are using a UV excitable indicator (PBFI). The UV excitation light induces unwanted fluorescence and/or luminescence from the optical components including the sensing fiber, leading to a poor signal-to-noise ratio. Our technique uses a UV diode pumped Q-switched source from CrystaLaser, a time gated acquisition system and a delay fiber that improve the signal-to-noise ratio and allow reducing the sensor size and the light intensity provided to the tissue, thus diminishing UV induced photodamage. Using this technique we have been able to record intracellular potassium fluctuations in vivo with fiber optic sensors of 10 mu m diameter.

Oxy and deoxy hemoglobin were measured (using a four color LED multispectral intrinsic optical imaging system) simultaneously with blood flow (laser speckle measurement). Both optical and electrophysiological data are compared spatially and against stimulation strength. When compared with non-lesioned animals, the hemodynamic response is seen to display significant differences exhibiting increased initial dip and decreased blood drain following stimulation. The origin of the difference is observed to be due to the vascular nature of the injury. The distinct hemodynamic responses may have a strong impact on General Linear Model based fMRI studies of spinal cord lesions due to the difficulty in separating vascular effects from neuronal plasticity following injury.

However, the effects of such correlations on information transmission in neural populations are not well understood. We quantified signal processing using linear response theory supported by numerical simulations in networks composed of two different models: One model generates a renewal process where interspike intervals are not correlated while the other generates a nonrenewal process where subsequent interspike intervals are negatively correlated. Our results show that the fractional rate of increase in information rate as a function of network size and stimulus intensity is lower for the nonrenewal model than for the renewal one. We show that this is mostly due to the lower amount of effective noise in the nonrenewal model. We also show the surprising result that coupling has opposite effects in renewal and nonrenewal networks: Excitatory (inhibitory coupling) will decrease (increase) the information rate in renewal networks while inhibitory (excitatory coupling) will decrease (increase) the information rate in nonrenewal networks. We discuss these results and their applicability to other classes of excitable systems.

Interpreting Neonatal Lethal Phenotypes in Mouse Mutants: Insights Into Gene Function and Human Diseases. Physiol Rev 89: 1-26, 2009; doi: 10.1152/physrev.00040.2007. - The mouse represents the model of choice to study the biological function of mammalian genes through mutation of its genome. However, the biggest challenge of mouse geneticists remains the phenotypic analysis of mouse mutants. A survey of mouse mutant databases reveals a surprisingly high number of gene mutations leading to neonatal death. These genetically modified mouse mutants have been instrumental in elucidating gene function and have become important models of congenital human diseases. The main complication when phenotyping mutant mice dying during the neonatal period is the large spectrum of physiological systems whose defects can challenge neonatal survival. Here, we present a comprehensive review of gene mutations leading to neonatal lethality and discuss the impact of these mutations on the major physiological processes critical to mouse newborn survival: parturition, breathing, suckling, and homeostasis. Selected examples of mouse mutants are highlighted to illustrate how the precise identification of the timing and cause of death associated with these physiological processes allows for a more profound understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular defects. This review provides a guide for the analysis of neonatal lethal phenotypes in mutant mice that will be helpful for dissecting out the function of specific genes during mouse development.

An artificial neural network (ANN) based method is developed for achieving more accurate remaining useful life prediction of equipment subject to condition monitoring. The ANN model takes the age and multiple condition monitoring measurement values at the present and previous inspection points as the inputs, and the life percentage as the output. Techniques are introduced to reduce the effects of the noise factors that are irrelevant to equipment degradation. The proposed method is validated using real-world vibration monitoring data.

The optimization method combines a genetic algorithm (GA), with a Response Surface Approximation (RSA) of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) type. During the optimization process, the individual objectives and constraints are approximated using ANN that is trained and tested using a few three-dimensional CFD flow simulations; the latter are obtained using the commercial package Fluent. The optimization objective is a weighted sum of individual objectives such as isentropic efficiency, stream wise vorticity and is penalized with a number of constraints. To minimize three-dimensional effects, the stator and rotor stacking curves are taken as the design variable. They are parametrically represented using a quadratic rational Bezier curve (QRBC) whose parameters are related to the blade lean, sweep and bow, which are used as the design variables. The described strategy was applied to single and multipoint optimization of the E/TU-3 turbine stage. This optimization strategy proved to be successful, flexible and practical, and resulted in an improvement of around 1% in stage efficiency over the turbine operating range with as low as 5 design variables. This improvement is attributed to the reduction in secondary flows, in stator hub choking, and in the transonic region and the associated flow separation.

It is known that the hysteresis existing in RTWUSM is also a non-smooth nonlinearity with multi-valued mapping. Thus, the modeling of such characteristic of the RTWUSM is a real challenge. In this paper, a rate-dependent hysteretic operator is proposed to extract the rate-dependent and hysteretic features of the motor. Moreover, considering the friction between the rotor and the stator that causes the asymmetry of the minor-loop of the hysteresis, a compensation method is introduced in the neural model. Then, an extended input space involved with the proposed hysteretic operator is constructed to transform the multi-valued of the hysteresis into a one-to-one mapping. Based on the obtained expanded input space, the neural networks can be utilized for modeling of the behavior of the RTWUSM.

Those first studies initiated a debate about the role of the motor cortex in the control of voluntary movement that continues to this day. The main issue concerns the degree to which the descending motor command emanating from the motor cortex specifies the spatiotemporal form of a movement or its causal forces, torques and muscle activity. The neurophysiological evidence supports both perspectives. This chapter surveys some of that evidence, with particular focus on the latter, more 'traditional', role of motor cortex.

It also compares the TCT with other approaches to motor control. The basic notions of the TCT are reviewed with a major focus on solutions to the problems of multi-muscle and multi-degrees of freedom redundancy. The TCT incorporates cognitive aspects by explaining how neurons recognize that internal (neural) and external (environmental) events match each other. These aspects as well as how motor learning occurs are subjects of further development of the TCT hypothesis.

Glycoproteomic analysis of two mouse mammary cell lines during transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition	PROTEOME SCIENCE			English	Article							BREAST-CANCER PROGRESSION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; BIOMARKER DISCOVERY; ADHESION MOLECULE; N-GLYCANS; TGF-BETA; PROTEOMIC APPROACH; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; CARCINOMA CELLS; E-CADHERIN	Background: TGF-beta acts as an antiproliferative factor in normal epithelial cells and at early stages of oncogenesis. However, later in tumor development TGF-beta can become tumor promoting through mechanisms including the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that is thought to contribute to tumor progression, invasion and metastasis. To identify EMT-related breast cancer therapeutic targets and biomarkers, we have used two proteomic approaches to find proteins that change in abundance upon the induction of EMT by TGF-beta in two mouse mammary epithelial cell lines, NMuMG and BRI-JM01. Results: Preliminary experiments based on two-dimensional electrophoresis of a hydrophobic cell fraction identified only 5 differentially expressed proteins from BRI-JM01 cells. Since 3 of these proteins were glycoproteins, we next used the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), to enrich for glycoproteins, followed by relative quantification of tryptic peptides using a label-free LC-MS based method. Using these approaches, we identified several proteins that are modulated during the EMT process, including cell adhesion molecules (several members of the Integrin family, Fibronectin, Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, and Neural cell adhesion molecule 1) and regulators of cellular signaling (Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2, Basigin). Conclusion: Interestingly, despite the fact that TGF-beta induces similar EMT phenotypes in NMuMG and BRI-JM01 cells, the proteomic results for the two cell lines showed only minimal overlap. These differences likely result in part from the conservative cut-off values used to define differentially-expressed proteins in these experiments. Alternatively, it is possible that the two cell lines may use different mechanisms to achieve an EMT transition.

In shaping my review, the modularity concept has been and continues to play a determinant role. Thus, I will first provide a brief background on the contemporary notion of modularity. Next, I will present evidence that musical abilities depend, in part, on modular processes. The evidence is coming mainly from neuropsychological dissociations. The relevance of findings of overlap in neuroimaging, of interference and domain-transfer effects between music and speech will also be addressed and discussed. Finally. I will contrast the modularity position with the resource-sharing framework proposed by Patel (2003, 2008a). This critical review should be viewed as an invitation to undertake future comparative research between music and language by focusing on the details of the functions that these mechanisms carry out, not only their specificity. Such comparative research is very important not only theoretically but also in practice because of their obvious clinical and educational implications.

Methods: Highly trained Zen meditators (n = 13; > 1000 hours of practice) and age/gender-matched control volunteers (11 = 13) received individually adjusted thermal stimuli to elicit moderate pain on the calf Conditions included: a) baseline-1: no task; b) concentration: attend exclusively to the calf; c) mindfulness: attend to the calf and observe, moment to moment, in a nonjudgmental manner; and d) baseline-2: no task. Results: Meditators required significantly higher temperatures to elicit moderate pain (meditators: 49.9 degrees C; controls: 48.2 degrees C; p = .01). While attending "mindfully," meditators reported decreases in pain intensity whereas control subjects showed no change from baseline. The concentration condition resulted in increased pain intensity for controls but not for meditators. Changes in pain unpleasantness generally paralleled those found in pain intensity. In meditators, pain modulation correlated with slowing of the respiratory rate and with greater meditation experience. Covariance analyses indicated that mindfulness-related changes could be partially explained by changes in respiratory rates. Finally, the meditators reported higher tendencies to observe and be nonreactive of their own experience as measured on the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire; these factors correlated with individual differences in respiration. Conclusions: These results indicated that Zen meditators have lower pain sensitivity and experience analgesic effects during mindful states. Results may reflect cognitive/selfregulatory skills related to the concept of mindfulness and/or altered respiratory patterns. Prospective studies investigating the effects of meditative training and respiration on pain regulation are warranted.

Case Report: A 63-year-old man with diverticular disease presented for a sigmoid resection. His medical history included coronary artery bypass grafting. diabetes mellitus. gastroesophageal reflux, chronic renal failure. COPD, a paralyzed left hemidiaphragm, and OSA treated with nighttime BiPAP and oxygen. Sigmoid resection was performed tinder combined lumbar spinal-thoracic epidural anesthesia without general anesthesia and/or endotracheal intubation (intrathecal 3.5 mL isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% with 100 mu g epinephrine and 200 mu g morphine [Epimorph]. epidural 60 mg bupivacaine, and 200 mg lidocaine). Intravenous ketamine was administered at a rate between 30 and 50 mg/h. Intraoperative BiPAP was applied using a setting of 12.5/8mm Hg with a backup ventilation rate of 10 breaths/min and an oxygen flow of 4 L/min. After surgery. epidural bupivacaine (0.1%) was infused over 3 days at 10ml/hr supplemented with oral acetaminophen, resulting in excellent pain relief. Postoperatively. the patient continued to use BiPAP when sleeping. and no adverse respiratory events were observed. The patient was discharged home 5 days after surgery. Conclusion: Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was successfully used in a patient with COPD and OSA undergoing sigmoid resection. Perioperative administration of BiPAP, excellent pain control by continuous epidural infusion of local anesthetic, and the avoidance of endotracheal intubation may have contributed to this patients uncomplicated postoperative Course.

Chondroitinase ABC and acute electrical stimulation are beneficial for muscle reinnervation after sciatic nerve transection in rats	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Chondroitinase ABC; electrical stimulation; nerve transection; rats; EMG; regeneration; kinematics; axonal counts	SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN; AXONAL REGENERATION; PERIPHERAL-NERVES; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; GROWTH-FACTOR; FIBRIN GLUE; EXPRESSION; PROMOTES; REPAIR	Purpose: nerve regeneration and functional recovery are often incomplete after peripheral nerve damage. The aim of this study was to determine if chondroitinase ABC injection at the lesion site, 1 hour of electrical stimulation and the combination of these treatments at the time of repair could be effective in promoting muscle reinnervation. Methods: the right sciatic nerve was completely sectioned in 32 female Sprague-Dawley rats. End-to-end microsuture repair was undertaken and fibrin glue was added. Five groups were studied: 1) suture (S) + fibrin glue (F) only; 2) S + F + chondroitinase ABC; 3) S + F + electrical stimulation; 4) S + F + chondroitinase ABC + electrical stimulation; 5) uninjured nerve. Results: post recovery kinematics showed larger excursion of the hip-ankle-toe angle during walking in groups 2, 3 and 4 than in group 1 (p < 0.05). In vivo electromyographic activity and maximal muscle force were similar between groups 2, 3, 4 and 5, with higher values in all of them compared to group 1 (p < 0.05). Also, the distal stump of the sciatic nerve was excised, and cross-sectioning revealed that the number of axons were similar in all groups. Conclusions: 150 days after nerve transection, recovery was incomplete with S and F only. Chondroitinase ABC injection at the lesion site and/or 1 hour of electrical stimulation of the proximal nerve stump were beneficial in promoting nerve regeneration and functional muscle reinnervation.

Prenatal immune challenge induces developmental changes in the morphology of pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in rats	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Neurodevelopment; Prenatal infection; Dendrite arbor and spine density	DENDRITIC SPINE DENSITY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS NEURONS; MATERNAL INFLAMMATION; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; FETAL-BRAIN; DOPAMINERGIC HYPERFUNCTION; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHANGES; INFECTION LEADS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEONATAL MICE	The neural mechanisms by which maternal infections increase the risk for schizophrenia are poorly understood; however, animal models using maternal administration of immune activators suggest a role for cytokine imbalance in maternal/fetal compartments. As cytokines can potentially affect multiple aspects of neuronal development and the neuropathology of schizophrenia is believed to involve subtle temporo-limbic neurodevelopmental alterations, we investigated morphological development of the pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus in rats that were prenatally challenged with the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with LPS (at E15-E16) or saline. The brains of offspring were processed for Golgi-Cox staining at postnatal days 10, 35 and 60. Dendritic length, branching, spine density and structure were quantified using Neurolucida software. At all ages, dendritic arbor was significantly reduced in mPFC and CA1 neurons of LPS-treated animals. Dendritic length was significantly reduced in the mPFC neurons of LPS group at P10 and 35 but returned to control values at P60, Opposite pattern was observed in CA1 region of LPS animals (normal values at P10 and 35, but a reduction at P60). LPS treatment significantly altered the structure of CA1 dendritic spines at P10. Spine density was found to be significantly lower only in layer V mPFC of P60 LPS rats. The study provides the first evidence that prenatal exposure to an immune activator dynamically affects spatio-temporal development of pyramidal neurons in mPFC and hippocampal that can potentially lead to aberrant neuronal connectivity and functions of these structures.

We suggest that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) provide an appropriate online measure to test some such effects. ERP findings of the past decade are reviewed with a focus on recent and ongoing research. It is concluded that, in contrast to previous suggestions, there is little evidence for a strict critical period in the domain of late acquired second language (L2) morphosyntax. As illustrated by data from our lab and others, proficiency rather than AoA seems to predict brain activity patterns in L2 processing, including native-like activity at very high levels of proficiency. Further, a strict distinction between linguistic structures that late L2 learners can vs. cannot learn to process in a native-like manner (Clahsen and Felser, 2006a; 2006b) may not be warranted. Instead, morphosyntactic real-time processing in general seems to undergo dramatic, but systematic, changes with increasing proficiency levels. We describe the general dynamics of these changes (and the corresponding ERP components) and discuss how ERP research can advance our current understanding of SLA in general.

The aim of the Study was thus to investigate the effects of sport-related concussions oil subjective and objective sleep quality. Methods: Ten concussed athletes and 11 non-concussed athletes were included. Concussed athletes had a history of 4.6 +/- 2.1 concussions with at least one concussion during the last year. They were recorded for two consecutive nights in the laboratory and during a 10-min period of wakefulness. They completed questionnaires related to sleep quality and symptoms as well as neuropsychological tests anti the CogSport computer battery. Results: Concussed athletes reported more symptoms and worse sleep quality than control athletes, but no between-group differences were found oil polysomnographic variables or on REM and NREM sleep quantitative EEG variables. However, concussed athletes showed significantly more delta activity and less alpha activity during wakefulness than did control athletes. Conclusion: In spite of the subjective complaints in sleep quality of concussed athletes, no change was observed in objective sleep characteristics. However, concussions were associated with,in increase in delta and a reduction in alpha power in the waking EEG. Sport-related concussions are thus associated with wakefulness problems rather than sleep disturbances. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A strong relationship between running economy and distance running performance is well established in the literature. From this established base, improvements in running economy have traditionally been achieved through endurance training. More recently, research has demonstrated short-term resistance and plyometric training has resulted in enhanced running economy. This improvement in running economy has been hypothesized to be a result of enhanced neuromuscular characteristics such as improved muscle power development and more efficient use of stored elastic energy during running. Changes in indirect measures of neuromuscular control (i.e. stance phase contact times, maximal forward jumps) have been used to support this hypothesis. These results suggest that neuromuscular adaptations in response to training (i.e. neuromuscular learning effects) are an important contributor to enhancements in running economy. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest that these adaptations translate into more efficient muscle recruitment patterns during running. Optimization of training and run performance may be facilitated through direct investigation of muscle recruitment patterns before and after training interventions. There is emerging evidence that demonstrates neuromuscular adaptations during running and cycling vary with training status. Highly trained runners and cyclists display more refined patterns of muscle recruitment than their novice counterparts. In contrast, interference with motor learning and neuromuscular adaptation may occur as a result of ongoing multidiscipline training (e.g. triathlon). In the sport of triathlon, impairments in running economy are frequently observed after cycling. This impairment is related mainly to physiological stress.. but an alteration in lower limb muscle coordination during running after cycling has also been observed. Muscle activity during running after cycling has yet to be fully investigated, and to date, the effect of alterations in muscle coordination on running economy is largely unknown. Stretching, which is another mode of training, may induce acute neuromuscular effects but does not appear to alter running economy. There are also factors other than training structure that may influence running economy and neuromuscular adaptations. For example, passive interventions such as shoes and in-shoe orthoses, as well as the presence of musculoskeletal injury, may be considered important modulators of neuromuscular control and run performance. Alterations in muscle activity and running economy have been reported with different shoes and in-shoe orthoses; however, these changes appear to be subject-specific and non-systematic. Musculoskeletal injury has been associated with modifications in lower limb neuromuscular control, which may persist well after an athlete has returned to activity. The influence of changes in neuromuscular control as a result of injury on running economy has yet to be examined thoroughly, and should be considered in future experimental design and training analysis.

Given that MSCs can survive hypoxia and that the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) provides metabolic control that contributes to MSC mobilization and survival, we investigated the effects of low oxygen (1.2% O(2)) exposure on G6PT gene expression. We found that MSCs significantly expressed G6PT and the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit beta, whereas expression of the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit a and the islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein was low to undetectable. Analysis of the G6PT promoter sequence revealed potential binding sites for hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha and for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its dimerization partner, the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), AhR: ARNT. In agreement with this, hypoxia and the hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride induced the expression of G6PT, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and HIF-1 alpha. Gene silencing of HIF-1 alpha prevented G6PT and VEGF induction in hypoxic MSCs whereas generation of cells stably expressing HIF-1 alpha resulted in increased endogenous G6PT gene expression. A semisynthetic analog of the polyketide mumbaistatin, a potent G6PT inhibitor, specifically reduced MSC-HIF-1 alpha cell survival. Collectively, our data suggest that G6PT may account for the metabolic flexibility that enables MSCs to survive under conditions characterized by hypoxia and could be specifically targeted within developing tumors.

NSCs are also an attractive source for cell transplantation and neural tissue repair after central nervous system injury. After systemic grafting, they are confronted with the BBB before they can enter the brain parenchyma. We investigated the interactions of human fetal neural precursor cells (hfNPCs) with human brain ECs in an in vitro model using primary cultures. We demonstrated that hfNPCs efficiently differentiate to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and move to the subendothelial space of human BBB endothelium, but not to pulmonary artery ECs. Effective differentiation was found to be dependent on the chemokine CCL2/MCP-1, but not on CXCL8/IL-8. Our findings suggest that neural precursor cells specifically interact with the BBB endothelium and differentiate in the subendothelial niche into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, under the influence of the chemokine CCL2/MCP-1.

There is also accumulating evidence that tumors are derived from and are maintained by a rare population of dysregulated stem cells. However, discrepancies in the markers used and reported have slowed down the functional characterization of these somatic stem cells. To circumvent this challenging issue, universal stem cell markers with properties common to all stem cell types must be discovered and exploited. In line with this idea, the measurement of aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1) activity shows promising potential as a universal marker for the identification and isolation of stem cells from multiple sources. Herein, we review the available data reporting utilization of ALDH1 activity as a means to identify and isolate stem cells and cancer stem cells, with a special focus on the mammary gland and breast cancer.

Among other things, this general approach aims at elaborating a theoretical background for any handwriting processing applications as well as providing some basic knowledge that can be integrated or taking care of in the development of automatic systems. So far, many models have been proposed to study human movement production in general and handwriting in particular: models relying on neural networks, dynamics models, psychophysical models, kinematic models and models exploiting minimization principles. Among the models which provide analytical representations, the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its delta-lognormal model have been considered as very promising. However, although numerous studies have shown that such a paradigm could explain most of the basic phenomena constantly reported in classical studies dealing with fine motor control, many problems, both theoretical and technical, have postponed its direct or indirect integration in the design of pattern recognizers. In this paper, we overview these problems and report on various projects conducted by our team to overcome these difficulties. First, we present a brief recall of the different models in the field and focus on the family of models involving lognormal functions. Then, from a practical perspective, we describe two new parameter extraction algorithms suitable for the reverse engineering of single strokes as well as complex handwriting signals. We show how the resulting representation can be used to improve electromyographic signal processing, opening a windows on new applications for handwriting processing, particularly in biomedical engineering and in some fields of neurosciences. We briefly conclude by listing various potential applications of the Kinematic Theory, particularly in the fields of handwriting recognition, signature verification and biomedical signal processing.

Preclinical and clinical investigations have suggested that NPY, acting on specific receptors, has direct role in several psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety-related illnesses, which will be reviewed in this chapter. Increasing support for a role for NPY in mood disorders has been obtained over the past few years. The Y-1, Y-2 and Y-4 receptor subtypes have been particularly involved in these behaviours. For example, we reported that NPY Y-2 knockout mice display anxiolytic-like phenotype as assessed in the elevated plus maze and open field tests, suggesting a role of this receptor subtype in anxiety-related behaviours. Moreover, NPY Y-2 knockout mice display memory retention deficits as evaluated in the Morris water maze and object recognition tests, while acquisition performance, swim speed and visible platform performance were not significantly different between knockout and wild-type mice. Additionally, young and old rats overexpressing NPY were found to be resistant to acute physical restrain stress, but rather surprisingly, no memory deficit was observed in old transgenic rats, contrasting with data obtained in young transgenic animals. Aged NPY transgenic rats and NPY Y-2 knockout mice exhibit anxiolytic-like phenotypes, in accordance with results observed in younger animals. Interestingly, the ontogeny of various NPY receptor subtypes suggest further that they may be implicated in the etiology of anxiety-like phenotype observed in maternally deprived animals as important changes in NPY receptor distribution and levels occur during this critical period, especially for the Y-2 receptor subtype. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that NPY and its receptors may be involved in the regulation of anxiety-related behaviours and provide evidence that this neuropeptide family is an attractive drug development target for these disorders.

The major lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase A (cathepsin A [CathA]), also known as protective protein, activates and stabilizes two other lysosomal enzymes, beta-galactosidase and neuramnidase/sialidase 1. Genetic deficiency of CathA (galactosialidosis) causes the lysosomal storage of sialylated glycoconjugates and leads to a multiorgan pathology. The galactosialidosis patients also show arterial hypertension and cardiomyopathy, conditions not predicted from the lysosomal storage of glycoconjugates. This review summarizes the experimental data suggesting that both cardiovascular pathologies associate with persisted vasoconstrictions and impaired formation of the elastic fibers triggered by the deficiency of CathA. We also discuss the homologous serine carboxypeptidases, Scpep1 and vitellogenic-like carboxypeptidase, that are secreted from endothelial cells and could potentially affect the cardiovascular system.

Information processing algorithms in the brain	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; VISUAL INFORMATION; RECOGNITION; FMRI; SEGMENTATION; REVEAL; FIELDS; STATES; FACE	If the brain is a machine that processes information, then its cognitive activity can be interpreted as a set of information processing states linking stimulus to response (i.e. as a mechanism or an algorithm). The cornerstone of this research agenda is the existence of a method to translate the measurable states of brain activity into the information processing states of a cognitive theory. Here, we contend that reverse correlation methods can provide this translation and we frame the transitions between information processing states in the context of automata theory. We illustrate, using examples from visual cognition, how this novel framework can be applied to understand the information processing algorithms of the brain in cognitive neuroscience.

MATERIAL and METHODS: Twelve right-handed patients who had been operated on left-sided hippocampal sclerosis and 12 right-handed normal subjects were included and the synonym generation task was used for evaluation of language lateralization. RESULTS: Atypical language activations were frequently found in the patients compared to the controls. A total of 3 (25%) subjects in the controls showed atypical activations: 2 bilateral with right and I bilateral with left-sided activations. There were no clear right-sided Broca activations in the control group but almost 25% of the patients showed clear right-sided Broca activations. In the patients the incidence of atypical language activations was 91.6% (11 patients). CONCLUSION: From the present study, it is clear that functional reorganization of the language-related neuronal network is modified in patients with left hippocampal sclerosis. Although the lesion is far from the primary language-related areas, atypical language lateralization is common in these patients and this should be considered in preoperative period.

However, this is generally true in static conditions as fingerprinting techniques suffer degradations in location accuracy in dynamic environments where the properties of the channel change in time. This is due to the fact that the technique needs a new database collection when a change of the channel's state occurs. This paper proposes a method allowing an accurate mobile user's location in time-varying channels when it is difficult or impossible to collect measurements. The system has the ability to generate, from a measured reference database, a new database corresponding to a new channel state. This is done by using measurements of few reference points in conjunction with a tree model data mining technique. The technique uses a regression analysis to learn the temporal predictive relationship between the received signal strength values of the mobile and the reference points in order to generate a new database at a different time state. After generating several databases, corresponding to several time states, an artificial neural network is used for location estimation. Results show low degradation, compared to a static channel, of approximately 7% and 11% at 3 meters in 2D and 3D dynamic environments, respectively.

The last 20 years have seen an increased interest in understanding the functional neuroanatomy of music processing in humans, using a variety of technologies including fMRI, PET, ERP, MEG, and lesion studies. We review current findings in the context of a rich intellectual history of research, organized by the cognitive systems underlying different aspects of human musical behavior. We pay special attention to the perception of components of musical processing, musical structure, laterality effects, cultural issues, links between music and movement, emotional processing, expertise, and the amusias. Current trends are noted, such as the increased interest in evolutionary origins of music and comparisons of music and language. The review serves to demonstrate the important role that music can play in informing broad theories of higher order cognitive processes such as music in humans.

We used the Pah(enu2/enu2) PKU mouse model in short- and long-term studies of enzyme substitution therapy with PEGylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PEG-PAL conjugates) from 4 different species. The most therapeutically effective PAL (Av, Anabaena variabilis) species was one without the highest specific activity, but with the highest stability; indicating the importance of protein stability in the development of effective protein therapeutics. A PEG-Av-p.C503S/p.C565S-PAL effectively lowered phenylalanine levels in both vascular space and brain tissue over a > 90 day trial period, resulting in reduced manifestations associated with PKU, including reversal of PKU-associated hypopigmentation and enhanced animal health. Phenylalanine reduction occurred in a dose- and loading-dependent manner, and PEGylation reduced the neutralizing immune response to the enzyme. Human clinical trials with PEG-Av-p.C503S/p.C565S-PAL as a treatment for PKU are underway.

Related motor axons select dorsal or ventral pathways at the base of the limb, raising the question of how these alternate trajectories are specified. EphA signaling has been proposed to control the dorsal trajectory of motor axons in conjunction with other signaling systems, although the respective contributions of each system to motor axon guidance are unclear. We show that the expression of EphB receptors by motor axons, and ephrin-B ligands by limb mesenchymal cells, directs the ventral trajectory of motor axons. Our findings reveal symmetry in the molecular strategies that establish this aspect of nerve-muscle connectivity. The involvement of ephrin:Eph signaling in guiding both sets of motor axons raises the possibility that other signaling systems function primarily to refine or modulate a core Eph signaling program.

Measurement of the Single-Top-Quark Production Cross Section at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							COLLIDER DETECTOR; FERMILAB TEVATRON; COLLISIONS; PHYSICS	We report a measurement of the single-top-quark production cross section in 2.2 fb(-1) of p (p) over bar collision data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab at root s = 1.96 TeV. Candidate events are classified as signal-like by three parallel analyses which use likelihood, matrix element, and neural network discriminants. These results are combined in order to improve the sensitivity. We observe a signal consistent with the standard model prediction, but inconsistent with the background-only model by 3.7 standard deviations with a median expected sensitivity of 4.9 standard deviations. We measure a cross section of 2.2(-0.6)(+0.7)(stat + syst) pb, extract the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix-element value vertical bar V(tb)vertical bar 0.88(-0.12)(+0.13)(stat + syst) +/- 0.07(theory), and set the limit vertical bar V(tb)vertical bar > 0.66 at the 95% C.L.

Search for the Higgs Boson Produced in Association with Z -> l(+) l(-) in p (p)over-bar Collisions at root s=1.96 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							MASSLESS PARTICLES; STANDARD MODEL	We present a search for the Higgs boson in the process q (q) over bar -> ZH -> l(+) l(-) b (b) over bar. The analysis uses an integrated luminosity of 1 fb(-1) of p (p) over bar collisions produced at root s = 1.96 TeV and accumulated by the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II). We employ artificial neural networks both to correct jets mismeasured in the calorimeter and to distinguish the signal kinematic distributions from those of the background. We see no evidence for Higgs boson production, and set 95% C.L. upper limits on sigma B-ZH(H -> b (b) over bar), ranging from 1.5 to 1.2 pb for a Higgs boson mass (m(H)) of 110 to 150 GeV/c(2).

Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in the Missing Energy and Acoplanar b-Jet Topology at root s=1.96 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								We report a search for the standard model Higgs boson in the missing energy and acoplanar b-jet topology, using an integrated luminosity of 0.93 fb(-1) recorded by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron p (p) over bar Collider. The analysis includes signal contributions from p (p) over bar -> ZH -> v (v) over barb (b) over bar, as well as from WH production in which the charged lepton from the W boson decay is undetected. Neural networks are used to separate signal from background. In the absence of a signal, we set limits on sigma(p (p) over bar -> VH) x B(H -> b (b) over bar) at the 95% C.L. of 2.6-2.3 pb, for Higgs boson masses in the range 105-135 GeV, where V W, Z. The corresponding expected limits range from 2.8 to 2.0 pb.	[Abazov, V. M.; Alexeev, G. D.; Kharzheev, Y. M.; Malyshev, V. L.; Tokmenin, V. V.; Verdier, P.; Yatsunenko, Y.

Dorsal Medial Prefrontal Cortex Plays a Necessary Role in Rapid Error Prediction in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anterior cingulate cortex; conflict monitoring; cognitive control; executive function; decision making; lesion	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CONFLICT DETECTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL SYSTEM; ADAPTATION; TASK; TIME; COMPENSATION	Activity in human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is correlated with errors, near-misses, and response conflict. Based on these observations, this region has been cast as playing a central role in models of error processing, conflict monitoring, and cognitive control. However, clear evidence that this region of the brain is necessary for these processes has been elusive. We studied the effects of damage to this region on four different error-related measures in five patients, and 19 healthy participants. Most error-related indices were not affected by such damage: patients had intact post-error slowing, and were able to report and to correct errors after they were made with accuracies comparable with the control group. However, all five patients were notably slow to correct errors, suggesting a deficit in on-line error prediction. This slowing was associated with impairment in the conscious prediction of error likelihood before a response. This finding constitutes important converging evidence for a critical role for human dACC in error monitoring, and sheds light on the selectivity and timing of the error-related process affected by dACC damage.

S2D team	Mutations in the calcium-related gene IL1RAPL1 are associated with autism	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							LINKED MENTAL-RETARDATION; ACCESSORY PROTEIN-LIKE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; FAMILY; NLGN4; CHANNEL; SYNAPSE; SHANK3; MEMBER	In a systematic sequencing screen of synaptic genes on the X chromosome, we have identified an autistic female without mental retardation (MR) who carries a de novo frameshift Ile367SerfsX6 mutation in Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein-Like 1 (IL1RAPL1), a gene implicated in calcium-regulated vesicle release and dendrite differentiation. We showed that the function of the resulting truncated IL1RAPL1 protein is severely altered in hippocampal neurons, by measuring its effect on neurite outgrowth activity. We also sequenced the coding region of the close related member IL1RAPL2 and of NCS-1/FREQ, which physically interacts with IL1RAPL1, in a cohort of subjects with autism. The screening failed to identify non-synonymous variant in IL1RAPL2, whereas a rare missense (R102Q) in NCS-1/FREQ was identified in one autistic patient. Furthermore, we identified by comparative genomic hybridization a large intragenic deletion of exons 3-7 of IL1RAPL1 in three brothers with autism and/or MR. This deletion causes a frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon, Ala28GlufsX15, at the very beginning of the protein. All together, our results indicate that mutations in IL1RAPL1 cause a spectrum of neurological impairments ranging from MR to high functioning autism.

Dendritic Cell Differentiation Signals Induce Anti-Inflammatory Properties in Human Adult Microglia	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESIONS; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ANTIGEN PRESENTATION; IN-VITRO; T-CELLS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CNS MICROGLIA; SPINAL-CORD	Microglia are resident cells of the CNS that belong to the myeloid cell lineage. In experimental models of neuroinflammation, they have limited capacity to function as APCs when compared with dendritic cells (DCs). Human peripheral blood monocytes have the plasticity to differentiate into mature DCs when exposed to GM-CSF and IL-4 followed by LPS. In this study we addressed the potential of human microglia to acquire phenotypic and functional properties of mature DCs under similar inducing conditions. Treated adult and fetal microglia became CD14(low) and acquired limited expression of CD209 (DC-SIGN); they remained CD1a(-) and CD83(-), and decreased MHCII expression, suggesting that they had not achieved a complete DC phenotype. The monocyte-derived DCs efficiently promoted CD4 T cell proliferation in an allogeneic MLR, whereas differentiated adult microglia had a decreased ability to stimulate CD4 T cell proliferation compared with their untreated counterparts. Differentiated fetal microglia did support CD4 T cell proliferation, whereas untreated cells could not. Fetal and adult microglia produced significant amounts of IL-10 following differentiation but no detectable IL-12 p70, in contrast to differentiated monocytes that produced IL-12 p70. Our data indicate that neither adult nor fetal microglia acquired the full characteristic phenotype of mature stimulatory DCs when treated with DC-inducing cytokines in vitro. Moreover, such treatment, especially of adult microglia, induces functional responses that could promote an antiinflammatory environment in the CNS. The Journal of Immunology, 2008, 181: 8288-8297.

On the geometry of a generalized cross-correlation random field	STATISTICS & PROBABILITY LETTERS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EXCURSION SETS; FMRI DATA; TOPOLOGY	Studying the geometry of random fields (RF) has become a well established tool for dealing with the statistical problem of multiple comparisons. This has led to ail increasing number of applications in medical imaging and astrophysics mainly. In particular, cross-correlation RF, defined as the sample correlation between pairs of independent Gaussian RF, have been used for analyzing functional connectivity in brain images. However, in some cases one needs to deal with correlated observations for which the "independence" assumption is no longer valid. In this paper we define a generalized cross-correlation RF that allows for correlated observations. We also study the geometry of such RF by giving results for the expected Euler Characteristic of its local maxima. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Carbonell, F.; Worsley, K.

The HDMR represents the potential as a sum of lower-dimensional functions and our NN-based approach makes it possible to obtain all of these functions from one set of fitting points. To reduce the number of terms in the HDMR, we use optimized redundant coordinates. By using exponential neurons, one obtains a potential in sum-of-products form, which greatly facilitates quantum dynamics calculations. A 12-dimensional (reference) potential surface for vinyl bromide is first refitted to show that it can be represented as a sum of two-dimensional functions. To fit 3d functions of the original coordinates, to improve the potential, a huge amount of data would be required. Redundant coordinates avoid this problem. They enable us to bypass the combinatorial explosion of the number of terms which plagues all HDMR and multimode-type methods. We also fit to a set of similar to 70 000 ab initio points for vinyl bromide in 15 dimensions [M. Malshe , J. Chem. Phys. 127, 134105 (2007)] and show that it is possible to obtain a surface in sum-of-products form of quality similar to the quality of the full-dimensional fit. Although we obtain a full-dimensional surface, we limit the cost of the fitting by building it from fits of six-dimensional functions, each of which requires only a small NN.

The absence of dystrophin results in muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration, leading to progressive muscle fiber loss. Utrophin is a close analogue of dystrophin. A substantial, ectopic expression of utrophin in the extrasynaptic sarcolemma of dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers can prevent deleterious effects of dystrophin deficiency. An alternative approach for the extrasynaptic up-regulation of utrophin involves the augmentation of utrophin transcription via the endogenous utrophin A promoter using custom-designed transcriptional activator proteins with zinc finger (ZFP) motifs. We tested a panel of custom-designed ZFP for their ability to activate the utrophin A promoter. Expression of one such ZFP efficiently increased, in a time-dependent manner, utrophin transcript and protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. In dystrophic mouse (mdx) muscles, administration of adenoviral vectors expressing this ZFP led to significant enhancement of muscle function with decreased necrosis, restoration of the dystrophin-associated proteins, and improved resistance to eccentric contractions. These studies provide evidence that specifically designed ZFPs can act as strong transcriptional activators of the utrophin A promoter. These may thus serve as attractive therapeutic agents for dystrophin deficiency states such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

The aim is to analyze the centre of pressure (CP) behaviour in forward stepping (FS) and lateral stepping (LS) to determine the dynamical consequences of scoliosis. Ten adolescents suffering from right thoracic scoliosis (Cobb >= 18) and 15 healthy adolescents participated in this study. Two forceplates recorded the CP evolution in medio-lateral and antero-posterior axes resulting from FS and. LS with the dominant (D) and with the non-dominant (nD) limbs. Our results showed between groups and within groups differences respect to axis of motion. The comparison between groups in the LS showed the increase of the CP total displacement only when stepping with nD limb. Conversely no major evidence emerges from the FS analysis. Whatever the axis was, the CP total displacement of the D limb did not differ between groups. The comparison between lower limbs for healthy subjects was always different for FS whereas this comparison became non-significant for LS. For patients the same analysis showed results less systematically different. The correlation analysis, only when LS is initiated with nD limb, revealed opposite CP dynamical strategies between groups. These results may be explained by the influence of the spinal deformation on internal mass distribution and the asymmetrical neurophysiological factors previously described. Therefore, to perform LS the patients develop an asymmetry between both limbs to guarantee the balance despite scoliosis. Thus LS reveals the differences between groups and between initiation limbs.

By using immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against whole rat choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), we quantified the distribution and characterized the ultrastructural features of these nerve terminals (axon varicosities) in the dorsolateral geniculate (DLG), parafascicular (PF), and reticular thalamic (Rt) nuclei of adult rat. The regional density of ACh innervation was the highest in PF (2.1. x 10(6) varicosities/mm(3)), followed by Rt (1.7 x 10(6)) and DLG (1.3 x 10(6)). In single thin sections, ChAT-immunostained varicosity profiles appeared comparable in shape and content in the three nuclei, but significantly larger in PF than in DLG and Rt. The number of these profiles displaying a synaptic junction was also much higher in PF than in DLG and Rt, indicating that all ChAT-immunostained varicosities in PF were synaptic, but only 39% in DLG and 33% in Rt. The hypothesis that glutamate corelease might account for the maintenance of the entirely synaptic ACh innervation in PF was refuted by the lack of colocalization of ChAT and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) in PF axon varicosities after dual immunolabeling. These data suggest that diffuse as well as synaptic transmission convey modulatory effects of the ACh input from brainstem to DLG and Rt during waking. In contrast, the entirely synaptic ACh input to PF should allow for a direct relaying of the information from brainstem, affecting basal ganglia function as well as perceptual awareness, including attention and pain perception.

In this study, we show that Daam1, a member of the Diaphanous-related formin protein family and a downstream effector for RhoA, is localized to the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Immunoblot analysis showed that Daam1 is enriched in the mouse hippocampus and co-fractionates in brain lysates with dendritic and synaptic proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Daam1 protein distributes in a punctate pattern throughout the cell body and dendritic shafts of dissociated hippocampal neurons and organotypic hippocampal cultures. Although Daam1 is mostly expressed in the shaft of dendrites, co-stainings with SV2 or PSD95 revealed that Daam1 is also present at some synapses. In addition, viral directed expression of a fluorescently tagged Daam1 fusion protein in hippocampal slices resulted in targeted delivery to the dendrites of pyramidal neurons, leading to a reduction in the density of spines.

Extracellular recordings were carried out in normal and early bilaterally enucleated rats. Direction-specific auditory neurons were found in both groups, and no evidence was found for a topographical order of best azimuthal direction. Although the distribution of best azimuthal direction was unaltered in enucleated rats, our data suggest that early visual deprivation modifies the width of auditory directional receptive fields in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. This suggests that visual input plays a substantial role in refining auditory receptive fields in the inferior colliculus.

The objective of the current study was to assess the possible effects of using folic acid antagonists in pregnancy on placenta-mediated adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Methods: We used data from an administrative database to retrospectively compare the occurrence of placenta-mediated adverse pregnancy outcomes between pregnant women exposed to folic acid antagonists and women without exposure to these agents. Results: We included in the analysis a total of 14 982 women who had been exposed to folic acid antagonists and 59 825 women who had not been exposed. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was the most frequently prescribed dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor (a total of 12 546 exposures during the preconception period and all 3 trimesters), and phenobarbital was the most frequently prescribed among the other folic acid antagonists (a total of 1565 exposures). The risks of preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-1.66), severe preeclampsia (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.38-2.28), placental abruption (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12-1.57), fetal growth restriction defined as less than the 10th percentile (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13), fetal growth restriction defined as less than the 3rd percentile (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.34) and fetal death (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07-1.70) were greater among mothers with exposure to folic acid antagonists. In general, the risks associated with exposure to other folic acid antagonists were higher than those associated with exposure to dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors. Supplementary analyses involving tight matching with propensity score, restriction of the analysis to women with exposure during the first and second trimesters and restriction of the analysis to specific categories of folic acid antagonists yielded similar results. Interpretation: Maternal exposure to folic acid antagonists appears to increase the risk of placenta-mediated adverse outcomes of pregnancy.

J	Herrmann, N; Gauthier, S				Herrmann, Nathan; Gauthier, Serge			Diagnosis and treatment of dementia: 6. Management of severe Alzheimer disease	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Review							ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NURSING-HOME PLACEMENT; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS; DOUBLE-BLIND; CEREBROVASCULAR EVENTS; BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS; DONEPEZIL TREATMENT; CLINICAL-TRIALS; OLDER-ADULTS	Background: The management of severe Alzheimer disease often presents difficult choices for clinicians and families. The disease is characterized by a need for full-time care and assistance with basic activities of daily living. We outline an evidence-based approach for these choices based on recommendations from the Third Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia. Methods: We developed evidence-based guidelines using systematic literature searches, with specific criteria for the selection and quality assessment of articles, and a clear and transparent decision-making process. We selected articles published from January 1996 to December 2005 that dealt with the management of severe Alzheimer disease. Subsequent to the conference, we searched for additional articles published from January 2006 to March 2008 using the same search terms. We graded the strength of the evidence using the criteria of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Results: We identified 940 articles, of which 838 were selected for further study. Thirty-four articles were judged to be of at least good or fair quality and were used to generate 17 recommendations. Assessment of severe Alzheimer disease should include the measurement of cognitive function and the assessment of behaviour, function, medical status, nutrition, safety and caregiver status. Management could include treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, or both. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms begins with nonpharmacologic approaches to addressing behavioural problems. Severe agitation, aggression and psychosis, which are potentially dangerous to the patient, the caregiver and others in the environment, can be treated with atypical antipsychotics, with consideration of their increased risk of cerebrovascular events and death. All pharmacologic approaches require careful monitoring and periodic reassessment to determine whether continued treatment is necessary. Caregiver support and use of community resources are essential. Interpretation: Severe Alzheimer disease requires frequent monitoring by health professionals. Simple nonpharmacologic approaches may address problems with mood and agitation. Antipsychotic drug therapy is occasionally necessary despite the inherent risks. Therapy with a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be useful for selected patients.

GRADED EXPRESSION OF netrin-1 BY SPECIFIC NEURONAL SUBTYPES IN THE ADULT MAMMALIAN STRIATUM	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neostriatum; cholinergic; gradient; DCC; UNC5; dopamine	TONICALLY ACTIVE NEURONS; IMMUNOREACTIVE GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; AXON GUIDANCE; CHOLINERGIC NEURONS; RAT NEOSTRIATUM; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SPINAL-CORD	Netrins are a family of secreted proteins that function as axon guidance cues during neural development. High levels of netrin-1 expressed by the embryonic ganglionic eminence, the precursor of the adult striatum, direct axons that pioneer the internal capsule. Here we describe netrin-1 expression by neurons distributed throughout the striatum of the adult mouse. Differences were detected in the number and type of neurons expressing netrin-1 in different regions of the striatum. Most neurons in the ventral striatum, including projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons, express netrin-1. In contrast, netrin-1 expression is largely limited to cholinergic interneurons in the dorsal striatum, and the proportion of cholinergic interneurons that express netrin-1 decreases along rostral-caudal and ventral-dorsal axes. Regional differences in expression in the adult striatum suggest that netrin-1 not only influences the development of striatal circuitry but may also participate in the maintenance and plasticity of connections in the adult brain.

Our aim was to evaluate whether depressive symptomatology alone predicts 5-year clinical fracture risk in older adults. Methods: In this secondary analysis of a community-based, prospective cohort study including 4175 women and 1652 men in Canada, depressive symptomatology was assessed at baseline by the mental health inventory-5 (MHI-5) and the mental component score (MCS) of the short form 36 questionnaire (SF-36). Fracture events were assessed annually for five years; all reported incident fragility fractures were confirmed radiographically. Results: Depressive symptomatology did not predict time to first fracture in men (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI] 0.45-1.65) or women (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86-1.39). Results were similar after controlling for potential confounders. Depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with baseline bone mineral density at the lumbar spine or femoral neck. Women with depressive symptoms were more. likely to report falls in the previous month (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.06, p=0.01). This association did not achieve statistical significance in men (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.96-3.04, p=0.07). Conclusion: In this large, community cohort, depressive symptomatology did not predict five-year risk of clinical fracture. Further research is needed to determine if individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at higher fracture risk and whether neuroendocrine or hormonal dysregulation might contribute to such risk in MDD.

We describe two patients with monosomy 1p36 who had brain abnormalities detected on prenatal ultrasound. The first patient was ascertained prenatally with ultrasound abnormalities, including ventriculomegaly, a single umbilical artery, a unilateral club foot, a ventricular septal defect, and intra-uterine growth retardation. Aminocentesis showed a normal karyotype. A postnatal MRI showed moderate to severe non-obstuctive myelination of the anterior limb of the internal capsule. A postnatal karyotype demonstrated a deletion of 1p36.3 that was detected prenatally due to low resolution. Molecular studies by array comparative genome hybridization (CGH) identified a terminal deletion of similar to 10 Mb. Our second patient was a fetus who had brain abnormalities suggestive of holoprosencephaly identified on prenatal ultrasound. Amniocentesis showed 46,XX,der(1)t(1;20)(p36.1;p12.2), that was found to be maternally inherited. Fetal autopsy demonstrated hydrocephalus, focal polymicrogyria, and cerebellar hypoplasia. However, holoprosencephaly was not confirmed. In addition to describing tow patients with monosomy 1p36 who had abnormal brain anatomy on prenatal ultrasounds, we review the literature of other prenatally detected patients with monosomy 1p36 and review brain abnormalities seen both prenatally and postnatally.

J	Inoue, S				Inoue, Sadayuki			In situ A beta pores in AD brain are cylindrical assembly of A beta protofilaments	AMYLOID-JOURNAL OF PROTEIN FOLDING DISORDERS			English	Article						A beta; amyloid pores; protofilaments; Alzheimer's disease; ultrastructure	ATOMIC-FORCE MICROSCOPY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; AMYLOID FIBRILS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BILAYER-MEMBRANES; ION CHANNELS; PROTEIN	According to the amyloid pore hypothesis, pores formed by small oligomers of misfolded amyloidogenic proteins cause rhembrane leakage with the unregulated rapid influx of ions leading to cell death. Ultrastructurally, pores reconstituted in vitro have mainly been characterised so far, and the presence of in situ pores in the amyloid tissues has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, the presence of in situ beta amyloid (A beta) pores was shown with high resolution transmission electron microscopy, in the neuronal cell membrane as well as in the membrane of mitochondria-like organelles in the brain with Alzheimer's disease. They are 16 rim wide and 11 nm long flat columnar structures made up of a single cylindrical layer (wall) of laterally associated A beta protofilaments which surrounds a 10 nm wide opening or lumen. Protofilaments are the basic unit of the fibrils of all amyloid-forming proteins and peptides. Individual extraceilular A beta protofilaments were 2-3 nm wide straight tubular structures with helical wall formed by the tight coiling of 1 nm wide A beta filaments. These in situ A beta pores are similar but not identical to in vitro reconstituted A beta pores.

Dietary manipulations result in changes in endocrine the and/or neuropeptide signals, such as the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which are dynamically linked to energy balance and the regulation of feeding behavior. We have recently demonstrated that food deprivation- induced reinstatement of heroin seeking can be blocked with leptin, and others have suggested a role for ghrelin in drug-related behaviors. The feeding-relevant effects of leptin and ghrelin involve the inhibition or activation, respectively, of neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AGRP) neurons in the hypothalamus. However, the effects of NPY, a highly potent orexigenic peptide, on chug-related behaviors have not been thoroughly studied. Here we examined the effect of acute NPY administration on the rate of heroin self-administration and the reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behavior. Heroin intake (0.05 mg/kg/infusion) was tested using a self-administration procedure (FR-1), 10-min post-NPY injections (0.0, 4.0, and 10 mu g/rat, ICV). In a different group of rats, NPY-induced reinstatement (0.0, 4.0, and 10 mu g/rat, ICV) of extinguished heroin seeking was assessed. NPY injections increased ongoing heroin self-administration, and induced a reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behavior. These findings suggest that NPY can modulate the rewarding and conditioned reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Besson, P; Andermann, F; Dubeau, F; Bernasconi, A				Besson, Pierre; Andermann, Frederick; Dubeau, Francois; Bernasconi, Andrea			Small focal cortical dysplasia lesions are located at the bottom of a deep sulcus	BRAIN			English	Article							FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BALLOON CELL SUBTYPE; HUMAN-BRAIN; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; HEALTHY CONTROLS; MRI	Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is often characterized by minor structural changes that may go unrecognized by standard radiological analysis. Visual assessment of morphological characteristics of FCD and sulci harbouring them is difficult due to the complexity of brain convolutions. Our purpose was to elucidate and quantify the spatial relationship between FCD lesions and brain sulci using automated sulcal extraction and morphometry. We studied 43 consecutive FCD patients using high-resolution MRI. Lesions were classified into small and large using qualitative (detection on initial clinical assessment of conventional MRI) and quantitative (volume) criteria. Sulci were identified and labelled automatically using an algorithm based on a congregation of neural networks. Segmented FCD lesions and sulci were then simultaneously visualized in 3D. We measured mean and maximum depth of sulci related to each FCD and of the corresponding sulci in 21 healthy controls. In addition, we calculated sulcal depth within the FCD neighbourhood. Twenty-one (21/43 49) patients had small FCD lesions (volume range: 1283093 mm(3)). Among them, 17 (81) had been overlooked during initial radiological evaluation and were subsequently identified using image processing. Eighteen (18/21 86) small FCD lesions were located at the bottom of a sulcus. Two others were related to the walls of two sulci and one was located at the crown of a gyrus. Mean and maximum depth of sulci related to the FCD was higher than that of the corresponding sulci in controls (P 0.008). Sulcal depth within lesional neighbourhood had larger mean depth than that of the entire sulcus (P 0.0002). Evidence that small FCD lesions are preferentially located at the bottom of an abnormally deep sulcus may be used to direct the search for developmental abnormalities, particularly in patients in whom large-scale MRI features are only mildly abnormal or absent.

L., Holzman, P. S., Matthysse, S., & Mendell, N. R. (1993). Eye tracking dysfunction and schizophrenia: A critical perspective. Schizophrenia Bulletin, 19, 461-505]. We used meta-analytic procedures to quantify patient-control differences in eye-tracking and to evaluate potential moderators of effect size including patient and target characteristics and characteristics of the control population (matched or not). The magnitude of patient-control differences in pursuit depended on the measure. Global measures had large effect sizes. Among specific measures, maintenance gain and leading saccades yielded large effect sizes, with gain also yielding the narrowest confidence interval. Effect sizes associated with specific measures of smooth pursuit VS. specific measures of intrusive saccades did not clearly implicate one system over the other. Patient demographics and target characteristics generally had little influence on effect sizes. However, studies that failed to sex-match patients and controls tended to have smaller effect sizes for maintenance gain and catch-up saccade rate. Average effect sizes and confidence limits for global measures of pursuit and for maintenance gain place these measures alongside the very strongest neurocognitive measures in the literature [Heinrichs, R.

The core concept that drives this rapid growth has been the use of a standardized 3D coordinate space for combining data from many subjects and/or time-points. This has allowed geographically-separated laboratories to reproduce experiments in precise detail, to share data or to perform meta-analysis in ways that go far beyond the traditional reviewing of summary results in journal publications. A further corollary of the brain mapping approach is the natural fostering of multi-center collaboration among distant sites. This article describes recent progress in trans-Pacific collaboration between Canadian and Asian laboratories in the study of neuroanatomical networks obtained from MRI data, both in the normal brain and in neurodegenerative disorders.

Dose-dependency of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters after intravenous bolus doses of cisatracurium	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						pharmacodynamics; cisatracurium; pharmacokinetics; cisatracurium; pharmacokinetics; dose-dependency; pharmacokinetics; early	NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING-AGENTS; EFFECT SITE EQUILIBRATION; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS; TWITCH DEPRESSION; ADDUCTOR POLLICIS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PHARMACOKINETICS; PERMEABILITY; METABOLITES; DIFFUSION	Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are generally assumed to be dose-independent. To our knowledge, there are very few clinical reports where the PK/PD parameters of a NMBA were derived separately for each dose group during a formal dose-ranging study. The primary objective of this study was to challenge a potential dose-dependency of cisatracurium PK/PD parameters by conducting a well-controlled experimental study. Eight dogs were anaesthetized with pentobarbital and mechanically ventilated. Two doses of cisatracurium (1.5xED(95) and 6xED(95)) were administered in a randomized cross-over design after an appropriate washout period. Neuromuscular function was monitored using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. Arterial blood was sampled continuously for the first minute after cisatracurium injection and at frequent intervals thereafter. Cisatracurium plasma concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. PK/PD modelling of individual data sets was performed with NONMEM using a non-parametric approach and a descriptive sigmoid E(max) model. Cisatracurium PKs were linear over the dose range studied. Using non-parametric PK/PD analysis, mean values for plasma-effect compartment equilibration delay (k(e0)) were 0.0600 vs 0.1278 min(-1) (P < 0.05) and sensitivity (EC(50)) were 323 vs 235 ng ml(-1) (P < 0.05) for the high and low doses, respectively. A dose-dependent effect on the PK/PD parameters of cisatracurium has important clinical implications as an accurate estimate of the EC(50) is desirable. PK/PD parameters derived after intubating bolus doses of cisatracurium would be more reliable.

Accurate risk estimates also are required for clinical trial design to ensure that homogeneous, high-risk patient groups are used to investigate new cancer therapeutics. Using the MEDLINE database, a literature search was performed on prostate cancer predictive tools from January 1966 to July 2007. The authors recorded input variables, the prediction form, the number of patients used to develop prediction tools, the outcome being predicted, prediction tool-specific features, predictive accuracy, and whether validation was performed. Each prediction tool was classified into patient clinical disease state and the outcome being predicted. First, the authors described the criteria for evaluation (predictive accuracy, calibration, generalizability, head-to-head comparison, and level of complexity) and the limitations of current predictive tools. The literature search generated 109 published prediction tools, including only 68 that had undergone validation. An increasing number of predictive tools addressed important endpoints, such as disease recurrence, metastasis, and survival. Despite their limitations and the limitations of data, predictive tools are essential for individualized, evidence-based medical decision making. Moreover, the authors recommend wider adoption of risk-prediction models in the design and implementation of clinical trials. Among prediction tools, nomograms provide superior, individualized, disease-related risk estimations that facilitate management-related decisions. Nevertheless, many more predictive tools, comparisons between them, and improvements to existing tools are needed. Cancer 2008; 113:3075-99. (C) 2008 American Cancer Society.

A complication does not necessarily represent a breech in the standard of care that constitutes medical negligence or medical malpractice. An operative or procedural complication is any complication, regardless of cause, Occurring (I) within 30 days after surgery or intervention in or out of the hospital, or (2) after 30 days during the same hospitalization subsequent to the operation or intervention. Operative and procedural complications include both intraoperative/intraprocedural complications and postoperative/postprocedural complications in this time interval. The MultiSocietal Database Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease has set forth a comprehensive list of complications associated with the treatment of patients with congenital cardiac disease, related to cardiac, pulmonary, renal, haematological, infectious, neurological, gastrointestinal, and endocrinal systems, as well as those related to the management of anaesthesia and perfusion, and the transplantation of thoracic organs. The objective of this manuscript is to examine the definitions of operative morbidity as they relate specifically to the renal system. These specific definitions and terms will be used to track morbidity associated with surgical and transcatheter interventions and other forms of therapy in a common language across many separate databases. Although renal dysfunction and renal failure are known risks of congenital heart surgery, accurate estimates of the incidences of these complications are limited. This lack of knowledge is in part due to the lack of uniform definitions of these postoperative complications. The purpose of this effort is to propose consensus definitions for renal complications following congenital cardiac surgery so that collection of such data can be standardized. Clinicians caring for patients with congenital heart disease will be able to use this list for databases, quality improvement initiatives, reporting of complications, and comparing strategies for treatment.

To test this hypothesis in vivo, we generated NRAGE knockout mice and found that NRAGE deletion caused a defect in developmental apoptosis of sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglia, similar to that observed in p75NTR knockout mice. Primary sympathetic neurons derived from NRAGE knockout mice were resistant to apoptosis induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-apoptotic p75NTR ligand, and NRAGE-deficient sympathetic neurons show attenuated BDNF-dependent JNK activation. Hair follicle catagen is an apoptosis-like process that is dependent on p75NTR signaling; we show that NRAGE and p75NTR show regulated co-expression in the hair follicle and that identical defects in hair follicle catagen are present in NRAGE and p75NTR knockout mice. Interestingly, NRAGE knockout mice have severe defects in motoneuron apoptosis that are not observed in p75NTR knockout animals, raising the possibility that NRAGE may facilitate apoptosis induced by receptors other than p75NTR. Together, these studies demonstrate that NRAGE plays an important role in apoptotic-signaling in vivo.	[Bertrand, M. J. M.; Barker, P.

Listening to Musical Rhythms Recruits Motor Regions of the Brain	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article							PREMOTOR CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ACTION REPRESENTATION; PLANUM TEMPORALE; MIRROR NEURONS; FMRI; CEREBELLUM; PERCEPTION; MOVEMENT; PIANISTS	Perception and actions can be tightly coupled; but does a perceptual event dissociated from action processes still engage the motor system? We conducted 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies involving rhythm perception and production to address this question. In experiment 1, on each trial subjects 1st listened in anticipation of tapping, and then tapped along with musical rhythms. Recruitment of the supplementary motor area, mid-premotor cortex (PMC), and cerebellum was observed during listen with anticipation. To test whether this activation was related to motor planning or rehearsal, in experiment 2 subjects naively listened to rhythms without foreknowledge that they would later tap along with them. Yet, the same motor regions were engaged despite no action-perception connection. In contrast, the ventral PMC was only recruited during action and action-coupled perceptual processes, whereas the dorsal part was only sensitive to the selection of actions based on higher-order rules of temporal organization. These functional dissociations shed light on the nature of action-perception processes and suggest an inherent link between auditory and motor systems in the context of rhythm.

Methods: We evaluated BOLD changes specifically related to the main physiological EEG rhythms (alpha, beta, theta, delta, spindles) in 15 epilepsy patients with rare discharges (all the regressors were included in the same general linear model to improve specificity). Results: We found a consistent effect of spindles, alpha and theta. For alpha, BOLD was positively correlated in thalami and putamen, and negatively correlated in the occipital, parietal and frontal lobes. For theta, a negative correlation was found over the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes. Spindles were correlated with a positive BOLD in thalami and putamen. Rhythm regressors added as confounds in the fMRI analysis explained at least 5% of BOLD signal Variance in 6.8 +/- 8.9% of gray matter voxels, a contribution which is of the order of typical changes in fMRI studies. Conclusion: First, we found specific cerebral Structures involved in each main EEG rhythm generation. Second, fluctuations of these rhythms following vigilance changes are responsible for noteworthy BOLD changes. Significance: Physiological EEG rhythms may be integrated to the analysis of EEG-fMRI in Studies with fluctuation of alertness, to eliminate possible confounding factors.

J	Kaye, M				Kaye, Michael			Nocturia: a blinded, randomized, parallel placebo-controlled self-study of the effect of 5 different sedatives and analgesics	CUAJ-CANADIAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article							URINARY-BLADDER; EXCRETION; METABOLITE; THERAPY; RAT	Background: In a previous study I noted that, when taken occasionally as a night-time sedative, the benzodiazepine (BZD) oxazepam decreased nocturia. The objective of the present study was, using placebo and other sedatives and analgesics, to assess whether oxazepam decreases nocturia and, if so, how? Methods: I conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled self-study over a period of 10 months using oxazepam, zopiclone and trazodone as sedatives, and naproxen and oxycodone as analgesics. I assessed each medication 10 times, for a total of 60 tests. Each test included assessment of sleep adequacy, number and volume of overnight voidings and chemistries. Every test was a "first-time" or "naive" event. Results: All medications differed in several parameters from placebo, but nocturia only showed a significant reduction with naproxen and oxazepam. Nocturia occurred a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 1.6 (0.84) times nightly with placebo and fell to 0.6 (0.5) with oxazepam, which was a 63% decrease without any change in urine volume. Naproxen reduced nocturia to a mean (SD) of 0.7 (0.8) times nightly by reducing water, salt and potassium excretion. Compared with placebo, all medications had less urine sodium loss and decreased fractional sodium excretion (FENa), suggesting increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption. This effect was most marked with naproxen. Neither improved sleep quality with zopiclone nor pain relief with oxycodone resulted in reduced nocturia. Conclusion: The effect of naproxen was probably a direct one on the kidney. The reduction of electrolyte excretion produced by the other medications is possibly a central effect on sympathetic activity, and the effect was too small to change urine volume. The effect of oxazepam was to make the bladder less irritable and could not be attributed to a decrease in urine volume, electrolyte change, sedation or analgesia. A central gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated effect in the cord or brain could explain the results observed with oxazepam.

Dopaminergic and Noradrenergic Contributions to Functionality in ADHD: The Role of Methylphenidate	CURRENT NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						ADHD; methylphenidate; dopamine; noradrenaline; subcortical; prefrontal	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; PREFRONTAL CORTICAL ALPHA(2)-ADRENOCEPTORS; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HEALTHY-YOUNG ADULTS; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; ORAL METHYLPHENIDATE; BASAL GANGLIA	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a childhood psychiatric condition characterized by severe impulsiveness, inattention and overactivity. Methylphenidate (MPH), a psychostimulant affecting both the dopaminergic and the noradrenergic systems, is one of the most frequently prescribed treatments for ADHD. Despite the widespread use of MPH and its proven effectiveness, its precise neurochemical mechanisms of action are under debate. For the most part, MPH's influence on subcortical dopamine neurotransmission is thought to play a crucial role in its behavioral and cognitive effects. In their hypothesis of biphasic MPH action, Seeman and Madras [42, 43] suggest that therapeutic doses of MPH elevate tonic dopamine while inhibiting phasic transmitter release in subcortical structures, leading to reduced postsynaptic receptor stimulation and psychomotor activation in response to salient stimuli. Volkow and colleagues [56] suggest that by amplifying a weak striatal dopamine signal, MPH increases the perception of a stimulus or task as salient. The enhanced interest for the task is thought to increase attention and improve performance. Recent animal studies have however shown that when administered at doses producing clinically relevant drug plasma levels and enhancing cognitive function, MPH preferentially activates dopamine and noradrenaline efflux within the prefrontal cortex relative to the subcortical structures [5]. Overall, we suggest that the delineated theories of MPH therapeutic action should not be discussed as exclusive. Studies are outlined that allow integrating the different findings and models.

Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in the treatment of pituitary macroadenomas	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Radiotherapy; fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy; macroadenoma; pituitary adenoma	TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; CONFORMAL RADIOTHERAPY; RADIATION-THERAPY; ADENOMAS; RADIOSURGERY; EFFICACY; RESECTION; MICROSURGERY; RECURRENT; SAFETY	Background The use of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) has evolved with technical advances in noninvasive immobilization, radiation delivery, and image guidance. The application of FSRT to pituitary tumours is aimed at reducing toxicity through improved dose conformality and reduced treatment margins. The aim of the present paper is to report our own experience and to review the published data on FSRT for pituitary macroadenomas. Methods Between September 2000 and October 2005, 13 patients with pituitary macroadenoma underwent FSRT at our institution. In 12 patients, radiotherapy treatment followed surgical resection (transsphenoidal resection in 8, frontal craniotomy in 3, and multiple transsphenoidal resections followed by craniotomy in 1). In 4 patients, the tumours were functional (2 adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting, 1 prolactinoma, and 1 growth hormone-secreting); the tumours in the remaining patients were clinically non-secretory. Before radiation, 3 patients had panhypopituitarism, and 6 patients had visual field defects. All patients were treated with FSRT using non-coplanar micro-multileaf collimation portals. A median dose of 50.4 Gy (range: 45-60 Gy) was prescribed to the 76.9%-95.2% isodose surface and delivered in 1.8-Gy fractions. The median planning target volume (gross tumour plus 3 mm) was 33.5 cm(3) (range: 3.2-75 cm(3)). Results After a median follow-up of 24 months (range: 6-60 months), local control was 100%. One patient achieved clinical complete response. Treatment was well tolerated acutely for all patients. Neither radiation-induced optic neuropathy nor any radiation-related endocrine dysfunction was observed in our patients. Conclusions In accordance with published series, we found FSRT to be safe and effective in the management of large pituitary macroadenomas.

Tranzyme Pharma (TZP)-101 is a small-molecule agonist with potent binding affinity ( inhibitory constant = 16 nM) and full agonist activity (EC(50) = 29 nM, maximum response = 111%) at the human recombinant GRLN-R. Pharmacokinetic profiling of TZP-101 in rat determined a plasma elimination half-life of 99 min and low blood-brain barrier permeability (0.09%). The pharmacological response to TZP-101, administered centrally [intracerebroventricular (icv)] or peripherally (iv), was evaluated in comparison with that of acylated ghrelin. Thus, TZP-101 ( iv) accelerated gastric emptying of a liquid meal (2% methylcellulose) similarly to ghrelin ( iv). IAlso, TZP-101 ( icv) stimulated spontaneous, cumulative food intake in a similar manner to ghrelin ( icv). However, unlike ghrelin, TZP-101 did not elicit significant GH release on either central or peripheral administration. Moreover, TZP-101 did not alter ghrelin-induced GH release. n total, these data demonstrate that the GH response can be pharmacologically demarcated from the orexigenic and gastrointestinal responses to ghrelin in rats. The observation that the centrally mediated orexigenic response and the peripherally mediated gastric motility response are pharmacologically associated is consistent with the classification of ghrelin as a brain-gut peptide, whereas the additional action of ghrelin to stimulate GH release ( possibly via a distinct signaling pathway) may be considered a complementary mechanism to harmonize somatic growth and body composition with the regulation of energy homeostasis.

The only consistent symptom of ring chromosome 20 syndrome (r(20)) is severe, refractory epilepsy often associated with a characteristic, although not pathognomonic, EEG pattern. Patients suffer from severe seizures with accompanying cognitive decline and frequent episodes of non-convulsive status epilepticus (SE). Other features of this rare disorder, such as dysmorphic changes, mental retardation and behavioral disturbances are variable. Because of the variability of the clinical presentation, some patients with r(20) undergo invasive investigations before being diagnosed. Case study. We present the case of a young boy with no dysmorphic traits, who was only diagnosed with r (20) syndrome at the age of 13. His first seizure occurred at the age of four. Later seizures were of various types including non-convulsive SE, with deterioration of the background EEG and severe cognitive decline. Despite multiple trials of anti-epileptic medications, his seizures remained highly refractory, and lie died as the result of an uncontrollable, prolonged SE, shortly after the diagnosis was made. Discussion. Non-convulsive SE is common in patients with r(20) syndrome and may be caused by a dysfunction in dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, until now, no case of lethal status epilepticus has been reported. This case report suggests that patients with unexplained refractory seizures and episodes of non-convulsive SE should undergo genetic testing early in their disease, even in the absence of any morphologic features or dysmorphic traits suggestive of a chromosomal disease.

It can be associated with a variety of symptoms including severe epilepsy. Patients often become symptomatic during childhood and the severity of the epilepsy correlates with the patient's neurological outcome. The patient reported here remained asymptomatic until age 24, when he started to experience migraine accompanied by visual scotoma and hemiparesis. Ten years later, lie developed severe, refractory epilepsy, with prolonged postictal neurological deficits and ictal as well as post-ictal headaches. It became increasingly difficult to distinguish between migraines and seizures as both could last for several hours, as demonstrated in the two video EEGs. Both the epilepsy and the migraine may therefore have contributed to the patient's severe, neurological deterioration, probably by accelerating the progressive neuronal damage. Surgery improved the Situation, but lesional areas were too extensive for complete removal. Late-onset symptoms in Sturge-Weber syndrome may thus result in a severe course for the disease. Early intervention and Surgical treatment options are discussed.

Implication of Unfavorable Histology, MYCN Amplification and Diploidy for Stage I and II Neuroblastomas	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY			English	Article						neuroblastoma; MYCN amplification; histology; diploidy	PEDIATRIC-ONCOLOGY-GROUP; CHILDRENS-CANCER-GROUP; GENE AMPLIFICATION; CHILDHOOD NEUROBLASTOMA; LOCALIZED NEUROBLASTOMA; NEURO-BLASTOMA; SERUM FERRITIN; CLASSIFICATION; GANGLIONEUROBLASTOMA; EXPRESSION	Background: Surgery is the first line treatment for low-grade neuroblastomas. In stage I tumors, the presence of MYCN amplification is rarely detected and the Shimada histology is not always taken into consideration when deciding on the treatment. This study concerns the significance of these two factors in the evolution of children with low-grade neuroblastomas. Methods: We analyzed the assessment and follow-up of children with low-grade neuroblastomas (stages I and II) with or without MYCN amplification, with either a favorable or unfavorable histology and with or without tumor cell diploidy. Favorable histology was defined as stroma-poor tumors with more than 5% differentiating neuroblasts and a mitosis karyorrhexis index (MKI) of less than 10011001 5000 5000 cells. Results: From 1995 to 2006, out of 114 neuroblastomas, nine (7.9%) were stage I and 21 (18.4%) stage II. Of these 30 patients, 27 underwent surgery alone and three received chemotherapy after surgery. The combination of MYCN amplification, unfavorable histology and diploidy was noted in one patient who developed metastases within two months. MYCN amplification alone was noted in two cases who are still tumor-free after two years. Unfavorable histology alone was noted in four patients, of whom one suffered a recurrence of the tumor (previously stage I) and three are tumor-free after six years. Tumor cell diploidy alone was present in 11 patients whose evolution is satisfactory. Conclusion: Because MYCN amplification and unfavorable histology are rare in early stage neuroblastomas, these tumors may be misclassified if they are not investigated further. It seems that no single clinical or biological feature can be considered a significant factor in establishing a prognosis or determining whether additional treatment is required.	[Roessingh, A.

Governing role of primary afferent drive in increased excitation of spinal nociceptive neurons in a model of sciatic neuropathy	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Neuropathic pain; Primary afferent; Ectopic discharge; Nerve block; Lidocaine; Spinal cord; Central sensitization; Dorsal horn	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; CHRONIC CONSTRICTION INJURY; ROSTRAL VENTROMEDIAL MEDULLA; LIDOCAINE PATCH 5-PERCENT; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; MU-OPIOID RECEPTOR; POSTINJURY PAIN HYPERSENSITIVITY; MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS	Previously we reported that the cuff model of peripheral neuropathy, in which a 2 man polyethylene tube is implanted around the sciatic nerve, exhibits aspects of neuropathic pain behavior in rats similar to those in humans and causes robust hyperexcitation of spinal nociceptive dorsal horn neurons. The mechanisms mediating this increased excitation are not known and remain a key unresolved question in models of peripheral neuropathy. In anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats 2-6 weeks after Cuff implantation we found that elevated discharge rate of single lumbar (L(3-4)) wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons persists despite acute spinal transection (T9) but is reversed by local conduction block of the cuff-implanted sciatic nerve; lidocaine applied distal to the cuff (i.e. between the Cuff and the cutaneous receptive field) decreased spontaneous baseline discharge of WDR dorsal horn neurons similar to 40% (n=18) and when applied subsequently proximal to the cuff, i.e. between the cuff and the spinal cord, it further reduced spontaneous discharge by similar to 60% (n=19; P<0.05 proximal vs. distal) to a level that was not significantly different from that of naive rats. Furthermore. in cuff-implanted rats WDR neurons (n=5) responded to mechanical cutaneous stimulation with all exaggerated afterdischarge which was reversed entirely by proximal nerve conduction block. These results demonstrate that the hyperexcited state of spinal dorsal horn neurons observed in this model of peripheral neuropathy is not maintained by tonic descending facilitatory mechanisms. Rather, on-going afferent discharges originating from the sciatic nerve distal to, at, and proximal to the cuff maintain the synaptically-mediated gain in discharge of spinal dorsal horn WDR neurons and hyperresponsiveness of these neurons to cutaneous stimulation. Our findings reveal that ectopic afferent activity from Multiple regions along peripheral nerves may drive CNS changes and the symptoms of pain associated with peripheral neuropathy.

MLC1 is an oligomeric plasma membrane (PM) protein of unknown function expressed mainly in glial cells and neurons. Most disease-causing missense mutations dramatically reduced the total and PM MLC1 expression levels in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. The impaired expression of the mutants was verified in primary cultures of rat astrocytes, as well as human monocytes, cell types that endogenously express MLC1, demonstrating the relevance of the tissue culture models. Using a combination of biochemical, pharmacological and imaging methods, we also demonstrated that increased endoplasmatic reticulum-associated degradation and endo-lysosomal-associated degradation can contribute to the cell surface expression defect of the mutants. Based on these results, we suggest that MLC1 mutations reduce protein levels in vivo. Since the expression defect of the mutants could be rescued by exposing the mutant-protein expressing cells to low temperature and glycerol, a chemical chaperone, we propose that MLC belongs to the class of conformational diseases. Therefore, we suggest the use of pharmacological strategies that improve MLC1 expression to treat MLC patients.

In this study, we hypothesized that hemoglobin may potentiate the inflammatory response of human macrophages stimulated With a S. Suis Cell-wall preparation. Monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated with the S. suis cell-wall preparation in the presence Or absence Of human hemoglobin, and the secretion of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-8 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The cell-wall preparation induced dose-dependent IL-1 beta. TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 responses in macrophages. Hemoglobin potentiated the cell-wall induced inflammatory response. resulting ill a significantly higher secretion of all the cytokines. The S. suis cell-wall preparation in combination with hemoglobin activated macrophage intracellular kinases involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. In conclusion, hemoglobin, which may be released ill vivo by the action of S. suis suilysin oil red blood cells. contributes to raising the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators by acting in synergy with S. suis cell-wall components. This phenomenon may contribute to the development and the severity of meningitis.

Participation in a trial may necessitate a shift of point of view compared to a certain habitual clinical mentality. A review of the ethical and rational principles governing the design and realization of a trial may help integrate clinical research into expert clinical practices. The treatment of unruptured aneurysms and AVMs remains controversial, and data from observational studies cannot provide a normative basis for clinical decisions. Prevention targets healthy individuals and hence has an obligation of results. There is no opposition between the search for objective facts using scientific methods and the ethics of medical practice since a good practice cannot forbid physicians the means to define what could be beneficial to patients. Perhaps the most difficult task is to recognize the uncertainty that is crucial to allow resorting to trial methodology. The reasoning that is used in research and analysis differs from the casuistic methods typical of clinical work, but clinical judgement remains the dominant factor that decides both who enters the trial and to whom the results of the trial will apply. Randomization is still perceived as a difficult and strange method to integrate into normal practice, but in the face of uncertainty it assures the best chances for the best outcome to each participant. Some tension exists between scientific methods and normal practice, but they need to coexist if we are to progress at the same time we care for patients.

In the present investigation, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated markers of oxidative stress in individuals with BD, as compared to healthy controls. Methods: A Medline search was conducted to identify Studies that measured peripheral markers of oxidative stress in bipolar disorder. Data were subjected to meta-analysis using a random effects model to examine the effect sizes of the pooled results. Bias assessment (Egger's test) and assessment of heterogeneity (l(2)) were also carried out. Results: Thiobarbituric acidic reactive substances (TBARS) (p = 0.001) as well as NO activity 0.02) were significantly increased in BD with a large effect size for TBARS and a moderate effect size for increase in NO. No significant effect sizes were observed for the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase (all p>0.05). Limitations: Some caution is warranted in interpreting these results: (1) Egger's test was positive for SOD, suggesting that SOD results may have been influenced by a publication bias. (2) We analyzed the absolute values of each antioxidant enzyme separately and the literature suggests that an imbalance between the antioxidant enzymes is a better indication of the presence of oxidative stress. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis Suggests that oxidative stress markers are increased in BD and that oxidative stress may play a role in the pathophysiology of BD.

Design: A retrospective study. Setting: A tertiary care university hospital. Participants: Cardiac surgery patients. Measurements and Results: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery with bilateral recording of their baseline ScO(2) using the INVOS 4100 (Somanetics, Troy, MI) were selected. A pulmonary artery catheter was used to obtain their hemodynamic profile. Left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function was evaluated by TEE, after the induction of anesthesia, using standard criteria. A model was developed to predict ScO(2). A total of 99 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were significant correlations between mean ScO2 values and central venous pressure (CVP) (r = -0.31, p = 0.0022), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r -0.25, p = 0.0129), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) (r = -0.24, p = 0.0186), mean arterial pressure/MPAP ratio (r = 0.33, p = 0.0011), LV fractional area change (<35, 35-50, and >= 50, p = 0.0002), regional wall motion score index (r = -0.27, p = 0.0062), and diastolic function (p = 0.0060). The mean ScO(2) had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.74; confidence interval, 0.64-0.84) to identify LV systolic dysfunction. A model predicting baseline ScO(2) was created based on LV systolic echocardiographic variables, CVP, sex, mitral valve surgery, and the use of beta-blocker (r(2) = 0.42, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Baseline ScO(2) values are related to cardiac function and are superior to hemodynamic parameters at predicting LV dysfunction. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study in a medical intensive care unit of a 554-bed, university-affiliated, academic medical center. Results: A total of 924 medical records were included in the database during the Study Period of which 787 patients were included in the study. Out of this cohort, 104 patients (13.2%) eventually developed a NP. The risk for patients who received proton-pump inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0.63; 95% CI 0.39-1.01) was not significantly different than in non exposed patients. Variables most strongly associated with NP were the administration of sedatives or neuromuscular blockers for at least 2 consecutive days (AHR 3.39;95% CI 1.99-5.75) an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) severity score greater than 15 (AHR, 3.34; 95%, CI 1.82-6.50), and presence of a central venous catheter (AHR 1.76; 95% CI 1.12-2.76). Conclusions: Prior use of a proton-pump inhibitor did not correlate with a significant increase in the risk of developing NP. This risk was higher with the administration of sedatives or neuromuscular blockers, increased disease severity, and placement of a central venous catheter. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The aims of this study were to assess the reliability and criterion validity of electromyographic indices of muscle fatigue during an intermittent absolute endurance test. Methods; Healthy subjects (44 males and 29 females; age: 20-55 yrs) performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and a fatigue test while standing in a static dynamometer. Surface EMG signals were collected from four pairs of back muscles (multifidus at the L5 level, iliocostalis lumborum at L3, and longissimus at L1 and T10). The fatigue test, assessing absolute endurance (90-Nm torque), consisted in performing an intermittent extension task to exhaustion. Strength was defined as the peak MVC whereas our endurance criterion was defined as the time to reach exhaustion (Tend) during the fatigue test. From the first five min (females) or ten min (males) of EMG data, frequency and time-frequency domain analyses were applied to compute various spectral indices of muscle fatigue. Results: The EMG indices were more reliable when computed from the time-frequency domain than when computed from the frequency domain, but showed comparable correlation results (criterion validity) with Tend and Strength. Some EMG indices reached moderate to good correlation (range: 0.64-0.69) with Tend, lower correlations (range: 0.39-0.55) with Strength, and good to excellent between-day test-retest reliability results (intra-class correlation range: 0.75-0.83). The quantification of the spectral content more locally in different frequency bands of the power spectrum was less valid and reliable than the indices computed from the entire power spectrum. Differences observed among muscles were interpreted in light of specific neuromuscular activation levels that were observed during the endurance test. These findings supported the use of an intermittent and time-limited (5-10 min) absolute endurance test, that is a practical way to assess the back capacity of chronic low back pain subjects, to assess absolute endurance as well as strength with the use of electromyographic indices of muscle fatigue.

In the United States, ASCE assigned a near failing grade of D- to the condition of water system infrastructure. Therefore. municipalities face a great challenge of managing the expected large replacement and new installation projects of water mains. This research aims at designing a robust model ill order to assess the condition and predict the performance of water mains. Data are collected from three different Canadian municipalities: (1) Moncton (New Brunswick): (2) London (Ontario) and (3) Longueiul (Quebec). An integrated model and framework, using all analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and artificial neural network (ANN), are developed. Ill addition. all automated, User-friendly, web-based infrastructure management tool (CR-Predictor) is developed based oil the integrated AHP/ANN model to assess water main condition. The developed tool and models are validated in which the), show robust results (98.51%)-the average validity percent. They are expected to benefit academics and practitioners (Municipal engineers, Consultants, and contractors) to prioritize inspection and rehabilitation planning for existing water mains.

Developmental control of ultrasound sensitivity by a juvenile hormone analog in crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus)	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Juvenile hormone; Phonotaxis; Development; Auditory	WING-DIMORPHIC CRICKET; HISTORY TRADE-OFF; PHONOTACTIC BEHAVIOR; SEXUAL DIMORPHISM; TEMPORAL PATTERN; AUDITORY NEURON; GRYLLUS-RUBENS; CALLING SONG; FLIGHT; SOUND	Cricket ears are sensitive to ultrasound as well as to lower, cricket-like sound frequencies. Ultrasound stimuli evoke negative phonotaxis in flying crickets, a behavior that has been interpreted as a defensive response against predation by echolocating bats. A recent study an a wing-dimorphic species, Gryllus texensis, showed that short-winged individuals, which are incapable of flight, are less sensitive to ultrasound, but not to lower sound frequencies, than their long-winged counterparts. The developmental decision to develop as a long- or short-winged individual is made during the last two larval instars, and there is some evidence suggesting that juvenile hormone (JH) has an instructive role, such that high levels of JH result in short-winged individuals. We show that treatment of last-instar larvae of a monomorphic long-winged species, Teleogryllus oceanicus, with a JH analog causes a decrease in sensitivity to ultrasound, but not to the lower sound frequency used for intraspecific communication.

Our aim in this paper is to show that although this version of the attitude, which we call GOFEP (Good Old Fashioned Evolutionary Psychology), does not suffer from fatal flaws that would make it incoherent or otherwise conceptually inadequate, it will nevertheless prove unacceptable to most cognitive scientists today. To show this, we raise a common objection to the concept of innateness, not to mount an attack on GOFEP but to study how its proponents have attempted to meet that: challenge. The aim of this move is to show that GOFEP cannot face the challenge without, as it were, losing its soul. There is, or so we will argue, something deep at the heart of GOFEP that prevents its proponents from meeting the challenge.

Pyramidal Neurons Switch From Integrators In Vitro to Resonators Under In Vivo-Like Conditions	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY PREFERENCES; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; CELLS; RESONANCE; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; SYNCHRONY	During wakefulness, pyramidal neurons in the intact brain are bombarded by synaptic input that causes tonic depolarization, increased membrane conductance (i.e., shunting), and noisy fluctuations in membrane potential; by comparison, pyramidal neurons in acute slices typically experience little background input. Such differences in operating conditions can compromise extrapolation of in vitro data to explain neuronal operation in vivo. For instance, pyramidal neurons have been identified as integrators (i. e., class 1 neurons according to Hodgkin's classification of intrinsic excitability) based on in vitro experiments but that classification is inconsistent with the ability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to oscillate/resonate at theta frequency since intrinsic oscillatory behavior is limited to class 2 neurons. Using long depolarizing stimuli and dynamic clamp to reproduce in vivo-like conditions in slice experiments, we show that CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells switch from integrators to resonators, i. e., from class 1 to class 2 excitability. The switch is explained by increased outward current contributed by the M-type potassium current I(M), which shifts the balance of inward and outward currents active at perithreshold potentials and thereby converts the spike-initiating mechanism as predicted by dynamical analysis of our computational model. Perithreshold activation of I(M) is enhanced by the depolarizing shift in spike threshold caused by shunting and/or sodium channel inactivation secondary to tonic depolarization. Our conclusions were validated by multiple comparisons between simulation and experimental data. Thus even so-called "intrinsic" properties may differ qualitatively between in vitro and in vivo conditions.

Nobody likes premies: the relative value of patients' lives	JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY			English	Article						ethics; preterm infant; triage; newborn	GESTATIONAL-AGE; INFANTS; BIRTH; CARE; MANAGEMENT; NEWBORNS; OUTCOMES; LESS	Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether patient selection or triage requires placing a relative value on human lives and whether the values placed on these lives are consistent with current ethical theories. Study Design: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to groups of physicians and students in Montreal. It presented eight currently incompetent patients with potential neurological sequelae requiring emergency care. Predicted outcomes were explicitly described. Four patients had a predicted 50% survival and a 50% chance of impairment; they were a preterm and a term neonate, a 2-month-old and a 50-year-old. Two already disabled patients, a 7-year-old and an 80-year-old, had 50% predicted survival. A 14-year-old and a 35-year-old had 5% survival, but differing impairment. Respondents were asked if they would resuscitate and in what order they would resuscitate if all needed intervention simultaneously. Result: Eighty-five percent response rate, n = 524. The proportion stating they would always resuscitate was smallest for the 80-year-old (18% P<0.001 compared to other patients), then the preterm (35%, P<0.001), then the term and the 50-year-old (53 and 58%, P<0.01). The 2-month-old and the 7-year-old would be resuscitated most frequently (74 and 77%, P<0.01), followed by the patients with 5% survival (64 and 68%, P<0.001). The median order of triage was first the 2-month-old, followed by the 7-year-old, the 14-year-old, the term newborn, the 50-year-old, the 35-year-old, the premature newborn and the 80-year-old. Conclusion: Order of resuscitation was not closely related to the predicted survival, impairment or potential life years gained. Age appeared to have a strong influence, with children's lives being valued more than the adults'. This tendency was reversed for the newborn infants who were undervalued compared with older children, and most particularly for the premature. The value placed on the life of newborns, in particular the premature, is less than that expected by any objective medical data and was not consistent with any ethical theory that we tested.

Delay discounting: Interactions between personality and cognitive ability	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY			English	Article						Personality; Delay discounting; Big Five; Decision making; Delay of gratification	GRATIFICATION; NEUROBIOLOGY; REWARDS	Delay discounting describes the extent to which the value of a reward decreases as the delay to obtaining that reward increases. Lower discounting rates predict better outcomes in social, academic, and health domains. The current study investigates how personality and cognitive ability interact to predict individual differences in delay discounting. Extraversion was found to predict higher discounting rates at the low end of the cognitive distribution, while emotional stability was found to predict lower discounting rates at the high end of the cognitive distribution. These findings support recent models of discounting behavior and suggest that personality and cognitive ability interact in shaping decision making. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

One hypothesis is that vitamin K may also play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A recent study found that patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease consumed less vitamin K than did cognitively intact control subjects. To learn more about the dietary intakes and food sources of vitamin K in these patients, a detailed analysis was conducted. Dietary vitamin K intakes were assessed from 5 nonconsecutive days of food records collected from 31 community-dwelling patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease and in 31 age- and sex-matched cognitively intact control subjects. Mean vitamin K intake on a person-day basis was 63+/-90 mu g/day in patients and 139+/-233 mu g/day in control subjects. Vitamin K intakes were significantly less in participants with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.0001), even after adjusting for energy intakes (P=0.0003). Vegetables, fats, and fruits contributed more than 70% of total vitamin K intake in both groups. The main source of vitamin K was green vegetables, which contributed 33% and 49% to total intakes in patients and control subjects, respectively. This lower consumption of green vegetables in participants with Alzheimer's disease explained their lower vitamin K intakes overall. Despite their limitations, results are in line with the most recent research in both vitamin K and Alzheimer's disease and suggest a need to consider vitamin K in future investigations on the role of diet in Alzheimer's disease.

To describe behavior in such emotion- and reward-laden scenarios, researchers have proposed dual-process models that posit competition between a slower, analytic faculty and a fast, impulsive, emotional faculty. In this paper, we examine the assumptions and limitations of these approaches to modeling motivated choice. We argue that models of this form, though intuitively attractive, are biologically implausible. We describe an approach to motivated choice based on sequential sampling process models that can form a solid theoretical bridge between what is known about brain function and environmental influences upon choice. We further suggest that the complex and dynamic relationships between biology, behavior, and environment affecting choice at the individual level must inform aggregate models of consumer choice. Models using agent-based complex systems may further provide a principled way to relate individual and aggregate consumer choices to the aggregate choices made by businesses and social institutions. We coin the term "brain-to-society systems" choice model for this broad integrative approach.

These operations can include the creation of lesions in the thalamus (thalamotomy) or the globus pallidus (pallidotomy), or the insertion of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the subcortical nuclei. These subcortical targets are often difficult to localize in pre-operative imaging data due to the limited resolution and contrast available in standard MRI or CT techniques. To address this problem, digital atlases of subcortical nuclei are often used to accurately identify surgical targets since they can be warped to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Targeting accuracy thus depends on the quality of the atlas-to-patient warp. In this paper, three atlas-to-patient warping techniques are compared. Two methods rely on an MRI template as an intermediary to estimate a nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation. The third is novel, and uses a pseudo-MRI derived from an atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to estimate the nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation directly. The methods are compared using (1) manual segmentations of subcortical nuclei and (2) functional data from intra-operative thalamic stimulation. The results demonstrate that the template-based atlas-to-patient warping technique is the best of the three for customizing the atlas onto patient data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impaired oxidation of branched-chain amino acids in the medial thalamus of thiamine-deficient rats	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						Thiamine deficiency; Branched-chain amino acid; Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase; Wernicke's encephalopathy	AMINOTRANSFERASE ISOENZYMES; ALPHA-KETOISOCAPROATE; GLUTAMATE METABOLISM; DEHYDROGENASE KINASE; BRAIN METABOLISM; LEUCINE; ENZYMES; ASTROCYTES; TISSUE	Thiamine, in its diphosphate form, is a required cofactor for enzymes of glucose metabolism and branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH). Although metabolic impairments in glucose metabolism have been found to occur in selectively vulnerable brain regions of the thiamine-deficient (TD) brain, the effects of thiamine deficiency on BCKDH have not been studied. BCKDH activity was assayed radiochemically in brain extracts of vulnerable (medial thalamus; MT) versus non-vulnerable (frontal cortex; FC) brain regions of rats made TD by administration of the central thiamine antagonist, pyrithiamine. A significant regional variation in BCKDH within the TD rat brain was noted, with a higher capacity for branched-chain amino acid oxidation in FC compared to MT: BCKDH activity was significantly reduced in MT of TD rats, resulting in selective accumulation of BCAAs in this brain region. Leucine concentrations were elevated over fivefold in the MT of symptomatic TD rats, compared with pair-fed control (PFC) rats. Impaired branched-chain ketoacid metabolism in rats may contribute to the neuronal dysfunction and ultimate thalamic neuronal cell death observed in thiamine deficiency.

The Orphan Transporter Rxt1/NTT4 (SLC6A17) Functions as a Synaptic Vesicle Amino Acid Transporter Selective for Proline, Glycine, Leucine, and Alanine	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							VESICULAR GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; INORGANIC-PHOSPHATE COTRANSPORTER; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTER; MOLECULAR-CLONING; NMDA RECEPTOR; RAT-BRAIN; ACETYLCHOLINE TRANSPORTER; DEPENDENT TRANSPORTER; EXPRESSION PATTERN	Rxt1/NTT4 (SLC6A17) belongs to a gene family of "orphan transporters" whose substrates and consequently functions remain unidentified. Although Rxt1/NTT4 was previously thought to function as a sodium-dependent plasma membrane transporter, recent studies localized the protein to synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Here, we provide evidence indicating that Rxt1/NTT4 functions as a vesicular transporter selective for proline, glycine, leucine, and alanine. Using Western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction approaches, we demonstrate that PC12 cells express the Rxt1/NTT4 gene and protein. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)- mediated knockdown of Rxt1/NTT4 in PC12 cells resulted in selective reductions in uptake levels for proline, glycine, leucine, and alanine. Likewise, gas chromatography analysis of amino acid content in an enriched synaptic vesicle fraction from wild-type and siRNA-Rxt1/NTT4 PC12 cells revealed that proline, glycine, leucine, and alanine levels were decreased in siRNA-treated cells compared with wild-type cells. Furthermore, Rxt1/NTT4-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells exhibited significant uptake increases of these amino acids compared with mock-transfected CHO cells. Finally, proline uptake in both PC12 cells and Rxt1/NTT4-transfected CHO cells was dependent on the electrochemical gradient maintained by the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. These data indicate that the orphan Rxt1/NTT4 protein functions as a vesicular transporter for proline, glycine, leucine, and alanine, further suggesting its important role in synaptic transmission.

The processes in the brain that underlie these behavioural changes have been the subject of recent investigations. What do we know about the maturation of the human brain during adolescence? Do structural changes in the cerebral cortex reflect synaptic pruning? Are increases in white-matter volume driven by myelination? Is the adolescent brain more or less sensitive to reward? Finding answers to these questions might enable us to further our understanding of mental health during adolescence.

Stimulation of the 5-HT(1A) receptors decreases serotonin (5-HT) synthesis and release, but it is not clear if the receptors are fully desensitized following chronic SSRI treatment. The main objective of this study was evaluation of ability of 5-HT(1A) receptors to modulate 5-HT synthesis after 14-day paroxetine treatment. 5-HT(1A) receptor sensitivity following chronic administration of the SSRI paroxetine was assessed by the ability of an acute challenge with the 5-HT(1A) agonist, flesinoxan, to modulate 5-HT synthesis in the rat brain. The rates of 5-HT synthesis were measured using the alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiographic method. The rats were treated for 2 weeks with paroxetine (10 mg/(kg day). s.c., delivered by osmotic minipump). After this treatment, the rats received an acute challenge with flesinoxan (5 mg/kg, i.p.). while the control rats were injected with the vehicle. Forty minutes following the flesinoxan injection. the tracer, alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan. was injected over 2 min. 5-HT synthesis rates were calculated from autoradiographically measured tissue tracer concentrations and plasma time-activity curves. The results demonstrated that the acute flesinoxan challenge produced a significant decrease in 5-HT synthesis rates throughout the rat brain. The greatest decrease was observed in the ventral hippocampus, somatosensory cortex and the ascending serotonergic cell bodies. In comparison with data reported oil an acute challenge with flesinoxan in naive rats (rats without any other treatment), the results presented here suggest a greater effect of flesinoxan oil synthesis reduction in rats chronically treated with paroxetine. The results also suggest that the 5-HT receptors were not fully desensitized by paroxetine treatment, and that the stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors with ail agonist is still capable of reducing 5-HT synthesis.

The frontosubcortical dopamine pathway has been implicated in ADHD. One of the key modulators of extracellular dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex is catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT). The objective of this study was to examine the association of the COMT Val(108/158)Met polymorphism with (1) task-oriented behavior in children with ADHD, and ( 2) response of this behavior given methylphenidate (MPH) treatment. Children of Caucasian ethnicity, having ADHD (n = 188), were assessed using the Restricted Academic Situation Scale (RASS). The RASS uses a simulated academic environment within the research clinic, to assess the child's ability for independent, sustained orientation to an assignment of math problems. Each child was administered placebo and MPH (0.5 mg/kg in a divided b.i.d. dose), each for a 1-week period, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. On day 3 of the respective treatment week, the child was administered placebo/MPH in the clinic, and the acute change in behavior ( before and 1 h after treatment) was evaluated on the RASS. Analysis was carried out using mixed model analysis of variance. Significant main effects of COMT genotype (F-2,F-184 = 5.12, p = 0.007) and treatment (F-1,F-184 = 44.26, p < 0.001) on task-oriented behavior were observed. However, no genotype by treatment interaction was observed. These results suggest that the COMT Val(108/158)Met polymorphism modulates task-oriented behavior, but it does not modulate the response of this behavior with MPH treatment.

Diagnosis and temporal evolution of signs of intracranial hypotension on MRI of the brain	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						Intracranial hypotension; Intracranial hypovolemia; MRI; FLAIR	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LEAKS; CERVICAL EPIDURAL VEINS; THUNDERCLAP HEADACHE; POSTURAL HEADACHE; MANAGEMENT; PRESSURE; HYPOVOLEMIA; FEATURES	Introduction A comprehensive evaluation of cranial magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) of 23 patients with intracranial hypotension (IH) was performed, and the evolution of the abnormalities on follow-up MRIs was correlated with the clinical outcome. Materials and methods The MRI report database at the University Health Network in Toronto was searched, and 23 cases of IH were identified between 2001 and 2007. A retrospective review of the MRIs of the brain and the electronic patient chart was performed. A control group of 40 subjects was also selected to complement the analysis of the pituitary gland. Results A positive venous distention sign (VDS) was observed in 23 out of 23 patients and was the first sign to disappear on early follow-up scans following successful treatment. Pachymeningeal enhancement was seen in 23 out of 23 patients, and pachymeningeal thickening was detectable on unenhanced fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences in 17 out of 23 patients (74%). An increase in pituitary size in IH was also demonstrated based on the measured pituitary height and was qualitatively detectable in 12 out of 21 (57%) patients as the protrusion of the pituitary gland above the sella turica (two postpartum patients were excluded from this analysis). Overall, there was good correlation between the imaging findings and clinical outcome following treatment. Conclusion Accurate diagnosis and follow-up of IH should be possible is some patients on unenhanced MRI of the brain by combining the signs on FLAIR and sagittal T1W images, enabling timely diagnosis in unsuspected cases and avoiding unnecessary administration of gadolinium compounds. In addition, VDS might be useful for early assessment of response to treatment.	[Forghani, R.] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Dept Radiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Farb, R.

METHODS: Ventilation tubes were inserted in the ears of 15 chinchillas. One ear was randomized to receive four drops of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone. A control solution (0.45% NaCl) was applied in the contralateral ear. The eardrops were delivered twice daily for 7 consecutive days. Auditory brain stem response (ABR) measurements were recorded at baseline (post-tympanostomy tube insertion), and on days 4, 8, 15, 22, and 60. RESULTS: An initial transient increase of 8.11 dB nHL was noted in the mean thresholds of the experimental ears at day 4. On the last ABR evaluation (day 60), the mean thresholds were 16.33 +/- 6.93 dB nHL in the experimental ears and 13.66 +/- 6.65 dB nHL in the control ears. The difference in the mean thresholds between the experimental and control ears at day 60 was not significant (95% confidence interval, 3.12, -8.02). Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated normal morphology in all experimental ears that were assessed. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone eardrops did not appear ototoxic when used in chinchillas post-ventilation tube insertion.

Increased gray matter density in young women with chronic vulvar pain	PAIN			English	Article						Clinical pain; Cerebral alterations; Structural magnetic resonance imaging; Voxel-based morphometry; Microglial activation; Neuronal degeneration	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; CHRONIC BACK-PAIN; VESTIBULITIS SYNDROME; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; FIBROMYALGIA PATIENTS; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; MIGRAINE PATIENTS; CHRONIC-FATIGUE; BASAL GANGLIA	Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is a common form of chronic vulvar pain with unknown aetiology. Central pain regulatory mechanisms have been Suggested to be disrupted in PVD, and consequently, PVD may be associated with anatomical changes ill pain modulatory brain areas. Here, we compared total gray matter volumes and regional gray matter densities between 14 medication-free Young women with relatively short-stan ding PVD (1 to 9 yrs) and 14 control Subjects using whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM revealed that PVD Subjects had significantly higher gray matter densities in pain modulatory and stress-related areas, i.e. the parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus and basal ganglia (globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and substantia nigra). In several of these regions, gray matter was related to clinical symptoms, namely lowered pain thresholds and increased pain catastrophizing scores. No region showed decreased gray matter density ill the PVD group. These results point at the morphological alterations in supra-spinal pain modulatory circuitry, which might contribute to the clinical symptoms of patients with PVD. Previous VBM studies in older subjects with a longstanding chronic pain condition have demonstrated gray matter decreases in similar areas. We therefore Speculate that gray matter density might increase in young pain patients with short disease duration and decrease in older Subjects with longstanding disease, similarly to some psychiatric conditions, in which bi-directional changes of gray matter have been observed.

However, firm evidence is still missing. Furthermore, sex-related factors, which seem to affect temporal summation as well as DNIC effects, might thus also modulate the interaction of these two processes. To answer these questions, we investigated 40 young and pain-free subjects (20 female and 20 male). The conditioning stimulus in our DNIC paradigm was realized by immersion of the hand into a water tub containing either 42 degrees C (non-painful heat) or 46 degrees C (painful heat) hot water. The test stimuli were either single pulses or series of five pulses (0.5 Hz repetition frequency) produced by a pressure algometer. The VAS ratings for the last Stimulus in the series were significantly higher than for the single Pulse (temporal summation). The ratings were significantly reduced by the 42 degrees C conditioning stimulus and even more by the 46 degrees C conditioning stimulus, Suggesting DNIC-like inhibition. This was equally true both for the single Pulse and for the series of pulses. Sex differences were not observed for temporal summation, DNIC inhibition or for the interaction of the two processes, although women exhibited significantly lower pressure pain thresholds and higher ratings for the ionic heat stimuli. In Conclusion, DNIC-type inhibition apparently does not preferentially act oil a sensitised pain system after slow temporal summation. Considering the sex of the subjects does not change this insight. (C) 2008 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Influenza virus-like particles produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana induce a protective immune response against a lethal viral challenge in mice	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						influenza; Nicotiana benthamiana; pandemic; transient expression; vaccine; virus-like particle	CELL-CULTURE; LIPID RAFTS; VACCINE; PLANTS; HA; HEMAGGLUTININ; NEURAMINIDASE; PURIFICATION; SYSTEM; NA	A strain-specific vaccine represents the best possible response to the threat of an influenza pandemic. Rapid delivery of such a vaccine to the world's population before the peak of the first infection wave seems to be an unattainable goal with the current influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity. Plant-based transient expression is one of the few production systems that can meet the anticipated surge requirement. To assess the capability of plant agroinfiltration to produce an influenza vaccine, we expressed haemagglutinin (HA) from strains A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) by agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Size distribution analysis of protein content in infiltrated leaves revealed that HA was predominantly assembled into high-molecular-weight structures. H5-containing structures were purified and examination by transmission electron microscopy confirmed virus-like particle (VLP) assembly. High-performance thin layer chromatography analysis of VLP lipid composition highlighted polar and neutral lipid contents comparable with those of purified plasma membranes from tobacco plants. Electron microscopy of VLP-producing cells in N. benthamiana leaves confirmed that VLPs accumulated in apoplastic indentations of the plasma membrane. Finally, immunization of mice with two doses of as little as 0.1 mu g of purified influenza H5-VLPs triggered a strong immune response against the homologous virus, whereas two doses of 0.5 mu g of H5-VLPs conferred complete protection against a lethal challenge with the heterologous A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1) strain. These results show, for the first time, that plants are capable of producing enveloped influenza VLPs budding from the plasma membrane; such VLPs represent very promising candidates for vaccination against influenza pandemic strains.

Because disruption of the various subunits of the AP complexes is embryonic lethal in the majority of cases, characterization of their function in vivo is still lacking. Here, we describe the first mutation in the human AP1S1 gene, encoding the small subunit sigma 1A of the AP-1 complex. This founder splice mutation, which leads to a premature stop codon, was found in four families with a unique syndrome characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia (MEDNIK). To validate the pathogenic effect of the mutation, we knocked down Ap1s1 expression in zebrafish using selective antisens morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO). The knockdown phenotype consisted of perturbation in skin formation, reduced pigmentation, and severe motility deficits due to impaired neural network development. Both neural and skin defects were rescued by co-injection of AMO with wildtype (WT) human AP1S1 mRNA, but not by co-injecting the truncated form of AP1S1, consistent with a loss-of-function effect of this mutation. Together, these results confirm AP1S1 as the gene responsible for MEDNIK syndrome and demonstrate a critical role of AP1S1 in development of the skin and spinal cord.

However, the precise interactions of ethanol with the endogenous opioid system at the level of the CeA have not been investigated. The aim of the current study was to investigate the hypothesis that acute systemic ethanol administration will increase the release of endogenous opioid peptides at the level of the CeA in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Rats were implanted with a unilateral guide cannula to aim microdialysis probes at the CeA. Intraperitoneal injections of saline and various doses of ethanol (0.8, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, and 2.8 g ethanol/kg body weight) were administered to the rats. Dialysate samples were collected at 30-min intervals at distinct time points prior to and following treatment. Radioimmunoassays specific for beta-endorphin, met-enkephalin, and dynorphin A1-8 were used to determine the effect of ethanol on the content of the opioid peptides in the dialysate. We report that the 2.8-g/kg dose of ethanol induced a long-lasting increase in beta-endorphin release from 60 min onwards following administration and, later, an ongoing increase in dynorphin A1-8 release. None of the ethanol doses tested elicited significant changes in dialysate met-enkephalin content compared to the saline treatment. Acute systemic ethanol administration induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in beta-endorphin and dynorphin A1-8 release at the level of the CeA, which may be involved in ethanol consumption.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 12 patients who underwent low dose chemotherapy for extra abdominal desmoid of different locations. The study took place in the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Canada between 1996 and 2003. We evaluated the patients for their compliance, tumor response, complications of treatment, and impact of treatment on symptoms. There were 7 females and 5 males with a mean age of 46 years. Results: Disease related morbidity included pain in 7 patients, functional limitation in 7 and cosmetic defects in 3. The mean tumor size was I I cm (3-20 cm). The mean follow-up was 43 months (1571 months). Chemotherapy was administered weekly. Complications were significant. Only 2 patients did not experience the toxicity. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 6 tumors showed a partial response and 6 remained stable. None showed progression. Of the 7 patients who had painful tumors, 6 achieved significant symptom relief. Function was improved in 3 and restored to normal in 4. Cosmesis was improved in 2 of the 3. At latest follow-up, tumors remained stable in 8, one has markedly regressed and 3 exhibited progression at an average of 54 months. Only one patient required surgery. The only long term side effect was a sensory peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion: Low dose chemotherapy was found to be a valuable adjunct to prevent local progression and improve symptoms.

An Instructive Case of an 8-Year-Old Boy With Intellectual Disability	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Review							BECKER MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; SEVERE MENTAL-RETARDATION; GENE	A child with global developmental delay sparing motor skills evolving into later intellectual disability with a consistently normal neuromuscular examination was discovered to have a dystrophin specific mutation in the 3' end of the gene. The deletion in the DMD gene was unsuspected and discovered through array comparative genomic hybridization and confirmed on polymerase chain reaction analysis. This case shows a central nervous system-specific and restrictive phenotype for a disorder that is conceptualized as being progressively neuromuscular in clinical expression. Given the familial and therapeutic implications for accurate diagnosis of DMD mutations, this case raises the possible need for screening boys with global developmental delay/intellectual disability even in the absence of any overt muscle weakness and further shows the utility of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis in the evaluation of patients with nonsyndromic mental retardation.

Here, we present the leading approaches and consider ways to adjudicate among them empirically. Anatomically, we focus on the cytoarchitecture of Brodmann areas 44 and 45, which constitute Broca's region. Functionally, we discuss four views: action perception, working memory, syntactic complexity and syntactic movement. We compare these views, reflect on how they can be distinguished experimentally and review relevant aphasia and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Although no single hypothesis accounts for all of the data, the role of Broca's region in language comprehension is best explained by the syntactic movement account. This conclusion opens the door for an attempt to define general principles for the neural representation of linguistic knowledge.

The presence of TRPV1 in the brain is now well established but, despite intensive research, its function is only beginning to be understood. New evidence implies an unexpected role for hippocampal TRPV1 in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, it was hypothesized that the effects of the cannabinoid-receptor antagonist rimonabant on mood might be due to its capability to antagonize TRPV1 receptors at high doses. Most studies, however, imply a positive (e.g. anxiolytic) outcome for TRPV1 antagonism. With potent small-molecule TRPV1 antagonists undergoing clinical trials, the effect of brain TRPV1 blockade might determine the future of this class of novel analgesic drugs. Clearly, more research is needed to delineate the biological role of brain TRPV1 receptors.

The P2X(4) subtype, upregulated in activated microglia, is thought to play a critical role in the development of tactile allodynia following peripheral nerve injury. Posttranslational regulation of P2X(4) function is crucial to the cellular mechanisms of neuropathic pain, however it remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the phosphoinositides PI(4,5)P(2) (PIP(2)) and PI(3,4,5)P(3) (PIP(3)), products of phosphorylation by wortmannin-sensitive phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, can modulate the function of native and recombinant P2X(4) receptor channels. In BV-2 microglial cells, depleting the intracellular levels of PIP(2) and PIP(3) with wortmannin significantly decreased P2X(4) current amplitude and P2X(4)-mediated calcium entry measured in patch clamp recordings and ratiometric ion imaging, respectively. Wortmannin-induced depletion of phosphoinositides in Xenopus oocytes decreased the current amplitude of P2X(4) responses by converting ATP into a partial agonist. It also decreased their recovery from desensitization and affected their kinetics. Injection of phosphoinositides in wortmannin-treated oocytes reversed these effects and application of PIP(2) on excised inside-out macropatches rescued P2X(4) currents from rundown. Moreover, we report the direct interaction of phospholipids with the proximal C-terminal domain of P2X(4) subunit (Cys(360)-Val(375)) using an in vitro binding assay. These results demonstrate novel regulatory roles of the major signaling phosphoinositides PIP(2) and PIP(3) on P2X(4) function through direct channel-lipid interactions.

In the present study, we show results of three experiments on multisensory perception of emotions using newly validated sets of dynamic visual and non-linguistic vocal clips of affect expressions. In Experiment 1, participants were required to categorise fear and disgust expressions displayed auditorily, visually, or using congruent or incongruent audio-visual stimuli. Results showed faster and more accurate categorisation in the bimodal congruent situation than in the unimodal conditions. in the incongruent situation, participant preferentially categorised the affective expression based on the visual modality, demonstrating a visual dominance in emotional processing. However, when the reliability of the visual stimuli was diminished, participants categorised incongruent bimodal stimuli preferentially via the auditory modality. These results demonstrate that visual dominance in affect perception does not occur in a rigid manner, but follows flexible situation-dependent rules. In Experiment 2, we requested the participants to pay attention to only one sensory modality at a time in order to test the putative mandatory nature of multisensory affective interactions. We observed that even if they were asked to ignore concurrent sensory information, the irrelevant information significantly affected the processing of the target. This observation was especially true when the target modality was less reliable. Altogether, these findings indicate that the perception of emotion expressions is a robust multisensory situation which follows rules that have been previously observed in other perceptual domains.

Selective Contribution of Interleukin-6 and Leptin to Brain Inflammatory Signals Induced by Systemic LPS Injection in Mice	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Indexing terms; systemic inflammation; immune-to-brain communication; cytokines; circumventricular organs; endothelial cells	FACTOR-KAPPA-B; SENSORY CIRCUMVENTRICULAR ORGANS; NUCLEAR STAT3 TRANSLOCATION; BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE; INDUCIBLE CYCLOOXYGENASE EXPRESSION; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-INDUCED ANOREXIA; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; VENTROMEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS	This study aimed to address the relative contributions of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the cytokine-like hormone leptin to the genomic activation of brain cells during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation. Wildtype and IL-6KO mice were injected with LPS (50 mu g/kg, intraperitoneally) and the brains analyzed by immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LPS induced a pronounced nuclear translocation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) throughout the brains of wildtype mice, an effect that was significantly diminished, but not abolished, in the IL-6KOs. The remnant STAT3-activation, although still observed within some of the same areas activated by IL-6, was most intense in ependymal and meningial cells and along distinct blood vessels throughout the brain. This expression was almost totally abolished in tire presence of an anti-leptin antiserum. Interestingly, the induction of cyclooxygenase 2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES), the rate-limiting enzymes for synthesis of PGE2 by LPS, was diminished to a degree that correlated with the absence of IL-6 but not entirely with leptin. These results demonstrate that the induction of the inflammatory pathway in the brain is mediated by both IL-6 and leptin, which appear to work in tandem. Unlike IL-6, however, the contribution of leptin to this response was limited to distinct cell types/brain areas and STAT3-responsive target genes implicated in the brain-controlled sickness-type response. The physiological significance of leptin's action on meningeal and endothelial cells remains to be clarified but might reflect a role in LPS-induced immune cell infiltration into the brain. J. Comp.

IGFBP7 gene regulation and its potential role in tumor angiogenesis remain unclear. Mechanisms of IGFBP7 induction and its angiogenic capacity were examined in human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) exposed to tumor-like conditions. HBEC treated with GBM cell (U87MG)-conditioned media (-CM) exhibited fourfold upregulation of IGFBP7 mRNA and protein compared to control cells. IGFBP7 gene regulation in HBEC was methylation independent. U87MG-CM analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay contained similar to 5 pM transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, a concentration sufficient to stimulate IGFBP7 in HBEC to similar levels as U87MG-CM. Both pan-TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody(1D11) and the TGF-beta 1 receptor (activin receptor-like kinase 5, ALK5) antagonist, SB431542, blocked U87MG-CM-induced IGFBP7 expression in HBEC, indicating that TGF-beta 1 is an important tumor-secreted effector capable of IGFBP7 induction in endothelial cells. HBEC exposed to either U87MG-CM or IGFBP7 protein exhibited increased capillary-like tube (CLT) formation in Matrigel. Both TGF-beta 1- and U87MG-CM-induced Smad-2 phosphorylation and U87MG-CM-induced CLT formation in HBEC were inhibited by the ALK5 antagonist, SB431542. These data suggest that proangiogenic IGFBP7 maybe induced in brain endothelial cells by TGF-beta s secreted by GBM, most likely through TGF-beta 1/ALK5/Smad-2 pathway.

Their axon tracts through the brain stem are established by a simple set of pioneer axons with precise trajectories parallel to the floor plate. To identify longitudinal guidance mechanisms in vivo, the overall role of floor plate tissue and the specific roles of Slit/Robo signals were tested. Ectopic induction or genetic deletion of the floor plate diverted longitudinal axons into abnormal trajectories. The expression patterns of the diffusible cues of the Slit family were altered in the floor plate experiments, suggesting their involvement in longitudinal guidance. Genetic tests of Slit1 and Slit2, and the Slit receptors Robo1 and Robo2 were carried out in mutant mice. Slit1; Slit2 double mutants had severe longitudinal errors, particularly for ventral axons, including midline crossing and wandering longitudinal trajectories. Robo1 and Robo2 were largely genetically redundant, and neither appeared to specify specific tract positions. However, combined Robo1 and Robo2 mutations strongly disrupted each pioneer tract. Thus, pioneer axons depend on long-range floor plate cues, with Slit/Robo signaling required for precise longitudinal trajectories.	[Farmer, W.

Until recently, NMDA receptors have been considered solely as neuronal components, but some evidence suggests that glial cells in the hippocampus, and in particular astrocytes, also could be activated by NMDA applications. On the basis of their shape and electrophysiological properties (linear and rectified IN curve), we describe two different populations of glial cells from GFAP-GFP transgenic mice that are activated differentially by NMDA. We found that linear glial cells were depolarized by NMDA that was not dependent on Ca(2+) rise but partially involved a Ca(2+) entry. Additionally, NMDA-induced depolarization of linear glial cells involved both a TTX-independent pathway likely through a direct activation, and a TTX-dependent pathway that required neuronal activity. The NMDA-induced depolarization in these cells was in part due to the activation of glutamate transporters and GABA(B) receptors. Furthermore, TTX-dependent NMDA-induced activation regulates the level of gap junction coupling between linear glial cells. In contrast, NMDA-induced depolarization in outward rectifying cells do not require a Ca(2+) rise but are mediated directly by Ca(2+) entry and are independent of glutamate transporters, GABA(B) and GABA(A) receptors. Our findings reveal that NMDA differentially activates hippocampal glial cells and the glial network through heterogeneous mechanisms in a cell-type specific manner. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Inflammatory cytokines are thought to play an important role in modulating hypoxic/ischemic damage in immature brain. Evidence for this from animal models is based mainly on studies that used a model of carotid artery ligation with hypoxia in postnatal rats. However, little is known about the role of cytokines in brain injury after whole-body hypoxia at the time of birth. This study used a well-established rat model of global birth hypoxia to assess mRNA and protein expression of three key proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (TNF-alpha) in the brain, liver, and kidney of neonates. We observed decreased IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha protein, and decreased IL-6 mRNA in brains of neonates in the 2 hr after birth hypoxia but increased IL-6 and IL-1 beta in liver compared with vaginally born controls. Increasing the severity of the insult by increasing the period of anoxic exposure further decreased brain IL-1 beta, whereas delivering anoxia under hypothermic conditions, known to be neuro protective, attenuated the decrease in brain IL-1 beta. These data suggest that decreased brain levels of inflammatory cytokines may modulate central nervous system responses to global birth hypoxia in rats. Our findings of decreased brain cytokine expression after global birth hypoxia contrast with reports of increased brain cytokines after carotid artery ligation with hypoxia in postnatal rats; possible reasons for these differences are discussed.

The demonstrated beneficial effect of FTY720 on disease activity in RR-MS patients and in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is largely attributed to effects on the systemic immune system. In addition, unlike other Current systemic immuno-modulators used in MS, the lipophilic nature of FTY720 allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Since S1P receptors are expressed oil all cell types, FTY720 has the potential to exert effects directly on the BBB and on resident cells of the CNS. The latter include cells implicated in regulating immune reactivity within the CNS (astrocytes, microglia), those that are targeted by the disease process (oligodendrocytes, neurons), and those involved in repair (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells). In vitro studies document the dose-dependent effects of FTY720 on neural cell survival, differentiation, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Animal model studies, specifically EAE, indicate an overall neuroprotective effect of FTY720 mediated at least in part by its actions within the CNS. Ongoing studies will need to define the direct and indirect (via immune-modulation) effects of FTY720 on the CNS across the broad clinical spectrum of MS. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The white matter has been structurally defined in the past only at its core regions (deep white matter). However, the most peripheral white matter areas, which are interleaved between the cortex and the deep white matter, have lacked clear anatomical definitions and parcellations. We used axonal fiber alignment information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to delineate the peripheral white matter, and investigated its relationship with the cortex and the deep white matter. Using DTI data from 81 healthy subjects, we identified nine common, blade-like anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into 21 subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short association fiber tracts connecting adjacent gyri (U-fibers) were also identified reproducibly among the healthy population. We anticipate that this atlas will be useful resource for atlas-based white matter anatomical studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We previously showed that rat mothers caring for pups subjected to mild pain in neonatal life increased pup licking and grooming behavior. Therefore, we tested whether naturally occurring variations in maternal behavior would modulate the effects of repeated mild inflammatory pain on behavioral responses to pain and stress in the adult male offspring. Rat pups were either uninjected (UI) or injected twice daily between PND3 and PND14 with either saline (0.9%) or formalin (0.25-0.4%) in the footpad of the hindpaw. Maternal behavior (pup licking and grooming) was recorded under basal conditions and after reunion with the litter post injection to determine maternal phenotype (High, Middle, Low licking). Adult offspring (PND60) were tested for their thermal sensitivity, inflammatory pain responses after formalin injection and neuroendocrine responses to formalin injections. Maternal phenotype significant after thermal stimulation, but not formalin injection. Offspring from the High licking mothers displayed increased withdrawal latencies compared to offspring from Low mothers, regardless of neonatal treatment. Pain responses after formalin injection were higher in offspring receiving formalin as neonates compared to saline-treated or uninjected rats. demonstrating a long lasting increased sensitivity to inflammatory pain. Neuroendocrine responses to pain stress were not affected by neonatal treatment. These data suggest that changes in maternal behavior can influence some modalities of pain sensitivity and that repeated mild inflammatory pain in neonatal period causes hypersensitivity to formalin in the adult offspring (C) 2008 International Association for the Study of Pain.

In previous work from our laboratory, we have shown that in animal models of neuropathic pain there is a sprouting of sympathetic fibers into the upper dermis, a territory normally devoid of them. However, it is not known whether such sympathetic spouting, which is likely trophic factor mediated, also occurs in chronic inflammation and arthritis. In the present study, we used a rat model of chronic inflammation in which a small single dose of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected subcutaneously, unilaterally, into the plantar surface of the hindpaw. This led to a localized long-term skin inflammation and arthritis in all joints of the hindpaw. Animals were perfused with histological fixatives at 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks after the injection. Experimental animals treated with CFA were compared to saline-injected animals. We then investigated the changes in the pattern of peripheral innervation of the peptidergic nociceptors and sympathetic fibers in rat glabrous hindpaw skin. Antibodies directed towards calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) were used for the staining of peptidergic and sympathetic fibers, respectively. Immunofluorescence was then used to analyze the different nerve fiber populations of the upper dermis. At 4 weeks following CFA treatment, DBH-immunoreactive (IR) fibers were found to sprout into the upper dermis, in a pattern similar to the one we had observed in animals with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in a previous publication. There was also a significant increase in the density of CGRP-IR fibers in the upper dermis in CFA treated animals at 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-injection. The increased peptidergic fiber innervation and the ectopic autonomic fibers found in the upper dermis may have a role in the pain-related behavior displayed by these animals.

TIMED RESTRICTED FEEDING EXPRESSION OF THE CLOCK OVAL NUCLEUS OF THE BED RESTORES THE RHYTHMS OF PROTEIN, PERIOD2, IN THE NUCLEUS OF THE STRIA TERMINALIS AND CENTRAL NUCLEUS OF THE AMYGDALA IN ADRENALECTOMIZED RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adrenalectomy; corticosterone; anticipatory activity; limbic forebrain; circadian rhythms; immunocytochemistry	SCHEDULES; PATHWAYS; BRAIN	Feeding schedules that limit food availability to a set time of day are powerful synchronizers of the rhythms of expression of the circadian clock protein Period 2 (PER2) in the limbic forebrain in rats. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms that mediate the effect of such timed restricted feeding (TRF) schedules on the expression of PER2. Adrenal glucocorticoids have been implicated in the circadian regulation of clock genes expression in peripheral tissues as well as in the control of the rhythms of expression of PER2 in certain limbic forebrain regions, such as the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) in rats. To study the possible involvement of glucocorticoids in the regulation of PER2 expression by TRF, we assessed the effect of adrenalectomy on TRF-entrained PER2 rhythms in the limbic forebrain in rats. Adrenalectomy selectively abolished the rhythms of PER2 in the BNSTov and CEA in normally fed rats, as previously shown, but had no effect on TRF-entrained PER2 rhythms in the same structures. These findings show that the effect of TRF on PER2 rhythms in the limbic forebrain is independent of adrenal glucocorticoids and demonstrate that the involvement of glucocorticoids in the regulation PER2 rhythms in the limbic forebrain is not only region specific, as previously shown, but also state dependent.

It is amply demonstrated that that neurons in adult visual cortex of cats are orientation-selective that is they respond with the highest firing rates to preferred oriented stimuli. Methodology/Principal Findings: In anesthetized cats, prepared in a conventional fashion for single cell recordings, the present investigation shows that presenting a stimulus uninterruptedly at a non-preferred orientation for twelve minutes induces changes in orientation preference. Across all conditions orientation tuning curves were investigated using a trial by trial method. Contrary to what has been previously reported with shorter adaptation duration, twelve minutes of adaptation induces mostly attractive shifts, i. e. toward the adapter. After a recovery period allowing neurons to restore their original orientation tuning curves, we carried out a second adaptation which produced three major results: (1) more frequent attractive shifts, (2) an increase of their magnitude, and (3) an additional enhancement of responses at the new or acquired preferred orientation. Additionally, we also show that the direction of shifts depends on the duration of the adaptation: shorter adaptation in most cases produces repulsive shifts, whereas adaptation exceeding nine minutes results in attractive shifts, in the same unit. Consequently, shifts in preferred orientation depend on the duration of adaptation. Conclusion/Significance: The supplementary response improvements indicate that neurons in area 17 keep a memory trace of the previous stimulus properties, thereby upgrading cellular performance. It also highlights the dynamic nature of basic neuronal properties in adult cortex since repeated adaptations modified both the orientation tuning selectivity and the response strength to the preferred orientation. These enhanced neuronal responses suggest that the range of neuronal plasticity available to the visual system is broader than anticipated.

Here we show, using high angular resolution diffusion imaging in the living human brain, a dissociation between the specific projections from the pars opercularis (area 44) and the pars triangularis (area 45) in the ventrolateral frontal lobe. As in the macaque monkey, area 44 has distinct connections with the rostral inferior parietal lobule via the third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. In contrast, area 45 connects with the superior temporal gyrus, anterior to Heschl's gyrus, via the extreme capsule fiber system. These results highlight the differences in connectivity between areas 44 and 45 which had previously been thought to be uniformly connected with the posterior temporal region via the arcuate fasciculus. We also provide evidence in the human brain that the arcuate fasciculus, as in the macaque monkey brain, connects the posterior superior temporal region with dorsolateral frontal areas 8 and rostral 6 that lie above areas 44 and 45. Thus, monkey and human evidence suggests that the connections of areas 44 and 45 are much more differentiated than had previously been thought and provide the basis for studies searching for their differential contribution in function.

The fact that HSV was present in elderly subjects with AD suggests that the virus could be a co-factor of the disease. We investigated the risk of developing AD in anti-HSV immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive subjects (indicator of a lifelong infection to HSV) and IgM-positive subjects (indicator of primary infection or reactivation of the virus) in a longitudinal population-based cohort of elderly subjects living in the community. Methods: Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the risk of developing AD according to the presence or not of anti-HSV IgG and IgM antibodies, assessed in the sera of 512 elderly initially free of dementia followed for 14 years. Results: During the follow-up, 77 incident AD cases were diagnosed. Controlled for age, gender, educational level and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status, IgM-positive subjects showed a significant higher risk of developing AD (HR = 2.55; 95% CI [1.38-4.72]), although no significant increased risk was observed in IgG-positive subjects (HR = 1.67; 95% CI [0.75-3.73]). No modification effect with APOE4 status was found. Conclusion: Reactivation of HSV seropositivity is highly correlated with incident AD. HSV chronic infection may therefore be contributive to the progressive brain damage characteristic of AD.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether maternal infection and associated fever near term disrupts synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of the offspring. We used LPS to mimic bacterial infection and trigger the maternal inflammatory response in near-term rats. LPS was administered to rats on embryonic days 15 and 16 and hippocampal synaptic transmission was evaluated in the offspring on postnatal days 20-25. Only offspring from rats that showed a fever in response to LPS were tested. Schaffer collateral-evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and fiber volleys in CA1 of hippocampal slices appeared smaller in offspring from the LPS group compared with controls, but, when the fEPSPs were normalized to the amplitude of fiber volleys, they were larger in the LPS group. In addition, intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons was heightened, as antidromic field responses in the LPS group were greater than those from control. Short-, but not long-term plasticity was impaired since paired-pulse facilitation of the fEPSP was attenuated in the LPS group, whereas no differences in long-term potentiation were noted. These results suggest that LPS-induced inflammation during pregnancy produces in the offspring a reduction in presynaptic input to CA1 with compensatory enhancements in postsynaptic glutamatergic response and pyramidal cell excitability. Neurodevelopmental disruption triggered by prenatal infection can have profound effects on hippocampal synaptic transmission, likely contributing to the memory and cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia.

In several bird species, females prefer males that sing more complex songs but it is unclear which aspect of male quality is signalled by this trait. Here we tested the hypothesis that a male's song complexity conveys information about his learning capacity. We recorded the songs of 27 male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, and quantified their complexity by measuring average song phrase duration, the total number of elements and the number of unique elements per song phrase. We then presented each male with a novel foraging task and recorded the number of trials he required to solve the task. We found a positive correlation between song complexity and learning proficiency: males with more song phrase elements required fewer learning trials to solve the novel foraging task. This result suggests that a male's song complexity signals his learning ability, which may have contributed to the selective pressures driving females to choose males with more complex songs.

As might be expected, damage to the optic nerve deprives the brain of visual input and causes visual loss. Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common acute optic neuropathy of middle and late life, with an annual incidence of up to 10 cases per 100 000 individuals older than 50 years. 1 It is characterized by rapid and painless unilateral visual loss, altitudinal visual field defects, and optic disc swelling.

Despite high abundance in mature skeletal muscle, levels of the causative mutation are low or undetectable in satellite cells. The activation of these typically quiescent mitotic cells and subsequent shifting of wild-type mtDNA templates to mature muscle have been proposed as a means of restoring a more normal mitochondrial genotype and function in these patients. Because resistance exercise is known to serve as a stimulus for satellite cell induction within active skeletal muscle, this study sought to assess the therapeutic potential of resistance training in eight patients with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions by assessing: physiological determinants of peak muscle strength and oxidative capacity and muscle biopsy-derived measures of damage, mtDNA mutation load, level of oxidative impairment and satellite cell numbers. Our results show that 12 weeks of progressive overload leg resistance training led to: (i) increased muscle strength; (ii) myofibre damage and regeneration; (iii) increased proportion of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-positive satellite cells; (iv) improved muscle oxidative capacity. Taken together, we believe these findings support the hypothesis of resistance exercise-induced mitochondrial gene-shifting in muscle containing satellite cells which have low or absent levels of deleted mtDNA. Further investigation is warranted to refine parameters of the exercise training protocol in order to maximize the training effect on mitochondrial genotype and treatment potential for patients with selected, sporadic mutations of mtDNA in skeletal muscle.

We explored navigational skills in both early and late blind individuals and structural differences in the hippocampus, a brain region well known to be involved in spatial processing. Thirty-eight participants were divided into three groups: early blind individuals (n 12; loss of vision before 5 years of age; mean age 33.8 years), late blind individuals (n 7; loss of vision after 14 years of age; mean age 39.9 years) and 19 sighted, blindfolded matched controls. Subjects undertook route learning and pointing tasks in a maze and a spatial layout task. Anatomical data was collected by MRI. Remarkably, we not only show that blind individuals possess superior navigational skills than controls on the route learning task, but we also show for the first time a significant volume increase of the hippocampus in blind individuals [F(1,36) 6.314; P 0.01; blind: mean 4237.00 mm(3), SE 107.53; sighted: mean 3905.74 mm(3), SE 76.27], irrespective of whether their blindness was congenital or acquired. Overall, our results shed new light not only on the construction of spatial concepts and the non-necessity of vision for its proper development, but also on the hippocampal plasticity observed in adult blind individuals who have to navigate in this space.

To further test this hypothesis, 10 patients with PD and 12 healthy controls were tested on a modified, learning version of the Tower of London task while undergoing positron emission tomography at four different time points over the course of learning. Despite having less accurate problem solving abilities than controls, PD patients were able to acquire the skill learning task. However, as compared to controls, they maintained higher levels of cerebral blood flow activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and showed an increase in activity in the frontopolar cortex and posterior cingulate over the course of learning. These findings reflect a shift to the explicit memory system in PD patients, enabling them to learn this cognitive skill, which is normally acquired by control subjects using implicit learning strategies and frontostriatal circuitry.

In Experiment 1, participants were asked to identify one of three presented voices (self, familiar or unknown) by responding with either the right or the left-hand. In Experiment 2, participants were presented with auditory morphs between the self-voice and a familiar voice and were asked to perform a forced-choice decision on speaker identity with either the left or the right-hand. In Experiment 3, participants were presented with continua of auditory morphs between self- or a familiar voice and a famous voice, and were asked to stop the presentation either when the voice became "more famous" or "more familiar/self". While these experiments did not reveal an overall hand difference for self-recognition, the last study, with improved design and controls, suggested a right-hemisphere advantage for self-compared to other-voice recognition, similar to that observed in the visual domain for self-faces.

The effects of simulated stuttering and prolonged speech on the neural activation patterns of stuttering and nonstuttering adults	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Stuttering; fMRI; Sparse sampling; Auditory processing; Speech motor control; Modified speech; Prolonged speech; Simulated stuttering; SPM2	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MOTOR IMAGERY; BRAIN ACTIVATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; WORKING-MEMORY; LEXICAL ACCESS; FMRI; PERCEPTION; ARTICULATION; RESPONSES	Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the neural correlates of passive listening, habitual speech and two modified speech patterns (Simulated stuttering and prolonged speech) in stuttering and nonstuttering adults. Within-group comparisons revealed increased right hemisphere biased activation of speech-related regions during the Simulated stuttered and prolonged speech tasks, relative to the habitual speech task, in the stuttering group. No significant activation differences were observed within the nonstuttering participants during these speech conditions. Between-group comparisons revealed less left superior temporal gyrus activation in stutterers during habitual speech and increased right inferior frontal gyrus activation during simulated stuttering relative to nonstutterers. Stutterers were also found to have increased activation in the left middle and Superior temporal gyri and right primary Motor Cortex and Supplementary motor cortex during the passive listening condition relative, to nonstutterers. The results provide further evidence for the presence of functional deficiencies underlying auditory processing, motor planning and execution in people who stutter, with these differences being affected by speech manner.

Several studies report associations between IL-1 beta polymorphisms and AD, but findings from different studies are controversial. Our aim was to verify the correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL-1 beta, at sites -511 and +3953, and AD by meta-analysis. Computerized bibliographic searches of PUBMED and AlzGene database (http://www.alzgene.org) were supplemented with manual searches of reference lists. There is evidence for association between IL-1 beta + 3953 SNP and AD, with an OR = 1.60 (95%C.I.: 1.16-2.22; Z = 2.83 p = 0.005) for TT genotype. No significant difference in genotype distribution of the IL-1 beta -511 SNP in AD was obtained, but high between-study heterogeneity was found. To reduce heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were performed using, as stratifying variables, characteristics of the population under study (age, gender, type of AD diagnosis, Mini Mental State Examination of the controls) and characteristics related to the study design (statistical power of individual studies). The frequency of the IL-1 beta -511 TT genotype resulted significantly higher than other genotypes only when the Caucasian studies with the highest statistical power were included in the subgroup analysis (OR = 1.32; 95% C.I.: 1.03-1.69; p = 0.03), with no evidence of between-study heterogeneity. our data support an association between the TT genotype of IL-1 beta +3953 SNP and AD, and suggest a possible association of the -511 TT genotype. Unreplicability of the results seems to be due mainly to the lack of statistical power of the individual studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modulation of the anti-nociceptive effects of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol by peripherally administered FAAH and MGL inhibitors in a neuropathic pain model	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						2-arachidonoyl glycerol; URB602; URB597; endocannabinoids; cannabinoid receptors; monoacylglycerol lipase; fatty acid amide hydrolase; neuropathic pain	MECHANICALLY-EVOKED-RESPONSES; CANNABINOID CB2 RECEPTORS; STRESS-INDUCED ANALGESIA; ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE; ENDOCANNABINOID 2-ARACHIDONOYLGLYCEROL; MONOACYLGLYCEROL LIPASE; ANANDAMIDE HYDROLYSIS; ENDOGENOUS LIGAND; SAPHENOUS NERVE; KNOCKOUT MICE	Background and purpose: There are limited options for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), are promising pain modulators and there is recent evidence of interactions between anandamide and 2-AG biosynthesis and metabolism. It has been clearly demonstrated that 2-AG degradation is mainly catalysed not only by monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) but also by a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Inhibitors specifically targeting these two enzymes have also been described: URB602 and URB597, respectively. However, the anti-nociceptive effects of the combination of peripherally injected 2-AG, URB602 and URB597 in a neuropathic pain model have not yet been determined. This was performed in the presence or absence of cannabinoid CB(1) (AM251) and CB(2) (AM630) receptor antagonists. Experimental approach: Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated in 213 male Wistar rats allocated to 32 different groups. Drugs were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal surface of the hind paw (50 mu L) 15 min before pain tests. Key results: 2-AG, URB602 and URB597 significantly decreased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia with ED50 of 1.6 +/- 1.5 and 127 +/- 83 mu g for 2-AG and URB602, respectively. These effects were mediated locally and were mostly inhibited by the two cannabinoid antagonists. Conclusions and implications: The combination of the three compounds did not produce any greater anti-allodynic or anti-hyperalgesic effects, suggesting that FAAH inhibition could reduce or limit the anti-nociceptive effects of 2-AG. Peripheral administration of endocannabinoids or MGL/FAAH inhibitors is a promising analgesic approach requiring further investigation.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether intraoperative lidocaine infusion reduces opioid consumption in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods: Fifty patients were enrolled in this prospective, randomized and observer-blinded study. At induction of anesthesia the control group (n = 25) received fentanyl 3 mu g.kg(-1) while the lindocaine group received fentanyl 1.5 mu g.kg(-1) and a bolus of lidocaine 1.5 mg.kg(-1) followed by a continuous infusion of lidocaine 2 mg.kg(-1).hr(-1). General anesthesia included propofol, rocuronium, and desflurane titrated to maintain blood pressure and heart rate within set parameters, and the bispectral index between 35 and 50. No supplemental opioids were given during surgery. All patients received acetaminophen, ketorolac, dexamethasone, droperidol and local anesthetics in the skin incision. Patients received fentanyl and ondansetron in the PACU. The primary outcome variable was the amount of fentanyl required in the PACU to establish and to maintain visual analogue scale pain scores < 3. Results: Most patients received fentanyl for pain relief in the PACU, but the cumulative mean dose was lower in the lidocaine group compared to the control group (98 +/- 54 mu g, vs 154 +/- 99 mu g, respectively, P = 0.018). Lidocaine infusion reduced by 10% the amount of desflurane required (P = 0.0 12). White-Song scores > 12 were attained by all patients in both groups within 30 min of their arrival in the PACU. Median time from arrival to the PACU to discharge home was similar in both groups, 167.5 min in the control group vs 180 min in the lidocaine group (P = 0.649). Conclusion: Intraoperative lidocaine infusion reduces opioid consumption in the PACU and intraoperative requirements of desflurane.

Here we describe a complete map of functional connections in the human brain derived by an automatic meta-analysis of 825 neuroimaging articles, representing 3402 experiments. The likelihood of a functional connection between regions was estimated by studying the interdependence of their "activity," as reported in each experiment, across all experiments. We obtained a dense coactivation map that recovers some fundamental principles of the brain's functional connectivity, such as the symmetric interhemispheric connections, and important functional networks, such as the fronto-parietal attention network, the resting state network and the motor network.

Methods: We summarize data published by our own lab and by others that delineate the effects of such therapies on in vitro neural cell cultures and in animal model-based systems. Results: The long-approved therapies, interferon beta (IFN beta) and glatiramer acetate (GA), do not readily access the CNS. These agents can still indirectly have an effect on disease-related immune regulatory and effector functions within the CNS by modulating the properties of systemic immune cells that migrate to this compartment. Such immune cells Could interact with perivascular and innate immune cells that are involved in immune reagulation and with cells that are either targets of the disease process (oligodendrocytes, neurons) and/or arc involved with repair (progenitor cells). Newer agents reported to favorably impact on relapse frequency in MS include the sphingosine-I-phosphate agonist, fingolimod, and the lipophilic statin, simvastatin. Both agents access the CNS and thus represent examples of agents that could directly impact on disease-relevant injury and repair process within the CNS. Conclusions: The observations reviewed in this report regarding indirect and direct effects of immuno-modulatory agents on the CNS indicate the need to understand and monitor the neurobiologic effects of, Such therapies.

Given our recent findings outlining a putative association between suggestibility and a specific dopaminergic genetic polymorphism, we hypothesized that similar exploratory genetic data may offer supplementary insights into a similar correlation with paranormal belief. With more affordable costs and better technology in the aftermath of the human genome project, genotyping is increasingly ubiquitous. Compelling brain theories guide specific research hypotheses as scientists begin to unravel tentative relationships between phenotype and genotype. In line with a doparninergic brain theory, we tried to correlate a specific phenotype concerning paranormal belief with a dopaminergic gene (COMT) known for its involvement in prefrontal executive cognition and for a polymorphism. that is positively correlated with suggestibility. Although our preliminary findings are inconclusive, the research approach we outline should pave the road to a more scientific account of elucidating paranormal belief. (C) 2008 Elsevier Srl.

Sleep abnormalities are a major and early feature of neurodegenerative disorders, especially for synucleinopathies, HD and prion-related diseases, in which the sleep-related brainstem regions are severely altered and impaired sooner than in most of the tauopathies. In synucleinopathies, HD and prion-related diseases, specific sleep disturbances, different from those observed in tauopathies, are considered as core manifestations of the disease and in some cases, as preclinical signs. For this reason, the evaluation of sleep components in these neurodegenerative disorders may be useful to make a diagnosis and to assess the efficacy of pharmacotherapy. Since sleep disruption may occur early in the course of neurodegeneration, sleep disturbance may serve as groundwork to study the efficacy of neuroprotective agents to prevent or delay the development of a full-blown neurodegenerative disorder.

While we have limited knowledge on the influence of NI risk on pain responses, we have no knowledge of how these responses change over time. Objective: To compare physiological and behavioural pain responses of infants at three levels of NI risk during the NICU neonatal period (Session 1) and at 6 months of age (Session 2). Design/methods: Prospective observational design with 149 preterm and term infants at high (Cohort A, n = 54), moderate (Cohort B, n = 45) and mild (Cohort C, n = 50) risks for NI from 3 Canadian tertiary level NICUs. Infants were observed in the NICU during 3 standardized phases of a heel lance: baseline, stick and return-to-baseline. At 6 months, infants were observed during the same three phases during an intramuscular immunization injection. Physiological (heart rate, oxygen saturation) and behavioural (9 facial actions, cry) responses were continuously recorded. Results: A significant interaction of Phase by Session was found with less total facial activity observed during Session 2 (all p values < 0.04). A significant interaction for Session by Cohort was found, showing that infants in Cohort A had significantly more change from baseline-to-stick phase for brow bulge, eye squeeze, nasolabial furrow and open tips between sessions with less facial actions demonstrated at Session 2 (all, p < 0.02). There were significantly lower mean and minimum heart rate (all p < 0.02) and higher minimum and maximum oxygen saturation (p < 0.04) at Session 2. Significantly higher mean and minimum fundamental cry frequencies (pitch) in Cohort B (p < 0.04) were found in Session 1. Cohort A had significantly longer cry durations, but no significant differences in cry dysphonation. Conclusions: Behaviourat and physiological, infant pain responses were generally diminished at 6 months of age compared to those in the neonatal period with some differences between NI risk groups in cry responses. Future exploration into the explanation for these differences between sessions and cohorts is warranted. (C) Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

They are most likely linked to epileptogenesis and have been found in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) of human ictal and interictal recordings. HFOs occur frequently at the time of interictal spikes, but were also found independently. This study analyses the relationship between spikes and HFOs and the occurrence of HFOs in nonspiking channels. Intracerebral EEGs of 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy were studied using macroelectrodes. Rates of HFOs within and outside spikes, the overlap between events, event durations, and the percentage of spikes carrying HFOs were calculated and compared according to anatomical localization, spiking activity, and relationship to the SOZ. HFOs were found in all patients, significantly more within mesial temporal lobe structures than in neocortex. HFOs could be seen in spiking as well as nonspiking channels in all structures. Rates and durations of HFOs were significantly higher in the SOZ than outside. It was possible to establish a rate of HFOs to identify the SOZ with better sensitivity and specificity than with the rate of spikes. HFOs occurred to a large extent independently of spikes. They are most frequent in mesial temporal structures. They are prominent in the SOZ and provide additional information on epileptogenicity independently of spikes. It was possible to identify the SOZ with a high specificity by looking at only 10 min of HFO activity.

Color responses of the human lateral geniculate nucleus: selective amplification of S-cone signals between the lateral geniculate nucleno and primary visual cortex measured with high-field fMRI	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						color; fMRI; LGN; S-cone; V1; visual cortex	MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; DETECTION MECHANISMS; CHROMATIC MECHANISMS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; GANGLION-CELLS; AWAKE MACAQUE; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION	The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the primary thalamic nucleus that relays visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1) and has been extensively studied in non-human primates. A key feature of the LGN is the segregation of retinal inputs into different cellular layers characterized by their differential responses to red-green (RG) color (L/M opponent), blue-yellow (BY) color (S-cone opponent) and achromatic (Ach) contrast. In this study we use high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (4 tesla, 3.6 x 3.6 x 3 mm(3)) to record simultaneously the responses of the human LGN and V1 to chromatic and Ach contrast to investigate the LGN responses to color, and how these are modified as information transfers between LGN and cortex. We find that the LGN has a robust response to RG color contrast, equal to or greater than the Ach response, but a significantly poorer sensitivity to BY contrast. In V1 at low temporal rates (2 Hz), however, the sensitivity of the BY color pathway is selectively enhanced, rising in relation to the RG and Ach responses. We find that this effect generalizes across different stimulus contrasts and spatial stimuli (1-d and 2-d patterns), but is selective for temporal frequency, as it is not found for stimuli at 8 Hz. While the mechanism of this cortical enhancement of BY color vision and its dynamic component is unknown, its role may be to compensate for a weak BY signal originating from the sparse distribution of neurons in the retina and LGN.

Theta burst stimulation-induced inhibition of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reveals hemispheric asymmetry in striatal dopamine release during a set-shifting task - a TMS-[(11)C]raclopride PET study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						basal ganglia; executive function; positron emission tomography; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; CARD SORTING TEST; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA	The prefrontostriatal network is considered to play a key role in executive functions. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that executive processes tested with card-sorting tasks requiring planning and set-shifting [e.g. Montreal-card-sorting-task (MCST)] may engage the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while inducing dopamine release in the striatum. However, functional imaging studies can only provide neuronal correlates of cognitive performance and cannot establish a causal relation between observed brain activity and task performance. In order to investigate the contribution of the DLPFC during set-shifting and its effect on the striatal dopaminergic system, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to left and right DLPFC. Our aim was to transiently disrupt its function and to measure MCST performance and striatal dopamine release during [(11)C]raclopride PET. A significant hemispheric asymmetry was observed. cTBS of the left DLPFC impaired MCST performance and dopamine release in the ipsilateral caudate-anterior putamen and contralateral caudate nucleus, as compared to cTBS of the vertex (control). These effects appeared to be limited only to left DLPFC stimulation while right DLPFC stimulation did not influence task performance or [(11)C]raclopride binding potential in the striatum. This is the first study showing that cTBS, by disrupting left prefrontal function, may indirectly affect striatal dopamine neurotransmission during performance of executive tasks. This cTBS-induced regional prefrontal effect and modulation of the frontostriatal network may be important for understanding the contribution of hemisphere laterality and its neural bases with regard to executive functions, as well as for revealing the neurochemical substrate underlying cognitive deficits.

Quality of life, resource consumption and costs of spinal cord stimulation versus conventional medical management in neuropathic pain patients with failed back surgery syndrome (PROCESS trial)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Costs; Quality of life; Neuropathic pain; Spinal cord stimulation; Randomised controlled trial	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CARE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MULTICENTER; UTILITY; STATES	Background: Chronic back and leg pain conditions result in patients' loss of function, reduced quality of life and increased costs to the society. Aims: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cost implications of spinal cord stimulation plus non-surgical conventional medical management (SCS group) versus non-surgical conventional medical management alone of (CMM group) in the management of neuropathic pain in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. Method: A total of 100 patients were randomised to either the SCS or CMM group. Healthcare resource consumption data relating to screening, the use of the implantable generator in SCS patients, hospital stay, and drug and non-drug pain-related treatment were collected prospectively. Resource consumption was costed using UK and Canadian 2005-2006 national figures. HRQoL was assessed using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Costs and outcomes were assessed for each patient over their first 6-months of the trial. Results: The 6-month mean total healthcare cost in the SCS group (CAN$19,486; (sic)12,653) was significantly higher than in the CMM group (CAN$3994; (sic)2594), with a mean adjusted difference of CAN$15, 395 ((sic)9997) (p < 0.001). However, the gain in HRQoL with SCS over the same period of time was markedly greater in the SCS group, with a mean EQ-5D score difference of 0.25 [p < 0.001] and 0.21 [p < 0.001], respectively at 3- and 6-months after adjusting for baseline variables. Conclusions: The addition of SCS to CMM in patients with neuropathic leg and back pain results in higher costs to health systems but also generates important improvements in patients' EQ-5D over the same period.

The limited efficacies of current antidepressant treatments necessitate the development of alternative pharmacothera pies. Recent preclinical findings suggesting that cannabinoid CB, receptor agonists and endocannabinoid enhancers possess antidepressant-like properties, and clinical evidence that the CB1 antagonist rimonabant increases the risk of depression and suicidality, support the notion that the endocannabinoid system represents a novel target in the treatment of mood disorders. Objective/methods: To compare the mechanism of endocannabinoid enhancers and CB1 agonists with current antidepressants and provide a rationale for a role of the endocannabinoid system in the pathology and treatment of mood disorders. Results/conclusion: CB1 agonists and fatty acid amide hdyrolase (FAAH) inhibitors share mechanisms with other antidepressants: the ability to enhance central serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission and promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus. FAAH inhibitors, compared with direct CB1 agonists, exhibit distinct pharmacological properties that quell adverse cannabinoid effects and widen the therapeutic window. Since the endocannabinoid system also plays a role in peripheral functions, side effects need to be addressed.

Antiviral drug development: progress and pitfalls	FUTURE VIROLOGY			English	Article							RESISTANCE; LAMIVUDINE; VIRUS	Conferences on Antiviral Research present a wealth of new information on novel drug development and the 21st annual meeting, held in Montreal between 13-17 April 2008, was no exception. The sessions topics included novel targets for HIV therapy, respiratory and emerging viruses, hepatitis viruses, clinical update on antiviral drugs, retroviruses, and herpes- and poxviruses, among others. In addition, there were a number of themed poster sessions dealing with each of the above areas, as well as novel methods for antiviral analysis, topical microbicides, medicinal chemistry, animal models, veterinary viruses and assorted viral agents. Each of these sessions were well organized and provoked thoughtful discussions, The session on novel targets for HIV therapy featured cutting-edge lectures on interactions between viral proteins and cellular factors. This work has the potential to lead to novel drug discovery as does that on peptide-based approaches to prevent replication of influenza viruses and the development of novel compounds that interfere with the neuraminidase enzymes of both influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Other areas of focus included novel approaches aimed at heightening immune effector mechanisms and the development of gene therapy strategies for certain types of viral infection. Of course, the development of compounds directed at numerous hepatitis C targets also featured prominently at the meeting.

In direct contradiction with the long accepted view of Euchordates, this new phylogenetic hypothesis for chordate evolution has been the object of some skepticism. We assembled an expanded phylogenomic dataset focused on deuterostomes. Maximum-likelihood using standard models and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using the CAT site-heterogeneous mixture model of amino-acid replacement both provided unequivocal support for the sister-group relationship between tunicates and vertebrates (Olfactores). Chordates were recovered as monophyletic with cephalochordates as the most basal lineage. These results were robust to both gene sampling and missing data. New analyses of ribosomal rRNA also recovered Olfactores when compositional bias was alleviated. Despite the inclusion of 25 taxa representing all major lineages, the monophyly of deuterostomes remained poorly supported. The implications of these phylogenetic results for interpreting chordate evolution are discussed in light of recent advances from evolutionary developmental biology and genomics. genesis 46:592-604, 2008.

Over-expression of BDNF by adenovirus with concurrent electrical stimulation improves cochlear implant thresholds and survival of auditory neurons	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Animal psychophysics; EABR; Spiral ganglion cell; Growth factors; Electrical stimulation; Gene therapy; Adenovirus; Ad.BDNF	SPIRAL GANGLION NEURONS; SENSORINEURAL HEARING-LOSS; MEDIATED GENE-TRANSFER; DEAFENED GUINEA-PIG; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; ETHACRYNIC-ACID; IN-VIVO; NERVE; DEGENERATION; INNERVATION	The survival of the auditory nerve in cases of sensorineural hearing loss is believed to be a major factor in effective cochlear implant function. The current study assesses two measures of cochlear implant thresholds following a post-deafening treatment intended to halt auditory nerve degeneration. We used an adenoviral construct containing a gene insert for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a construct that has previously been shown to promote neuronal survival in a number of biological systems. We implanted ototoxically deafened guinea pigs with a multichannel cochlear implant and delivered a single inoculation of an adenovirus suspension coding for BDNF (Ad.BDNF) into the scala tympani at the time of implantation. Thresholds to electrical stimulation were assessed both psychophysically and electrophysiologically over a period of 80 days. Spiral ganglion cell survival was analyzed at the 80 days time point. Compared to the control group, the Ad.BDNF treated group had lower psychophysical and electrophysiological thresholds as well as higher survival of spiral ganglion cells. Electrophysiological, but not psychophysical, thresholds correlated well with the density of spiral ganglion cells. These results indicate that the changes in the anatomy of the auditory nerve induced by the combination of Ad.BDNF inoculation and the electrical stimulation used for testing improved functional measures of Cl performance.

Pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy: The concept of synergism	HEPATOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Review						ammonia; astrocyte; cytokines; hepatic encephalopathy; manganese; synergism	ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; PORTACAVAL ANASTOMOSIS; INCREASED EXPRESSION; CIRRHOTIC-PATIENTS; GLUTAMATE UPTAKE; AMMONIA; PROTEIN; QUANTIFICATION	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains a severe neuropsychiatric complication of liver failure. Neuropathological evaluation of material from patients who died in hepatic coma reveals morphologic changes primarily to astrocytes (cytotoxic edema, Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis) accompanied by discreet neuronal changes. Liver failure results in the accumulation in brain of neurotoxic compounds (ammonia, manganese, proinflammatory cytokines, mercaptans, octanoic acid) that may act synergistically to impair neuropsychiatric function. Ammonia and manganese act synergistically to activate mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors leading to increased production of neuroactive steroids, many of which (allopregnanolone, THDOC) have potent neuroinhibitory properties resulting from activation of a neuromodulatory site on the GABA-A receptor ("increased GABAergic tone"). New evidence demonstrates that proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and the interleukins (IL-1 beta, and IL-6) are produced not only by the liver but also by the brain in liver failure. Ammonia and proinflammatory cytokines generated either by intercurrent infection or from hepatocyte necrosis in liver failure act synergistically to decrease the capacity of astrocytes to remove glutamate from the brain extracellular space leading to the activation of glutamate (NMDA) receptors that in turn results in alterations of cell-cell signalling and hyperexcitability. Therapy for HE continues to rely heavily on strategies aimed at reduction of gut ammonia production, increased ammonia removal and, ultimately, liver transplantation. A more complete understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms has led to novel potential strategies aimed at decreasing both GABAergic tone, glutamate (NMDA) receptor activation and proinflammatory cytokines. Such strategies hold promise for new therapies for HE in the near future.

Externalizing Behavior and the Higher Order Factors of the Big Five	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						externalizing behavior; higher order factors; Stability; Plasticity; cognitive ability	ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; 5-FACTOR MODEL; PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; PERSONALITY; DISORDERS; BOYS; HYPERACTIVITY; ADOLESCENCE; MOTIVATION; SPECTRUM	The comorbidity of various externalizing behaviors stems from a broad predisposition that is strongly genetically determined (R. F. Krueger, B. M. Hicks, C. J. Patrick, S. R. Carlson, W. G. Iacono, & M. McGue, 2002). This finding raises the question of how externalizing behavior is related to broad personality traits that have been identified in normal populations and that also have a genetic component. Using structural equation modeling, the authors applied a hierarchical personality model based on the Big Five and their two higher order factors, Stability (Neuroticism reversed, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) and Plasticity (Extraversion and Openness). Cognitive ability was included to separate variance in Openness associated with Extraversion (hypothesized to be positively related to externalizing behavior) from variance in Openness associated with cognitive ability (negatively related to externalizing behavior). This model was used to predict a latent externalizing behavior variable in an adolescent male sample (N = 140) assessed through self- and teacher reports. As hypothesized, externalizing behavior was characterized by low Stability, high Plasticity, and low cognitive ability.

In this study, high frequency recordings of ultrasonic vocalizations were made during mating, aggression, and both conspecific and heterospecific (dubbed "tickling") rough-and-tumble play behavior. We found that frequency modulated 50-kHz calls (trills and step calls) were positively correlated with positively valenced appetitive behavior during mating, play, and aggression. These calls were also positively correlated with the reward value of these social encounters. However, constant frequency (i.e., flat) 50-kHz calls were not related to appetitive behaviors or reward. In contrast, 22-kHz calls were positively related to aversive/withdrawal behaviors during mating, play, and aggression. Finally, we found that rats self-administered playback of frequency modulated 50-kHz trill calls and avoided playback of 22-kHz calls. Playback of flat 50-kHz calls or tape hiss was neutral. These results suggest that frequency modulated 50-kHz calls index a positively valenced, appetitive, social-emotional state in rats.

The initial cues that orchestrate leukocyte entry remain poorly defined. We have used flow cytometry to investigate whether MyD88, an adaptor protein that transmits signals from TLRs and receptors for IL-1 and IL-18, regulates leukocyte infiltration into the stab-injured entorhinal cortex (EC) and into sites of axonal degeneration in the denervated hippocampus. We have previously established the kinetics of leukocyte entry into the denervated hippocampus. We now show that significant leukocyte entry into the EC occurs within 3-12 h of stab injury. Whereas T cells showed small, gradual increases over 8 days, macrophage infiltration was pronounced and peaked within 12-24 h. MyD88 deficiency significantly reduced macrophage and T cell recruitment to the stab-injured EC and the denervated hippocampus at 5 days post-injury. Whereas macrophage and T cell entry remained impaired into the denervated hippocampus of MyD88-deficient mice at 8 days, leukocyte infiltration into the stab-injured EC was restored to levels observed in wild-type mice. Transcripts for TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and CCL2, which increased >50-fold after stab injury in C57BL/6 mice at the time of peak expression, were severely reduced in injured MyD88 knockout mice. Leukocyte recruitment and gene expression were unaffected in TLR2-deficient or TLR4 mutant mice. No significant differences in gene expression were observed in mice lacking IL-1R or IL-18R. These data show that MyD88-dependent signaling mediates proinflammatory gene expression and leukocyte recruitment after CNS injury. The Journal of Immunology,2008,181: 6481-6490.

Phenotypic variability among patients with hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome homozygous for the delF188 mutation in SLC25A15	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Milupa International Workshop on Hyperornithinaemia Hyperammonaemia Homocitrullinuria Syndrome	MAR 24, 2006	Rome, ITALY				MITOCHONDRIAL ORNITHINE TRANSPORTER; HHH SYNDROME; UREA CYCLE; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; JAPANESE PATIENTS; ORNT1 GENE; DIAGNOSIS; R179X	Background: Hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome (OMIM 238970) is caused by impaired ornithine transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane due to mutations in SLC25A15. To date, 22 different mutations of the SLC25A15 gene have been described in 49 patients belonging to 31 unrelated families. Objective: To further delineate the phenotypic spectrum of HHH syndrome from a description of a genetically homogeneous cohort of patients and identify prognostic factors based on long-term follow-up. Methods: Sixteen French-Canadian patients were retrospectively and prospectively clinically assessed. Results: Owing to a founder effect, 15 of the 16 patients were homozygous for the F188del mutation in the SLC25A15 gene. The main clinical features at presentation were liver dysfunction (6/16) and neurological disease (9/16), including chronic neurological symptoms (6/9) and acute encephalopathy (3/9). Hyperammonaemia was not constant and usually mild and uncommon after start of treatment. Long-term follow-up showed that variable intellectual impairment and lower limb spasticity often occur, together or separately, with no obvious relationship to age at diagnosis and compliance with treatment. Conclusion: We report the largest known cohort to date of patients with HHH syndrome. A similar range of severity occurred in the clinical course and outcome of patients homozygous for delF188 and in the 33 other reported patients compiled from the literature. The poor clinical outcome of some patients with HHH syndrome despite early treatment and repeatedly normal plasma ammonia levels emphasises the need to better understand the pathophysiology and to reconsider the therapeutic goals for HHH.

The present study was undertaken to identify the phenotype, origin and biological role of nestin-expressing cells during reparative fibrosis. A neural stem cell phenotype was identified based on musashi-1 expression, growth as a neurosphere, and differentiation to a neuronal cell. Using the Wnt1-cre; Z/EG transgenic mouse model, which expresses EGFP in embryologically-derived neural crest cells, the reporter signal was detected in nestin-expressing cells residing in the heart. In infarcted human hearts, nestin-expressing cells were detected in the viable myocardium and the scar and morphologically analogous to the population identified in the rat heart. Following either an ischemic insult or the acute administration of 6-hydroxydopamine, sympathetic sprouting was dependent on the physical association of neurofilament-M immunoreactive fibres with nestin-positive processes emanating from neural stem cells. To specifically study the biological role of the subpopulation in the infarct region, neural stem cells were isolated from the scar, fluorescently labelled and transplanted in the heart of 3-day post-MI rats. Injected scar-derived neural stem cells migrated to the infarct region and were used as a substrate for de novo blood vessel formation. These data have demonstrated that the heart contains a resident population of neural stem cells derived from the neural crest and participate in reparative fibrosis. Their manipulation could provide an alternative approach to ameliorate the healing process following ischemic injury. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this article is to provide data-driven cues for intervention with bilingual aphasia. First, the impact of a number of factors considered to influence second language processing will be discussed with reference to neurolinguistic and neuroimaging data. The discussion will then move to bilingual aphasia. Specifically, we shall describe the recovery patterns following bilingual aphasia, and discuss the issues of pathological mixing and switching. The literature and clinical evidence will provide the framework for a discussion of data-driven cues for intervention with bilingual aphasia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Conductances mediating intrinsic theta-frequency membrane potential oscillations in layer II parasubicular neurons. J Neurophysiol 100: 2746-2756, 2008. First published September 24, 2008; doi: 10.1152/jn.90351.2008. Ionic conductances that generate membrane potential oscillations in neurons of layer II of the parasubiculum were studied using whole cell current-clamp recordings in horizontal slices from the rat brain. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate and GABA synaptic transmission did not reduce the power of the oscillations, indicating that oscillations are not dependent on synaptic inputs. Oscillations were eliminated when cells were hyperpolarized 6-10 mV below spike threshold, indicating that they are mediated by voltage-dependent conductances. Application of TTX completely eliminated oscillations, suggesting that Na+ currents are required for the generation of the oscillations. Oscillations were not reduced by blocking Ca2+ currents with Cd2+ or Ca2+-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid, or by blocking K+ conductances with either 50 mu M or 5 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), 30 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA), or Ba2+(1-2 mM). Oscillations also persisted during blockade of the muscarinic-dependent K+ current, I M, using the selective antagonist XE-991 (10 mu M). However, oscillations were significantly attenuated by blocking the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current I-h with Cs+ and were almost completely blocked by the more potent I-h blocker ZD7288 (100 mu M). Intrinsic membrane potential oscillations in neurons of layer II of the parasubiculum are therefore likely driven by an interaction between an inward persistent Na+ current and time-dependent deactivation of I-h. These voltage-dependent conductances provide a mechanism for the generation of membrane potential oscillations that can help support rhythmic network activity within the parasubiculum during theta-related behaviors.

In many nonprimate species, rhythmic patterns of activity such as locomotion or respiration are generated by neural networks at the spinal level. These neural networks are called central pattern generators (CPGs). Under normal gravitational conditions, the energy efficiency and the robustness of human rhythmic movements are due to the ability of CPGs to drive the system at a pace close to its resonant frequency. This property can be compared with oscillators running at resonant frequency, for which the energy is optimally exchanged with the environment. However, the ability of the CPG to adapt the frequency of rhythmic movements to new gravitational conditions has never been studied. We show here that the frequency of a rhythmic movement of the upper limb is systematically influenced by the different gravitational conditions created in parabolic flight. The period of the arm movement is shortened with increasing gravity levels. In weightlessness, however, the period is more dependent on instructions given to the participants, suggesting a decreased influence of resonant frequency. Our results are in agreement with a computational model of a CPG coupled to a simple pendulum under the control of gravity. We demonstrate that the innate modulation of rhythmic movements by CPGs is highly flexible across gravitational contexts. This further supports the involvement of CPG mechanisms in the achievement of efficient rhythmic arm movements. Our contribution is of major interest for the study of human rhythmic activities, both in a normal Earth environment and during microgravity conditions in space.

Here, we demonstrate that BA-210, a cell-permeable fusion protein derived from C3 transferase, formulated in fibrin sealant and delivered topically onto the dura matter, diffuses into the spinal cord and inactivates Rho in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with BA-210 in rats with thoracic spinal cord contusion increased tissue sparing around the lesion area and led to significant improvement of locomotor function. In mice, BA-210 improved functional outcome when treatment was either applied at the time of injury or delayed by 24 h. In both rats and mice, treatment with BA-210 was well tolerated. Rats gained body weight normally, and BA-210 treatment had no impact on the development of allodynia. Inactivating Rho with BA-210 holds promise for treating patients with SCI.

Little is known about biological predispositions that convey vulnerability for the illness. We searched for biological vulnerability markers using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in both affected and unaffected participants at high genetic risk for bipolar disorder. Methods: We recruited high-risk participants aged 15-30 years from families in which multiple members were affected with bipolar disorder. Our primary sample included 14 affected and 15 unaffected relatives of probands with bipolar I disorder. Our extended sample comprised 19 affected and 21 unaffected participants with a family history of either bipolar I or bipolar II disorders. We matched both samples by age and sex with 31 control participants without a personal or family history of psychiatric disorders. We performed single voxel proton MRS at 1.5 T in bilateral dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortices with correction for grey matter proportion. Results: We found comparable levels of choline, creatine, myo-inositol and N-acetylaspartate among the groups in both samples. There were no differences between regions of the medial prefrontal cortex or between hemispheres for any of the metabolites in any of the samples. The exclusion of 5 participants taking medication did not change our results. Conclusion: Neurochemical changes in the medial prefrontal cortex that are measurable using proton MRS do not appear to be antecedent to the onset of mood disorders in genetically susceptible individuals.

Look who's talking: The deployment of visuo-spatial attention during multisensory speech processing under noisy environmental conditions	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; COCKTAIL PARTY PROBLEM; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; GAMMA RESPONSES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SEEING VOICES; INTEGRATION	In a crowded scene we can effectively focus our attention on a specific speaker while largely ignoring sensory inputs from other speakers. How attended speech inputs are extracted from similar competing information has been primarily studied in the auditory domain. Here we examined the deployment of visuo-spatial attention in Multiple speaker scenarios. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were monitored as a real-time index of visual attention towards three competing speakers. Participants were instructed to detect a target syllable by the center speaker and ignore syllables from two flanking speakers. The study incorporated interference trials (syllables from three speakers), no-interference trials (syllable from center speaker only), and periods without speech stimulation in which static faces were presented. An enhancement of flanking speaker induced SSVEP was found 70-220 ins after sound onset over left temporal scalp during interference trials. This enhancement was negatively correlated with the behavioral performance of participants - those who showed largest enhancements had the worst speech recognition performance. Additionally, poorly performing participants exhibited enhanced flanking speaker induced SSVEP over visual scalp during periods without speech stimulation. The present study provides neurophysiologic evidence that the deployment of visuo-spatial attention to flanking speakers interferes with the recognition of multisensory speech signals under noisy environmental conditions.

A significant decrease in stance/swing duration and the number of limbs simultaneously in the stance phase was seen in trained compared to sedentary rats at 28 days after SCI (p < 0.05). These kinematic improvements were associated with a significant increase in the amplitude of extracellular recordings from the tibial motoneuron pool in response to descending neuronal drive as well as significant amelioration of electrophysiological properties assessed from intracellular recordings. In fact, electrophysiological Properties were not significantly different between uninjured controls and SCI-trained rats. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were significantly elevated in the lumbar spinal cord of SCI-trained Fats compared to SCI-sedentary controls. The data support a therapeutic role of increased neuromuscular activity in promoting functional recovery and Suggest that it might occur via the beneficial effects of neurotrophic factors on neuronal plasticity.

Adult medulloblastoma is a rare disease for which there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Treatment regimens have typically been modeled after pediatric protocols. We sought to review the presentation, management, and Outcome of patients with adult medulloblastoma treated at the McGill University teaching hospitals over the past 18 years. Methods. Medical records were reviewed to gather demographic and clinical data including presenting symptoms, tumor characteristics, management, survival and treatment toxicity. Results. Twenty-five patients were identified. Eleven patients, were female and 14 were male. The median age at diagnosis was 30 (range 17-48). Our 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 78%,. and 30%, respectively. Median OS was 108 months and median progression-free survival time was 63 months, Age, sex, risk, stage, extent of resection, chemotherapy and time between surgery and adjuvant therapy did not significantly influence survival outcomes. The most frequently reported adverse events included sensory neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, febrile neutropenia, and radiation dermatitis. Conclusion. Adult medulloblastoma has distinct characteristics from the pediatric population including presentation in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. Late relapses, especially in the posterior fossa, are a significant problem. Further follow-up will be required to ascertain the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy oil survival.

Cerebral Hemodynamic Changes During Intensive Care of Preterm Infants	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						prematurity; cerebral hemodynamics; systemic hemodynamics; brain injury	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; CORTICAL PAIN RESPONSES; PREMATURE-INFANTS; BLOOD-VOLUME; NEWBORN-INFANTS; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; BRAIN; OXYGENATION; BIRTH	OBJECTIVES. The objectives of this study were to examine the circulatory changes experienced by the immature systemic and cerebral circulations during routine events in the critical care of preterm infants and to identify clinical factors that are associated with greater hemodynamic-oxygenation changes during these events. METHODS. We studied 82 infants who weighed < 1500 g at birth and required intensive care management and continuous blood pressure monitoring from an umbilical arterial catheter. Continuous recording of cerebral and systemic hemodynamic and oxygenation changes was performed. We studied 6 distinct types of caregiving events during 10-minute epochs: (1) quiet baseline periods; (2) minor manipulation; (3) diaper changes; (4) endotracheal tube suctioning; (5) endotracheal tube repositioning; and (6) complex events. Each event was matched with a preceding baseline. We examined the effect of specific clinical factors and cranial ultrasound abnormalities on the systemic and cerebral hemodynamic oxygenation changes that were associated with the various event types. RESULTS. There were highly significant differences in hemodynamics and oxygenation between events overall and baseline epochs. The magnitude of these circulatory changes was greatest during endotracheal tube repositioning and complex caregiving events. Lower gestational age, higher illness severity, chorioamnionitis, low Apgar scores, and need for pressor-inotropes all were associated with circulatory changes of significantly lower magnitude. Cerebral hemodynamic changes were associated with early parenchymal ultrasound abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS. Routine caregiving procedures in critically ill preterm infants are associated with major circulatory fluctuations that are clinically underappreciated and underdetected by current bedside monitoring.

Substance P stimulates CFTR-dependent fluid secretion by mouse tracheal submucosal glands	PFLUGERS ARCHIV-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cystic fibrosis; CFTR; Gland secretion; Local nerve reflex; Substance P	VASOACTIVE-INTESTINAL-PEPTIDE; FIBROSIS AIRWAY GLANDS; CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; MUCUS SECRETION; SENSORY NEUROPEPTIDES; CL-SECRETION; NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION; TACHYKININ RECEPTORS; CHLORIDE SECRETION; LIQUID SECRETION	The mucosa of the proximal airways defends itself and the lower airways from inhaled irritants such as capsaicinoids, allergens, and infections by several mechanisms. Sensory nerves monitor the luminal microenvironment and release the tachykinin substance P (SP) to stimulate mucus secretion. Here, we have studied the role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in SP stimulation by comparing mouse airway submucosal gland responses in wild-type (WT) and CFTR-/- mice. Capsaicinoids (chili pepper oil) increased fluid secretion by glands from WT mice five-fold, and this response was abolished by exposing the basolateral aspect of the tracheas to L- 732,138 (10 mu mol/l), a specific antagonist of the neurokinin-1 receptor. Secretion was also stimulated 25-fold by basolateral application of SP, and this response was strongly inhibited by the CFTR inhibitor CFTR(inh)172. In contrast, submucosal glands from CFTR knockout mice failed to secrete when stimulated by SP (1 mu mol/l), although those from wild-type control littermates were responsive. SP stimulation of wild-type glands was also abolished by clotrimazole (25 mu mol/l), a blocker of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. These results indicate that SP mediates local responses to capsaicinoids through a mechanism involving coordinated activation of CFTR and K(+) channels. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which CFTR-dependent responses to substance P have been directly demonstrated. Since CFTR regulation is qualitatively similar in human and mouse glands, loss of this local regulation in CF may contribute to reduced innate defenses in CF airways.

Here, we review recent studies in an attempt to provide an integrated view of the control of information processing in the nucleus accumbens in terms of the regulation of goal-directed behaviors and how disruption of these functions might underlie the pathological states in drug addiction and other psychiatric disorders. We propose a model that could account for the results of several studies investigating limbic-system interactions in the nucleus accumbens and their modulation by dopamine and provide testable hypotheses for how these might relate to the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disorders.

A critical band of phase alignment for discrimination but not recognition of human faces	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Face discrimination; Face recognition; Spatial phase alignment; Fourier filtering; Spatial frequency; Face frequency	HIGH SPATIAL-FREQUENCIES; HUMAN VISUAL-SYSTEM; NATURAL IMAGES; LETTER IDENTIFICATION; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; HUMAN-EFFICIENCY; HUMAN-VISION; PERCEPTION; ORIENTATION; INFORMATION	We investigated the processes underlying the discrimination and recognition of human faces as a function of spatial phase alignment to assess whether face processing can be understood in terms of the amplitude spectrum alone. Specifically, we varied the amount of aligned Fourier phase in different regions of the face frequency spectrum and argue that the properties of the underlying neural processes are best understood in terms of the number of phase alignments as opposed to octave bandwidths. Additionally, we observed performance differences for face discrimination tasks compared to face recognition tasks. For face recognition, our results show that a narrower range of phase alignment is needed for face frequencies near 9 cpf when compared to 3 and 27 cpf, thereby supporting the notion of a critical frequency for face recognition. However, for face discrimination where participants were required to discriminate between an average face and different unique faces along a face morph continuum, performance depended on a fixed signal-to-noise ratio of phase alignment within a contiguous range of face frequencies (termed critical band of phase alignments), regardless of the central face frequency of that range within the face frequency spectrum when compared to non-phase randomized control thresholds.

A three-stage indirect multi-stepahead prediction model, which combines dynamic spline interpolation into multilayer adaptive time-delay neural network (ATNN), is proposed in this study for the long term hydrologic prediction. In the first two stages, a group of spline interpolation and dynamic extraction units are utilized to amplify the effect of observations in order to decrease the errors accumulation and propagation caused by the previous prediction. In the last step, variable time delays and weights are dynamically regulated by ATNN and the output of ATNN can be obtained as a multi-step-ahead prediction. We use two examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. One example is the sunspots time series that is a well-known nonlinear and non-Gaussian benchmark Lime series and is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of nonlinear models. Another example is a case study of a long-term hydrologic prediction which uses the monthly discharges data from the Manwan Hydropower Plant in Yunnan Province of China. Application results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; TMS; Mu rhythm; Motor resonance mechanism; Mirror neurons	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX EXCITABILITY; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; LONG-TERM STABILITY; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; MENTAL-IMAGERY; HAND ACTIONS; MU-RHYTHM; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY	It is now well established that the human brain is endowed with a system that matches the observation of actions with their execution. At the motor cortex level, EEG mu rhythm modulation (8-12 Hz) and TMS-incluced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are two techniques commonly used to assess brain activity during action observation. While both techniques have reliably demonstrated similarities in the pattern of activity induced by action production and action observation, the relationship they bear with each other remains elusive. In the present study, we combined ongoing EEG recordings and single-pulse TIVIS during the execution, imagination and observation of simple hand actions. Relationship between MEPs and EEG frequency bands at the individual level was investigated. Our results replicate those obtained independently with both techniques: a significant increase in MEP amplitude and a significant attenuation of the mu rhythm during action observation, imagination and execution compared to rest. Surprisingly, we found no significant correlation between MEP amplitude and mu rhythm modulation. However, modulation in the low to midrange beta (12-18 Hz) was related to MEP size during the rest and execution conditions. These results suggest that although mu rhythm and TMS-induced MEPs are sensitive to motor resonance mechanisms, they may reflect different processes taking place within the observation/execution matching system.

J	Hernandez, G; Haines, E; Shizgal, P				Hernandez, Giovanni; Haines, Eric; Shizgal, Peter			Potentiation of intracranial self-stimulation during prolonged subcutaneous infusion of cocaine	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Cocaine; Subcutaneous; In vivo microdialysis; Intracranial self-stimulation; Brain stimulation reward	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; BRAIN-STIMULATION; REWARD; RAT; TOLERANCE; SENSITIZATION; DOPAMINE; MORPHINE; REINFORCEMENT; INTERMITTENT	Subcutaneous administration of cocaine yields a longer duration of action than administration via the intraperitoneal or intravenous routes. However, cocaine is a powerful vasoconstrictor, and thus injection of this drug at a single subcutaneous locus entails significant risk of necrotic skin lesions. This paper introduces a new method for subcutaneous administration of cocaine that reduces the probability of dermonecrosis by dispersing the drug under a large area of skin. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the new method. In the first, changes in dopamine tone in the nucleus accumbens were measured by means of microdialysis during prolonged subcutaneous infusions of cocaine. The dopamine concentration attained a fairly stable, elevated level, suggesting that absorption, distribution, and excretion of the drug approached steady state. In a second experiment, performance for rewarding electrical stimulation was measured during repeated prolonged infusions of cocaine. The pulse frequency required to sustain responding was decreased by the drug, in a manner that was stable both within and across test sessions. Thus, the new method is appropriate for studies requiring stable neurochemical and behavioral conditions during repeated long test sessions, high rates of drug delivery and alternation between administration of the drug and the vehicle.

It is based on the brain simultaneously optimizing stability, accuracy and efficiency. Formulated as a V-shaped learning function, it stipulates precisely how feedforward commands to individual muscles are adjusted based on error. Changes in muscle activation patterns recorded in experiments provide direct support for this control scheme. In simulated motor learning of novel environmental interactions, muscle activation, force and impedance evolved in a manner similar to humans, demonstrating its efficiency and plausibility. This model of motor learning offers new insights as to how the brain controls the complex musculoskeletal system and iteratively adjusts motor commands to improve motor skills with practice.

Cutaneous tactile allodynia associated with microvascular dysfunction in muscle	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article							REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME; CHRONIC POSTISCHEMIA PAIN; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION; INJURY; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; CELLS; ACID	Background: Cutaneous tactile allodynia, or painful hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation of the skin, is typically associated with neuropathic pain, although also present in chronic pain patients who do not have evidence of nerve injury. We examine whether deep tissue microvascular dysfunction, a feature common in chronic non-neuropathic pain, contributes to allodynia. Results: Persistent cutaneous allodynia is produced in rats following a hind paw ischemia-reperfusion injury that induces microvascular dysfunction, including arterial vasospasms and capillary slow flow/no-reflow, in muscle. Microvascular dysfunction leads to persistent muscle ischemia, a reduction of intraepidermal nerve fibers, and allodynia correlated with muscle ischemia, but not with skin nerve loss. The affected hind paw muscle shows lipid peroxidation, an upregulation of nuclear factor kappa B, and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines, while allodynia is relieved by agents that inhibit these alterations. Allodynia is increased, along with hind paw muscle lactate, when these rats exercise, and is reduced by an acid sensing ion channel antagonist. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate how microvascular dysfunction and ischemia in muscle can play a critical role in the development of cutaneous allodynia, and encourage the study of how these mechanisms contribute to chronic pain. We anticipate that focus on the pain mechanisms associated with microvascular dysfunction in muscle will provide new effective treatments for chronic pain patients with cutaneous tactile allodynia.

Cells, including neurons, undergo massive epigenetic reprogramming during development through modifications to chromatin structure, and by covalent modifications of the DNA through methylation. There is evidence that these changes are sensitive to environmental influences such as maternal behavior and diet, leading to sustained differences in phenotype. For example, natural variations in maternal behavior in the rat that influence stress reactivity in offspring induce long-term changes in gene expression, including in the glucocorticoid receptor, that are associated with altered histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and NGFI-A transcription factor binding. These effects can be reversed by early postnatal cross-fostering, and by pharmacological manipulations in adulthood, including Trichostatin A (TSA) and L-methionine administration, that influence the epigenetic status of critical loci in the brain. Because levels of methionine are influenced by diet, these effects suggest that diet could contribute significantly to this behavioral plasticity. Recent data suggest that similar mechanisms could influence human behavior and mental health. Epidemiological data suggest indeed that dietary changes in methyl contents could affect DNA methylation and gene expression programming. Nutritional restriction during gestation could affect epigenetic programming in the brain. These findings provide evidence for a stable yet dynamic epigenome capable of regulating phenotypic plasticity through epigenetic programming. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor, but in glaucoma RGC death can persist after ocular hypertension is normalized. To understand the mechanism underlying chronic RGC death we identified and characterized a gene product, alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), whose expression is up-regulated early in ocular hypertension and remains up-regulated long after ocular hypertension is normalized. In ocular hypertension retinal glia up-regulate alpha 2M, which binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 receptors in RGCs, and is neurotoxic in a paracrine fashion. Neutralization of alpha 2M delayed RGC loss during ocular hypertension; whereas delivery of alpha 2M to normal eyes caused progressive apoptosis of RGC mimicking glaucoma without ocular hypertension. This work adds to our understanding of the pathology and molecular mechanisms of glaucoma, and illustrates emerging paradigms for studying chronic neurodegeneration in glaucoma and perhaps other disorders.

A recent study, however, has shown that it is advantageous to present illusory figures in the "notch" mode of presentation, that is by leaving the round inducers on screen at all times and by removing the inward-oriented notches delineating the illusory figure at stimulus onset. Indeed, using the notch mode of presentation, novel P1 and N1 effects have been found when comparing visual potentials (VEPs) evoked by an illusory figure and the VEPs to a control figure whose onset corresponds to the removal of outward-oriented notches, which prevents their integration into one delineated form. In Experiment 1, we replicated these findings, the illusory figure was found to evoke a larger P1 and a smaller N1 than its control. In Experiment 2, real grey squares were placed over the notches so that one condition, that with inward-oriented notches, shows a large central grey square and the other condition, that with outward-oriented notches, shows four unconnected smaller grey squares. In response to these "real" figures, no P1 effect was found but a N1 effect comparable to the one obtained with illusory figures was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that the P1 effect observed with illusory figures is likely specific to the processing of the illusory features of the figures. Conversely, the fact that the N1 effect was also obtained with real figures indicates that this effect may be due to more global processes related to depth segmentation or surface/object perception.

A comparison of 5-HT synthesis in the FSL rats treated with citalopram (FSL-CTP) and those treated with saline (FSL-SAL) indicate that citalopram reduces global 5-HT synthesis in the FSL rats, as well as in all the brain areas investigated. The reduced synthesis was also observed in the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus and the median raphe (MR) nucleus. The comparison of the synthesis between the citalopram-treated SPD rats (SPD-CTP) and the saline-treated SPD rats (SPD-SAL) revealed a global increase of 5-HT synthesis in the SPD-CTP group, as well as an increase in some terminal areas, but a reduction in the DR and the MR. In contrast to the reduction throughout the brain in the FSL rats, the FRL rats treated with citalopram (FRL-CTP), when compared to the saline group (FRL-SAL), showed a global increase of 5-HT synthesis, as well as in most of the terminal areas and in the DR and the MR. The reduction of 5-HT synthesis throughout the brain in the FSL rats is likely, in part, a result of reported supersensitivity of the 5-HT1A receptors. Comparing changes in the SPD, FRL, and FSL rats treated with citalopram to their respective controls (saline-treated rats), the FSL rats treated acutely with citalopram were the only rats that exhibited lower 5-HT synthesis rates in all of the limbic areas, the basal ganglia, and the neocortices. This may be related to the pathophysiological basis of depressive characteristics in FSL rats. The citalopram treatment produced unexpected results in the FRL rats: 5-HT synthesis was elevated not only in most of the terminal areas, but also in the cell body areas, the DR and MR. The increase of 5-HT synthesis throughout the brain in the FRL rats is likely, in part, a result of the reported subsensitivity of the 5-HT1A receptors, and possibly other sites through which 5-HT synthesis could be controlled (e.g., 5-HT1B). In addition differences in intracellular signaling could be at least in part responsible for these differences. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Maintenance of Axo-Oligodendroglial Paranodal Junctions Requires DCC and Netrin-1	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						myelin; axoglial junction; paranode; septate-like junctions; Caspr; neurofascin	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GLIA INTERACTIONS; PROTEIN CASPR; SPINAL-CORD; MYELIN GALACTOLIPIDS; ADHESION MOLECULE; C-ELEGANS; CELL; CNS; CONTACTIN	Paranodal axoglial junctions are essential for the segregation of myelinated axons into distinct domains and efficient conduction of action potentials. Here, we show that netrin-1 and deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) are enriched at the paranode in CNS myelin. We then address whether netrin-1 signaling influences paranodal adhesion between oligodendrocytes and axons. In the absence of netrin-1 or DCC function, oligodendroglial paranodes initially develop and mature normally but later become disorganized. Lack of DCC or netrin-1 resulted in detachment of paranodal loops from the axonal surface and the disappearance of transverse bands. Furthermore, the domain organization of myelin is compromised in the absence of netrin-1 signaling: K+ channels inappropriately invade the paranodal region, and the normally restricted paranodal distribution of Caspr expands longitudinally along the axon. Our findings identify an essential role for netrin-1 and DCC regulating the maintenance of axoglial junctions.

Muscarinic-2 and orexin-2 receptors on GABAergic and other neurons in the rat mesopontine tegmentum and their potential role in sleep-wake state control	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Review						acetylcholine; hypocretin; paradoxical sleep; REM sleep; reticular formation	PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; VESICULAR ACETYLCHOLINE TRANSPORTER; CHOLINERGIC NERVE-TERMINALS; C-FOS EXPRESSION; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; BRAIN-STEM; REM-SLEEP; HYPOCRETIN-OREXIN; PONTOMESENCEPHALIC TEGMENTUM	Acetylcholine (ACh) plays an important role in the promotion of paradoxical sleep (PS) with muscle atonia through the muscarinic-2 receptor (M2R) in the mesopontine tegmentum. Conversely, orexin (Orx or hypocretin) appears to be critical for the maintenance of waking with muscle tone through the orexin-2 (or hypocretin-B) receptor (Orx2R), which is lacking in dogs having narcolepsy with cataplexy. In dual-immunostained material viewed under fluorescence microscopy, we examined the presence and distribution of M2R or Orx2R labeling on all neuronal nuclei (NeuN)-stained neurons or on glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-stained neurons through the mesopontine tegmentum. Applying stereological analysis, we deter-mined that many neurons bear M2Rs on their membrane (approximate to 6,300), including relatively large, non-GABAergic cells, which predominate (>75%) in the oral and caudal pontine (PnO and PnC) reticular fields, and small, GABAergic cells (approximate to 2,800), which predominate (>80%) in the mesencephalic (Mes) reticular formation. Many neurons bear Orx2Rs on their membrane (approximate to 6,800), including relatively large, non-GABAergic cells, which predominate (>70%) through all reticular fields, and comparatively few GABAergic cells (approximate to 700). In triple-immunostained material viewed by confocal microscopy, many large neurons in PnO and PnC appear to bear both M2Rs and Orx2Rs on their membrane, indicating that ACh and Orx could exert opposing influences of inhibition vs. excitation on putative reticulo-spinal neurons and thus attenuate vs. facilitate activity and muscle tone. A few GABAergic cells bear both receptors and could as PS inhibitor neurons serve under these different influences to control PS effector neurons and accordingly gate PS and muscle atonia appropriately across sleep-wake states.

These experiences, which are characterized by a sense of union with God, are commonly reported across all cultures. To date, no electroencephalography (EEG) study has been conducted to identify the neuroelectrical correlates of such experiences. The main objective of this study was to measure EEG spectral power and coherence in 14 Carmelite nuns during a mystical experience. EEG activity was recorded from 19 scalp locations during a resting state, a control condition and a mystical condition. In the mystical condition compared to control condition, electrode sites showed greater theta power at F3, C3, P3, Fz, Cz and Pz, and greater gammal power was detected at T4 and P4. Higher delta/beta ratio, theta/alpha ratio and theta/beta ratio were found for several electrode sites. In addition, FP1-C3 pair of electrodes displayed greater coherence for theta band while F4-P4, F4-T6, F8-T6 and C4-P4 pairs of electrodes showed greater coherence for alpha band. These results indicate that mystical experiences are mediated by marked changes in EEG power and coherence. These changes implicate several cortical areas of the brain in both hemispheres.

This investigation determined whether epigenetic phenomena might similarly be associated with suicide/depression. Methods: The expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA was assessed in several brain regions of individuals who had committed suicide and had been diagnosed with major depression relative to that of individuals who had died suddenly as a result of factors other than suicide. Results: The DNMT gene transcripts' expression was altered in several brains regions of suicides, including frontopolar cortex, amygdala, and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Importantly, an increase of both mRNA and protein expression was found in the frontopolar cortex. In addition, although transcript abundance of various forms of DNMT was highly correlated in normal control subjects, this coordination of DNMT isoform expression was diminished in suicide brain. Further, within the frontopolar cortex, gene-specific aberrations in DNA methylation were apparent in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor alpha 1 subunit promoter region, the transcript of which is underexpressed in suicide/major depressive disorder (MDD) brains. Indeed, three cytosine/guanosine sites were hypermethylated relative to control subjects. Finally, we found that DNMT-3B mRNA abundance was inversely correlated to alpha 1 mRNA abundance. Conclusions: These data show that DNMT mRNA expression was altered in suicide brain, and this change in expression in the frontopolar cortex was associated with increased methylation of a gene whose mRNA expression has previously been shown to be reduced. These observations suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may be associated with altered gene expression in suicide/MDD.

Functional consequences of neuromyelitis optica-IgG astrocyte interactions on blood-brain barrier permeability and granulocyte recruitment	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; PLASMA-EXCHANGE; WATER CHANNEL; KNOCKOUT MICE; AQUAPORIN-4; EXPRESSION; INJURY; COMPLEMENT; ANTIBODY	Autoantibody neuromyelitis optica-IgG (NMO-IgG) recognizing aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is implicated as playing a central role in the physiopathology of NMO. The aim of this in vitro-based study was to characterize functional consequences of interaction between NMO-IgG and cells of the neurovascular unit (astrocytes and brain endothelium) that would provide insight into recognized features of NMO, namely altered blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and granulocyte recruitment. We used sera from NMO and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis cases shown to bind in a characteristic perivascular pattern to primate cerebellar slices. Using flow cytometry, we found that sera from NMO-IgG-positive patients reacted with CNS-derived human fetal astrocytes, whereas sera from multiple sclerosis patients did not. We demonstrated that NMO-IgG binding to astrocytes alters aquaporin-4 polarized expression and increases permeability of a human BBB endothelium/astrocyte barrier. We further demonstrated that NMO-IgG binding to human fetal astrocytes can result in NK cell degranulation, astrocyte killing by Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent granulocyte attraction through the BBB model. Our study highlights important functional roles for NMO-IgG that could account for pathological lesions and BBB dysfunction observed in NMO.

Pain and Denture Condition in Edentulous Orodyskinesia: Comparisons with Tardive Dyskinesia and Control Subjects	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						dyskinesia; edentulousness; antipsychotic drugs; denture; pain; oral examination	ORAL DYSKINESIA	Edentulous orodyskinesia (ED) is a neglected source of aimless oral movements that may be confused with tardive dyskinesia (TD). We attempted to clarify the clinical features significance and orodental factors in relation to ED. Fourteen ED subjects, 13 TD patients and 15 age-matched controls self-assessed their oral pain perception condition and function using a visual analogue scale. Dyskinesias were classified and rated by a neurologist. Perioral thermal and pressure pain thershold studies and a standardized orodental examination were conducted blind to subject group. The perceived oral pain level was low in all groups, and those reporting a significant intensity level of pain (>= 50th percentile) were few. The pain thresholds in both dyskinetic groups were comparable to control values. All ED cases wore a complete set of dentures, considered a current source of problems by 85.7% of them. ED cases commonly displayed inadequage dental occlusal relationship (P = 0.014 vs. controls; P = 0.036 vs. TD) and an overclosed vertical dimension (P = 0.006 vs. controls) as well as unstable and unretentive dentures. ED was limited to the oral region spared the tongue when the mouth is open and was never severe in our patients. ED has distinct movement charactereistics and is often associated with inadequate dentures and biomechanical sources of denture instability. The contribution of the foregoing findings to the expression of oral dyskinesia warrants further studies. (C) 2008 Movement Disorder Society.

Even when drugs are unavailable for long periods or when users are successful in curbing their drug use for extended periods, individuals remain vulnerable to events that precipitate relapse. Behavioural studies in humans and laboratory animals show that drug-related stimuli, drugs themselves and stressors are powerful events for the precipitation of relapse. Molecular, neurochemical and anatomical studies have identified lasting neural changes that arise from mere exposure to drugs and other enduring changes that arise from learning about the relationship between drug-related stimuli and drug effects. Chronic drug exposure increases sensitivity of some systems of the brain to the effects of drugs and stressful events. These changes, combined with those underlying conditioning and learning, perpetuate vulnerability to drug-related stimuli. Circuits of the brain involved are those of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and its glutamatergic connections, and the corticotropin-releasing factor and noradrenergic systems of the limbic brain. This paper reviews advances in our understanding of how these systems mediate the effects of events that precipitate relapse and of how lasting changes in these systems can perpetuate vulnerability to relapse.

Cineradiographic (video X-ray) analysis of skilled reaching in a single pellet reaching task provides insight into relative contribution of body, head, oral, and forelimb movement in rats	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						bone and joint motion; cineradiography/X-ray analysis; motor system; movement analysis; skilled reaching and upper extremities	MOTOR CORTEX STROKE; UNRESTRAINED AWAKE ANIMALS; CERVICAL VERTEBRAL COLUMN; QUALITATIVE IMPAIRMENTS; LIMB KINEMATICS; RECOVERY; LESIONS; INJURY; COMPENSATION; ORIENTATION	The forelimb movements (skilled reaching) used by rats to reach for a single food pellet to place into the mouth have been used to model many neurological conditions. They have been described as a sequence of oppositions of head-pellet, paw-pellet and pellet-mouth that can be described as movements of the distal portion of body segments in relation to their fixed proximal joints. Movement scoring is difficult, however, because the location and movement of body segments is estimated through the overlying fur and skin, which is pliable and partially obscures movement. Using moderately high-speed cineradiographic filming from lateral, dorsal, and frontal perspectives, the present study describes how forelimb and skeletal bones move during the skilled reaching act. The analysis indicates that: (i) head movements for orienting to food, enabled by the vertical orientation of the rostral spinal cord, are mainly independent of trunk movement, (ii) skilled reaching consists of a sequence of upper arm and extremity movements each involving a number of concurrent limb segment and joint movements and (iii) food pellets are retrieved from the paw using either the incisors and/or tongue. The findings are discussed in relation to the idea that X-ray cinematography is valuable tool for assisting descriptive analysis and can contribute to understanding general principles of the relations between whole body, head, oral, and upper extremity movement.

During the induction phase (Days 1, 3, 5 and 7), male Long-Evans adult rats were treated with the neurotensin antagonist SR-48692 (760, 320 or 640 mu g/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle, followed by morphine (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle. and their locomotor activity (ambulatory, non-ambulatory and vertical activity) was measured for 2 h. One week after the last injection, each group received a single injection of morphine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and their locomotor activity was again measured for 2 h (sensitization test, day 14). Results show that SR-48692 alone did not change locomotion. Morphine stimulated locomotor activity, an effect that was stronger on day 7 than on day 1. The two higher doses of SR-48692 attenuated the acute stimulant effect of morphine and prevented the observed increase from day 1 to day 7. The sensitization test on day 14 showed that rats pre-treated with morphine alone displayed significantly stronger ambulatory and vertical activity than vehicle pre-treated rats, a sensitization effect that was attenuated by SR-48692. The present results suggest that endogenous neurotensin contributes to the acute locomotor stimulant effect of morphine and to the induction of its sensitization. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the Drosophila neuroblast lineage, the zinc finger transcription factor Hunchback (Hb) is both necessary and sufficient to specify early-born neuronal identity. We show here that Ikaros, a mouse ortholog of Hb, is expressed in all early embryonic RPCs, which then give rise to Ikaros-negative RPCs at later stages in the lineage. Remarkably, misexpression of Ikaros in late RPCs is sufficient to confer competence to generate early-born neurons. Conversely, Ikaros mutant mice have reduced numbers of early-born cell types, whereas late-born cell types are not affected. These results suggest a model in which Ikaros expression is both necessary and sufficient to confer early temporal competence to RPCs and raise the possibility that a similar strategy might be used to control the sequential order of cell birth in other parts of the nervous system.

We previously demonstrated that apoD protects against neuropathology by controlling the level of peroxidated lipids. Here, we further investigated the biological function of apoD in a mouse model of acute encephalitis. Our results show that apoD transcript and protein are upregulated during acute encephalitis induced by the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection. The apoD upregulation coincides with glial activation, and its expression returns to normal levels when the virus is cleared, concomitantly to a resolved glial reactivity. In addition, the overexpression of human apoD in the neurons of Thy-1/ApoD transgenic mice results in a threefold increase of the number of mice surviving to HCoV-OC43 infection. This increased survival rate is correlated with an upregulated glial activation associated with a limited innate immune response (cytokines, chemokines) and T-cell infiltration into infected brains. Moreover, the protection seems to be associated with a restricted phospholipase A2 activity. These data reveal a role for apoD in the regulation of inflammation and suggest that it protects from HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis, most likely through the phospholipase A2 signaling pathways.

Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization in Global Developmental Delay	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS			English	Article						developmental delay; etiology; copy number changes	IDIOPATHIC MENTAL-RETARDATION; ETIOLOGIC YIELD; CHROMOSOMAL IMBALANCE; GENETIC EVALUATION; DIAGNOSTIC YIELD; CHILD; CGH; ABERRATIONS; DISORDERS; FEATURES	Objective: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) is an emerging technology that allows for the genome-wide detection of DNA copy number changes (CNC) such as deletions or duplications. In this study, array-based CGH was applied to a consecutive series of children with previously undiagnosed non-syndromal global developmental delay (GDD) to assess potential etiologic yield. Methods: The children in this study were drawn from a previously reported consecutive series of children with well-defined GDD. Almost all subjects had undergone prior karyotyping and neuroimaging studies with non-diagnostic results. Array-based CGH was undertaken using the SignatureChip (R) (1887 BACs representing 622 loci) with abnormalities verified by subsequent FISH analysis and testing of parents to distinguish between pathogenic and familial non-pathogenic variants. Results: On CGH analysis in our study, 6 of 94 children (6.4%) had a causally related pathogenic CNC. Three were sub-telomeric in location. An analysis of a variety of clinical factors revealed that only the presence of minor dysmorphic features (<3) was predictive of etiologic yield on CGH analysis (4/26 vs. 2/68, P = 0.05). Severity of delay was not found to be predictive. Interpretation: In children with non-syndromal GDD, array-based CGH has an etiologic yield of 6.4%. This suggests that this emerging technology may be of diagnostic value when applied subsequent to detailed history, physical examination, and targeted laboratory testing. Array CGH may merit consideration as a first-tier test in the context of a child with unexplained GDD. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	[Shevell, M.

J	Hanessian, S; Auzzas, L				Hanessian, Stephen; Auzzas, Luciana			The Practice of Ring Constraint in Peptidomimetics Using Bicyclic and Polycyclic Amino Acids	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							ASYMMETRIC MICHAEL ADDITION; STRUCTURAL CONFIRMATION; INHIBITORY-ACTIVITY; CYCLOPROPYL-GROUP; FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE; NATURAL OCCURRENCE; OLEFIN METATHESIS; CYCLIC ENONES; FACTOR-VIIA; PROLINE	Medicinal chemistry has witnessed major advances with the discovery of small synthetic molecules that mimic natural peptidic substrates. These small synthetic mimics do not undergo proteolytic degradation, an advantage they hold over their natural counterparts. Small synthetic molecules make up a number of life-saving marketed drugs that inhibit certain physiologically relevant proteases. The advent of sophisticated instrumental methods, such as X-ray crystallography and high-field NMR, has played a pivotal role in the design of structure-based enzyme inhibitors. Highly stereocontrolled methods of synthesis have led to a variety of functionally diverse molecules that function as peptidomimetics because they have isosteric subunits not affected by proteolytic enzymes. Further studies to optimize biological activity and achieve desirable pharmacokinetic profiles can eventually lead to drug substances. The practice of constraining natural amino acids like their conformationally rigid counterparts has been highly successful in the design and synthesis of peptidomimetic molecules. With some notable exceptions, structural information gathered from protein X-ray crystallography of therapeutically relevant target enzymes, alone or in complex forms with inhibitor molecules, has been instrumental in the design of peptidomimetics. For example, a significant number have become marketed drugs as antihypertensives and antivirals. Natural products have also been a source of inspiration for the design and synthesis of truncated analogues with the intention of maintaining, or even improving their biological activities. However, lower molecular weight peptides are not suitable as therapeutic agents because they are subject to rapid amide proteolysis. They are poorly transported to the brain and rapidly excreted through the liver and kidney. Thus, lower molecular weight peptides are eliminated as potential drug substances in clinical practice. A synthetic peptidomimetic is needed that is resistant to cleavage but maintains its biological activity. Conformationally constrained monocyclic and bicyclic unnatural amino acids can be directly incorporated in a potential inhibitor molecule as part of the design element. In this Account, we describe our efforts in the synthesis of constrained azacycles that contain proline or pipecolic acid as an integral part of bicyclic and polycyclic amino acids. We devised syntheses of conformationally biased monocyclic, bicyclic, and polycyclic amino add analogues, into which pharmacologically or structurally relevant functional groups were incorporated. Stereo-controlled reactions for C-C, C-N, and C-O bond formation had to be implemented on appropriately protected amino acid frameworks. A number of these frameworks provided access to functionally diverse scaffolds for further use as core subunits in more elaborated structures. Specific applications as peptidomimetics of natural substrates for relevant enzymes, such as thrombin, were also pursued, resulting in highly active inhibitors in vitro.

Cyclical and dose-dependent responses of adult human mature oligodendrocytes to fingolimod	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG FTY720; 1-PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR AGONIST; SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; PROCESS RETRACTION; COUPLED RECEPTORS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LINEAGE CELLS	Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP) analogue that has been used in clinical trials as a systemic immunomodulatory therapy for multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod readily accesses the central nervous system, raising the issue of its direct effects on neural cells. We assessed the effects of active fingolimod on dissociated cultures of mature, myelin-producing oligodendrocytes derived from adult human brain. Human OLGs express S1P receptor transcripts: in relative abundance of S1P5 > S1P3 > S1P1, with undetectable levels of S1P4. low doses of fingolimod (100 pmol/L to 1 nmol/L) induced initial membrane elaboration (2 days), subsequent retraction (4 days), and recurrence of extension with prolonged treatment (8 days). Higher doses (10 nmol/L to 1 mu mol/L) caused the opposite modulation of membrane dynamics. Retraction was rescued by co-treatment with the S1P3/S1P5 pathway antagonist, suramin, and was associated with RhoA-mediated. cytoskeletal signaling. Membrane elaboration was mimicked using the SIPI agonist SEW2871. Fingolimod rescued human OLGs from serum and glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis, which was reversed with suramin co-treatment and mimicked using an S1P5 agonist. High doses of fingolimod induced an initial down-regulation of S1P5 mRNA levels relative to control (4 hours), subsequent up-regulation (2 days), and recurrent down-regulation (8 days). S1P1 mRNA levels were inversely regulated compared with S1P5. These results indicate that fingolimod modulates maturity- and species-specific OLG membrane dynamics and survival responses that are directly relevant for myelin integrity.

In 30 anesthetized dogs, trains of five electrical stimuli (1 mA; 1 ms) were delivered immediately after the P wave of the ECG to mediastinal nerves associated with the superior vena cava. Regional atrial electrical events were monitored with 191 atrial unipolar electrodes. Mediastinal nerve sites were identified that reproducibly initiated atrial arrhythmias. These sites were then restimulated following 1 h (time control, n = 6), or the intravenous administration of naftopidil (alpha(1)-adrenergic blocker: 0.2 mg/kg, n = 6), yohimbine (alpha(2)-adrenergic blocker: 1 mg/kg, n = 6) or both (n = 8). A ganglionic blocker (hexamethonium: 1 mg/ kg) was tested in four dogs. Stimulation of mediastinal nerves sites consistently elicited atrial tachyarrhythmias. Repeat stimulation after 1 h in the time-control group exerted a 19% decrease of the sites still able to induce atrial tachyarrhythmias. Hexamethonium inactivated 78% of the previously active sites. Combined alpha-adrenoceptor blockade inactivated 72% of the previously active sites. Bradycardia responses induced by mediastinal nerve stimulation were blunted by hexamethonium, but not by alpha(1,2)-adrenergic blockade. Naftopidil or yohimbine alone eliminated atrial arrhythmia induction from 31% and 34% of the sites (similar to time control). We conclude that heterogeneous activation of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system results in atrial arrhythmias that involve intrinsic cardiac neuronal alpha-adrenoceptors. In contrast to the global suppression exerted by hexamethonium, we conclude that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade targets intrinsic cardiac local circuit neurons involved in arrhythmia formation and not the flow-through efferent projections of the cardiac nervous system.

Males trained in a pacing chamber with a 4-hole partition had significantly shorter ejaculation latencies compared with males trained in chambers with a 1-hole partition. Those differences persisted when males were switched into the other pacing condition, suggesting that the pattern of copulation in these males had become "fixed." In the second experiment, males were trained to associate an almond odor with copulation in either the 1-hole or 4-hole condition. Males ejaculated preferentially with females associated with the 4-hole pacing condition. Copulatory behavior in male rats is sensitive to female availability. and females associated with greater availability are preferred.

J	Arvanitogiannis, A; Shizgal, P				Arvanitogiannis, Andreas; Shizgal, Peter			The Reinforcement Mountain: Allocation of Behavior as a Function of the Rate and Intensity of Rewarding Brain Stimulation	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain stimulation reward; self-stimulation; medial forebrain bundle; single-operant matching law; rate of reinforcement	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; SELF-STIMULATION; SUMMATION FUNCTION; RESPONSE STRENGTH; PULSE FREQUENCY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; TRAIN DURATION; WEIGHT-LOSS; MAGNITUDE; PERFORMANCE	The single-operant matching law has been used to describe the relationship between time allocated to pursuit of brain stimulation reward (BSR) and the obtained rate of reinforcement. We generalize this relationship to a third dimension by including the strength of the stimulation (the number of pulses per train) as an independent dimension, and we dub the resulting 3-dimensional structure "the reinforcement mountain." The validity of generalizing the single-operant matching law in this way was assessed by determining the changes in the position of the mountain produced by increasing the stimulation current or the train duration. Most of the predictions were supported, and the mountain model fitted the data closely. It is argued that application of this model can remove ambiguity inherent in 2-dimensional descriptions of operant performance and can reveal whether lesions, drugs, or physiological manipulations that alter performance for BSR act before or after the output of the ("reward-growth") function that translates the electrically induced impulse flow into the intensity of the BSR.

Cytosolic prion protein is the predominant anti-Bax prion protein form: Exclusion of transmembrane and secreted prion protein forms in the anti-Bax function	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH			English	Article						Bax; prion; transmembrane prion protein; cytosolic prion protein; secreted prion protein; neuroprotection; apoptosis	MEDIATED CELL-DEATH; DEFICIENT PURKINJE-CELLS; DOPPEL-INDUCED APOPTOSIS; BCL-2 FAMILY-MEMBERS; AMYLOID-BETA PEPTIDE; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; HUMAN NEURONS; PROTEASOMAL DEGRADATION; SIGNAL SEQUENCE; EXPRESSION	Prion protein (PrP) prevents Bax-mediated cell death by inhibiting the initial Bax conformational change that converts cytosolic Bax into a pro-apoptotic protein. PrP is mostly a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein but it is also retrotranslocated into cytosolic PrP (CyPrP) or can become a type 1 or type 2 transmembrane protein. To determine the form and subcellular location of the PrP that has anti-Bax function, we co-expressed various Syrian hamster PrP (SHaPrP) mutants that favour specific PrP topologies and subcellular localization with N-terminally green fluorescent protein tagged pro-apoptotic Bax (EGFP-Bax) in MCF-7 cells and primary human neurons. Mutants that generate both CyPrP and secreted PrP ((PrP)-Pr-Sec) or only CyPrP have anti-Bax activity. Mutants that produce (PrP)-Pr-Ctm or (PrP)-Pr-Ntm lose the anti-Bax activity, despite their ability to also make (PrP)-Pr-Sec. Transmembrane-generating mutants do not produce CyPrP and both normal and cognate mutant forms of CyPrP rescue against the loss of anti-Bax activity. (PrP)-Pr-Sec-generating constructs also produce non-membrane attached (PrP)-Pr-Sec. However, this form of PrP has minimal anti-Bax activity. We conclude that CyPrP is the predominant form of PrP with anti-Bax function. These results imply that the retrotranslocation of PrP encompasses a survival function and is not merely a pathway for the proteasomal degradation of misfolded protein. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although it is now well established that activity-dependent mechanisms can down regulate KCC2 gene expression, the role of post-translational mechanisms in controlling KCC2 expression, specifically at the cell-surface, are poorly understood. We therefore set out to identify the mechanisms and motifs regulating KCC2 endocytosis, one important pathway that may control KCC2 membrane expression. Using a fluorescence-based assay, we show KCC2 when expressed in HEK293 cells is constitutively internalized via a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway. Consistent with this, we demonstrate KCC2 from adult mouse brain associates in vivo with the clathrin-binding adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) complex. Using an endocytosis reporter system, we identify the presence of an autonomous endocytosis motif in the carboxyl cytoplasmic terminus of KCC2. By site-directed mutagenesis we define this novel KCC2 endocytic motif as a non-canonical di-leucine Motif, 657LLYXEE662, Finally by mutating this motif in the context of full-length KCC2 we demonstrate that this novel KCC2 endocytic motif is essential for the constitutive internalization of KCC2 and for binding to the AP-2 complex. Subsequent sequence analysis reveals this motif is highly conserved between the closely related K+/Cl- family members that mediate chloride efflux, but absent from the more distant related cotransporters controlling chloride influx. In conclusion, our results indicate constitutive internalization of KCC2 is clathrin-mediated and dependent on the binding of AP-2 to this novel endocytic motif. Furthermore, that this process appears to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism amongst functionally homologous cotransporters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As a consequence, most mammals with large brains have profusely convoluted cortices. The human cortex is a good example of this trend, however, given the large variability in human brain size, it is not clear how cortical folding varies from the smallest to the largest brains. We analyzed cortical folding in a large cohort of human subjects exhibiting a 1.7-fold variation in brain volume. We show that the same disproportionate increase of cortical surface relative to brain volume observed across species can be also observed across human brains: the largest brains can have up to 20% more surface than a scaled-up small brain. We introduce next a novel local measure of cortical folding, and we show that the correlation between cortical folding and size varies along a rostro-caudal gradient, being especially significant in the prefrontal cortex. The expansion of the cerebral cortex, and in particular that of its prefrontal region, is a major evolutionary landmark in the emergence of human cognition. Our results suggest that this may be, at least in part, a natural outcome of increasing brain size.

Revealing modular architecture of human brain structural networks by using cortical thickness from MRI	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						betweenness centrality; cortical thickness; modularity; morphometry; MRI; network; small world	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEUROCOGNITIVE NETWORKS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; METABOLIC NETWORKS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; MEMORY; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Modularity, presumably shaped by evolutionary constraints, underlies the functionality of most complex networks ranged from social to biological networks. However, it remains largely unknown in human cortical networks. In a previous study, we demonstrated a network of correlations of cortical thickness among specific cortical areas and speculated that these correlations reflected an underlying structural connectivity among those brain regions. Here, we further investigated the intrinsic modular architecture of the human brain network derived from cortical thickness measurement. Modules were defined as groups of cortical regions that are connected morphologically to achieve the maximum network modularity. We show that the human cortical network is organized into 6 topological modules that closely overlap known functional domains such as auditory/language, strategic/executive, sensorimotor, visual, and mnemonic processing. The identified structure-based modular architecture may provide new insights into the functionality of cortical regions and connections between structural brain modules. This study provides the first report of modular architecture of the structural network in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.

Spasticity measurement based on tonic stretch reflex threshold in stroke using a portable device	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Motor control; Stretch reflex threshold; Clinical measure; Cerebro-vascular accident; Hypertonia	MODIFIED ASHWORTH SCALE; MOTOR CONTROL; ELBOW FLEXORS; SPINAL-CORD; RELIABILITY; MUSCLE; POSTSTROKE; UNITS; CAT; CONTRACTIONS	Objectives: We investigated intra- and inter-evaluator reliability to quantify spasticity based on the tonic stretch reflex threshold (TSRT) and the correlation between TSRT and resistance to stretch. Methods: Spasticity was evaluated in 20 subjects with chronic stroke-related spasticity using a portable device and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Evaluations were done on 2 days, by three evaluators. Biceps brachii EMG signals and elbow displacement were recorded during 20 elbow stretches applied at different velocities for each evaluation. Velocity-dependent dynamic stretch reflex thresholds (angle where EMG signal increased in the biceps for a given velocity of stretch) were recorded. These values were used to compute TSRT (excitability of motoneurons at 0 degrees/s). Spasticity was also measured with MAS. Results: Reliability was moderately good for subjects with moderate to high spasticity (intra-evaluator: 0.46-0.68, and inter-evaluator: 0.53-0.68). The TSRT measure of spasticity did not correlate with resistance to stretch (MAS). Conclusions: TSRT may be a more representative measure for subjects with moderate to high spasticity. Further improvements are suggested for the portable device in order to quantify all the levels of spasticity. Significance: TSRT may be an alternative clinical measure to current clinical scales.

Persistent metabolic crisis as measured by elevated cerebral microdialysis lactate-pyruvate ratio predicts chronic frontal lobe brain atrophy after traumatic brain injury	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						brain trauma; microdialysis; lactate; pyruvate; MRI; atrophy; outcome; biomarker	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; PERFUSION-PRESSURE; INTRACEREBRAL MICRODIALYSIS; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; EXTRACELLULAR GLUTAMATE; LACTATE/PYRUVATE RATIO; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; ENERGY-METABOLISM; GLUCOSE	Objective: To determine whether persistent metabolic dysfunction in normal-appearing frontal lobe tissue is correlated with long-term tissue atrophy. Design: Prospective monitoring with retrospective data analysis. Setting: Single-center academic neurointensive care unit. Patients: Fifteen patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 3-12). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Hourly cerebral microdialysis was performed for the initial 96 hrs after trauma to determine extracellular levels of glucose, glutamate, glycerol, lactate, and pyruvate in normal appearing frontal lobes. Six months after injury, the anatomical outcome was assessed by measures of global and regional cerebral atrophy using volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging. The lactate/pyruvate ratio was elevated >40 after traumatic brain injury in most patients, with a mean percent time of 32 +/- 29% of hours monitored. At 6 months after traumatic brain injury, there was a mean frontal lobe atrophy of 12 +/- 11% and global brain atrophy of 8.5 +/- 4.5%. The percentage of time of elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio correlated with the extent of frontal lobe brain atrophy (r = -.56, p < 0.01), but not global brain atrophy (r = -.31, p = 0.20). The predictive effect of lactate/pyruvate ratio was independent of patient age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and volume of frontal lobe contusion.

Recent findings indicate that a small number of individuals have severe musical problems that have neurogenetic underpinnings. Such deficiencies are termed congenital amusia, an umbrella term for lifelong musical disabilities that cannot be attributed to mental retardation, deafness, lack of exposure to music, or brain damage after birth. Congenital amusia constitutes a natural experiment, giving us a rare chance to examine the biological basis of music by tracing causal links among genes, environment, brain, and behavior.

Recent findings A superficial cervical plexus block is the regional anesthetic technique of choice. It is as efficacious as a combined (superficial and deep) cervical plexus block and carries substantially less risk of inducing a life-threatening complication from the block placement than a cervical epidural or a deep cervical plexus block. Lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine and ropivacaine are all suitable agents for this block but bupivacaine provides the longest duration of postoperative analgesia. The addition of epinephrine 1:300000 (3.75 mu g/ml) reduces maximal blood concentrations of lidocaine and bupivacaine without inducing any adverse hemodynamic effects. Summary The anesthesiologist should learn how to place a superficial cervical plexus block. The technique is easy to master, effective and carries a low risk of inducing a serious complication.

J	Srivastava, VK; Nalbantoglu, J				Srivastava, Vinit Krishna; Nalbantoglu, Josephine			Flow cytometric characterization of the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line for the cancer stem-like phenotype	CYTOMETRY PART A			English	Article						flow cytometry; side population; CD133; cancer stem cell; medulloblastoma; tumor sphere	BRAIN-TUMORS; IN-VIVO; DIFFERENTIATION; IDENTIFICATION; HOECHST-33342; RESISTANCE; NUMBERS; MICE	Side Population (SP) analyses and CD133 expression have identified cells with stem-like potential in normal and cancerous tissue. Whether stern-like cells exist in cancer cell lines is hotly debated. We have interrogated the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line with respect to stern-like potential. Vital staining for Hoechst 33342 efflux capacity and CD133 immunophenotyping were performed on DAOY cells to assess the presence of the SP and the CD133 stern cell markers, respectively. SP/non-SP and CD133(+)/CD133(-) DAOY cells were sorted into separate fractions for limiting dilution analysis (tumor sphere assay) and asymmetric division assessment. SP/non-SP cells were also sorted separately for viability (XTT assay), cell size, cell cycle status, and proliferative capacity (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)). A minor proportion of cells displayed either the SP or the CD133(+) phenotypes. CD33 expression mapped to both the SP and non-SP compartments, with CD133(+) cells being enriched almost fourfold within the non-SP gate. The SP, non-SP, CD133(+), and CD133(-) fractions were all capable the of reconstituting the original parental DAOY population. Slight clonogenic enrichment was observed in only the SP fraction; however, both CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells displayed equivalent stem cell-like fresuencies. SP cells were resistant to Hoechst 33342-inediated toxicity relative to the parental population and differed from the nonSP cells with respect to increased cell size, decreased S-phase, arid slightly decreased proliferative capacity. The multiparainetric strategy described in this study revealed that the SP and CD133(+) subset may be two independent compartments. Our results highlight the need for new reliable specific cancer stern cell marker(s) as Hoechst 33342 efflux and CD133 expression might not be suitable for selectively isolating cancer stemlike cells from cell lines, as shown for the DAOY cells. As such, care must be used in interpreting therapeutic Studies targeting the stern cell compartment of cancer cell lines. (C) 2008 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

A mutation in the shorter isoform of zVIPL (zVIPL-s,) results in a reduction or mechanosensitivity and consequent loss of escape behavior. Here we show that motoneurons and hindbrain reticulospinal neurons, which normally integrate mechanosensory inputs, failed to fire in response to tactile stimuli in hi472 larvae, suggesting a perturbation in sensory function. The hi472 mutant larvae in fact suffered from a severe loss of functional neuromasts of the lateral line mechanosensory system, a reduction of zVIPL labeling in support cells, and a reduction or even a complete loss of hair cells in neuromasts. The Delta-Notch signaling pathway is implicated in cellular differentiation of neuromasts, and we observed an increase in Notch expression in neuromasts of hi472 mutant larvae. Treatment of hi472 mutant larvae with DAPT, an inhibitor of Notch signaling, or overexpression of the Notch ligand deltaB in hi472 mutant blastocysts produced partial rescue of the morphological defects and of the startle response behavior. We conclude that zVIPL-s is a necessary component of Delta-Notch signaling during neuromast development in the lateral line mechanosensory system. (C) 2008 Wiley periodicals. Inc.

A first neuro-fuzzy network named NeFIK is considered to solve the inverse kinematics problem. After a few pre-processing steps characterizing the minimum-time trajectory and the corresponding torques, a second neuro-fuzzy controller is built. Its purpose is to fit the robot dynamic behavior corresponding to the determined minimum-time trajectory with respect to actuators models, torque nominal values, as well as position, velocity, acceleration and jerk boundary conditions. A Tsukamoto Neuro-Fuzzy Inference network is designed to achieve the online control of the robot. The premise parameters (antecedent membership functions parameters) as well as rule-consequence parameters arc learned and optimized, generating the optimal-time trajectory torques, representing the robot dynamic behavior. Simulation results are presented and discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our aim was to clarify the beneficial effect of IFN-beta in the treatment of MS. We assessed the influence of IFN-beta treatment on (i) CD73 expression on the surface of primary cultures of human blood-brain barrier endothelial cells (BBB-EC) and human astrocytes using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry, (ii) transmigration of CD4(+) T lymphocytes using an in vitro model of BBB and (iii) CD73 enzyme activity, i.e. ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity in the serum of MS patients using a radiochemical assay. IFN-beta increases the expression of ecto-5'-nucleotidase both on BBB-EC and astrocytes. As a consequence, lymphocyte transmigration through BBB-EC is reduced. Importantly, this reduction can be reversed using alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine-5'-diphosphate, a specific inhibitor of ecto-5'-nucleotidase. CD73 is strongly expressed in microvasculature in samples of postmortem MS brain and, moreover, in the majority of MS patients there was a clear upregulation both in the soluble serum ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity and skin microvascular CD73 expression after IFN-beta treatment. Upregulation of ecto-5'-nucleotidase and a subsequent increase in adenosine production might contribute to the beneficial effects of IFN-beta on MS via enhancing the endothelial barrier function.

The effect of higher doses of isoflurane, widely used in clinical settings, on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is meanwhile ignored. In this study we investigated the integrity of the BBB during various levels of isoflurane anaesthesia (1% and 3%) in cats by monitoring the extravasation of Evans blue. Simultaneously we measured the electroencephalogram (EEG), with particular emphasis on its direct current (DC) component. High doses of anaesthetic (3%) broke down the BBB in the cortex and thalamus, while milder doses (1%) only opened the BBB in the thalamus. The fluorescent signal of Evans blue was visible over an extravascular length of 23 mu m in the cortex and 25 mu m in the thalamus, similar to the diffusion of the same dye when the BBB was disrupted with mannitol. The opening of the BBB was associated with (i) a positive DC shift in the EEG measured on the scalp and (ii) an evaluated increase in cerebral volume of 2-2.8%. The opening of the BBB by high doses of isoflurane brings into discussion hitherto unexplored effects of anaesthesia on the brain. The electrophysiological correlate provided by the DC component of the EEG constitutes a promising option for the assessment of the BBB integrity during human anaesthesia.

Chronic activation of the D2 dopamine autoreceptor inhibits synaptogenesis in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in vitro	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mesencephalon; microculture; protein kinase A; rapamycin; transgenic mice	REPEATED PKA ACTIVATION; RAT SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; SYNAPSE FORMATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; RECEPTOR AGONISTS; RAPAMYCIN PATHWAY; S6 KINASE	Chronic blockade or activation of dopamine receptors is critical for the pharmacological treatment of diseases like schizophrenia, Parkinson's or attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. However, the long-term impact of such treatments on dopamine neurons is unclear. Chronic blockade of the dopamine D2 receptor in vivo triggers an increase in the axonal arborization of dopamine neurons [European Journal of Neuroscience, 2002, 16, 787-794]. However, the specific involvement of presynaptic (autoreceptors) vs. postsynaptic D2 receptors as well as the molecular mechanisms involved have not been determined. Here, we examined the role of D2 autoreceptors in regulating the ability of mouse dopamine neurons to establish axon terminals. Chronic activation of this receptor with quinpirole, a specific agonist, decreased the number of axon terminals established by isolated dopamine neurons. This effect was accompanied by a decrease in dopamine release and was mediated through inhibition of protein kinase A. The decrease in axon terminal number induced by D2 receptor activation was also occluded when the mammalian Target of Rapamycin pathway of mRNA translation was blocked. Our results suggest that chronic activation of the D2 autoreceptor inhibits synaptogenesis by mesencephalic dopamine neurons through translational regulation of the synthesis of proteins required for synapse formation. This study provides a better understanding of the impact of long-term pharmacological interventions acting through the D2 receptor.

The association between anxiety and alcohol versus cannabis abuse disorders among adolescents in primary care settings	FAMILY PRACTICE			English	Article						Adolescents; alcohol abuse; anxiety; cannabis abuse; family medicine; primary care	PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER; DSM-IV DISORDERS; MENTAL-DISORDERS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; SOCIAL ANXIETY; RISK-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; COPING MOTIVES	Background. Both clinical and population-based studies show that anxiety disorders and substance misuse frequently co-occur in adults, whereas among adolescents, less examination of this association has been done. Adolescence is frequently the time of substance use initiation and its subsequent interaction with anxiety disorders has not been fully explored. It is unknown in adolescents whether anxiety is more related to alcohol abuse versus cannabis abuse. In addition, as depression has been implicated in adolescents with both anxiety and substance misuse, its role in the association should also be considered. Objective. To test the association between current anxiety with alcohol versus cannabis abuse disorders. Method. Cross-sectional, clinician-administered, structured assessment-using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders-to evaluate anxiety, mood and substance abuse disorders among 632 adolescents recruited from primary care settings. Results. Results show a strong association between current anxiety and alcohol [odds ratio = 3.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-11.8], but not cannabis (odds ratio = 1.4; 95% CI 0.4-4.7) abuse. Conclusion. This association in adolescents reflects the importance for increased awareness of anxiety symptoms and alcohol use patterns in primary care. The lack of association of anxiety with cannabis abuse in this group may reflect differences in cannabis' anxiolytic properties or that this young group has had less exposure thus far. Given adolescence is a time of especially rapid psychosocial, hormonal and brain development, primary care may provide an opportunity for further investigation and, potentially, early screening and intervention.

J	Blondin, F; Lepage, M				Blondin, Francois; Lepage, Martin			An fMRI study on memory discriminability for complex visual scenes	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						prefrontal cortex; fan effect; salience; hippocampus; memory discriminability	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; RETRIEVAL; PET; INTERFERENCE; INFORMATION; REGIONS	The fan effect represents an increase in reaction time for the recognition of in Item as a function of the amount of information associated with that item in memory. The present study used FMRI to study the neural correlates of the fan effect for complex visual scenes. We used a test in which landscape pictures were divided vertically into three equal segments. In the high discriminability condition only one segment was presented during encoding, whereas in the low discriminability condition two different segments from the same picture were presented. During a subsequent forced-choice recognition test, reaction times were significantly faster for the high discriminability condition. Increase in brain activity for the low relative to high discriminability condition was observed in the right prefrontal cortex, several regions of parietal cortex bilaterally, and several late visual processing areas, including the occipito-temporal regions, precuneus, and cuneus. These results support the hypothesis that a region of the prefrontal cortex is involved in the control of memory interference at retrieval elicited by the amount of related information in memory, and further suggests that this Involvement is right-lateralized for nonverbal material. The high versus low discriminability contrast showed an increase in activity principally in the bilateral medial temporal gyrus, including the enthorinal cortex/hippocampus and in several bilateral prefrontal cortex regions mostly located in BA 10. These activations were associated with a condition, in which the stimuli were more salient in memory and thus could represent the perceptual salience of items in memory.

Wesley			Understanding international differences in terminology for delirium and other types of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients	INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE			English	Editorial Material						delirium; delirio; delire; delier; delir; delire; confusion; confusione; coma; acute brain dysfunction; psychosis; delirium tremens; Durchgangs-Syndrom; acute verwardheid	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS; CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD; SUBSYNDROMAL DELIRIUM; PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE; HOSPITAL PATIENTS; MOTORIC SUBTYPES; MEDICAL PATIENTS; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES	Background: Delirium (acute brain dysfunction) is a potentially life threatening disturbance in brain function that frequently occurs in critically ill patients. While this area of brain dysfunction in critical care is rapidly advancing, striking limitations in use of terminology related to delirium internationally are hindering cross-talk and collaborative research. In the English literature, synonyms of delirium such as the Intensive Care Unit syndrome, acute brain dysfunction, acute brain failure, psychosis, confusion, and encephalopathy are widely used. This often leads to scientific "confusion" regarding published data and methodology within studies, which is further exacerbated by organizational, cultural and language barriers. We undertook this multinational effort to identify conflicts in terminology and phenomenology of delirium to facilitate communication across medical disciplines and languages. Methods: The evaluation of the terminology used for acute brain dysfunction was determined conducting communications with 24 authors from academic communities throughout countries/regions that speak the 13 variants of the Romanic languages included into this manuscript. Results: In the 13 languages utilizing Romanic characters, included in this report, we identified the following terms used to define major types of acute brain dysfunction: coma, delirium, delirio, delirium tremens, delire, confusion mentale, delir, delier, Durchgangs-Syndrom, acute verwardheid, intensiv-psykose, IVA-psykos, IVA-syndrom, akutt konfusion/forvirring. Interestingly two terms are very consistent: 100 % of the selected languages use the term coma or koma to describe patients unresponsive to verbal and/or physical stimuli, and 100% use delirium tremens to define delirium due to alcohol withdrawal. Conversely, only 54% use the term delirium to indicate the disorder as defined by the DSM-IV as an acute change in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking and altered level of consciousness. Conclusions. Attempts towards standardization in terminology, or at least awareness of differences across languages and specialties, will help cross-talk among clinicians and researchers.	[Ely, E.

Diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease dementia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Review							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LEWY BODIES; VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS; RIVASTIGMINE; DONEPEZIL; DEPRESSION; PSYCHOSIS; TRIAL; RISK	Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been considered predominantly a motor disorder. However, its frequent association with dementia, which contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality of the condition, is gaining increasing recognition. PD dementia (PDD) has a unique clinical profile and neuropathology, distinct from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholinergic deficits, a feature of both AD and PDD, underlie the rationale for cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in both conditions. In clinical practice, it is important that PDD should be recognised and appropriately treated. This review aims to outline the recently proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for PDD and to summarise the guidelines/recommendations published since 2006 on the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in the management of PDD. Although the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine has recently been approved for the management of PDD, there remains a need for the development of novel therapies that can affect key mechanisms of the disease or prevent/delay patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment from progressing to PDD.

Since methyl enetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme of folate interconversion and homocysteine metabolism, we addressed the possibility that VPA might have different teratogenicity in Mthfr(+/+) and Mthfr(+/-) mice and that VPA might interfere with folate metabolism through MTHFR modulation. Mthfr(+/+) and Mthfr(+/-) pregnant mice were injected with VPA on gestational day 8.5; resorption rates and occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) were examined on gestational day 14.5. We also examined the effects of VPA on MTHFR expression in HepG2 cells and on MTHFR activity and homocysteine levels in mice. Mthfr(+/+) mice had increased resorption rates (36%) after VPA treatment, compared to saline treatment (100/6), whereas resorption rates were similar in Mthfr(+/-) mice with the two treatments (25-27%). NTDs were only observed in one group (VPA-treated Mthfr(+/+)). In HepG2 cells, VPA increased MTHFR promoter activity and MTHFR mRNA and protein (2.5- and 3.7-fold, respectively). Consistent with cellular MTHFR upregulation by VPA, brain MTHFR enzyme activity was increased and plasma homocysteine was decreased in VPA-treated pregnant mice compared to saline-treated animals. These results underscore the importance of folate interconversion in VPA-induced teratogenicity, since VPA increases MTHFR expression and has lower teratogenic potential in MTHFR deficiency.

J	Preuss, R; Fung, J				Preuss, Richard; Fung, Joyce			Musculature and biomechanics of the trunk in the maintenance of upright posture	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article						Balance; Kinematics; Kinetics; Electromyography; Surface translation	LOW-BACK-PAIN; LUMBAR SPINE; RESPONSES; SURFACE; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; PERTURBATION; RELIABILITY; PARAMETERS; COMPONENTS; STABILITY	Surface perturbation has been used for decades to study balance and postural control; however the behavior of the trunk in these postural responses has been largely overlooked. Thirteen healthy males (18-23 yrs) were exposed to horizontal support surface translations delivered randomly in one of eight different horizontal directions in both sitting and standing. A 4-segment model of the trunk was used to estimate the kinematics and kinetics associated with the postural response, while surface EMG was acquired, bilaterally, from seven trunk muscles and one hip muscle. Multi-segmental movement was observed in the trunk in both test postures. Both the biomechanical and neuromuscular aspects of the trunk response were significantly affected by translation direction and test posture, with an interaction effect between these variables. The response in sitting was closely tied to the movement of the support surface, while the response in standing occurred in two phases: the first related to the dynamic response in the lower limbs, and the second tied to the movement of the support surface. As such, the observed postural responses could be largely explained by the biomechanical constraints of the system, such that the neural control of trunk equilibrium is simplified.

Prospective serial proton MR spectroscopic assessment of response to tamoxifen for recurrent malignant glioma	JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY			English	Article						brain neoplasm; chemotherapy; glioma; magnetic resonance imaging; magnetic resonance spectroscopy; tamoxifen	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; HIGH-DOSE TAMOXIFEN; GAMMA-KNIFE RADIOSURGERY; BRAIN-TUMOR METABOLISM; HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; IN-VIVO; PHASE-II; GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; RADIATION-THERAPY	Objective Early prediction of imminent failure during chemotherapy for malignant glioma has the potential to guide proactive alterations in treatment before frank tumor progression. We prospectively followed patients with recurrent malignant glioma receiving tamoxifen chemotherapy using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ((1)H-MRSI) to identify intratumoral metabolic changes preceding clinical and radiological failure. Methods We performed serial (1)H-MRSI examinations to assess intratumoral metabolite intensities in 16 patients receiving high-dose oral tamoxifen monotherapy for recurrent malignant glioma (WHO grade III or IV) as part of a phase II clinical trial. Patients were followed until treatment failure, death, or trial termination. Results Patients were officially classified as responders (7 patients) or non-responders (9 patients) 8 weeks into treatment. At 8 weeks, responders and non-responders had different intratumoral intensities across all measured metabolites except choline. Beyond 8 weeks, metabolite intensities remained stable in all responders, but changed again with approaching disease progression. Choline, lipid, choline/NAA, and lactate/NAA were significantly elevated (P < 0.02), while creatine (P < 0.04) was significantly reduced, compared to stabilized levels on average 4 weeks prior to failure. Lactate was significantly elevated (P = 0.036) fully 8 weeks prior to failure. In one patient who was still responding to tamoxifen at the conclusion of the trial, metabolite intensities never deviated from 8-week levels for the duration of follow-up. Conclusions Characteristic global intratumoral metabolic changes, detectable on serial 1H-MRSI studies, occur in response to chemotherapy for malignant glioma and may predict imminent treatment failure before actual clinical and radiological disease progression.

Depolarization recruits DCC to the plasma membrane of embryonic cortical neurons and enhances axon extension in response to netrin-1	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						cortical neuron; deleted in colorectal cancer; netrin-1; PI3-kinase; PKA; PKC	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; COLORECTAL-CANCER DCC; GROWTH CONE GUIDANCE; VERTEBRATE NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; SYNAPSIN-I; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ADENYLYL-CYCLASE	The netrin-1 receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) is required for the formation of major axonal projections by embryonic cortical neurons, including the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, and cortico-thalamic tracts. The presentation of DCC by axonal growth cones is tightly regulated, but the mechanisms regulating DCC trafficking within neurons are not well understood. Here, we investigated the mechanisms regulating DCC recruitment to the plasma membrane of embryonic cortical neurons. In embryonic spinal commissural neurons, protein kinase A (PKA) activation recruits DCC to the plasma membrane and enhances axon chemoattraction to netrin-1. We demonstrate that PKA activation similarly recruits DCC and increases embryonic cortical neuron axon extension, which, like spinal commissural neurons, respond to netrin-1 as a chemoattractant. We then determined if depolarization might recruit DCC to the plasma membrane. Neither netrin-1 induced axon extension, nor levels of plasma membrane DCC, were altered by depolarizing embryonic spinal commissural neurons with elevated levels of KCl. In contrast, depolarizing embryonic cortical neurons increased the amount of plasma membrane DCC, including at the growth cone, and increased axon outgrowth evoked by netrin-1. Inhibition of PKA, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, protein kinase C, or exocytosis blocked the depolarization-induced recruitment of DCC and suppressed axon outgrowth. Inhibiting protein synthesis did not affect DCC recruitment, nor were the distributions of trkB or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) influenced by depolarization, consistent with selective mobilization of DCC. These findings identify a role for membrane depolarization modulating the response of axons to netrin-1 by regulating DCC recruitment to the plasma membrane.

To determine whether effects on MRI markers of disease burden and tissue damage support and extend data on the benefits of mitoxantrone induction therapy before initiation of long-term GA therapy. 40 RRMS patients, aged 18 to 55 years, with 1-15 Gd-enhancing lesions on screening MRI and EDSS score 0-6.5 were randomized to receive GA (20 mg/d SC), starting 2 weeks after the last of 3 monthly mitoxantrone infusions (36 mg/m(2) total; n = 21), or to GA alone (20 mg/d SC; n = 19), for a total of 15 months. MRIs were obtained at baseline and months 6, 9, 12, and 15. At baseline, mean (+/- SD) age was 37.2 +/- 9.7 years; disease duration, 3.5 +/- 4.8 years; EDSS score, 2.3 +/- 1.1; and number of Gd-enhancing lesions, 3.75 +/- 3.95. Reductions in Gd-enhancing lesions (RR = 0.30, 95 % CI, 0.11-0.86, p = 0.0147) and relapse activity favoring mitoxantrone- GA were accompanied by significant differences in changes in T2w lesion volume (p = 0.0139), T1w hypointense lesion volume (p = 0.0303), and proportion of Gdenhancing lesions that evolved into black holes (p = 0.0023) compared with GA alone. Longterm continuous GA after brief, low-dose mitoxantrone induction is safe and more effective than GA alone. A trend toward decreased clinical disease activity was accompanied by major effects on MRI measures of disease burden and severe tissue injury.

REM sleep behaviour disorder in Parkinson's disease is associated with specific motor features	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HALLUCINATIONS; DEMENTIA; PD	Background: Rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is commonly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), and recent studies have suggested that RBD in PD is associated with increased cognitive impairment, waking EEG slowing, autonomic impairment and lower quality of life on mental health components. However, it is unclear whether the association of RBD in PD has implications for motor manifestations of the disease. Methods: The study evaluated 36 patients with PD for the presence of RBD by polysomnography. Patients underwent an extensive evaluation on and off medication by a movement disorders specialist blinded to the polysomnography results. Measures of disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, complications of therapy and response to therapy were assessed and compared using regression analysis that adjusted for disease duration and age. Results: Patients with PD and RBD were less likely to be tremor predominant (14% vs 53%; p < 0.02) and had a lower proportion of their Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score accounted for by tremor (8.2% vs 19.0%; p < 0.01). An increased frequency of falls was noted among patients with RBD (38% vs 7%; p = 0.04). Patients with RBD demonstrated a lower amplitude response to their medication ( UPDRS improvement 16.2% vs 34.8%; p = 0.049). Markers of overall disease severity, quantitative motor testing and motor complications did not differ between groups. Conclusions: The presence of altered motor subtypes in PD with RBD suggests that patients with PD and RBD may have a different underlying pattern of neurodegeneration than PD patients without RBD.

Dynamic coding of vertical facilitated vergence by premotor saccadic burst neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MESENCEPHALIC RETICULAR-FORMATION; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ALERT SQUIRREL-MONKEY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; GAZE-SHIFTS; NEURAL CONTROL; DISPARITY SENSITIVITY; DISJUNCTIVE SACCADES; 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE	To redirect our gaze in three-dimensional space we frequently combine saccades and vergence. These eye movements, known as disconjugate saccades, are characterized by eyes rotating by different amounts, with markedly different dynamics, and occur whenever gaze is shifted between near and far objects. How the brain ensures the precise control of binocular positioning remains controversial. It has been proposed that the traditionally assumed "conjugate" saccadic premotor pathway does not encode conjugate commands but rather encodes monocular commands for the right or left eye during saccades. Here, we directly test this proposal by recording from the premotor neurons of the horizontal saccade generator during a dissociation task that required a vergence but no horizontal conjugate saccadic command. Specifically, saccadic burst neurons (SBNs) in the paramedian pontine reticular formation were recorded while rhesus monkeys made vertical saccades made between near and far targets. During this task, we first show that peak vergence velocities were enhanced to saccade-like speeds (e.g., > 150 vs. < 100 degrees/s during saccade-free movements for comparable changes in vergence angle). We then quantified the discharge dynamics of SBNs during these movements and found that the majority of the neurons preferentially encode the velocity of the ipsilateral eye. Notably, a given neuron typically encoded the movement of the same eye during horizontal saccades that were made in depth. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the brain stem saccadic burst generator encodes integrated conjugate and vergence commands, thus providing strong evidence for the proposal that the classic saccadic premotor pathway controls gaze in three-dimensional space.

To test this hypothesis we trained cats to stand on four force platforms and to perform a task in which they were required to reach forward with one forelimb or the other and depress a lever. As such the task required the cat to make a flexion movement followed by an extension in the reaching limb while maintaining postural support by increasing extensor muscle tonus in the supporting limbs. We recorded the activity of 131 neurons from the PMRF of three cats during left, ipsilateral reach. Of these, 86/131 (66%) showed a change in discharge frequency prior to the onset of activity in one of the prime flexor muscles and 43/86 (50%) showed a bimodal pattern of discharge in which activity decreased during the lever press. Among the remaining cells, 28/86 (33%) showed maintained activity throughout the reach and the lever press. Most cells showed a broadly similar pattern of discharge during reaches with the right, contralateral limb. We suggest these results support the view that a population of neurons within the PMRF contributes to the control of movement in one forelimb and the control of posture in the other forelimb as a coordinated unit. Another population of neurons contributes to the control of postural support independently of the nature of the activity in the reaching limb.

The current study investigated the regulation of ApTrkl by overexpressing the receptor and several variants in Aplysia sensory neuron cultures. Kinase activity-dependent constitutive activation of ApTrkl was observed mainly on the plasma membrane. These studies revealed two modes of receptor internalization: (1) kinase activity-dependent internalization and (2) 5-HT-dependent, kinase activity-independent internalization. Both modes of internalization were ligand independent, and the action of 5-HT was mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). On the other hand, methiothepin, an inverse agonist of 5-HT GPCRs activated endogenous ApTrkl to the same extent as 5-HT, suggesting a transactivation mechanism due to a novel coupling of GPCRs to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation that is also activated through inverse agonist binding. The neuropeptide sensorin could transiently activate ApTrkl but was not required for 5-HT-induced ApTrkl activation. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Bruce			Algorithm for head computed tomography imaging in patients with mandible fractures	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							BRAIN-INJURY; MANAGEMENT	Purpose: Trauma to the mandible can potentially increase our predictive accuracy for intracranial injuries (ICIs) because of the mandible's strength, anatomic proximity, and direct connection to the skull base. Our goals were to: 1) investigate the association of mandible fractures with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and intracranial lesions (ICLs); and 2) determine predictors of ICIs in a level If Canadian trauma center with distinct patient demographics and fracture etiologies. Patients and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of medical records of mandible-fracture patients treated at our institution from 1997 to 2003. Patients who had undergone postinjury computed tomography (CT) of the head with a minimum of 4 weeks' follow-up were considered eligible. Data collected included patient and fracture characteristics, neurologic evaluation, and the presence of concomitant injuries. Results: One hundred eighty-one patients were reviewed, of whom 86 were found eligible, with demographics representative of an urban-trauma population. The incidence of TBI was 68.6%, and of ICLs, 27%. Logistic regression identified alcohol (odds ratio [OR], 3.97), concomitant facial fracture (OR, 2.77), and other systemic injury (OR, 2.59) as independent predictors of an ICI in mandibular fracture patients. Importantly, ICIs were observed in 19% of mandible-fracture patients, satisfying the criteria for mild TBI, and in 17% of patients without any evidence of TBI. Conclusions: Some authors have advocated treating mandible fractures on an outpatient basis, with a focused workup. Our results of significant concomitant ICI in mandible-fracture patients, conversely, suggest that such management may inadvertently result in the oversight of potentially life-threatening injuries. Thus, we recommend mandatory intracranial CT imaging if the patient's neurologic status at time of injury is unknown or meets the criteria of TBI, or if positive predictors for ICL are present.

VIP elevates cAMP and activates cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels; however, its effects on surface expression have not been investigated. We studied CFTR levels in the apical membrane of polarized Calu-3 cell monolayers, a widely used model for submucosal gland serous cells. Biotinylation during VIP exposure revealed a significant increase in apical CFTR within 10 min, which reached a maximal 3.3-fold increase after 30 min. Total CFTR content of cell lysates was not altered during this time period; therefore, the increase in surface CFTR reflects redistribution from intracellular pools. Internalization assays revealed that apical accumulation was due, at least in part, to a reduction in the rate of CFTR endocytosis. VIP-induced accumulation of apical CFTR was mimicked by phorbol ester but not by forskolin, and it was blocked by the protein kinase (PK) C inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide X (BisX) or chelerythrine chloride but not by the PKA inhibitor N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino) ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesul-fonamide dihydrochloride (H89). Increases in surface expression were paralleled by enhanced iodide effluxes during cAMP stimulation. BisX inhibition of VIP responses was abrogated when monolayers were pretreated with tannic acid to inhibit endosome recycling. Thus, PKC increases the surface expression of CFTR channels in addition to potentiating their responsiveness to PKA phosphorylation. Integrated regulation through multiple signaling pathways may be a common feature of VIP and other physiological secretagogues.

Preliminary experimental studies have shown diminished pain sensitivity in schizophrenia patients. The objective of the study was to investigate the role of excitatory and inhibitory systems on pain perception in schizophrenia. Methods: Participants were 23 patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (DSM-IV criteria) and 29 healthy volunteers, who did not differ in age, sex or ethnicity. Excitatory and inhibitory systems were elicited using a temporal summation test (Peltier thermode) administered before and after activation of the diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) by means of a cold-pressor test. Results: Time was a significant predictor of pain scores in controls, but not in patients. That is, pain ratings increased during the tonic thermal stimulation among controls but not in schizophrenia patients. When correlation coefficients (between time and pain ratings) for patients and controls were compared, the correlation coefficient emerged as significantly weaker in the schizophrenia group (Z = 12.04; p = 0.0001), suggesting a lack of sensitization in schizophrenia. DNIC was similar in magnitude in both patients and controls. Conclusions: Diminished pain sensitivity in schizophrenia may be related to abnormal excitatory mechanisms, but not to DNIC. More studies are needed to better characterize the neurophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms involved in the lack of sensitization in schizophrenia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We recorded 10 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls for two consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory, using a 10-electrode EEG montage. Sixty seconds of REM sleep EEG without artifact were analyzed using FFT spectral analysis. Absolute and relative spectral amplitudes of five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta] and beta2) were extracted and compared between the two groups. Frequency bands with significant differences were correlated with BPRS positive and negative symptoms scores. Patients with schizophrenia showed lower relative alpha and higher relative beta2 spectral amplitudes compared to healthy controls over the averaged total scalp. Analysis using cortical regions showed lower relative alpha over frontal, central and temporal regions and higher relative beta2 over the occipital region. Absolute spectral amplitude was not different between groups for any given EEG band. However, absolute alpha activity correlated negatively with BPRS positive symptoms scores and correlated positively with negative symptoms scores. Since similar results have been reported following EEG spectral analysis during the waking state, we conclude that abnormalities of subcortical-cortical transfer of information in schizophrenia could be generated by mechanisms common to REM sleep and waking.

This study tested the hypothesis that common hypomorphic variants of the RET gene, which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor critical for renal branching morphogenesis, might account for subtle renal hypoplasia in some normal newborns. A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs1800860 G/A) was identified within an exonic splicing enhancer in exon 7. The adenosine variant at mRNA position 1476 reduced affinity for spliceosome proteins, enhanced the likelihood of aberrant mRNA splicing, and diminished the level of functional transcript in human cells. In vivo, normal white newborns with an rs1800860(11476A) allele had kidney volumes 10% smaller and cord blood cystatin C levels 9% higher than those with the rs1800860(1476G) allele. These findings suggest that the RET(1476A) allele, in combination with other common polymorphic developmental genes, may account for subtle renal hypoplasia in a significant proportion of the white population. Whether this gene variant affects clinical outcomes requires further study.

Inadvertent arterial puncture is often without consequence, but can lead to devastating complications if it goes unrecognized and a large-bore dilator or catheter is inserted. The present study reviews our experience with these complications and the literature to determine the safest way to manage catheter-related cervicothoracic arterial injury (CRCAI). Methods: We retrospectively identified all cases of iatrogenic carotid or subclavian injury following central venous catheterization at three large institutions in Montreal. We reviewed the French and English literature published from 1980 to 2006, in PubMed, and selected studies with the following criteria: arterial misplacement of a large-caliber cannula (>= 7F, adult patients (>18 years old), description of the method for managing arterial trauma, reference population (denominator) to estimate the success rate of the therapeutic option chosen. A consensus panel of vascular surgeons, anesthetists and intensivists reviewed this information and proposed a treatment algorithm. Results: Thirteen patients were treated for CRCAI in participating institutions. Five of them underwent immediate catheter removal and compression, and all had severe complications resulting in major stroke and death in one patient, with the other four undergoing further intervention for a false aneurysm or massive bleeding. The remaining eight patients were treated by immediate open repair (six) or through an endovascular approach (two) for subclavian artery trauma without complications. Five articles met all our inclusion criteria, for a total of 30 patients with iatrogenic arterial cannulation: 17 were treated by immediate catheter removal and direct external pressure; eight (47%) had major complications requiring further interventions; and two died. The remaining 13 patients submitted to immediate surgical exploration, catheter removal and artery repair under direct vision, without any complications (47% vs 0%, P = .004). Conclusion: During central venous placement, prevention of arterial puncture and cannulation is essential to minimize serious sequelae. If arterial trauma with a large-caliber catheter occurs, prompt surgical or endovascular treatment seems to be the safest approach. The pull/pressure technique is associated with a significant risk of hematoma, airway obstruction, stroke, and false aneurysm. Endovascular treatment appears to be safe for the management of arterial injuries that are difficult to expose surgically, such as those below or behind the clavicle. After arterial repair, prompt neurological evaluation should be performed, even if it requires postponing elective intervention. Imaging is suggested to exclude arterial complications, especially if arterial trauma site was not examined and repaired.

De novo mRNA synthesis is required for both consolidation and reconsolidation of fear memories in the amygdala	LEARNING & MEMORY			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE-A; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; REACTIVATED MEMORY; POLYMERASE-II; KAPPA-B; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; RETRIEVAL; ACTIVATION; NEUROBIOLOGY; INHIBITION	Memory consolidation is the process by which newly learned information is stabilized into long-term memory (LTM). Considerable evidence indicates that retrieval of a consolidated memory returns it to a labile state that requires it to be restabilized. Consolidation of new fear memories has been shown to require de novo RNA and protein synthesis in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA). We have previously shown that de novo protein synthesis in the LA is required for reconsolidation of auditory fear memories. One key question is whether protein synthesis during reconsolidation depends on already existing mRNAs or on synthesis of new mRNAs in the amygdala. In the present study, we examined the effect of mRNA synthesis inhibition during consolidation and reconsolidation of auditory fear memories. We first show that intra-LA infusion of two different mRNA inhibitors dose-dependently impairs long-term memory but leaves short-term memory (STM) intact. Next, we show that intra-LA infusion of the same inhibitors dose-dependently blocks post-reactivation long-term memory (PR-LTM), whereas post-reactivation short-term memory (PR-STM) is left intact. Furthermore, the same treatment in the absence of memory reactivation has no effect. Together, these results show that both consolidation and reconsolidation of auditory fear memories require de novo mRNA synthesis and are equally sensitive to disruption of de novo mRNA synthesis in the LA.

A monolithic based NIRS front-end wireless sensor	MICROELECTRONICS JOURNAL			English	Article						near-infrared spectroreflectometry (NIRS); low noise; low power; CMOS; dynamic threshold MOSFET (DTMOS); operational amplifier; transimpedance	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; OPERATIONAL-AMPLIFIER; IMPLEMENTATION; SEIZURES; DESIGN; LIGHT	This paper concerns a novel analog front-end of a wireless brain oxymeter smart sensoring instrument based on near-infrared spectroreflectometry (NIRS). The NIRS sensor makes use of dynamic threshold transistors (DTMOS) for low voltage (I V), low power and low noise enhancement. The design is composed of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). The OTA differential input pairs use DTMOS devices for input common mode range enhancement. The OTA was fabricated in a standard 0.18 mu m CMOs process technology. Measurements under a 5 pF capacitive load for the OTA gave a DC open loop gain of 67 dB, unity frequency gain bandwidth of 400 kHz, input and output swings of 0.58 and 0.7 V, a power Consumption of 18 mu W, and an input referred noise of 134nV/root Hz at 1 kHz without any extra noise reduction techniques. The achieved features of the proposed oxymeter front-end will allow ultra low-light level measurements, high resolution and good temperature stability.

The physiological effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia and analgesia on the cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems	MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA			English	Review						Anesthesia, epidural; Analgesia; Heart, physiology; Lung, physiology; Digestive system, physiology	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; LEFT-VENTRICULAR FUNCTION; EXPERIMENTAL HEMORRHAGIC-SHOCK; SYMPATHETIC NEURAL BLOCKADE; CORONARY-ARTERY OCCLUSION; SUPPRESSES RENIN RELEASE; BOWEL FUNCTION; CIRCULATORY RESPONSES; VENTILATORY RESPONSE; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY	Studies of regional anesthesia are increasing in popularity not only for the purpose of technical advancement, but also to better understand the effects of neural deafferentation on the function of various organs. Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) is one of the most versatile and widely utilized neural deafferentation techniques. The aim of this article is to critically review published data regarding the most relevant effects of TEA on the cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. In the cardiovascular system, TEA modifies the electrical activity of the heart in addition to ventricular function and wall motion. Improvements in regional blood flow and a reduction of the major determinants of cardiac oxygen consumption lead to less severity of the ischemic injury. Although TEA negatively affects the performance of intercostal muscles, it spares diaphragmatic function and, when it is limited to the first five thoracic segments, affects Pulmonary volumes to a lesser extent. TEA can be safely used in patients with compromised respiration. Splanchnic sympathetic block is achieved when thoracic fibers from T5 to T12 are affected in a close-dependent manner. Improved gastrointestinal blood flow and motility are clear in animals, and in clinical studies, TEA has been shown to improve recovery after major abdominal surgery. TEA thus presents a powerful tool available to anesthesiologists for perioperarive intervention, but its use alone cannot prevent postoperative morbidity and mortality. It is therefore necessary to address its use in the context of multimodal intervention.

Here we show that succinate accumulates in the hypoxic retina of rodents and, via its cognate receptor G protein-coupled receptor-91 (GPR91), is a potent mediator of vessel growth in the settings of both normal retinal development and proliferative ischemic retinopathy. The effects of GPR91 are mediated by retinal ganglion neurons (RGCs), which, in response to increased succinate levels, regulate the production of numerous angiogenic factors including VEGF. Accordingly, succinate did not have proangiogenic effects in RGC-deficient rats. Our observations show a pathway of metabolite signaling where succinate, acting through GPR91, governs retinal angiogenesis and show the propensity of RGCs to act as sensors of ischemic stress. These findings provide a new therapeutic target for modulating revascularization.

Although prevalent, classical linear analysis techniques are often numerically fragile in high dimensions due to irrelevant, redundant, and noisy information. We developed a robust Bayesian linear regression algorithm that automatically detects relevant features and excludes irrelevant ones, all in a computationally efficient manner. In comparison with standard linear methods, the new Bayesian method regularizes against overfitting, is computationally efficient (unlike previously proposed variational linear regression methods, is suitable for data sets with large numbers of samples and a very high number of input dimensions) and is easy to use, thus demonstrating its potential as a drop-in replacement for other linear regression techniques. We evaluate our technique on synthetic data sets and on several neurophysiological data sets. For these neurophysiological data sets we address the question of whether EMG data collected from arm movements of monkeys can be faithfully reconstructed from neural activity in motor cortices. Results demonstrate the success of our newly developed method, in comparison with other approaches in the literature, and, from the neurophysiological point of view, confirms recent findings on the organization of the motor cortex. Finally, an incremental, real-time version of our algorithm demonstrates the suitability of our approach for real-time interfaces between brains and machines. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine whether brain damage and notably hippocampal atrophy occur early on in this model, whole brain as well as hemispheric, cortical, subcortical and hippocampal volumes was measured in non-lesioned and lesioned rat pups, 2 days (P12) and 12 days (P22) after the hyperthermic seizure. All pups with a cortical lesion showed reductions in whole brain and in ipsilateral hemispheric, cortical and hippocampal volumes at P12, which persisted at P22 in pups having also sustained a prolonged hyperthermic seizure at P10. Limiting the duration of the seizure with Diazepam prevented the hippocampal atrophy, Thus, a prolonged hyperthermic seizure in immature brain with a subtle neocortical lesion impairs normal brain development, and the duration of the seizure appears to be a key factor in generating hippocampal atrophy.

The organization of the transition from childhood to adulthood in pediatric neurosurgery in Canada	NEUROCHIRURGIE			French	Article						Myelomeningocele; Neurofibromatosis; Pediatric neurosurgery; Child-to-adult transition		The problem of the transition from childhood to adulthood in Canadian neurosurgery results from the individuation of pediatric neurosurgery. Except for transition programs for specific diseases, such as spina bifida or neurofibromatosis or cerebrovascular diseases, which are followed by adult surgical-endovascular teams, the transition from pediatric to adult care is generally left to the initiative of patients and their family. This reflects both the organization of healthcare and the geographic specificities of Canada. A harmonious transition from childhood to adulthood should result from coordination between neurosurgeons and between the different hospital networks. Transition teams, such as those already in operation for spina bifida, should be expanded to other diseases. Patient associations have a key role to play in this change. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Up-regulation of protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase expression by lithium is mediated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 inactivation and beta-catenin stabilization	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase; Lithium; Valproic acid; Glycogen synthase kinase-3; beta-Catenin	VALPROIC ACID; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; INHIBITION; WNT; GSK-3; MICE; PHOSPHORYLATION; MALFORMATION; HIPPOCAMPUS	During cell aging, proteins accumulate damages, which affect their structure and activity. The protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is involved in the repair of proteins containing abnormal L-isoaspartyl residues. Although its mechanism of action is well defined, little is known about the pathways involved in the regulation of PIMT expression. In this study, we demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and beta-catenin are involved in the regulation of PIMT expression. Treatment of astrocytoma cells (U-87) with direct pharmacological GSK-3 inhibitors such as lithium, SB-216763 and SB-415286 stimulated PIMT expression (similar to twofold). As expected, GSK-3 inhibition led to an increase of phosphorylated GSK-30 (Ser9) and to beta-catenin accumulation. PIMT induction by lithium was dependent on increased protein synthesis. In addition, RT-PCR analysis showed higher level of PIMT mRNA following GSK-3 inhibition, which was abolished by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. These results demonstrated regulation of PIMT expression by lithium at both the transcriptional and the translational levels. Additionally, inhibition by siRNA of GSK-3 and beta-catenin modulated the expression of the PIMT in accordance with GSK-3 pharmacological inhibition. Valproic acid, an antiepileptic drug with mood-stabilizing properties, up-regulated phospho-GSK-30 (Ser9), beta-catenin and PIMT levels similarly to lithium. This study reports that PIMT expression is up-regulated by GSK-3 inhibition and beta-catenin stabilization upon treatments with lithium and valproic acid. These findings suggest a possible therapeutic role for PIMT in certain brain diseases including epilepsy. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Functional reorganization was assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and stimulation with complex sounds presented binaurally and monaurally. For neurologically intact control Subjects, results showed that binaural stimulations evoked balanced activity in both hemispheres while monaural stimulations induced strong contralateral activity and weak ipsilateral activity. The results obtained from hemispherectomized subjects were substantially different from those obtained from control subjects. Specifically, activity in the intact hemisphere showed a significant decrease in response to contralateral stimulation but, concomitantly, an increase in response to ipsilateral Stimulation. The present findings suggest that a substantial functional reorganization takes place in the auditory pathways following an early hemispherectomy. The exact nature of this functional reorganization remains to be specified. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Paiement, P.; Champoux, F.; Bacon, B.

There is substantial psychophysical evidence that fibromyalgia patients perceive pain and other noxious stimuli differently than healthy individuals and that normal pain modulatory systems, such as diffuse noxious inhibitory control mechanisms, are compromised in fibromyalgia. Furthermore, functional brain imaging studies revealing enhanced pain-related activations corroborate the patients' reports of increased pain. Neurotransmitter studies show that fibromyalgia patients have abnormalities in dopaminergic, opioidergic, and serotoninergic systems. Finally, studies of brain anatomy show structural differences between the brains of fibromyalgia patients and healthy individuals. The cerebral alterations offer a compelling explanation for the multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia, including widespread pain and affective disturbances. The frequent comorbidity of fibromyalgia with stress-related disorders, such as chronic fatigue, posttraumatic stress disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, as well as the similarity of many CNS abnormalities, suggests at least a partial common substrate for these disorders. Despite the numerous cerebral alterations, fibromyalgia might not be a primary disorder of the brain but may be a consequence of early life stress or prolonged or severe stress, affecting brain modulatory circuitry of pain and emotions in genetically susceptible individuals.

THE EFFECTS OF SPINAL CORD STIMULATION IN NEUROPATHIC PAIN ARE SUSTAINED: A 24-MONTH FOLLOW-UP OF THE PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED MULTICENTER TRIAL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SPINAL CORD STIMULATION	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Failed back surgery syndrome; Neuropathic pain; Neurostimulation; Radicular pain; Randomized controlled trial; Spinal cord stimulation	BACK SURGERY SYNDROME; CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL-MANAGEMENT; EXPERIENCE; COMPLICATIONS; GUIDELINES; EFFICACY; SF-36	OBJECTIVE: After randomizing 100 failed back surgery syndrome patients to receive spinal cord stimulation (SCS) plus conventional medical management (CMM) or CMM alone, the results of the 6-month Prospective Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial of the Effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation (i.e., PROCESS) showed that SCS offered superior pain relief, health-related quality of life, and functional capacity. Because the rate of crossover favoring SCS beyond 6 months would bias a long-term randomized group comparison, we present all outcomes in patients who continued SCS from randomization to 24 months and, for illustrative purposes, the primary outcome (>50% leg pain relief) per randomization and final treatment. METHODS: Patients provided data on pain, quality of life, function, pain medication use, treatment satisfaction, and employment status. Investigators documented adverse events. Data analysis included inferential comparisons and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The 42 patients continuing SCS (of 52 randomized to SCS) reported significantly improved leg pain relief (P < 0.0001), quality of life (P <= 0.01), and functional capacity (P = 0.0002); and 13 patients (31%) required a device-related surgical revision. At 24 months, of 46 of 52 patients randomized to SCS and 41 of 48 randomized to CMM who were available, the primary outcome was achieved by 17 (37%) randomized to SCS versus 1 (2%) to CMM (P = 0.003) and by 34 (47%) of 72 patients who received SCS as final treatment versus 1 (7%) of 15 for CMM (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: At 24 months of SCS treatment, selected failed back surgery syndrome patients reported sustained pain relief, clinically important improvements in functional capacity and health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment.

The discovery of the underlying mutation in the survival of motor neurons 1 (SMN1) gene has accelerated preclinical research, leading to treatment targets and transgenic mouse models, but there is still no effective treatment. The clinical severity is inversely related to the copy number of SMN2, a modifying gene producing some full-length SMN transcript. Drugs shown to increase SMN2 function in vitro, therefore, have the potential to benefit patients with SMA. Because several drugs are now on the horizon of clinical investigation, we review recent clinical trials for SMA and discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with SMA drug development. Although an orphan disease, SMA is well-positioned for successful trials given that it has a common genetic etiology in most cases, that it can be readily diagnosed, that preclinical research in vitro and in transgenic animals has identified candidate compounds, and that trial networks have been established.

Delays in diagnosis and treatment among children and adolescents with cancer in Canada	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						cancer; children; delay; diagnosis; epidemiology; prognostic factors; treatment	PEDIATRIC BRAIN-TUMORS; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; CONTROL PROGRAM; SYMPTOM ONSET; CARCINOMA; PROGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; INTERVAL; IMPACT; TIME	Background. Few Studies have investigated delays in diagnosis and treatment among children and adolescents with cancer, especially from the perspective of an entire Country. Detailed understanding of delays along the continuum of cancer patient care is important in order to establish appropriate benchmarks for timely oncological care. Our objective was to characterise the different components of delay in 2,896 Canadian children and adolescents (aged 0-19 years) with cancer that were enrolled in the Treatment and Outcome Surveillance component of the Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control Program from 1995 to 2000. Procedure. We examined median and standardised means concerning the distribution of delay times across categories of pertinent variables and over time. The word "delay" was used simply to represent a time interval, measured in days, Without implying whether this interval exceeded a particular threshold of clinical acceptability. Results. The median times (and inter-quartile ranges) for patient, diagnosis and healthcare system delays for all cancers were 9 (1-31), 30 (13-69) and 12 (4-35) clays, respectively. The median total delay was 34 (16-76) days. Conclusions. Patient and referral delays were the longest time segments influencing timely diagnosis. Differences in delays were observed across age groups, cancer types and geographical regions. There was a significant trend for decreasing delays to diagnosis and treatment.

Accurate recognition of these most common of subtypes of neurodevelopmental disabilities is a central precondition to their correct evaluation and management. Proper evaluation is a time- and labor-intensive process that emphasizes several different goals. Guidelines now exist to assist the practitioner in selecting the appropriate investigation path to be pursued, and these guidelines should be used to inform the selections of investigations made. Although challenging and time consuming, the evaluation of these children offers many professional rewards and is a necessary first step in a family's adaptation to their child's chronic condition.

GMS likely represents a heterogeneous group of disorders with hitherto unknown genetic etiology. The clinical phenotype to some extent overlaps that of Pierson syndrome (PS), which comprises congenital nephrotic syndrome and distinct ocular abnormalities but which may also include neurodevelopmental deficits and microcephaly. PS is caused by mutations of LAMB2, the gene encoding laminin beta 2. We hypothesized that GMS might be allelic to PS or be caused by defects in proteins that interact with laminin beta 2. In a cohort of 18 patients with GMS or a GMS-like phenotype we therefore analyzed the genes encoding laminin beta 2 (LAMB2), laminin alpha 5 (LAMA5), alpha 3-integrin (ITGA3), beta 1-integrin (ITGB1) and alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4), but we failed to find causative mutations in these genes. We inferred that LAMA5, ITGA3, ITGB1, and ACTN4 are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of GMS. We excluded LAMB2 as a candidate gene for GMS. Further studies are required, including linkage analysis in families with GMS to identify genes underlying this disease.

The extent to which this problem is due to CNS maldevelopment. prenatal ischemia, postnatal chronic cyanosis and/or multiple exposures to cardiopulmonary bypass is unknown. To better Understand the etiolooy of CNS abnormalities in HLHS, we evaluated 68 neonates with HI-FIS: in 28 cases. both fetal Ultrasound and echocardiogram data were available to assess head size, head growth and aortic valve anatomy (atresia of, stenosis). In addition, we evaluated neuropathology in 11 electively aborted HLHS fetuses. The mean head circumference percentile in HLHS neonates was significantly smaller than HLHS fetuses (22 +/- 21% versus 40 +/- 4%. p < 0.001). A significant decrease in head growth. defined as a 50% reduction in head circumference percentile, was observed in half (14/28) of HLHS fetuses and nearly a quarter (6/28) were already growth restricted (<= 10%) at the time of initial evaluation. Brains from HLHS fetuses demonstrated chronic diffuse white matter injury of varying severity. These patterns of prenatal head growth and brain histopathology identify a spectrum of abnormal CNS development and/or injury in HLHS fetuses.

The rewarding efficacy of brain stimulation and its modulation by dopaminergic drugs in young adult and old BNF344F1 rats	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						amphetamine; alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine; rewarding brain stimulation; rate-frequency curve; dopamine; aging; aged; reinforcement	INTRACRANIAL SELF-STIMULATION; AGE-RELATED DECLINE; METHYL-PARA-TYROSINE; CATECHOLAMINE LEVELS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; RELEASE; PERFORMANCE; STRIATUM; LIFE; AMPHETAMINE	In old age there is evidence of waning motivation, and possibly lowering of mood. Physiologically there is a decline in the levels of brain neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine, and loss of myelin. These changes might be expected to impair the functioning of brain circuitry for reinforcement, and to lead to impaired motivation. To evaluate the function of brain reinforcement mechanisms during aging we examined brain stimulation reward and its modulation by dopaminergic drugs in BN F344F1 rats aged from young adult (5 months) to old (37 months). Brain stimulation directly activates the neural circuitry for reinforcement, and the response rate-frequency tradeoff can be used to characterize the functioning of the system. Both young and old subjects readily learned to]ever press for 0.6 s trains of 0.15 ms brain stimulation pulses, and there was no difference in the number of pulses per train required to maintain responding at 50% of the maximum rate (M50). Amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) significantly reduced the M50, and the dopamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (100 mg/kg) increased the 1050, but these effects were not influenced by the age of the subjects. The results suggest that in healthy animals dopaminergic modulation of reinforcement is functionally intact in old age. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Arrhythmias were traditionally treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, but increasing awareness of the risks of presently available antiarrhythmic agents has greatly limited their usefulness. Most common treatment algorithms still involve small molecule drugs, and antiarrhythmic agents with improved efficacy and safety are sorely needed. This paper reviews the model systems that are available for discovery and development of new antiarrhythmic drugs. We begin with a presentation of screening methods used to identify specific channel-interacting, agents, with a particular emphasis on high-throughput screens. Traditional manual electrophysiological methods, automated electrophysiology, fluorescent dye methods, flux assays and radioligand binding assays are reviewed. We then discuss a variety of relevant arrhythmia models. Two models are widely used in resting for arrhythmogenic actions related to excess action potential prolongation, an important potential adverse effect of chemical entities affecting cardiac rhythm: the methoxamine-sensitized rabbit and the dog, with chronic atrioventricular block. We then go oil to review models used to assess potential antiarrhythmic actions. For ventricular arrhythmias, chemical induction methods, cardiac or neural electrical stimulation, ischaemic heart models and models of cardiac channelopathies can be used to identify effective antiarrhythmic a,gents. For atrial arrhythmias, potentially Useful Models include vagally-maintained atrial fibrillation, acute asphyxia with atrial burst-pacing, sterile pericarditis, Y-shaped atria surgical incisions, chronic atrial dilation models, atrial electrical remodelling due to sustained atrial tachycardia, heart failure-related atrial remodelling, and acute atrial ischaemia. It is hoped that the new technologies now available and the recently-developed models for arrhythmia-response assessment will permit the introduction of newer and more effective antiarrhythmic therapies in the near future.

We provide evidence that this approach is insufficient. We report novel tactile-auditory and tactile-visual interactions in humans, demonstrating that a facilitating sound or visual stimulus that is exactly synchronous with an excitatory tactile signal presented at the lower leg increases the peripheral representation of that excitatory signal. These results demonstrate that during multisensory integration, the brain not only continuously binds information obtained from the senses, but also acts directly on that information by modulating activity at peripheral levels. We also discuss a theoretical framework to explain this novel interaction.

Probes are implanted in different areas of the brain to record and/or stimulate specific sites in the brain. Neural probes are currently used in many clinical settings for diagnosis of brain diseases such as seizers, epilepsy, migraine, Alzheimer's, and dementia. We find these devices assisting paralyzed patients by allowing them to operate computers or robots using their neural activity. In recent years, probe technologies were assisted by rapid advancements in microfabrication and microelectronic technologies and thus are enabling highly functional and robust neural probes which are opening new and exciting avenues in neural sciences and brain machine interfaces. With a wide variety of probes that have been designed, fabricated, and tested to date, this review aims to provide an overview of the advances and recent progress in the microfabrication techniques of neural probes. In addition, we aim to highlight the challenges faced in developing and implementing ultra-long multi-site recording probes that are needed to monitor neural activity from deeper regions in the brain. Finally, we review techniques that can improve the biocompatibility of the neural probes to minimize the immune response and encourage neural growth around the electrodes for long term implantation studies.

Functional connectivity, i.e., the correlation between the temporal activity of remote regions, may be used to track brain reorganization while, for example, a subject; learns a new skill. However, testing the significance of changes in functional connectivity is challenging for individual data, because fMRI time series exhibit dependencies in both space and time that may not be properly captured by classical parametric models. To address this issue, we propose a new statistical procedure ill a bootstrap hypothesis testing framework after various strategies were implemented to take temporal dependencies into account. These alternatives were evaluated oil Gaussian and non-Gaussian Monte-Carlo simulations of space-time processes, as well as oil a longitudinal study of motor skill learning. The results demonstrated that neglecting the temporal dependencies or modeling them as an autoregressive process of order 1 may lead to poor control of the false positive rate, i.e. to liberal tests. The version of the procedure based oil a circular block bootstrap achieved robust, satisfactory performances in all settings.

Nutrient sensing involves marked metabolic activation, resulting in the production of coupling signals that promote insulin biosynthesis and secretion. The P-cell's high capacity for nutrient sensing, however, necessitates reduced protection to nutrient toxicity. This potentially explains why in susceptible individuals, chronic fuel surfeit results in beta-cell failure and type 2 diabetes. Here we discuss recent insights into first, the biochemical basis of P-cell signaling in response to glucose, amino acids and fatty acids, and second, P-cell nutrient detoxification. We emphasize the emerging role of glycerolipid/fatty acid cycling in these processes.

The aim of this study is to present prenatal h-channel gene expressions (HCN1 and HCN2; HCN1-Entrez-Gene ID: 84390; HCN2- Entrez Gene ID: 114244) in dysplastic hippocampal pyramidal neurons induced by in utero irradiation in rats. MATERIALS and METHODS: Time-pregnant Wistar albino rats were irradiated and the dysplastic hippocampus in their 2 month-old litters was studied. Gene expression was studied by RNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS: None of the rats showed seizure activity. mRNA levels of HCN1 and HCN2 genes were decreased especially in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampi of experimental rats; however, the differences were not significant compared to controls. In CA2, mRNA levels of both genes were increased and this rise did not reach significant level. The CA4 sub-region showed a different pattern of expression: HCN1 increased but HCN2 decreased insignificantly compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that dysplastic neurons showed decreased levels of mRNA expression of HCN1 and HCN2 genes, in particularly CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. The rationale for how these changes contribute to epileptogenesis in dysplastic tissues still requires further studies.

At the cellular level, during SWS, a slow oscillation (<1 Hz) synchronizes firing patterns in large neuronal populations and is reflected on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings as large-amplitude, low-frequency waves. By using simultaneous EEG and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we characterized the transient changes in brain activity consistently associated with slow waves (>140 mu V) and delta waves (75-140 mu V) during SWS in 14 non-sleep-deprived normal human volunteers. Significant increases in activity were associated with these waves in several cortical areas, including the inferior frontal, medial prefrontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate areas. Compared with baseline activity, slow waves are associated with significant activity in the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, and brainstem, whereas delta waves are related to frontal responses. No decrease in activity was observed. This study demonstrates that SWS is not a state of brain quiescence, but rather is an active state during which brain activity is consistently synchronized to the slow oscillation in specific cerebral regions. The partial overlap between the response pattern related to SWS waves and the waking default mode network is consistent with the fascinating hypothesis that brain responses synchronized by the slow oscillation restore microwake-like activity patterns that facilitate neuronal interactions.

Can sociodemographic and clinical variables predict the quality of life of outpatients with major depression?	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Quality of Life; Depression; Predictors; Socio-demographic variables; Clinical variables	BRAZILIAN OUTPATIENTS; WHOQOL-BREF; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; OUTCOMES; DISORDERS; DISEASE; BURDEN	Quality of life (QOL) in depression could be of great value as an outcome measure, especially in determining the effectiveness of treatment strategies. However, for this aim to be accomplished, it is important to clarify the relationship between QOL and a number of potentially mediating factors, such as sociodemographic and clinical variables. For this purpose, we assessed 140 depressed outpatients with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the WHOQOL BREF, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). After standard and stepwise multiple regression analyses, the following variables were found to be independent predictors of QOL: BDI score for the physical (adjusted R-2=0.125) and psychological (adjusted R-2=0.23) domains, and for the overall QOL estimate (adjusted R-2=0.226); age, suicidality according to the MINI and BDI score for the social relations domain (adjusted R-2=0.244); and ethnicity, psychiatric comorbidity, psychotic symptoms and BDI score for the environmental domain (adjusted R-2=0.328). Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional design, relatively small sample size, and lack of objective measures of depressive symptomatology. Sociodemographic and clinical variables appear to explain less than 32.8% of the variance of QOL in subjects with depressive disorders. Clearly, further studies are needed to clarify which additional factors play a role in determining QOL in major depression. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A quantitative comparison of an homogeneous versus a two-layered model efficiencies to recover flow changes is presented. By simulating a realistic human head with MRI anatomical data, we show that the two-layered model allows distinction between changes in superficial layers and brain. We also show that the two-layered model provides a better estimate of the flow change than the homogeneous one. Experimental measurements with a two-layered dynamical phantom confirm the ability of the two-layered analytical model to distinguish flow increase in each layer.

Maternal sensitive behaviour (i.e. awareness of infant cues and appropriate responsiveness to those cues) in interaction with her very low birthweight infant is associated with better outcomes in these domains; however, maternal anxiety interferes with the mother's ability to interact sensitively with her very low birthweight infant. There is a need for brief, cost-effective and timely interventions that address both maternal psychological distress and interactive behaviour. The Cues and Care trial is a randomized controlled trial of an intervention designed to reduce maternal anxiety and promote sensitive interaction in mothers of very low birthweight infants. Methods and design: Mothers of singleton infants born at weights below 1500 g are recruited in the neonatal intensive care units of 2 tertiary care hospitals, and are randomly assigned to the experimental (Cues) intervention or to an attention control (Care) condition. The Cues intervention teaches mothers to attend to their own physiological, cognitive, and emotional cues that signal anxiety and worry, and to use cognitive-behavioural strategies to reduce distress. Mothers are also taught to understand infant cues and to respond sensitively to those cues. Mothers in the Care group receive general information about infant care. Both groups have 6 contacts with a trained intervener; 5 of the 6 sessions take place during the infant's hospitalization, and the sixth contact occurs after discharge, in the participant mother's home. The primary outcome is maternal symptoms of anxiety, assessed via self-report questionnaire immediately post-intervention. Secondary outcomes include maternal sensitive behaviour, maternal symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and infant development at 6 months corrected age. Discussion: The Cues and Care trial will provide important information on the efficacy of a brief, skills-based intervention to reduce anxiety and increase sensitivity in mothers of very low birthweight infants. A brief intervention of this nature may be more readily implemented as part of standard neonatal intensive care than broad-based, multi-component interventions. By intervening early, we aim to optimize developmental outcomes in these high risk infants.

Media coverage of the persistent vegetative state and end-of-life decision-making	NEUROLOGY			English	Review							SCHIAVO,TERRI; CONSCIOUSNESS; DISORDERS; CARE	Background: Conflicting perspectives about the diagnosis and prognosis of the persistent vegetative state (PVS) as well as end-of-life (EOL) decision-making were disseminated in the Terri Schiavo case. This study examined print media coverage of these features of the case. Methods: We retrieved print media coverage of the Schiavo case from the LexisNexis Academic database and used content analysis to examine headlines and text of articles describing Schiavo's neurologic condition, behavioral repertoire, prognosis, and withdrawal of life support. The accuracy of claims about PVS was assessed. Results: Our search yielded 1,141 relevant articles published (1990-2005) in the four most prolific American newspapers for this case. The most frequent headline themes featured legal (31%), EOL (25%), and political (22%) aspects of the case. Of the articles analyzed, 21% reported that Schiavo "might improve" and 7% that she "might recover." Statements explicitly denying the PVS diagnosis were found in 6% of articles. Explanations of PVS and other chronic disorders of consciousness were rare (<= 1%). Most frequently cited descriptions of behaviors were that the patient responds (10%), reacts (9%), is incapacitated ( 6%), smiles (5%), and laughs (5%). Withdrawal of life support was described as murder in 9% of articles. Conclusions: Media coverage included refutations of the persistent vegetative state (PVS) diagnosis, attributed behaviors inconsistent with PVS, and used charged language to describe end of life decision-making. Strategies are needed to achieve better internal agreement within the professional community and effective communication with patient communities, families, the media, and stakeholders.

Enhanced glutamatergic phenotype of mesencephalic dopamine neurons after neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesion	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dopamine; glutamate; VGLUT2; 6-OHDA; mesencephalon; nucleus accumbens	INORGANIC-PHOSPHATE COTRANSPORTER; HIPPOCAMPAL GRANULE CELLS; VESICULAR GLUTAMATE; RAT-BRAIN; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; REGIONAL EXPRESSION; VGLUT2 EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA; IN-VITRO	There is increasing evidence that a subset of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons uses glutamate as a co-transmitter and expresses vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) 2, one of the three vesicular glutamate transporters. In the present study, double in situ hybridization was used to examine tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and VGLUT2 mRNA expression during the embryonic development of these neurons, and postnatally, in normal rats and rats injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) at P4 to destroy partially DA neurons. At embryonic days 15 and 16, there was a regional overlap in the labeling of TH and VGLUT2 mRNA in the ventral mesencephalon, which was no longer found at late embryonic stages (E18-E21) and postnatally. In normal pups from P5 to P15, only 1-2% of neurons containing TH mRNA in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra, pars compacta, also displayed VGLUT2 mRNA. In contrast, after the cerebroventricular administration of 6-OHDA at P4, 26% of surviving DA neurons in the VTA of P15 rats expressed VGLUT2. To search for a colocalization of TH and VGLUT2 protein in axon terminals of these neurons, the nucleus accumbens of normal and 6-OHDA-lesioned P15 rats was examined by electron microscopy after dual immunocytochemical labeling. In normal rats, VGLUT2 protein was found in 28% of TH positive axon terminals in the core of nucleus accumbens. In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, the total number of TH positive terminals was considerably reduced, and yet the proportion also displaying VGLUT2 immunoreactivity was modestly but significantly increased (37%). These results lead to the suggestion that the glutamatergic phenotype of a VTA DA neurons is highly plastic, repressed toward the end of normal embryonic development, and derepressed postnatally following injury. They also support the hypothesis of co-release of glutamate and DA by mesencephalic neurons in vivo, at least in the developing brain. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is involved in this process; here, we show that it acts by inhibiting translation initiation. A binding partner of FMRP, CYFIP1/Sra1, directly binds the translation initiation factor eIF4E through a domain that is structurally related to those present in 4E-BP translational inhibitors. Brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BC1), another FMRP binding partner, increases the affinity of FMRP for the CYFIP1-eIF4E complex in the brain. Levels of proteins encoded by known FMRP target mRNAs are increased upon reduction of CYFIP1 in neurons. Translational repression is regulated in an activity-dependent manner because BDNF or DHPG stimulation of neurons causes CYFIP1 to dissociate from eIF4E at synapses, thereby resulting in protein synthesis. Thus, the translational repression activity of FMRP in the brain is mediated, at least in part, by CYFIP1.

Here, we provide evidence supporting the role of androgen receptor (AR) in mediating the effect of testosterone on white matter. In a large sample of typically developing adolescents (n = 408, 204 males), we used magnetic resonance imaging and acquired T1-weighted and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) images. We also measured plasma levels of testosterone and genotyped a functional polymorphism in the AR gene, namely the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 believed to be inversely proportional to the AR transcriptional activity. We found that the testosterone-related increase of white-matter volume was stronger in male adolescents with the lower versus higher number of CAG repeats in the AR gene, with testosterone explaining, respectively, 26 and 8% of variance in the volume. The MTR results suggest that this growth is not related to myelination; the MTR decreased with age in male adolescents. We speculate that testosterone affects axonal caliber rather than the thickness of the myelin sheath.

Although changes in osmoregulatory reflex gain are known to occur under physiological and pathological conditions, the basis for this modulation is unknown. Here, we show that angiotensin II amplifies osmosensory transduction by enhancing the proportional relationship between osmolality, receptor potential, and action potential firing in rat supraoptic nucleus neurons. This effect is mediated by a phospholipase C-and protein kinase C-dependent increase in cellular mechanosensitivity that is associated with a rapid increase in cortical actin filament density. Preventing this increase with cytochalasin D eliminated the enhancement of mechanosensitivity, whereas enhancing actin filament density with jasplakinolide potentiated mechanosensitivity and occluded the effects of angiotensin II. These results indicate that a receptor-mediated increase in cortical actin density can enhance osmosensitivity in acutely isolated supraoptic neurons.

It represents a severe from of hypertrophic axonal and demyelinating neuropathy. Although it is predominantly inherited as an autosomal recessive condition, autosomal dominant inheritance has also been described. To date, the autosomal recessive forms of DSD are classified into several CMT type 4 (CMT4) subclasses based on allelic heterogeneity. We present a 7-year-old boy with a severe from of CMT disease consistent with the autosomal recessive phenotype of DSD. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for mutations in the PMP22 gene resulting in homozygous deletion of exons 2 and 3. The maternally inherited allele was the typical 1.5 Mb deletion involving PMP22 seen with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). The paternally inherited allele was a deletion of exons 2 and 3. Both parents presented with a typical clinical picture of HNPP. To out knowledge, this is the first patient reported with large deletions involving both PMP22 alleles. Our patient has also developed severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a clinical feature not previously reported with CMT or DSD. The correlation of the phenotype and the molecular defects observed in this patient may set a new subcategory in the classification of DSD. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Vie demonstrate in vitro using an artificially methylated plasmid that DNA methylation state remains stable, even under extreme pH conditions. Next, using two different genomic regions from human DNA, we assess methylation state from both cortical and sub-cortical brain regions using subjects with varying pH levels. No correlation was found between DNA methylation state and pH. These results suggest that DNA methylation state is stable in post-mortem brain. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We show that the loss of one allele of the p53 family member, p73, makes mice susceptible to neurodegeneration as a consequence of aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Behavioral analyses demonstrated that old, but not young, p73(+/-) mice displayed reduced motor and cognitive function, CNS atrophy, and neuronal degeneration. Unexpectedly, brains of aged p73(+/-) mice demonstrated dramatic accumulations of phospho-tau (P-tau)- positive filaments. Moreover, when crossed to a mouse model of AD expressing a mutant amyloid precursor protein, brains of these mice showed neuronal degeneration and early and robust formation of tangle-like structures containing P-tau. The increase in P-tau was likely mediated by JNK; in p73(+/-) neurons, the activity of the p73 target JNK was enhanced, and JNK regulated P-tau levels. Thus, p73 is essential for preventing neurodegeneration, and haploinsufficiency for p73 may be a susceptibility factor for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Using aged (similar to 16 months) amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice that exhibit increased production of the amyloid-beta(A beta) peptide and severe cerebrovascular and memory deficits, we examined the capacity of in vivo treatments with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and tempol, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist pioglitazone to rescue cerebrovascular function and selected markers of AD neuropathology. Additionally, we tested the ability of pioglitazone to normalize the impaired increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose uptake (CGU) induced by whisker stimulation, and to reverse spatial memory deficits in the Morris water maze. All compounds fully restored cerebrovascular reactivity of isolated cerebral arteries concomitantly with changes in proteins regulating oxidative stress, without reducing brain A beta levels or A beta plaque load. Pioglitazone, but not NAC, significantly attenuated astroglial activation and improved, albeit nonsignificantly, the reduced cortical cholinergic innervation. Furthermore, pioglitazone completely normalized the CBF and CGU responses to increased neuronal activity, but it failed to improve spatial memory. Our results are the first to demonstrate that late pharmacological intervention with pioglitazone not only overcomes cerebrovascular dysfunction and altered neurometabolic coupling in aged APP mice, but also counteracts cerebral oxidative stress, glial activation, and, partly, cholinergic denervation. Although early or combined therapy may be warranted to improve cognition, these findings unequivocally point to pioglitazone as a most promising strategy for restoring cerebrovascular function and counteracting several AD markers detrimental to neuronal function.

Impact of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene premutation on neuropsychiatric functioning in adult males without fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome: A controlled study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS			English	Article						Fragile X syndrome; FMRP; FXTAS; working memory; alcohol abuse	TREMOR/ATAXIA SYNDROME FXTAS; MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN; MESSENGER-RNA; SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY; BEHAVIORAL-PHENOTYPE; MALAISE INVENTORY; ADAPTIVE-BEHAVIOR; SPECTRUM DISORDER; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; STATUS CATEGORIES	Fragile X Syndrome is the most common heritable form of mental retardation caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which arises from intergenerational trinucleotide repeat expansion leading to full mutation. An intermediary carrier condition, known as the premutation, is characterized by expansion up to 200 repeats without concomitant gene silencing. This prevalent allelic variant was initially thought to be free of phenotypic effects. However, recent reports have identified a degenerative disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) in older men as well as premature ovarian failure in women. Previously reports are inconsistent regarding the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with premutation due to small sample sizes, ascertainment bias, lack of adequate control groups, administration of measures with poor psychometric properties, and the confounding effects of FXTAS. We addressed these problems by conducting a controlled study of male carriers (n = 40) of the premutation without manifest symptoms of FXTAS, comparing their responses on specific, reliable, and valid measures of neuropsychiatric functioning to those of individuals with shared family environment (n = 22) and non-carrier comparison males (n = 43). Multivariate analyses revealed that the premutation confers significant risk for working memory difficulties, an associated feature of Attention-Deficit Disorder. Furthermore, both the family controls and men with premutation exhibited higher rates of Alcohol Abuse as compared to non-carrier control men. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing the distinct phenotypic outcomes that characterize the Fragile X premutation and the subtle risk factors that can act as precursors to more significant psychiatric impairment.

Initial association of NR2E1 with bipolar disorder and identification of candidate mutations in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and aggression through resequencing	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS			English	Article						nuclear receptor; mental illness; "fierce" mice; brain; polymorphisms	NUCLEAR RECEPTOR TLX; CHROMOSOME 6Q; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS; REGULATORY MOTIFS; PROMOTER REGION; TAILLESS GENE; ONSET; LINKAGE; MOUSE; AGE	Nuclear receptor 2E1 gene (NR2E1) resides within a 6q21-22 locus for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Mice deleted for Nr2e1 show altered neurogenesis, cortical and limbic abnormalities, aggression, hyperexcitability, and cognitive impairment. NR2E1 is therefore a positional and functional candidate for involvement in mental illness. We performed association analyses in 394 patients with bipolar disorder, 396 with schizophrenia, and 479 controls using six common markers and haplotypes. We also performed a comprehensive mutation screen of NR2E1, resequencing its entire coding region, complete 5' and 3' untranslated regions, consensus splice-sites, and evolutionarily conserved regions in 126 humans with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or aggressive disorders. NR2E1 was associated with bipolar disorder I and 11 [odds ratio (OR = 0.77, P = 0.013), bipolar disorder I (OR = 0.77, P = 0.015), bipolar disorder in females (OR = 0.72, P = 0.009), and with age at onset <= 25 years (OR = 0.67, P = 0.006)], all of which remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. We identified eight novel candidate mutations that were absent in 325 controls; four of these were predicted to alter known neural transcription factor binding sites. Analyses of NR2E1 m-RNA in human brain revealed forebrain-specific transcription. The data presented support the hypothesis that genetic variation at NR2E1 may be associated with susceptibility to brain-behavior disorders. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The pleiotropic activity of Gro/TLE depends on context-specific interactions with a variety of DNA-binding proteins. Most of those factors engage Gro/TLE through two different types of short peptide motifs, the WRP(W/Y) tetrapeptide and the Engrailed homology 1 (Eh1) sequence (FXIXXIL). The aim of this study was to elucidate the contribution of WRP(W/Y) and Eh1 motifs to mammalian Gro/TLE anti-neurogenic activity. Here we describe point mutations within the C-terminal WD40 repeat domain of Gro/TLE1 that do not perturb protein folding but disrupt the ability of Gro/TLE1 to inhibit the differentiation of cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells into neurons. One of those mutations, L743F, selectively blocks binding to Hes1, an anti-neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix protein that harbors a WRPW motif. In contrast, the L743F mutation does not disrupt binding to Engrailed1 and FoxG1, which both contain Eh1 motifs, nor to Tcf3, which binds to the Gro/TLE N terminus. These results demonstrate that the recruitment of transcription factors harboring WRP(W/Y) tetrapeptides is essential to the antineurogenic function of Gro/TLE1.

Its pathological features have not been previously documented. We report a case of a 61-year-old man with ADSA who died of congestive heart failure. Autopsy specimens of brain, thoracolumbar spinal cord, peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle were examined. There was no abnormality on gross examination. Microscopically, there were occasional swollen axons within the cerebral cortex and deep nuclei, particularly the subthalamic nucleus, with no neuronal loss, gliosis or microglial activation. There were many axonal spheroids within the medulla, particularly in the dorsal column nuclei. Axonal spheroids were also seen in the dorsal columns and ventral horns in the thoracolumbar spinal cord, but there was no Wallerian degeneration or demyelination. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunostaining of some of the spheroids suggested continuing dysfunction of axoplasmic flow in some regions. There was mild inflammation of peripheral nerve roots but no spheroid, and patchy chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. In summary, the major pathological process in ADSA is a neuroaxonal dystrophy most prominent in the dorsal columns and dorsal column nuclei, consistent with the clinical pattern of central sensory pathway degeneration.

Mice with a disrupted VWF gene (VWFKO) have endothetial cells that are deficient in Weibel-Palade bodies. These mice were used to evaluate the role of VWF and/or Weibel-Palade bodies in Bordetella perfussis toxin-induced hypersensitivity to histamine, a subphenotype of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, the principal autoimmune model of multiple sclerosis. No significant differences in susceptibility to histamine between wild-type and VWFKO mice were detected after 3 days; however, histamine sensitivity persisted significantly longer in VWFKO mice. Correspondingly, encephalomyelitis onset was earlier, disease was more severe, and blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability was significantly increased in VWFKO mice, as compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, inflammation was selectively increased in the brains, but not spinal cords, of VWFKO mice as compared with wild-type mice. Early increases in BBB permeability in VWFKO mice were not due to increased encephalitogenic T-cell activity since BBB permeability did not differ in adjuvant-treated VWFKO mice as compared with littermates immunized with encephalitogenic peptide plus adjuvant. Taken together, these data indicate that VWF and/or Weibel-Palade bodies negatively regulate BBB permeability changes and autoimmune inflammatory lesion formation within the brain elicited by peripheral inflammatory stimuli.

A comparison between ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block using the "double bubble" sign and neurostimulation-guided axillary block	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							BRACHIAL-PLEXUS BLOCK; SUCCESS RATE; STIMULATION; ANESTHESIA	BACKGROUND: Ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block can be performed using the double bubble sign. Previously described, the double bubble sign consists superiorly of the axillary artery (in short axis) superimposed on an inferior bubble created by local anesthetic injection. In this study, we compared this new method of brachial plexus anesthesia to the traditional triple-nerve stimulation axillary block. METHODS: Seventy patients were randomized to receive a single-injection, ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block using the double bubble sign or a triple-stimulation axillary block. RESULTS: Both methods produced similar Success rates (89%-91%). However, infraclavicular blocks were associated with a shorter performance time (3.90 +/- 2.27 vs 8.03 +/- 3.92 min; P < 0.001) and lower block-related pain scores (2.70 +/- 2.02 vs 4.17 +/- 2.57 on a 0-10 scale; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared to triple-stimulation axillary block, ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block using the double bubble sign provided a similar efficacy, a shorter performance time and lower procedural pain scores.

However, the nutritional benefit from omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) may offset the deleterious effects of mercury. Increased n-3 FA have been associated with lower rates of mood disorders. The authors examined neuropsychiatric symptoms among 243 freshwater fish-eaters, with low serum n-3 FA (median = 0.11 mg/mL) and low mercury exposure (median in blood and hair = 2.22 and 0.54 mu g/g). They assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms with the Brief Symptom Inventory. The results did not show the expected inverse association between serum n-3 FA and neuropsychiatric symptoms. For men who consumed more than 130 g of alcohol per week, the authors observed a positive association between serum n-3 FA and neuropsychiatric symptoms, possibly reflecting an alcohol-related release of n-3 FA from membranes into blood. They observed a positive relation between hair mercury and neuropsychiatric symptoms solely for women, suggesting that men may respond differently to mercury.

For malignant gliomas, paclitaxel is prevented from reaching its target by the presence of the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood-brain barrier. We investigated the utilization of a new drug delivery system to increase brain delivery of paclitaxel. Experimental approach: Paclitaxel molecules were conjugated to a brain peptide vector, Angiopep-2, to provide a paclitaxel Angiopep-2 conjugate named ANG1005. We determined the brain uptake capacity, intracellular effects and antitumour properties of ANG1005 in vitro against human tumour cell lines and in vivo in human xenografts. We then determined ANG1005 activity on brain tumours with intracerebral human tumour models in nude mice. Key results: We show by in situ brain perfusion that ANG1005 enters the brain to a greater extent than paclitaxel and bypasses the P-gp. ANG1005 has an antineoplastic potency similar to that of paclitaxel against human cancer cell lines. We also demonstrate that ANG1005 caused a more potent inhibition of human tumour xenografts than paclitaxel. Finally, ANG1005 administration led to a significant increase in the survival of mice with intracerebral implantation of U87 MG glioblastoma cells or NCI-H460 lung carcinoma cells. Conclusions and implications: These results demonstrate the antitumour potential of a new drug, ANG1005, and establish that conjugation of anticancer agents with the Angiopep-2 peptide vector could increase their efficacy in the treatment of brain cancer.

However, situations may arise where confounding factors make this clinical assessment difficult or impossible. As a result, ancillary tests have been developed in order to aid in the confirmation of brain death. AS assessment of neuronal electrical activity; electroencephalography (EEG) is no longer recommended in this determination, tools assessing cerebral perfusion, as reflected by the presence or absence of cerebral blood flow (CBF), are the mainstay of NDD. The preferred ancillary test currently is Hexamethylpropylene amine oxime-single photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT) radionuclide angiography. When this is not available, or is equivocal, 4-vessel cerebral angiography can be used to determine the presence or absence of intracranial blood flow. However, as cerebral angiography has its own limitations, other techniques are sought by physicians in the Intensive Care and Neuro-intensive Care settings to replace cerebral angiography. In this article, we briefly review the history of diagnosis of brain death, pathophysiologic issues in making this determination, and currently available CBF imaging techniques, discussing each in turn with respect to their utility in the diagnosis of brain death.

Because repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has the potential to modulate neural network activity, several studies have explored its use in treating medication-resistant AH, with mixed results in small-to-medium patient samples. Our aim is to apply a metaanalytic approach to exploring the efficacy of rTMS in treating medication-resistant AH. Method: A search of the electronic databases for studies comparing low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS over the left temporoparietal cortex to sham stimulation in patients suffering from medication-resistant AH was performed. Our search was completed by cross-referencing the articles, searching the Cur-rent Controlled Trials website, and direct contact with relevant researchers. Results: From 265 possible abstracts, 6 parallel-arm, double-blind placebo-controlled and 4 crossover controlled trials, all randomized, matched the inclusion and exclusion criteria (n = 232). The primary outcome measure (effect of active treatment on AH at the end of the treatment) was tested with a random effect model and reached a significant homogeneous ES estimate (Hedges' g = 0.514; P = 0.001; 95 CI%, 0.225 to 0.804; Q = 13.022; P = 0.162). Conclusions: We found that low-frequency rTMS over the left temporoparietal cortex has a medium ES action on medication-resistant AH. This result has implications for understanding the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms (specifically AH) and supports the use of rTMS as a complementary treatment approach in patients suffering from treatment-resistant AH.

The expression of miRNA is deregulated in many types of cancers. To determine whether genetic alterations in miRNA genes are associated with cancers, we have systematically screened sequence variations in several hundred human miRNAs from > 100 human tumor tissues and 20 cancer cell lines. We identified 8 new single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 14 novel mutations (or very rare SNPs) that specifically present in human cancers. These mutations/SNPs are distributed in the regions of pri-, pre- and even mature miRNAs, respectively. Importantly, whereas most of the mutations did not exert detectable effects on miRNA function, a G -> A mutation at 19 nt downstream of miRNA let-7e led to a significant reduction of its expression in vivo, indicating that miRNA mutation could contribute to tumorigenesis. These data suggest that further screening for genetic variations in miRNA genes from a wide variety of human cancers should increase the discovery and identification of molecular diagnostic and therapeutic targets and complement the mutation analysis of consensus coding sequences in human cancers.

Cortical structure was estimated with several measures (cortical volume, surface area, and thickness, sulcal depth, and absolute mean curvature in sulcal regions and sulcal walls) using three-dimensional surface-based methods in 148 normal subjects (n [men/women]: 83/65, age [mean +/- standard deviation]: 25.0 +/- 4.9 years). We found significantly larger scaling exponents than geometrically predicted for cortical surface area, absolute mean curvature in sulcal regions and in sulcal walls, and smaller ones for cortical volume and thickness. As brain size increases, the cortex thickens only slightly, but the degree of sulcal convolution increases dramatically, indicating that human cortices are not simply scaled versions of one another. Our results are consistent with previous hypotheses that greater local clustering of interneuronal connections would be required in a larger brain, and fiber tension between local cortical areas would induce cortical folds. We suggest that sex effects are explained by brain size effects in cortical structure at a macroscopic and lobar regional level, and that it is necessary to consider true relationships between cortical measures and brain size due to the limitations of linear stereotaxic normalization.

Its effects may be mediated not only by its hypertensive properties but also by its neurohumoral influences independent of blood pressure (BP). Objective: The present study aimed to simultaneously characterize the effects of midodrine on BP, plasma catecholamines, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and power spectral analysis of heart rate (HR) in healthy volunteers. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind, 2-period, crossover study in which a single, oral, 5-mg dose of midodrine was compared with placebo. The washout period between midodrine and placebo was 1 week. The study parameters included plasma DGM (as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]); systolic and diastolic BP (as measured with an oscillometric monitor); HR; plasma catecholamines (measured by HPLC); plasma ANP, also known as venous return (measured by a radioimmunoassay); and low- and high-frequency HR variation (calculated from computerized 5-minute electro-cardiographic recordings). All study parameters were measured simultaneously 12 times just before and over a period of 8 hours after drug administration. Results: Fifteen healthy nonsmoking male subjects (14 white, 1. black; mean [SD] age, 28.6 [4.7] years; weight, 74.5 [16.4] kg; seated BP, 109.9 [9.0]/73.6 [9.5] mm Hg; seated HR, 63.8 [8.4] bpm) were randomized. No significant effects of midodrine on BP were observed. At C-max, midodrine decreased norepinephrine from 188.4 (30.6) to 162.5 (29.8) pg/mL (P = 0.011) and HR from 57.2 (7.3) to 54.9 (6.6) bpm (P = 0.022). A significant correlation was found between DGM concentration and HR (p = -0.61; P = 0.014). A DGM-related increase in plasma ANP (+29.6 [90.0] fmoL/mL) was observed. Conclusion: This study in healthy male volunteers found that midodrine has sympatholytic influences that are independent of BP but related to augmented venous return.

After the lesion. each of the 244 cases presented at least one of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) symptoms of a manic episode, namely, elated Or irritable mood, grandiosity, talkativeness, flight of ideas, hyperhedonism, reduced need for sleep, agitation, or distractibility (all optional in DSM-IV). As expected, file subgroup of 59 manic patients had a right hemisphere lesion far more often than a left one. However, this was also true of various sets of the nonmanic cases. Furthermore, elation was not the symptom most strongly associated with lesion side. Elation without mania was not significantly predicted by lesion side. However, talkativeness Was strongly predicted by right lesion side whether in manic or nonmanic patients or even when the symptom Was the only Symptom observed. Agitation was consistently and robustly associated with right lesion side, but not completely distinctly so (it fell short of significance when not accompanied by elation or other symptoms). It is proposed that prevalence of right hemisphere lesions causing mania is Primarily related to mental and behavioral disinhibition rather than a shift of mood and that it consists of release of left hemisphere influence.

Rho inhibition recruits DCC to the neuronal plasma membrane and enhances axon chemoattraction to netrin 1	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						axon guidance; DCC; ROCK; PRK; C3; Y27632; regeneration; growth cone; Rho GTPases; rat	FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS; BINDING PROTEIN RHO; NERVE GROWTH CONES; IN-VIVO; SUBSTRATE ADHESION; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; ACTIVATING RHO; POINT CONTACTS; FAMILY GTPASES	Molecular cues, such as netrin 1, guide axons by influencing growth cone motility. Rho GTPases are a family of intracellular proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton, substrate adhesion and vesicle trafficking. Activation of the RhoA subfamily of Rho GTPases is essential for chemorepellent axon guidance; however, their role during axonal chemoattraction is unclear. Here, we show that netrin 1, through its receptor DCC, inhibits RhoA in embryonic spinal commissural neurons. To determine whether netrin 1-mediated chemoattraction requires Rho function, we inhibited Rho signaling and assayed axon outgrowth and turning towards netrin 1. Additionally, we examined two important mechanisms that influence the guidance of axons to netrin 1: substrate adhesion and transport of the netrin receptor DCC to the plasma membrane. We found that inhibiting Rho signaling increased plasma membrane DCC and adhesion to substrate-bound netrin 1, and also enhanced netrin 1-mediated axon outgrowth and chemoattractive axon turning. Conversely, overexpression of RhoA or constitutively active RhoA inhibited axonal responses to netrin 1. These findings provide evidence that Rho signaling reduces axonal chemoattraction to netrin 1 by limiting the amount of plasma membrane DCC at the growth cone, and suggest that netrin 1-mediated inhibition of RhoA activates a positive-feedback mechanism that facilitates chemoattraction to netrin 1. Notably, these findings also have relevance for CNS regeneration research. Inhibiting RhoA promotes axon regeneration by disrupting inhibitory responses to myelin and the glial scar. By contrast, we demonstrate that axon chemoattraction to netrin 1 is not only maintained but enhanced, suggesting that this might facilitate directing regenerating axons to appropriate targets.

The comparative characterization of 'tool' compounds in different paradigms demonstrates that estrogen-mediated CNS effects are discernible before the manifestation of changes in primary target organs. Agonist activity at, and recruitment of the coactivator SRC-1 by, the estrogen receptor a accurately reflect peripheral, but not neurotrophic, efficacy. Interaction with, and SRC-1 recruitment at, the estrogen receptor beta appears to be an essential prerequisite for pronounced CNS effects. Monitoring of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenal axis activity and the differential organ-specific induction of estrogen-responsive proteins are helpful for early delineation of CNS efficacy. Behavioral and antioxidant efficacy are useful confirmatory readouts, with limited roles in lead selection. Finally, an algorithm for the identification of estrogens with a neurotrophic profile can be generated by assigning 'performance grades' in a multifarious test array.

Maternal factors implicated in fetal bradycardia after combined spinal epidural for labour pain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						anaesthesia obstetrical; anaesthesia spinal; maternal factors; age; pain; bradycardia; fetus	HEART-RATE ABNORMALITIES; INTRATHECAL OPIOIDS; CESAREAN DELIVERY; CONTROLLED TRIAL; ANALGESIA; FENTANYL; SUFENTANIL	Background and objective: Combined spinal epidural analgesia is effective for fast relief of severe labour pain but has been associated with worrisome decreases in fetal heart rate. Since the reasons for this phenomenon remain elusive, some anaesthesiologists may abstain from using this technique. We postulated that factors unrelated to the neuraxial technique could play a role in the decrease in fetal heart rate. To our knowledge, no prospective study has previously looked into this possibility. Methods: We collected prospective data on 223 consecutive patients who received combined spinal epidural analgesia (123) or epidural analgesia (100). Maternal blood pressure, analogue pain scores, exogenous infusion of oxytocin, cervical dilatation, maternal age, parity and ethnicity were collected and correlated with the occurrence of decreases in fetal heart rate post combined spinal epidural. Results: Univariate analysis showed a correlation between the incidence of fetal bradycardia and higher maternal pain scores, older maternal age, and combined spinal epidural analgesia. Multivariate analysis revealed that only pain scores and maternal age were independent predictors of fetal bradycardia post neuraxial blockade. Conclusions: Maternal pain scores and older maternal age are factors unrelated to the neuraxial technique that are independent predictors of fetal bradycardia after neuraxial analgesia for labour.

Here we compare their basic physiological characteristics and synaptic inputs from the peri-trigeminal area (PeriV) to those of motoneurons using whole-cell recordings made with pipettes containing biocytin in brainstem slices of rats that had a tracer injected into their masseters. Values for input resistance, spike duration and overall duration of afterhyperpolarization (AHP) were greater for interneurons than for motoneurons. Some interneurons (44%) and motoneurons (33%) had an outward rectification during depolarization. Hyperpolarization-induced inward rectification was seen predominantly in interneurons (85% vs. 31% for motoneurons). Few interneurons (15%) showed depolarization and time-dependent firing frequency accommodation, while half (52%) of the motoneurons did. Rebound excitation at the offset of hyperpolarization was more common in interneurons than in motoneurons (62% vs. 34%). Both populations received synaptic inputs from PeriV. These inputs were predominantly excitatory and were mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamatergic receptors. Response latencies and rise times of the evoked potentials were longer in interneurons than in motoneurons, suggesting that some of the inputs to interneurons could be polysynaptic and/or occurring at distal dendritic locations. Miniature synaptic events could be seen in about half of the neurons in both populations. These results suggest that interneurons can be clearly distinguished from motoneurons on the basis of some electrophysiological properties like the input resistance and spike and AHP durations, and the kinetics of their synaptic inputs from adjacent areas.

They are required for purine and pyrimidine, and thus DNA synthesis, as well as for the remethylation of homocysteine into methionine which is further metabolized into S-adenosylmethionine, the universal methyl donor for transmethylation of DNA. By this way, folates play a key role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Folate deficiency, either by insufficient nutritional uptake or linked to some single nucleotide polymorphism, will lead to an impaired DNA synthesis and repair, a hypomethylation of DNA and other molecules, and homocysteine accumulation. This situation has been associated with several pathologies, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and pregnancy complications. However, much less is known until now about the impact of one-carbon metabolism on initial events of human reproduction, from gametogenesis to early embryonic development. The present review will deal with these aspects of folate metabolism with respect to male and female fertility. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tons droits reserves.

Chronic maternal stress affects growth, behaviour and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function in juvenile offspring	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						prenatal stress; hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis; locomotor activity; guinea pigs; programming	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; GUINEA-PIG PUPS; PRENATAL STRESS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; NEUROENDOCRINE RESPONSES; CORTICOSTEROID RECEPTORS; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSORS; ANTENATAL ANXIETY; SALIVARY CORTISOL; INFANT-MORTALITY	Maternal stress during pregnancy, particularly that combined with low socioeconomic status (SES), has been linked to an increased Fisk for impaired behavioural and emotional development and affective disorders in children. In animal models, acute periods of prenatal stress have profound effects on hypothalamo--pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function and behaviour. However, few studies have determined the impact of chronic exposure to stress in animal models. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of chronic maternal stress (CMS) during the 2nd half of pregnancy and nursing on growth, locomotor behaviour and HPA axis function in juvenile guinea pig offspring. Pregnant guinea pigs were exposed to a random combination of variable stressors every other day over the 2nd half of gestation and from postnatal day (pnd) 1 until weaning (pnd25). CMS mothers displayed increased basal salivary cortisol levels in the later stages of pregnancy compared to control mothers (p<0.05). The male offspring of CMS mothers had a lower bodyweight, which was maintained to weaning (p<0.01). In open-field testing, CMS male offspring showed a decrease in activity compared to controls (p<0.05). There was no effect of CMS on bodyweight or activity in female offspring. In contrast, both male and female offspring born to CMS mothers displayed increased (p<0.05) basal salivary cortisol at pnd25, but a blunted adrenocortical response to exposure to the novel open-field enclosure. In conclusion, CMS leads to modification of growth trajectory, locomotor activity and adrenocortical responses to stress in juvenile offspring. Further, males appear considerably more vulnerable to these effects than females. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Als2 mRNA splicing variants detected in KO mice rescue severe motor dysfunction phenotype in Als2 knock-down zebrafish	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR; HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARALYSIS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE GENE; ENDOSOME TRAFFICKING; ALS2-DEFICIENT MICE; CLINICAL-FEATURES; MISSENSE MUTATION; CELLS; RAB5	Recessive ALS2 mutations are linked to three related but slightly different neurodegenerative disorders: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia and primary lateral sclerosis. To investigate the function of the ALS2 encoded protein, we generated Als2 knock-out (KO) mice and zAls2 knock-down zebrafish. The Als2 2/2 mice lacking exon 2 and part of exon 3 developed mild signs of neurodegeneration compatible with axonal transport deficiency. In contrast, zAls2 knock-down zebrafish had severe developmental abnormalities, swimming deficits and motor neuron perturbation. We identified, by RT-PCR, northern and western blotting novel Als2 transcripts in mouse central nervous system. These Als2 transcripts were present in Als2 null mice as well as in wild-type littermates and some rescued the zebrafish phenotype. Thus, we speculate that the newly identified Als2 mRNA species prevent the Als2 KO mice from developing severe neurodegenerative disease and might also regulate the severity of the motor neurons phenotype observed in ALS2 patients.

HMSN/ACC truncation mutations disrupt brain-type creatine kinase-dependant activation of K(+)/Cl(-) co-transporter 3	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CELL-VOLUME REGULATION; K+-CL-COTRANSPORTER; ATP RELEASE; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; KCC3; RECEPTORS; CLONING; IDENTIFICATION; METABOLISM; ASTROCYTES	The potassium-chloride co-transporter 3 (KCC3) is mutated in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC); however, the molecular mechanisms of HMSN/ACC pathogenesis and the exact role of KCC3 in the development of the nervous system remain poorly understood. The functional regulation of this transporter by protein partners is also largely unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we discovered that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of KCC3, which is lost in most HMSN/ACC-causing mutations, directly interacts with brain-specific creatine kinase (CK-B), an ATP-generating enzyme that is also a partner of KCC2. The interaction of KCC3 with CK-B was further confirmed by in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, followed by sequencing of the pulled-down complexes. In transfected cultured cells, immunofluorescence labeling showed that CK-B co-localizes with wild-type KCC3, whereas the kinase fails to interact with the inactive truncated KCC3. Finally, CK-B's inhibition by DNFB results in reduction of activity of KCC3 in functional assays using Xenopus laevis oocytes. This physical and functional association between the co-transporter and CK-B is, therefore, the first protein-protein interaction identified to be potentially involved in the pathophysiology of HMSN/ACC.

Network inference from co-occurrences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm; graphical models; importance sampling; Markov models; network inference; network tomography	CARLO EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION; EM ALGORITHM; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; CONVERGENCE	The discovery of networks is a fundamental problem arising in numerous fields of science and technology, including communication systems, biology, sociology, and neuroscience. Unfortunately, it is often difficult, or impossible, to obtain data that directly reveal network structure, and so one must infer a network from incomplete data. This paper considers inferring network structure from "co-occurrence" data: observations that identify which network components (e.g., switches, routers, genes) carry each transmission but do not indicate the order in which they handle the transmission. Without order information, the number of networks that are consistent with the data grows exponentially with the size of the network (i.e., the number of nodes). Yet, the basic engineering/evolutionary principles underlying most networks strongly suggest that not all data-consistent networks are equally likely. In particular, nodes that co-occur in many observations are probably closely connected. With this in mind, we model the co-occurrence observations as independent realizations of a random walk on the network, subjected to a random permutation to account for the lack of order information. Treating permutations as missing data, we derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the random walk parameters. The model and EM algorithm significantly simplify the problem, but the computational complexity of the reconstruction process does grow exponentially in the length of each transmission path. For networks with long paths, the exact E-step may be computationally intractable. We propose a polynomial-time Monte Carlo EM algorithm based on importance sampling and derive conditions that ensure convergence of the algorithm with high probability. Simulations and experiments with Internet measurements demonstrate the promise of this approach.

J	Cole, C				Cole, Charles			A socio-cognitive framework for designing interactive IR systems: Lessons from the Neanderthals	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Neanderthals; information retrieval; cognitive information retrieval; information retrieval model; evolutionary psychology; enhanced working memory; decoding; encoding	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; INFORMATION-SEEKING RESEARCH; RETRIEVAL; BEHAVIOR; INTELLIGENCE; DIFFERENCE; ATTENTION; SEARCH	The article analyzes user-IR system interaction from the broad, socio-cognitive perspective of lessons we can learn about human brain evolution when we compare the Neanderthal brain to the human brain before and after a small human brain mutation is hypothesized to have occurred 35,000-75,000 years ago. The enhanced working memory mutation enabled modern humans (i) to decode unfamiliar environmental stimuli with greater focusing power on adaptive solutions to environmental changes and problems, and (ii) to encode environmental stimuli in more efficient, generative knowledge structures. A sociological theory of these evolving, more efficient encoding knowledge structures is given. These new knowledge structures instilled in humans not only the ability to adapt to and Survive novelty and/or changing conditions in the environment, but they also instilled an imperative to do so. Present day IR systems ignore the encoding imperative in their design framework. To correct for this lacuna, we propose the evolutionary-based socio-cognitive framework model for designing interactive IR systems. A case study is given to illustrate the functioning of the model.

Method: A neuropsychological battery assessing attention, mental control, perceptual-motor skills, executive functions, verbal fluency, abstraction and visuo-spatial attention was administered to 70 remitted bipolar patients and 50 healthy controls. Insight was assessed using the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder; Quality of Life was assessed using the Portuguese version of the WHO Quality of Life Assessment - Abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF-PT). Results: No differences in QoL and cognitive performance were observed between bipolar patients with 'impaired' and 'preserved' insight. Insight was found to be correlated with poorer psychological and environmental QoL. A multiple regression model showed that depressive symptoms were significant predictors of physical, psychological and environmental QoL. Conclusion: The present study adds to the notion that depressive symptoms, even of low intensity, are strong predictors of QoL. The present study suggests that the impact of insight on self-reported QoL may be subtle during remission and may be more substantially affected in the presence of manic symptoms.

D decreased systolic blood pressure and body and heart weights. Left ventricular diastolic diameter was increased by D (P < 0.01) but it was not attenuated by P. D decreased plasma vitamin C (P < 0.05) it id increased the ascorbyl radical/vitamin C ratio (P < 0.01). This ratio was attenuated by P. No difference was found among groups in cardiac troponin I, brain natriuretic peptide concentrations. and tissue oxidative stress (OS). Myocardial MCP-1 expression was higher in the D group. Cardiac kinin receptor (B1R and B2R) expression was not affected by D, yet binding sites for B2R and B1R were increased in D+P and P groups, respectively (P < 0.05). 111 conclusion, D induced cardiac functional alterations, inflammation and plasma OS whereas tissue OS, and cardiac kinin receptors expression were not modified. P did not improve cardiac performance, but it modulated kinin receptor expression and enhanced antioxidant defense.

Objectives: We aimed to screen a large cohort of patients with Kallmann syndrome (KS) and normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) for mutations in PROK2/PROKR2, evaluate their prevalence, define the genotype/phenotype relationship, and assess the functionality of these mutant alleles in vitro. Design: Sequencing of the PROK2 and PROKR2 genes was performed in 170 KS patients and 154 nIHH. Mutations were examined using early growth response 1-luciferase assays in HEK 293 cells and aequorin assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Results: Four heterozygous and one homozygous PROK2 mutation (p. A24P, p. C34Y, p. I50M, p. R73C, and p. I55fsX1) were identified in five probands. Four probands had KS and one nIHH, and all had absent puberty. Each mutant peptide impaired receptor signaling in vitro except the I50M. There were 11 patients who carried a heterozygous PROKR2 mutation (p. R85C, p. Y113H, p. V115M, p. R164Q, p. L173R, p. W178S, p. S188L, p. R248Q, p. V331M, and p. R357W). Among them, six had KS, four nIHH, and one KS proband carried both a PROKR2 (p. V115M) and PROK2 (p. A24P) mutation. Reproductive phenotypes ranged from absent to partial puberty to complete reversal of GnRH deficiency after discontinuation of therapy. All mutant alleles appear to decrease intracellular calcium mobilization; seven exhibited decreased MAPK signaling, and six displayed decreased receptor expression. Nonreproductive phenotypes included fibrous dysplasia, sleep disorder, synkinesia, and epilepsy. Finally, considerable variability was evident in family members with the same mutation, including asymptomatic carriers. Conclusion: Loss-of-function mutations in PROK2 and PROKR2 underlie both KS and nIHH.

D. (2007). Effects of verbal working memory deficits on metaphor comprehension in patients with Parkinson's disease. Brain (aid Language, 101, 80-89]. Thirteen PD patients and a matched group of 16 healthy control (HQ participants performed the Discourse Comprehension Test [Brookshire, R. H., & Nicholas, L. E. (1993). Discourse comprehension lest. Tucson, AZ: Communication Skill Builders], a standardized test which evaluates the ability to generate inferences based on explicit or implied information relating to main ideas or details presented in short stories. initial analyses revealed that the PD group as a whole was significantly less accurate than the HC group when comprehension questions pertained to implied as opposed to explicit information in the stories, consistent with previous findings [Murray, L. L., & Stout, J. C. (1999). Discourse comprehension in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 8, 137-148]. However, subsequent analyses showed that only a subgroup of PD patients with WM deficits. and not PD patients with WM capacity within the control group range, were significantly impaired for drawing inferences (especially predictive inferences about implied details in the stories) when compared to the control group. These results build oil a growing body of literature, which demonstrates that compromise of frontal-striatal systems and subsequent reductions in processing/WM capacity in PD are a major source of pragmatic-language deficits in many PD patients.

Understanding speaker attitudes from prosody by adults with Parkinson's disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; EMOTIONAL PROSODY; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; REDUCED SENSITIVITY; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; BASAL GANGLIA; BRAIN-DAMAGE; DEFICITS; SPEECH; RECOGNITION	The ability to interpret vocal (prosodic) cues during social interactions can be disrupted by Parkinson's disease, with notable effects on how emotions are understood from speech. This study investigated whether PD patients who have emotional prosody deficits exhibit further difficulties decoding the attitude of a speaker from prosody. Vocally inflected but semantically nonsensical 'pseudo-utterances' were presented to listener groups with and without PD in two separate rating tasks. Task I required participants to rate how confident a speaker sounded from their voice and Task 2 required listeners to rate how polite the speaker sounded for a comparable set of pseudo-utterances. The results showed that PD patients were significantly less able than HC participants to use prosodic cues to differentiate intended levels of speaker confidence in speech, although the patients could accurately detect the polite/impolite attitude of the speaker from prosody in most cases. Our data suggest that many PD patients fail to use vocal cues to effectively infer a speaker's emotions as well as certain attitudes in speech such as confidence, consistent with the idea that the basal ganglia play a role in the meaningful processing of prosodic sequences in spoken language (Pell & Leonard, 2003).

Lund, and A.G. Hannam. The 6 presentations paying tribute to Sessle spanned the period from the earl), phase of his career up to some of his most recent studies with colleagues in Asia, Europe, and Australia as well as Canada. The studies have included those providing an improved understanding of the cortical control of sensory inputs in pain perception (presented by R. Dubner) and in the control of mastication and swallowing, as well as brainstem mechanisms of orofacial pain (K. Iwata, G. Murray). His current activities in his laboratory and in Denmark, are also highlighted (L. Avivi-Arber, P. Svensson). The potential transfer of basic research discoveries toward drug development in pain control that stem from some of his research is also described (B. Cairns). The final section of the paper includes a commentary from Professor Sessle.

Lund	JOURNAL OF OROFACIAL PAIN			English	Biographical-Item						mastication; orofacial movements; pain; trigeminal system		This tribute article to Professor James P. L and sterns from 6 of the presentations delivered at the July 1, 2008, symposium that honored 3 "giants" in orofacial neuroscience: B.J. Sessle, A. G. Hannam, and J. P. Lund. It was noted that soon after his training as a dentist in Australia, Jim Lund became interested in research. At the time he decided to do a PhD, there was a lot of discussion about how rhythmic movements were programmed. The early belief, based on Sherrington's studies of motor systems, was that these movements were simply an alternating series of reflexes. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, some still shared this belief, whereas others favored Graham Brown's hypothesis that repetitive movements were centrally programmed and did not depend on reflexes triggered by sensory inputs. There was no strong evidence then for either scenario except for the rhythmic movements of respiration. Lund's pioneering work during his PhD proved the existence of a central pattern generator (CPG) for mastication in the brainstem. Since then he has been interested in understanding how CPGs function and how sensory feedback works to adjust the motor patterns that they produce. Sections in this tribute article to Lund are written by some of his close collaborators and reflect the evolution of his work throughout the years. The first 4 presentations in this article (by K.-G. Westberg, D. McFarland, A. Kolta, and C. Stohler) highlight various aspects of these interests, and the final 2 presentations (by J. Feine and A. Woda) focus especially on clinical aspects of Lund's interests. The last section of this article is a final commentary from Professor Lund. I OROFAC. PAIN 2008;22:297-306.

The objective of our study was to analyze BDNF in lithium-responsive patients with bipolar disorder (BD) to further understand the role of BDNF in the pathophysiology of BD. Methods: Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured transformed B lymphocytes for BDNF protein. Results: BDNF levels were 36% lower in lymphoblasts from patients with BD (n = 12), compared with matched control participants (n = 13), and 55% lower when compared with their unaffected relatives (n = 14). Lithium significantly decreased BDNF levels in patients with BD and healthy control participants, although BDNF levels remained lower (33%) in the BID group posttreatment. Conclusion: Decreased BDNF may constitute part of the pathophysiologic process of BID in a lithium-responsive subgroup of individuals with this disease. A compensatory mechanism protecting the genetically predisposed unaffected relatives from phenotypic expression of BID is suggested.	[Young, L.

Method: Subjects were eightynine 51/2-year-old children whose mothers were pregnant during a natural disaster: the January 1998 ice storm crisis in the Canadian province of Quebec that resulted in power losses for 3 million people for as long as 40 days. In June 1998, women completed several questionnaires including those about the extent of objective stress (Storm32) and subjective distress (impact of Events Scale-Revised) experienced due to the storm. Their children were assessed with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (IQ) and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (language) at 51/2 years of age, and mothers completed assessments of recent life events and psychological functioning. Results: Children exposed in utero to high levels of objective stress had lower Full Scale IQs, Verbal IQs, and language abilities compared to children exposed to low or moderate levels of objective prenatal maternal stress; there were no effects of subjective stress or objective stress on Performance IQs. Trend analyses show that for all outcome variables except Block Design, there was a significant curvilinear association between objective stress and functioning. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to a moderately severe natural disaster is associated with lower cognitive and language abilities at 51/2 years of age.

To support this contention, we have demonstrated the presence and synthesis of OT receptors in all heart compartments and the vasculature. The functionality of these receptors has been established by the ability of OT to induce atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide (NO) release from the perfused heart and atrial slices. OT's cardiovascular actions include natriuresis, blood pressure reduction, negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, parasympathetic neuromodulation, as well as vasodilatation triggered by the NO pathway that is also involved in endothelial cell growth and anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, we have reported the abundance of the OT system in the early developing heart and OT's capacity to generate cardiomyocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells. The most potent inducer of cardiac differentiation, OT-Gly-Lys-Arg, is an extended form of OT that is abundantly expressed in the fetal heart. Therefore, in pathological conditions, OT plays an anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective role, improving vascular and metabolic functions; it has potential for therapeutic use.

Both in the clinic and in experimental settings, distraction has been shown to reduce pain. Further, negative emotions increase pain, whereas positive emotions have the opposite effect. Other more complex psychological states alter the way we feel pain. For instance, empathy for another person who is suffering increases our own pain experience, and expectation of pain relief underlies much of the placebo effect. Neuroimaging studies show a physiological basis for psychological pain modulation, with activity in pain pathways altered by attentional state, positive and negative emotions, empathy and the administration of a placebo. The same psychological factors activate intrinsic modulatory systems in the brain, including those stimulated when opiates are given for pain relief. It is important for the dentist and patients to understand the influence of psychological state on pain transmission. Such an understanding will not only help patients learn how to participate in their own pain control, but will also help the clinician create a fostering environment.	[Bushnell, M.

The present study was aimed at the measurement of dopamine D(2) binding sites in cirrhotic patients by positron emission tomography (PET) using (11)C-N-methylspiperone as ligand. The regions of interest (ROI) were designated on a three-dimensional stereotaxic ROI template (3DSRT). The pixel values of twelve ROIs corrected by the pixel value of the cerebellum after 80 min static scanning were used to quantitate changes in binding. D(2) binding sites were significantly decreased in the hippocampus and thalamus of cirrhotic patients and were positively correlated with serum bilirubin levels and Child-Pugh scores and were negatively correlated with prothrombin times (thalamus). Loss of D(2) sites was greater in thalamus and hippocampus of alcoholic cirrhotics compared to non-alcoholics. Statistically significant correlations were also observed between D(2) binding sites in hippocampus, thalamus and lenticular nuclei and history of overt encephalopathy. These findings suggest that D(2) receptor binding in some regions of brain in cirrhotic patients is influenced by factors such as the severity of liver damage and history of alcohol dependency or overt encephalopathy. Alterations of D(2) receptor sites indicative of dopaminergic synaptic dysfunction could play an important role in the pathogenesis of the cognitive and motor disturbances associated with chronic liver failure.

As a zoonotic agent, S. suis also causes similar diseases in humans. Binding of pathogenic bacteria to extracellular matrix components enhances their adhesion to and invasion of host cells. In the present study we isolated and identified a novel fibronectin-binding protein from S. suis. The native protein (designated SsEno) possessed not only high homology with other bacterial enolases but also enolase activity. We cloned, expressed and purified SsEno and showed that it is ubiquitously expressed by all S. suis serotypes and we identified its surface localization using immunoelectron microscopy. ELISA demonstrated that SsEno binds specifically to fibronectin and plasminogen in a lysine-dependent manner. Additional surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that SsEno binds to fibronectin or plasminogen with low nanomolar affinity. Inhibition experiments with anti-SsEno antibodies also showed that bacterial SsEno is important for the adhesion to and invasion of brain microvascular endothelial cells by S. suis. Overall, the present work is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a fibronectin-binding activity of a bacterial enolase, and shows that, similar to other bacterial fibronectin-binding proteins, SsEno may contribute to the virulence of S. suis.

We now know that some brain areas, particularly the frontal cortex, continue to develop well beyond childhood. There are two main changes with puberty. First, there is an increase in axonal myelination, which increases transmission speed. Second, there is a gradual decrease in synaptic density, indicating significant pruning of connections. These neural changes make it likely that cognitive abilities relying on the frontal cortex, such as executive functions and social-cognitive abilities, also change during adolescence. Here, we review recent research that has demonstrated development during adolescence of a variety of social-cognitive abilities and their neural correlates.

Characterization of the null murine sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter 1 (Smit1 or Slc5a3) phenotype: Myo-inositol rescue is independent of expression of its cognate mitochondrial ribosomal protein subunit 6 (Mrps6) gene and of phosphatidylinositol levels in neonatal brain	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM			English	Article						myo-inositol; phosphatidylinositol; Slc5a3 or Smit1; Mprs6; knockout; MALDI-TOF MS; central apnea; development; lithium; galactosemia	ARTHROGRYPOSIS MULTIPLEX CONGENITA; DOWN-SYNDROME; LITHIUM; MONOPHOSPHATASE; IDENTIFICATION; MECHANISM; HYPERTONICITY; GALACTOSEMIA; METABOLISM; PHOSPHATES	Ablation of the murine Slc5a3 gene results in severe myo-inositol (Ins) deficiency and congenital central apnea due to abnormal respiratory rhythmogenesis. The lethal knockout phenotype may be rescued by supplementing the maternal drinking water with 1% Ins. In order to test the hypothesis that Ins deficiency leads to inositide deficiencies, which are corrected by prenatal treatment, we measured the effects of Ins rescue on Ins, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and myo-inositol polyphosphate levels in brains of E18.5 knockout fetuses. As the Slc5a3 gene structure is unique in the sodium/solute cotransporter (SLC5) family, and exon 1 is shared with the mitochondrial ribosomal protein subunit 6 (Mrps6) gene, we also sought to determine whether expression of its cognate Mrps6 gene is abnormal in knockout fetuses. The mean level of Ins was increased by 92% in brains of rescued Slc5a3 knockout fetuses (0.48 versus 0.25 nmol/mg), but was still greatly reduced in comparison to wildtype (6.97 nmol/mg). The Ptdlns, InSP(5) and InsP(6) levels were normal without treatment. Mrps6 gene expression was unaffected in the E18.5 knockout fetuses. This enigmatic model is not associated with neonatal PtdIns deficiency and rescue of the phenotype may be accomplished without restoration of Ins. The biochemical mechanism that both uniformly leads to death and allows for Ins rescue remains unknown. In conclusion, in neonatal brain tissue, Mrps6 gene expression may not be contingent on function of its embedded Slc5a3 gene, while inositide deficiency may not be the mechanism of lethal apnea in null Slc5a3 mice.

In the present study, we investigated the interactions of plasma membrane phosphoinositides with P2X(1) ATP receptors and their physiological consequences. In an isolated rat mesenteric artery preparation, we observed a strong inhibition of P2X(1)-mediated constrictive responses by depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)] with the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, we provided electrophysiological evidence that lowering PI(4,5)P(2) levels with wortmannin significantly decreases P2X(1) current amplitude and recovery. Previously reported modulation of recovery of desensitized P2X(1) currents by phospholipase C-coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) metabotropic receptors was also found to be wortmannin-sensitive. Treatment with wortmannin alters the kinetics of P2X1 activation and inactivation without changing its sensitivity to ATP. The functional impact of wortmannin on P2X(1) currents could be reversed by addition of intracellular PI(4,5)P(2), but not phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and direct application of PI(4,5)P(2) to excised inside-out macropatches rescued P2X(1) currents from rundown. We showed that the proximal region of the intracellular C terminus of P2X(1) subunit directly binds to PI(4,5)P(2) and other anionic phospholipids, and we identified the basic residue Lys(364) as a critical determinant for phospholipid binding and sensitivity to wortmannin. Overall, these results indicate that PI(4,5)P(2) plays a key role in the expression of full native and heterologous P2X(1) function by regulating the amplitude, recovery, and kinetics of ionotropic ATP responses through direct receptor-lipid interactions.

Study 1 showed that trust in organismic development was distinct from optimism, neuroticism, and social desirability whereas it correlated with having relaxed expectations for developmental milestones and making fewer social comparisons about one's child. Study 2 used observational methods to demonstrate a significant link between trust in organismic development and mothers behaving in an autonomy-supportive rather than controlling manner toward their 1-year-old child during puzzle solving activities. Study 3 used a 1 year prospective design to show that trust in first time mothers was associated with better maternal and child adaptation over time, controlling for initial levels of adaptation and child temperament. Study 4 explored possible social/political antecedents of trust in organismic development by comparing the beliefs of first time mothers from Canada and Norway. The four studies suggest that trust in organismic development fosters autonomy supportive parenting practices and positive maternal and child adaptation.

Early technique failure has been a major limitation on the wider adoption of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The objectives of this study were to use data from a large, multicentre, prospective database, the United Kingdom Renal Registry (UKRR), in order to determine the ability of all artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict early PD technique failure and to compare its performance with a logistic regression (LR)-based approach. Methods. The analysis included all incident PD patients enrolled in the UKRR from 1999 to 2004. The event of interest was technique failure. For both the ANN and LR analyses a bootstrap approach was used: the data were divided into 20 random training (75%) and validation (25%) sets. Models were derived oil the latter and then used to make predictions on the former. Predictive accuracy was assessed by area under the ROC curve (AUROC). The 20 AUROC values and their standard errors were then averaged. Results. There were 3269 patients included in the analysis with a mean age of 59.9 years and a mean observation time of 430 days. Of the patients, 38.3% were female and 90.8% were Caucasian. 1458 patients (44.6%) Suffered technique failure. The AUROC for the ANN model was 0.760 +/- 0.0167 and the LR model was 0.709 and 0.0208. (P = 0.0164) Conclusions. Using UKRR data, both ANN and LR models predicted early PD technique failure with moderate accuracy. In this study, an ANN outperformed an LR-based approach. As the scope and the completeness of the UKRR increases, the question of whether more sophisticated ANN models will perform even better remains for further study.

To maintain this, all these cells must be adequately polarized, their axons capable of conducting action potentials and releasing transmitters at an even greater numbers of synapses. Hence the often dire consequences of any interruption in the normal Supply of O-2 and glucose. Initially, though both cognitive and synaptic functions are soon suppressed, membrane potentials in the brain change little - indeed, many neurons are hyperpolarized - and all these effects are fully reversible when glucose and/or O-2 supplies are restored. The early events, suppression of synaptic and cognitive function, sharply reduce the brain's needs of energy, enabling it to maintain the minimal metabolism required for survival. Even this minimum cannot be sustained for more than a few minutes: if ischemia is prolonged, a slowly progressive depolarization (mainly caused by glutamate release) suddenly accelerates owing to the activation of several inward currents. The resulting near-total depolarization and large increase in Ca2+ influx - as well as Ca2+ release from internal stores (including mitochondria) - leads to a rapid rise in cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. As long as this does not reach the critical level that triggers the irreversible processes leading to cell death, restoring energy supplies reactivates the membrane pumps that re-establish normal ionic gradients and membrane potentials, and thus make possible the return of synaptic and cognitive functions, Rapid advances in knowledge suggest a wide spectrum of agents potentially capable of delaying or even preventing irreversible outcomes of brain ischemia.

Perhaps more than any of the other disciplines that comprise the science of toxicology, it has been compelled to consider a daunting array of factors other than those directly coupled to chemical and dose, and the age and sex of the subject population. In epidemiological investigations, researchers are increasingly cognizant of the problems introduced by allegedly controlling for variables classified as confounders or covariates. In essence, they reason, the consequence is blurring or even concealing interactions of exposure with modifiers such as the individual's social ecology. Other researchers question the traditional practice of relying on values such as NOAELs when they are abstracted from a biological entity that in reality represents a multiplicity of intertwined systems. Although neurotoxicologists have come to recognize the complexities of assessing risk in all its dimensions, they still face the challenge of communicating this view to the health professions at large.

J	Mengistu, T; Ghaly, W				Mengistu, Temesgen; Ghaly, Wahid			Aerodynamic optimization of turbomachinery blades using evolutionary methods and ANN-based surrogate models	OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						artificial neural networks; genetic algorithm; computational fluid dynamics; aerodynamic design; global optimization; NURBS; response surface approximation		A fast, flexible, and robust simulation-based optimization scheme using an ANN-surrogate model was developed, implemented, and validated. The optimization method uses Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is coupled with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that uses a back propagation algorithm. The developed optimization scheme was successfully applied to single-point aerodynamic optimization of a transonic turbine stator and multi-point optimization of a NACA65 subsonic compressor rotor in two-dimensional flow, both were represented by 2D linear cascades. High fidelity CFD flow simulations, which solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations, were used in generating the data base used in building the ANN low fidelity model. The optimization objective is a weighted sum of the performance objectives and is penalized with the constraints; it was constructed so as to achieve a better aerodynamic performance at the design point or over the full operating range by reshaping the blade profile. The latter is represented using NURBS functions, whose coefficients are used as the design variables. Parallelizing the CFD flow simulations reduced the turn-around computation time at close to 100% efficiency. The ANN model was able to approximate the objective function rather accurately and to reduce the optimization computing time by ten folds. The chosen objective function and optimization methodology result in a significant and consistent improvement in blade performance.

PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA			English	Article						ketamine; intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring; selective posterior rhizotomy; anesthesia; children; train	MOTOR-EVOKED-RESPONSES; SMALL-DOSE KETAMINE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; DORSAL RHIZOTOMY; CEREBRAL-PALSY; NITROUS-OXIDE; STIMULATION; POTENTIALS; SPASTICITY; ANESTHESIA	Objective: Direct dorsal rootlet stimulation with intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring is an adjunct to clinical evaluation during selective posterior rhizotomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of ketamine on intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring during selective posterior rhizotomy. Specifically, we sought to determine if low dose ketamine given as part of the anesthesia was associated with changes in intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring in patients who underwent selective posterior rhizotomy. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using anesthetic records and electrophysiological records of 32 children who had intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring during selective posterior rhizotomy under general anesthesia. Administration and dosage of ketamine preceding the stimulation of dorsal roots was determined from the anesthetic record. A pediatric neurologist, blinded to patient, and to ketamine exposure, evaluated different electrophysiological criteria. Results: Eight children received ketamine and 24 did not receive it. The mean average dose of ketamine was 0.18 mg.kg(-1) (SD: 0.04). We did not find any statistically significant difference in intraoperative electrophysiological response between the ketamine and the control groups. However, we noted some trends: Administration of ketamine preceding the stimulation of dorsal roots was associated with a lower maximal threshold (2.7 mA vs 3.5 mA, P = 0.663) and root thresholds compared with children who did not receive ketamine. In addition, the train response following delivery of the suprastimulation tended to last longer with the presence of ketamine. Conclusions: Administration of low dose ketamine preceding the stimulation of dorsal roots during selective posterior rhizotomy might be associated with lower maximal thresholds and a more sustained train response following stimulation. Physicians should be aware of this finding in order to avoid misinterpreting intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring.

Neurotensin modulation of spontaneous EPSCs in the nucleus accumbens of Lewis and Fischer 344 rats	PEPTIDES			English	Article							EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; BRAIN; STRAINS; NEURONS; MAINTENANCE; HYPOTHERMIA; BEHAVIOR; MORPHINE	Fischer 344 (F344) and Lewis (LEW) rats are inbred strains that are differentially sensitive to drugs of abuse and that respond differently to the endogenous neuropeptide neurotensin (NT). To understand the mechanisms involved we used whole cell patch clamp recording technique to study the effects of an equimolar concentration of NT and its active analog, D-Tyr[11]neurotensin (D-NT), on the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic cur-rents (sEPSCs) in nucleus accumbens medium spiny (MS) neurons in brain slices. NT and D-NT produced an increase in the amplitude but not in the frequency of sEPSCs in all neurons tested in both F344 and LEW rats. In LEW rats, NT and D-NT produced an increase in sEPSCs of the same magnitude. In contrast, in F344 rats, D-NT produced an increase in sEPSCs that was 2.4 times larger than that of NT. Moreover, the effect Of D-NT in F344 rats was also significantly larger than that measured in LEW rats whereas NT produced an effect of the same magnitude in both strains. These results demonstrate that MS neurons in F344 rats are more responsive to the activation of NT receptors sensitive to D-NT than LEW animals. This finding parallels previous behavioral data and provides additional evidence that the NT circuitry differs in the two strains, in a brain region known to play a key role in the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse.

We recorded simultaneously electrophysiology (EEG; Compumedics, USA) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS; ISS, USA) to examine the localization of the ictal onset zone and assess language lateralization in a young epileptic boy (L.H., 10 years) as part of his pre-surgical evaluation. L.H. underwent a prolonged EEG-NIRS recording while electro-clinical and electrical seizures were recorded. Results were compared to those obtained with other pre-surgical techniques (SPECT, FDG-PET, EEG-fMRI and EEG-MEG) and showed good concordance for ictal onset zone localization. A second MRS session without EEG was carried out in order to investigate language lateralization. For this purpose, the patient performed a categorical verbal-fluency task during NIRS recordings. Results showed left-hemisphere dominance for language function in this young boy. This case report illustrates that multi-channel EEG-NIRS has the potential to contribute favourabLy to pre-surgical investigation in young patients. (C) 2008 British Epilepsy Association.

Here we explored the possibility that the degree of morphological similarities across the same cortical regions also varies as a function of this behavioral trait. Using structural magnetic-resonance (MR) images, we measured cortical thickness in a total of 295 adolescents (12 to 18 years of age). We found that inter-regional correlations in cortical thickness increased with the resistance to peer influence (RPI) this was especially the case, in female adolescents, in the premotor and prefrontal networks. We also observed significant differences between the adolescents with high and low RPI scores in their general intelligence and the scores of positive youth development. We suggest that these morphological findings might reflect differences, between adolescents with high vs. low resistance to peer influences, in a repeated and concurrent engagement of these networks in social context.

The 3 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone are highly potent positive modulators at the GABA(A) receptor and produced a biphasic effect oil pain ill the formalin test. Dose-dependent antinociception was observed at lower doses (maximal antinociception at 0.16 mg/kg) and was reversed at higher closes. Bicuculline abolished the antinociceptive effect. The 3 beta-hydroxylated epipregnanolone and isopregnanolone are inactive or only weekly active at the GABA(A) receptor, and did not affect formalin-induced pain. 5 alpha- and 5 beta-dihydroprogesterone have also been shown to have low affinity for the GABA,x receptor, but call be rapidly metabolized to their 3 alpha-hydroxylated counterparts. In the formalin test, they produced a biphasic effect on pain similar to that of pregnanolone and allopregnanolone. but with lower potency. The effect was reversible by bicuculline, showing involvement of the GABA(A) receptor. and was blocked by indomethacin, implying, that the antinociceptive effect is dependent on their conversion to allopregnanolone or pregnanolone. The results indicate that GABA-ergic progesterone metabolites modulate nociception. A Change in levels of GABA-ergic progesterone metabolites. such as is observed ill depression. chronic fatigue and premenstrual dysphoric disorder could. therefore. contribute to the pain complaints associated with these disorders.

These systems currently allow high volumetric production of monoclonal recombinant antibodies in the range of grams per litre. However their use for large-scale expression of cytokines typically results in much lower volumetric productivity. Results: We have engineered a HEK293 cell clone for high level production of human recombinant glycosylated IFN alpha 2b and developed a rapid and efficient method for its purification. This clone steadily produces more than 200 mg (up to 333 mg) of human recombinant IFN alpha 2b per liter of serum-free culture, which can be purified by a single-step cation-exchange chromatography following media acidification and clarification. This rapid procedure yields 98% pure IFN alpha 2b with a recovery greater than 70%. Purified IFN alpha 2b migrates on SDS-PAGE as two species, a major 21 kDa band and a minor 19 kDa band. N-terminal sequences of both forms are identical and correspond to the expected mature protein. Purified IFN alpha 2b elutes at neutral pH as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of 44,000 Da as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. The presence of intramolecular and absence of intermolecular disulfide bridges is evidenced by the fact that non-reduced IFN alpha 2b has a greater electrophoretic mobility than the reduced form. Treatment of purified IFN alpha 2b with neuraminidase followed by O-glycosidase both increases electrophoretic mobility, indicating the presence of sialylated O-linked glycan. A detailed analysis of glycosylation by mass spectroscopy identifies disialylated and monosialylated forms as the major constituents of purified IFN alpha 2b. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD) shows that the glycans are linked to the expected threonine at position 106. Other minor glycosylated forms and non-sialylated species are also detected, similar to IFN alpha 2b produced naturally by lymphocytes. Further, the HEK293-produced IFN alpha 2b is biologically active as shown with reporter gene and antiviral assays. Conclusion: These results show that the HEK293 cell line is an efficient and valuable host for the production of biologically active and glycosylated human IFN alpha 2b.

J	Sridharan, D; Levitin, DJ; Menon, V				Sridharan, Devarajan; Levitin, Daniel J.; Menon, Vinod			A critical role for the right fronto-insular cortex in switching between central-executive and default-mode networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						brain networks; cognitive control; insula; attention; prefrontal cortex	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VON ECONOMO NEURONS; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MENTAL CHRONOMETRY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN NETWORKS	Cognitively demanding tasks that evoke activation in the brain's central-executive network (CEN) have been consistently shown to evoke decreased activation (deactivation) in the default-mode network (DMN). The neural mechanisms underlying this switch between activation and deactivation of large-scale brain networks remain completely unknown. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the mechanisms underlying switching of brain networks in three different experiments. We first examined this switching process in an auditory event segmentation task. We observed significant activation of the CEN and deactivation of the DMN, along with activation of a third network comprising the right fronto-insular cortex (rFIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when participants perceived salient auditory event boundaries. Using chronometric techniques and Granger causality analysis, we show that the rFIC-ACC network, and the rFIC, in particular, plays a critical and causal role in switching between the CEN and the DMN. We replicated this causal connectivity pattern in two additional experiments: (i) a visual attention "oddball" task and (ii) a task-free resting state. These results indicate that the rFIC is likely to play a major role in switching between distinct brain networks across task paradigms and stimulus modalities. Our findings have important implications for a unified view of network mechanisms underlying both exogenous and endogenous cognitive control.

Neurochemical diversity of afferent neurons that transduce sensory signals from dog ventricular myocardium	AUTONOMIC NEUROSCIENCE-BASIC & CLINICAL			English	Article						calcitonin gene-related peptide; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; substance P; ventricular afferent neuron; dorsal root ganglion; nodose ganglion	GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLIA; SUBSTANCE-P; GUINEA-PIG; SYMPATHETIC REFLEX; SPINAL-CORD; HEART; RAT; CAPSAICIN; FIBERS	While much is known about the influence of ventricular afferent neurons on cardiovascular function in the dog, identification of the neurochemicals transmitting cardiac afferent signals to central neurons is lacking. Accordingly, we identified ventricular afferent neurons in canine dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and nodose ganglia by retrograde labeling after injecting horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the anterior right and left ventricles. Primary antibodies from three host species were used in immunohistochemical experiments to simultaneously evaluate afferent somata for the presence of HRP and markers for two neurotransmitters. Only a small percentage (2%) of afferent somata were labeled with HRP. About half of the HRP-identified ventricular afferent neurons in T-3 DRG also stained for substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), either alone or with two markers colocalized. Ventricular afferent neurons and the general population of T-3 DRG neurons showed the same labeling profiles; CGRP (alone or colocalized with SP) being the most common (30-40% of ventricular afferent somata in T-3 DRG). About 30% of the ventricular afferent neurons in T-2 DRG displayed CGRP immunoreactivity and binding of the putative nociceptive marker IB4. Ventricular afferent neurons of the nodose ganglia were distinct from those in the DRG by having smaller size and lacking immunoreactivity for SP, CGRP, and nNOS. These findings suggest that ventricular sensory information is transferred to the central nervous system by relatively small populations of vagal and spinal afferent neurons and that spinal afferents use a variety of neurotransmitters.

Biological and neural bases of partner preferences in rodents: Models to understand human pair bonds	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						conditioning; love; neurobiology; pari bond; reward; sex; social attachment	VOLES MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER; CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; MONOGAMOUS PRAIRIE VOLE; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; MALE-RAT; SOCIAL ATTACHMENT; FEMALE RATS; EJACULATORY PREFERENCES	Aim. To analyse the biological and neural bases of partner preference formation in rodents as models to understand human pair bonding. Development. Rodents are social individuals. capable of forming short-or long-tasting partner preferences that develop slowly by stimuli like cohabitation or rapidly by stimuli like sex and stress. Dopamine, corticosteroids, oxytocin, vasopressin, and opioids form the neurochemical substrate for pair bonding in areas like the nucleus accumbens the prefrontal cortex the piriform cortes, the medical preooptic area, the ventral tegmental area and the medial amygdala among others. Additional areas may participate depending on the nature of the conditioned stimuli by which and individual recognizes a preferred partner. Conclusions. Animal models help us understand that the capacity of an individual to display long-lasting and selective preferences depends on neural bases, selected throughout evolution. The challenge in neuroscience is to use this knowledge to create new solutions of mental problems associated with the incapacity of an individual to display a social bond keep one or cope with the disruption of a consolidated one.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms operating at the onset of myelination and during maintenance of the myelin sheath in the adult. Here we use a genetic cell ablation approach combined with Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays to identify a number of oligodendrocyte-enriched genes that may play a key role in myelination. One of the "oligogenes" we cloned using this approach is TmemIO/Opalin, which encodes for a novel transmembrane glycoprotein. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis revealed that Tmem10 is selectively expressed by oligodendrocytes and that its expression is induced during their differentiation. Developmental immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that Tmem10 starts to be expressed in the white matter tracks of the cerebellum and the corpus callosum at the onset of myelination after the appearance of other myelin genes such as MBP. In contrast to the spinal cord and brain, Tmem10 was not detected in myelinating Schwann cells, indicating that it is a CNS-specific myelin protein. In mature oligodendrocytes, Tmem10 was present at the cell soma and processes, as well as along myelinated internodes, where it was occasionally concentrated at the paranodes. In myelinating spinal cord cultures, Tmem10 was detected in MBP-positive cellular processes that were aligned with underlying axons before myelination commenced. These results suggest a possible role of Tmem10 in oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination. 02008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Scyl1, mutated in a recessive form of spinocerebellar neurodegeneration, regulates COPI-mediated retrograde traffic	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA; TO-GOLGI TRANSPORT; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; VESICLE FORMATION; LIVING CELLS; BINDING-SITE; PROTEIN; COATOMER; MEMBRANE; CLATHRIN	Scy1-like 1 (Scyl1), a member of the Scy1-like family of catalytically inactive protein kinases, was recently identified as the gene product altered in muscle- deficient mice, which suffer from motor neuron degeneration and cerebellar atrophy. To determine the function of Scyl1, we have now used a mass spectrometry-based screen to search for Scyl1-binding partners and identified components of coatomer I (COPI) coats. The interaction was confirmed in pull- down assays, and Scyl1 co-immunoprecipitates with beta COP from brain lysates. Interestingly, and unique for a non-transmembrane domain protein, Scyl1 binds COPI coats using a C-terminal RKLD-COO- sequence, similar to the KKXX-COO- COPI- binding motif found in transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins. Scyl1 co-localizes with beta COP and is localized, in an Arf1-independent manner, to the ER- Golgi intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi, sites of COPI-mediated membrane budding. The localization and binding properties of Scyl1 strongly suggest a function in COPI transport, and inhibitory RNA-mediated knock down of the protein disrupts COPI- mediated retrograde traffic of the KDEL receptor to the ER without affecting anterograde traffic from the ER. Our data demonstrate a function for Scyl1 as an accessory factor in COPI trafficking and suggest for the first time that alterations in the COPI pathway result in neurodegenerative disease.

An improved method for the estimation of firing rate dynamics using an optimal digital filter	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Kaiser window; spike density; ISI; rate histogram; vestibular afferents	VESTIBULAR-NERVE AFFERENTS; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; NEURONAL SPIKE TRAINS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CANAL AFFERENTS; RESPONSES; STIMULATION; VARIABILITY; ROTATIONS	In most neural systems, neurons communicate by means of sequences of action potentials or 'spikes'. Information encoded by spike trains is often quantified in terms of the firing rate which emphasizes the frequency of occurrence of action potentials rather than their exact timing. Common methods for estimating firing rates include the rate histogram, the reciprocal interspike interval, and the spike density function. In this study, we demonstrate the limitations of these aforementioned techniques and propose a simple yet more robust alternative. By convolving the spike train with an optimally designed Kaiser window, we show that more robust estimates of firing rate are obtained for both low and high-frequency inputs. We illustrate our approach by considering spike trains generated by simulated as well as experimental data obtained from single-unit recordings of first-order sensory neurons in the vestibular system. Improvements were seen in the prevention of aliasing, phase and amplitude distortion, as well as in the noise reduction for sinusoidal and more complex input profiles. We review the generality of the approach, and show that it can be adapted to describe neurons with sensory or motor responses that are characterized by marked nonlinearities. We conclude that our method permits more robust estimates of neural dynamics than conventional techniques across all stimulus conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

IL-6, and leptin are increased in post-poliomyelitis syndrome (PPS) compared to healthy controls; and (ii) whether an association exists between elevated inflammatory markers and clinical parameters in PPS. The cause of PPS is unknown, but abnormal inflammatory responses have been implicated in several small studies. Methods: Serum inflammatory markers were measured (by Luminex) in 51 PPS patients and 26 normal controls. Clinical parameters assessed included disease duration, muscle strength (Medical Research Council sumscore), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and pain (visual analog scale scores). Results: In PPS, TNF alpha levels, as well as IL-6 and leptin were significantly increased compared to controls (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0.03 for TNF alpha, p=0.03 for IL-6, p=0.01 for leptin). The elevated TNF alpha levels in PPS were associated with increased pain due to illness (Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.36, 95% C.I. 0.09 to 0.57) and specifically, with muscle pain (r= 0.38, 95% C.I. 0.11 to 0.59). There were no correlations between inflammatory markers in PPS and joint pain, muscle strength, fatigue, or disease duration. Conclusions: Serum TNF alpha, IL-6 and leptin levels are abnormally increased in PPS patients. Elevated TNF alpha levels appear to be specifically associated with increased muscle pain.
