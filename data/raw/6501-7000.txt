Impact of scale space search on age- and gender-related changes in MRI-based cortical morphometry	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						Gaussian kernel smoothing; filter size; unified P-value; permutation test; cortical volume; cortical surface area; cortical thickness; surface-based morphometry	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; HEALTHY-YOUNG ADULTS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAINS; ACTIVATION; THICKNESS; VOLUME; SEX; REGISTRATION; ASYMMETRY	In magnetic resonance imaging based brain morphometry, Gaussian smoothing is often applied to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to increase the detection power of statistical parametric maps. However, most existing studies used a single smoothing filter without adequately justifying their choices. In this article, we want to determine the extent for which performing a morphometry analysis using multiple smoothing filters, namely conducting a scale space search, improves or decreases the detection power. We first compared scale space search with single-filter analysis through a simulated population study. The multiple comparisons in our four-dimensional scale space searches were corrected for using a unified P-value approach. Our results illustrate that, compared with a single-filter analysis, a scale space search analysis can properly capture the variations in analysis results caused by variations in smoothing, and more importantly, it can obviously increase the sensitivity for detecting brain morphometric changes. We also show that the cost of an increased critical threshold for conducting a scale space search is very small. In the second experiment, we investigated age and gender effects on cortical volume, thickness, and surface area in 104 normal subjects using scale space search. The obtained results provide a perspective of scale space theory on the morphological changes with age and gender. These results suggest that, in exploratory studies of aging, gender, and disease, conducting a scale space search is essential, if we are to produce a complete description of the structural changes or abnormalities associated with these dimensions.

We sought to explore the neural activity underlying recognition by employing the old/new word repetition event-related potential effect. Behavioural recognition performance was comparable across both groups, and demonstrated superior recognition for low frequency over high frequency words. However, the ASD group showed a parietal rather than anterior onset (300-500 ms), and diminished right frontal old/new effects (800-1500 ms) relative to TD individuals. This study shows that undiminished recognition performance results from a pattern of differing functional neurophysiology in ASD.

All the reported cases occurred sporadically. Although several causal genes of HPE and ectrodactyly have been identified, the genetic cause of Hartsfield syndrome remains unknown. We hypothesised that a single key developmental gene may underlie the co-occurrence of HPE and ectrodactyly. Methods We used whole exome sequencing in four isolated cases including one case-parents trio, and direct Sanger sequencing of three additional cases, to investigate the causative variants in Hartsfield syndrome. Results We identified a novel FGFR1 mutation in six out of seven patients. Affected residues are highly conserved and are located in the extracellular binding domain of the receptor (two homozygous mutations) or the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (four heterozygous de novo variants). Strikingly, among the six novel mutations, three are located in close proximity to the ATP's phosphates or the coordinating magnesium, with one position required for kinase activity, and three are adjacent to known mutations involved in Kallmann syndrome plus other developmental anomalies. Conclusions Dominant or recessive FGFR1 mutations are responsible for Hartsfield syndrome, consistent with the known roles of FGFR1 in vertebrate ontogeny and conditional Fgfr1-deficient mice. Our study shows that, in humans, lack of accurate FGFR1 activation can disrupt both brain and hand/foot midline development, and that FGFR1 loss-of-function mutations are responsible for a wider spectrum of clinical anomalies than previously thought, ranging in severity from seemingly isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, through Kallmann syndrome with or without additional features, to Hartsfield syndrome at its most severe end.

A clinical overlap between AGS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been reported. We describe an AGS patient who developed autoimmune manifestations: thyroiditis, cANCA positivity, antiphospholipid antibodies and cerebral ischemia. This first description of antiphospholipid syndrome in a TREX1-mutated patient further expands the clinical spectrum of AGS. Although the clinical overlap with SLE may indicate common pathogenic mechanisms, the autoimmune manifestations in AGS are so extensive that we suggest they should be considered a clinical feature of the disease, rather than a sign of coexistent SLE.

Ethanol self-administration and nicotine treatment induce brain levels of CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 in African green monkeys	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						CYP2B6; CYP2E1; Nicotine; Ethanol; Monkey; Induction; Brain	RAT-BRAIN; CYTOCHROME-P450 ENZYMES; OXIDATIVE STRESS; VERVET MONKEYS; SMOKING; POLYMORPHISM; CONSUMPTION; ALCOHOLICS; EXPRESSION	CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 are enzymes responsible for the metabolism of many centrally acting drugs, toxins and endogenous compounds. Human smokers and alcoholics have elevated levels of CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 in certain brain regions, which may contribute to altered drug efficacy, neurotoxicity and metabolic tolerance. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of ethanol self-administration and nicotine treatment, alone and in combination, on brain CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 levels in monkeys. Monkeys were randomized into four groups (N = 10/group): an ethanol-only group, a nicotine-only group, an ethanol + nicotine group and a control (no drug) group. Ethanol (10% alcohol in sucrose solution) was voluntarily self-administered by the monkeys and nicotine was given as subcutaneous injections (0.5 mg/kg bid). Immunocytochemistry revealed induction of both CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 protein in certain brain regions and cells within monkey brain as a result of ethanol self-administration, nicotine treatment and combined exposure to both drugs. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated CYP2B6 induction by ethanol in the caudate, putamen and cerebellum (1.5-3.2 fold, P < 0.05), and CYP2E1 induction by nicotine in the frontal cortex and putamen (1.6-2.0 fold, P < 0.05). Combined ethanol and nicotine exposure induced CYP2B6 in the caudate, putamen, thalamus and cerebellum (1.4-2.4 fold, P < 0.05), and CYP2E1 in the frontal cortex and putamen (1.5-1.8, P < 0.05). CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 mRNA levels were unaffected by ethanol or nicotine exposure. In summary, ethanol and nicotine can induce CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 protein in the primate brain, which could potentially result in altered sensitivity to centrally acting drugs and toxins.

The fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, URB597, promotes retinal ganglion cell neuroprotection in a rat model of optic nerve axotomy	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Endocannabinoids; Anandamide; Cannabinoid receptor; Microglia; Optic nerve	CANNABINOID CB1 RECEPTORS; N-ARACHIDONOYL GLYCINE; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS; ELEVATED GLUTAMATE; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; EYE TISSUES; SPINAL-CORD; ANANDAMIDE	The endocannabinoid, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), is degraded by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). This study examined whether the FAAH inhibitor, URB597, increases retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival following optic nerve axotomy in young and aged animals. URB597 alone, or together with either a CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonist, was administered daily for 1 or 2 weeks post-axotomy. Histological assessment of retinas indicated that URB597 increased RGC survival in young retina at 1 and 2 weeks post-axotomy. The increase in RGC survival at 2 weeks was accompanied by a reduction in phagocytic microglia. The CB1 antagonist, AM281, but not the CB2 antagonist, AM630, ablated URB597-mediated RGC neuroprotection. CB1 or CB2 antagonism increased phagocytic microglia in URB597 and vehicle-treated animals. In aged animals, URB597 increased RGC survival at 1 week, but not at 2 weeks post-axotomy and had no effect on microglia. Retinal Iba-1 positive microglia were also decreased in URB597-treated axotomized young animals and this decrease was mitigated by CB1 but not CB2 antagonism. As seen with phagocytotic microglia, the CB2 antagonist, AM630, increased lba-1 positive microglia in the absence of URB597 treatment. Measurement of retinal endocannabinoid levels in URB597-treated animals at 2 weeks post-axotomy revealed a significant increase in AEA levels, accompanied by a decrease in the AEA metabolite, N-arachidonoyl glycine, in young animals but not aged animals. 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels were similar across all experimental groups. These data demonstrate that URB597-mediated retinal neuroprotective effects are mediated primarily through CB1 receptors and that URB597 neuroprotective efficacy declines with age.

Neuromedin U Receptor 2 does not play a role in the development of neuropathic pain following nerve injury in mice	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							CALCIUM-CHANNELS; IDENTIFICATION; RAT; RESPONSES; REFLEXES; STRESS; SYSTEM; LIGAND	Background: Previous studies have identified neuromedin U receptor 2 (NMUR2) as the subtype mediating the effects of neuromedin U on acute chemo-nociception induced by capsaicin or formalin injection. The aims of this study were to determine whether NMUR2 is required for the development of mechanical hypersensitivity after nerve injury or heat hypersensitivity after inflammation and whether there is a gender difference in the contribution of NMUR2 to nociception. Methods: Mechanical sensitivity was assessed with von Frey filaments in wild type (WT) and NMUR2-null mice at baseline and following spared tibial nerve (STN) injury. Heat sensitivity was also assessed at baseline and after induction of inflammation with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Results: The response to von Frey filaments at baseline was similar for WT and NMUR2-null mice and for males and females. The response of male NMUR2-null mice was slightly but significantly decreased when exposed to 52 degrees C but not 58 degrees C heat stimuli. There was no difference between the stimulus-response curve for WT and NMUR2-null mice 7, 13 and 16 days after nerve injury. Similarly, after FCA-induced inflammation, there was no significant difference in heat hyperalgesia between WT and NMUR2-null mice or male or female mice in responses to temperatures ranging from 44 to 48 degrees C. Conclusions: The present data do not support a significant contribution of NMUR2 to the development of hypersensitivity after nerve injury or tissue inflammation, suggesting that pharmacological intervention aimed at the NMUR2 receptor might not be a valuable approach for the treatment of chronic pain.

Increased serotonin transporter gene (SERT) DNA methylation is associated with bullying victimization and blunted cortisol response to stress in childhood: a longitudinal study of discordant monozygotic twins	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Bullying; childhood victimization; cortisol; DNA methylation; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; SERT	PITUITARY-ADRENOCORTICAL AXIS; X ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; INFANT RHESUS MACAQUES; IOWA ADOPTEE SAMPLE; EARLY-LIFE STRESS; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; HPA AXIS	Background. Childhood adverse experiences are known to induce persistent changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress. However, the mechanisms by which these experiences shape the neuroendocrine response to stress remain unclear. Method. We tested whether bullying victimization influenced serotonin transporter gene (SERT) DNA methylation using a discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design. A subsample of 28 MZ twin pairs discordant for bullying victimization, with data on cortisol and DNA methylation, were identified in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative 1994-1995 cohort of families with twins. Results. Bullied twins had higher SERT DNA methylation at the age of 10 years compared with their non-bullied MZ co-twins. This group difference cannot be attributed to the children's genetic makeup or their shared familial environments because of the study design. Bullied twins also showed increasing methylation levels between the age of 5 years, prior to bullying victimization, and the age of 10 years whereas no such increase was detected in non-bullied twins across time. Moreover, children with higher SERT methylation levels had blunted cortisol responses to stress. Conclusions. Our study extends findings drawn from animal models, supports the hypothesis that early-life stress modifies DNA methylation at a specific cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site in the SERT promoter and HPA functioning and suggests that these two systems may be functionally associated.

A comprehensive imaging protocol, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cortical thickness analysis and 320-row computed tomography (CT) perfusion was used to provide information on brain plasticity and potential steal phenomenon. A 25-year-old man known for a right temporal grade V Spetzler-Martin classification arteriovenous malformation (AVM) presented with left progressive hemiparesis. He underwent functional 3T magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cortical thickness analysis, and CT perfusion (CT 320 row, Aquilion ONE, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) before and after endovascular treatment. The results were compared to look for modifications in brain perfusion and organization. An improvement in the left hemiparesis and a reorganization of motor function were observed after endovascular treatment. Modifications in the angioarchitecture and perfusion of an extensive AVM may be accompanied by a functional and structural reorganization of the brain. The location in the so-called eloquent regions may not be sufficient to explain the wide spectrum of symptoms that these patients can present. A more comprehensive approach considering a global involvement of the brain in patients with large AVMs is suggested to achieve the best treatment strategy and to stage treatment in incurable AVMs.	[La Piana, Roberta; Bourassa-Blanchette, Samuel; Nino, Maria Del Pilar Cortes; Tampieri, Donatella] McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Hosp & Inst, Dept Neuroradiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Klein, Denise] McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Hosp & Inst, Cognit Neurosci Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mok, Kelvin] McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Hosp & Inst, Neuronav Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Tampieri, D (reprint author), Montreal Neurol Hosp & Inst, 3801 Univ St,Room 540A, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada.	donatella.tampieri@mcgill.ca			Government of Canada Centres of Excellence for Commercialization and Research (CECR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Montreal Neurological Institute	We thank the patient for his participation in the study.

An Improved Neural Network Training Algorithm for Wi-Fi Fingerprinting Positioning	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						indoor positioning; neural network; Wi-Fi fingerprinting		Ubiquitous positioning provides continuous positional information in both indoor and outdoor environments for a wide spectrum of location based service (LBS) applications. With the rapid development of the low-cost and high speed data communication, Wi-Fi networks in many metropolitan cities, strength of signals propagated from the Wi-Fi access points (APs) namely received signal strength (RSS) have been cleverly adopted for indoor positioning. In this paper, a Wi-Fi positioning algorithm based on neural network modeling of Wi-Fi signal patterns is proposed. This algorithm is based on the correlation between the initial parameter setting for neural network training and output of the mean square error to obtain better modeling of the nonlinear highly complex Wi-Fi signal power propagation surface. The test results show that this neural network based data processing algorithm can significantly improve the neural network training surface to achieve the highest possible accuracy of the Wi-Fi fingerprinting positioning method.

In addition to providing peripheral glia and neurons, NCC generate melanocytes as well as most of the cranio-facial skeleton. NCC migration and differentiation is controlled by a combination of their axial origin along the neural tube and their exposure to regionally distinct extracellular cues. Such contribution of extracellular ligands is especially evident during the formation of the enteric nervous system (ENS), a complex interconnected network of neural ganglia that locally controls (among other things) gut muscle movement and intestinal motility. Most of the ENS is derived from a small initial pool of NCC that undertake a long journey in order to colonize - in a rostral to caudal fashion - the entire length of the prospective gut. Among several signaling pathways known to influence enteric NCC colonization, GDNF/RET signaling is recognized as the most important. Indeed, spatiotemporally controlled secretion of the RET ligand GDNF by the gut mesenchyme is chiefly responsible for the attraction and guidance of RET-expressing enteric NCC to and within the embryonic gut. Here, we describe an ex vivo cell migration assay, making use of a transgenic mouse line possessing fluorescently labeled NCC, which allows precise quantification of enteric NCC migration potential in the presence of various growth factors, including GDNF.

Here, we examined the effect of loss of discriminative touch and proprioception on cortical thickness and functional connectivity. We performed structural magnetic resonance imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans on a 60-year-old female who at age 31 suffered a selective loss of large-diameter myelinated primary afferents and, therefore, relies mainly on her intact thin-fiber senses (temperature, pain, itch, and C-fiber touch) and vision to negotiate her environment. The patient showed widespread cortical thinning compared with 12 age-matched female controls. In contrast, her right anterior insula was significantly thick. Seed-based resting-state analysis revealed that her right anterior insula had increased connectivity to bilateral posterior insula. A separate independent component analysis revealed the increased connectivity between the insula and visual cortex in the patient. As the insula is an important processing area for temperature and C-fiber tactile information, the increased intrainsular and insular-visual functional connectivity could be related to the patients use of C-fiber (gentle) touch and temperature information in conjunction with visual information to navigate her environment. We, thus, demonstrated plasticity in networks involving the insular cortex following denervation of large-diameter somatosensory afferents.	[Ceko, Marta; Seminowicz, David A.; Bushnell, M.

Empirical demonstrations of abstract object encoding, independent of low-level structure, have relied on speech stimuli, and non-speech studies of object-category encoding (e.g., human vocalizations) often lack a systematic assessment of low-level information (e.g., vocalizations are highly harmonic). It is currently unknown whether abstract encoding constitutes a general functional principle that operates for auditory objects other than speech. We combined multivariate analyses of functional imaging data with an accurate analysis of the low-level acoustical information to examine the abstract encoding of non-speech categories. We observed abstract encoding of the living and human-action sound categories in the fine-grained spatial distribution of activity in the middle-to-posterior temporal cortex (e.g., planum temporale). Abstract encoding of auditory objects appears to extend to non-speech biological sounds and to operate in regions other than the anterior temporal lobe. Neural processes for the abstract encoding of auditory objects might have facilitated the emergence of speech categories in our ancestors.

However, the details regarding the developmental trajectory of large-scale structural brain networks are not yet understood. Here, we used graph theory to examine developmental changes in the organization of structural brain networks in 203 normally growing children and adolescents. Structural brain networks were constructed using interregional correlations in cortical thickness for 4 age groups (early childhood: 4.88.4 year; late childhood: 8.511.3 year; early adolescence: 11.414.7 year; late adolescence: 14.818.3 year). Late childhood showed prominent changes in topological properties, specifically a significant reduction in local efficiency, modularity, and increased global efficiency, suggesting a shift of topological organization toward a more random configuration. An increase in number and span of distribution of connector hubs was found in this age group. Finally, inter-regional connectivity analysis and graph-theoretic measures indicated early maturation of primary sensorimotor regions and protracted development of higher order association and paralimbic regions. Our finding reveals a time window of plasticity occurring during late childhood which may accommodate crucial changes during puberty and the new developmental tasks that an adolescent faces.

In the first account, religion is seen as promoting health, with the link formalized in ancestral shamanism, for example. However, empirical research has not been conclusive in demonstrating a direct adaptive function of religion in this particular respect. The second account views religion as a derived product of non-religious adaptive abilities. This account is more compatible with the composite functions of the entity which is termed religion. Il existe deux interpretations evolutionnistes divergentes pour expliquer l'avenement de la religion : celle de l'avantage adaptatif et celle du phenomene emergent. La premiere est notamment basee sur un lien que ses defenseurs voient entre religion et sante dans le chamanisme. L'examen de ces travaux montre que l'objet d'etude est mal defini et que les liens entre religion et avantage adaptatif ne sont pas demontres de facon satisfaisante. La seconde interpretation considere la religion comme un produit derive de diverses habiletes qui trouvent leur explication adaptative en dehors de la religion. Cette voie rend mieux compte de l'aspect composite de ce qui est appele << religion >>.

Here, we present an improved algorithm for dense vertex-to-vertex correspondence that uses direct matching of features defined on a surface and improves it by using spectral correspondence as a regularization. This algorithm has the speed of both feature matching and spectral matching while exhibiting greatly improved precision (distance errors of 1.4 percent). The method, FOCUSR, incorporates implicitly such additional features to calculate the correspondence and relies on the smoothness of the lowest-frequency harmonics of a graph Laplacian to spatially regularize the features. In its simplest form, FOCUSR is an improved spectral correspondence method that nonrigidly deforms spectral embeddings. We provide here a full realization of spectral correspondence where virtually any feature can be used as an additional information using weights on graph edges, but also on graph nodes and as extra embedded coordinates. As an example, the full power of FOCUSR is demonstrated in a real-case scenario with the challenging task of brain surface matching across several individuals. Our results show that combining features and regularizing them in a spectral embedding greatly improves the matching precision (to a submillimeter level) while performing at much greater speed than existing methods.

It is widely held that the mechanisms that extend lifespan may be adapted for diminishing age-associated pathologies. We tested whether a number of compounds reported to extend lifespan in C. elegans could reduce age-dependent toxicity caused by mutant TAR DNA-binding protein-43 in C. elegans motor neurons. Only half of the compounds tested show protective properties against neurodegeneration, suggesting that extended lifespan is not a strong predictor for neuroprotective properties. We report here that resveratrol, rolipram, reserpine, trolox, propyl gallate, and ethosuximide protect against mutant TAR DNA-binding protein-43 neuronal toxicity. Finally, of all the compounds tested, only resveratrol required daf-16 and sir-2.1 for protection, and ethosuximide showed dependence on daf-16 for its activity.

The present study tested the hypothesis that intron 2 of the nestin gene drives expression and a subpopulation of nestin(+) cells participate in reparative vascularisation. The directed expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) by the second intron of the nestin gene identified GFP/nestin(+) cells intercalated among ventricular myocytes in the heart of normal transgenic mice. Ischemic injury led to the migration of GFP(+) cells to the scar and a subpopulation was detected in CD31/nestin(+) endothelial cells of newly formed blood vessels. The direct contribution to reparative vascularisation provided the impetus to test the hypothesis that increasing the population of nestin(+) cells in the infarcted heart will improve scar healing. Skin-derived cells isolated from E18 SpragueDawley rats grew as spheres, expressed nestin, sox2, neural crest-related transcriptional genes and a panel of peptide growth factors. Skin-derived cells transplanted in the non-infarcted left ventricle of 3-day post-MI rats migrated to the peri-infarct/infarct region and remained engrafted for 21 days. A significantly smaller infarct, increased number of small calibre blood vessels and improved ventricular function were observed in engrafted infarcted rat hearts. Thus, the second intron of the nestin gene drives expression in the mouse heart and a subpopulation of GFP/nestin(+) cells directly participate in reparative vascularisation. Increasing the population of nestin(+) cells via the transplantation of skin-derived cells represents a potential approach to limit ischemic damage to the heart. J. Cell.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; SHAPE-FREQUENCY; SUBJECTIVE CONTOURS; COLOR SELECTIVITY; TILT; MECHANISMS; CONTRAST; ORGANIZATION; INFORMATION	Prolonged exposure to an oriented line shifts the perceived orientation of a subsequently observed line in the opposite direction, a phenomenon known as the tilt aftereffect (TAE). Here we consider whether the TAE for line stimuli is mediated by a mechanism that integrates the local parts of the line into a single global entity prior to the site of adaptation, or the result of the sum of local TAEs acting separately on the parts of the line. To test between these two alternatives we used the fact the TAE transfers almost completely across luminance contrast polarity [1]. We measured the TAE using adaptor and test lines that (1) either alternated in luminance polarity or were of a single polarity, and (2) either alternated in local orientation or were of a single orientation. We reasoned that if the TAE was agnostic to luminance polarity and was parts-based, we should obtain large TAEs using alternating-polarity adaptors with single-polarity tests. However we found that (i) TAEs using one-alternating-polarity adaptors with all-white tests were relatively small, increased slightly for two-alternating-polarity adaptors, and were largest with all-white or all-black adaptors. (ii) however TAEs were relatively large when the test was one-alternating polarity, irrespective of the adaptor type. (iii) The results with orientation closely mirrored those obtained with polarity with the difference that the TAE transfer across orthogonal orientations was weak. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the TAE for lines is mediated by a global shape mechanism that integrates the parts of lines into whole prior to the site of orientation adaptation. The asymmetry in the magnitude of TAE depending on whether the alternating-polarity lines was the adaptor or test can be explained by an imbalance in the population of neurons sensitive to 1st-and 2nd-order lines, with the 2nd-order lines being encoded by a subset of the mechanisms sensitive to 1st-order lines.

Both features may be relevant to the pathophysiology of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy that represents the most refractory adult form of epilepsy with up to 30% of patients not achieving adequate seizure control. Compared to other limbic structures such as the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal area remains understudied and, in particular, detailed information on its dysfunctional characteristics remains scarce; this lack of information may be due to the fact that the perirhinal cortex is not grossly damaged in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and in models mimicking this epileptic disorder. However, we have recently identified in pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats the presence of selective losses of interneuron subtypes along with increased synaptic excitability. In this review we: (i) highlight the fundamental electrophysiological properties of perirhinal cortex neurons; (ii) briefly stress the mechanisms underlying epileptiform synchronization in perirhinal cortex networks following epileptogenic pharmacological manipulations; and (iii) focus on the changes in neuronal excitability and cytoarchitecture of the perirhinal cortex occurring in the pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Overall, these data indicate that perirhinal cortex networks are hyperexcitable in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy, and that this condition is associated with a selective cellular damage that is characterized by an age-dependent sensitivity of interneurons to precipitating injuries, such as status epilepticus.

Proteolysis of cell adhesion molecules and a wide variety of other cell surface proteins serves as a mechanism for protein turnover and, in some cases, cell signaling. Metalloproteases such as A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease (ADAM) family members cleave cell surface receptors to release their substrates' ectodomains, while the presenilin/gamma-secretase complex mediates regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), releasing intracellular domain fragments from the plasma membrane. In the case of some substrates such as Notch and amyloid precursor protein (APP), the released intracellular domains enter the nucleus to modulate gene expression. We report that CAR ectodomain is constitutively shed from glioma cells and developing neurons, and is also shed when cells are treated with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the calcium ionophore ionomycin. We identified ADAM10 as a sheddase of CAR using assays involving shRNA knockdown and rescue, overexpression of wild-type ADAM10 and inhibition of ADAM10 activity by addition of its prodomain. In vitro peptide cleavage, mass spectrometry and mutagenesis revealed the amino acids M224 to L227 of CAR as the site of ADAM10-mediated ectodomain cleavage. CAR also undergoes RIP by the presenilin/gamma-secretase complex, and the intracellular domain of CAR enters the nucleus. Ectodomain shedding is a prerequisite for RIP of CAR. Thus, CAR belongs to the increasing list of cell surface molecules that undergo ectodomain shedding and that are substrates for.-secretase-mediated RIP.

Existing tools available to perform such analysis (e.g., detrended fluctuation analysis), however, provide limited gains in discriminability power over traditional spectral based EEG analysis. In this paper, we explore the use of an innovative EEG amplitude modulation analysis technique based on spectro-temporal signal processing. More specifically, full-band EEG signals are first decomposed into the five well-known frequency bands and the envelopes are then extracted via a Hilbert transform. Each of the five envelopes are further decomposed into four so-called modulation bands, which were chosen to coincide with the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. Experiments on a resting-awake EEG dataset collected from 76 participants (27 healthy controls, 27 diagnosed with mild-AD, and 22 with moderate-AD) showed significant differences in amplitude modulations between the three groups. Most notably, i) delta modulation of the beta frequency band disappeared with an increase in disease severity (from mild to moderate AD), ii) delta modulation of the theta band appeared with an increase in severity, and iii) delta modulation of the beta frequency band showed to be a reliable discriminant feature between healthy controls and mild-AD patients. Taken together, it is hoped that the developed tool can be used to assist clinicians not only with early detection of Alzheimer's disease, but also to monitor its progression.

The present study investigated the effects of aging on motor system metabolism and function in former university-level athletes who sustained their last concussion several decades prior to testing. Methods: To test the hypothesis that age and remote concussions induce functional as well as metabolic alterations of the motor system, we used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect metabolic abnormalities in the primary motor cortex and the serial reaction time task (SRTT) to evaluate motor learning. Results: Our results indicate that motor learning is significantly reduced in former concussed athletes relative to controls. In addition, glutamate/H2O ratio in M1 was disproportionately reduced in concussed athletes with advancing age and was found to strongly correlate with motor learning impairments. Conclusion: Findings from this study provide evidence that the acquisition of a repeated motor sequence is compromised in the aging concussed brain and that its physiological underpinnings could implicate disproportionate reductions of M1 glutamate concentrations with advancing age.

Discontinuities in slow finger movements in patients with Parkinson's disease	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Discontinuities; Parkinson's disease; Slow finger movement; 3D ultrasound motion analysis; L-Dopa; Bradykinesia	SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; MOTOR CONTROL; TREMOR; COHERENCE; NETWORKS; HUMANS	Slow finger movements in healthy humans are characterized by discontinuous rhythmic changes in a low frequency band about 8 Hz. These pulsatile changes in velocity are thought to present the central output of an oscillatory cerebello-thalamo-cortical network in the same frequency. Hypothesizing that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the dopaminergic OFF- and ON-condition show changes in the characteristics of discontinuities compared to healthy humans, we used a 3D-ultrasound device to measure slow finger movements of 16 patients with PD and 12 age-matched controls. We provide evidence that slow finger movements of patients with PD are characterized by discontinuities in acceleration, which are significantly slower in the OFF- but not in the ON-condition compared to healthy controls. Correlation analysis between clinical motor improvement after dopaminergic medication and changes of peak frequencies and peak power of discontinuities was not significant. We conclude that the oscillatory brain network of slow finger movements is affected in PD, presenting in a lower frequency in the OFF-condition. We suggest that one factor of the modulation of this network is a dopaminergic stimulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Bettray, L.

Here we demonstrate that the pivotal translational repressor, the eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), is rhythmically regulated via the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the SCN and preferentially represses vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) nnRNA translation. Knockout (KO) of Eif4ebp1 (gene encoding 4E-BP1) leads to upregulation of VIP and higher amplitude of molecular rhythms in the SCN. Consequently, the 4E-BP1 null mice exhibit accelerated re-entrainment to a shifted light/dark cycle and are more resistant to the rhythm-disruptive effects of constant light. Conversely, in Mtor(+/-) mice VIP expression is decreased and susceptibility to the effects of constant light is increased. These results reveal a key role for mTOR/4E-BP1-mediated translational control in regulating entrainment and synchrony of the master clock.

This input is often actively shaped by the movements of the animal and its sensory receptors. Little is known about natural sensory scene statistics taking into account the concomitant movement of sensory receptors in freely moving animals. South American weakly electric fish use a self-generated quasi-sinusoidal electric field for electrolocation and electrocommunication. Thousands of cutaneous electroreceptors detect changes in the transdermal potential (TDP) as the fish interact with conspecifics and the environment. Despite substantial knowledge about the circuitry and physiology of the electrosensory system, the statistical properties of the electrosensory input evoked by natural swimming movements have never been measured directly. Using underwater wireless telemetry, we recorded the TDP of Apteronotus leptorhynchus as they swam freely by themselves and during interaction with a conspecific. Swimming movements caused low-frequency TDP amplitude modulations (AMs). Interacting with a conspecific caused additional AMs around the difference frequency of their electric fields, with the amplitude of the AMs(envelope) varying at low frequencies due to mutual movements. Both AMs and envelopes showed a power-law relationship with frequency, indicating spectral scale invariance. Combining a computational model of the electric field with video tracking of movements, we show that specific swimming patterns cause characteristic spatiotemporal sensory input correlations that contain information that may be used by the brain to guide behavior.

However, a dopaminergic innervation of the pedunculopontine nucleus, considered part of the MLR, was recently identified in the monkey. The origin and role of this dopaminergic input are unknown. We addressed these questions in a basal vertebrate, the lamprey. Here we report a functional descending dopaminergic pathway from the posterior tuberculum (PT; homologous to the substantia nigra pars compacta and/or ventral tegmental area of mammals) to the MLR. By using triple labeling, we found that dopaminergic cells from the PT not only project an ascending pathway to the striatum, but send a descending projection to the MLR. In an isolated brain preparation, PT stimulation elicited excitatory synaptic inputs into patch-clamped MLR cells, accompanied by activity in reticulospinal cells. By using voltammetry coupled with electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that PT stimulation evoked DA release in the MLR, together with the activation of reticulospinal cells. In a semi-intact preparation, stimulation of the PT elicited reticulospinal activity together with locomotor movements. Microinjections of a D1 antagonist in the MLR decreased the locomotor output elicited by PT stimulation, whereas injection of DA had an opposite effect. It appears that this descending dopaminergic pathway has a modulatory role on MLR cells that are known to receive glutamatergic projections and promotes locomotor output.

BASIS Team	The development of face orienting mechanisms in infants at-risk for autism	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Autism; Infancy; At-risk; Face-processing; Attention; Prospective study	SPECTRUM DISORDERS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; EYE-GAZE; RECOGNITION; TODDLERS; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; SIBLINGS	A popular idea related to early brain development in autism is that a lack of attention to, or interest in, social stimuli early in life interferes with the emergence of social brain networks mediating the typical development of socio-communicative skills. Compelling as it is, this developmental account has proved difficult to verify empirically because autism is typically diagnosed in toddlerhood, after this process of brain specialization is well underway. Using a prospective study, we directly tested the integrity of social orienting mechanisms in infants at-risk for autism by virtue of having an older diagnosed sibling. Contrary to previous accounts, infants who later develop autism exhibit a clear orienting response to faces that are embedded within an array of distractors. Nevertheless, infants at-risk for autism as a group, and irrespective of their subsequent outcomes, had a greater tendency to select and sustain attention to faces. This pattern suggests that interactions among multiple social and attentional brain systems over the first two years give rise to variable pathways in infants at-risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show how recent evidence probing the impact of hypnosis and suggestion can inform and advance a neurophenomenological approach. In contrast to meditative practices that involve lengthy and intensive training, hypnosis induces profound alterations in subjective experience following just a few words of suggestion. Individuals highly responsive to hypnosis can quickly and effortlessly manifest atypical conscious experiences as well as override deeply entrenched processes. These capacities open new avenues for suspending habitual modes of attention and achieving refined states of meta-awareness. Furthermore, hypnosis research sheds light on the effects of suggestion, expectation, and interpersonal factors beyond the narrow context of hypnotic procedures. Such knowledge may help to further foster phenomenological interviewing methods, improve experiential reports, and elucidate the mechanisms of contemplative practices. Incorporating hypnosis and suggestion into the broader landscape of neurophenomenology, therefore, would likely help bridge subjective experience and third-person approaches to the mind.

Here we show that LAR RPTPs are required for normal development of the mandibular and maxillary regions. Approximately half of the mouse embryos lacking both Ptprs (RPTPs) and Ptprf (LAR) exhibit micrognathia (small lower jaw), cleft palate and microglossia/glossoptosis (small and deep tongue), a phenotype closely resembling Pierre-Robin sequence in humans. We show that jaw bone and cartilage patterning occurs aberrantly in LAR family phosphatase-deficient embryos and that the mandibular arch harbors a marked decrease in cell proliferation. Analysis of signal transduction in embryonic tissues and mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures identifies an increase in Bmp-Smad signaling and an abrogation of canonical Wnt signaling associated with loss of the LAR family phosphatases. A reactivation of beta-catenin signaling by chemical inhibition of GSK3 beta successfully resensitizes LAR family phosphatase-deficient cells to Wnt induction, indicating that RPTPs are necessary for normal Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation. Together these results identify LAR RPTPs as important regulators of craniofacial morphogenesis and provide insight into the etiology of Pierre-Robin sequence.

Essential role for ligand-dependent feedback antagonism of vertebrate hedgehog signaling by PTCH1, PTCH2 and HHIP1 during neural patterning	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Neural tube; Hedgehog; Negative feedback	PROGENITOR-CELL IDENTITY; MOUSE PATCHED GENE; SONIC HEDGEHOG; BINDING PROTEIN; CHINESE FAMILY; PRIMARY CILIUM; NEURONAL FATE; FLOOR PLATE; SHH; TUBE	Hedgehog (HH) signaling is essential for vertebrate and invertebrate embryogenesis. In Drosophila, feedback upregulation of the HH receptor Patched (PTC; PTCH in vertebrates), is required to restrict HH signaling during development. By contrast, PTCH1 upregulation is dispensable for early HH-dependent patterning in mice. Unique to vertebrates are two additional HH-binding antagonists that are induced by HH signaling, HHIP1 and the PTCH1 homologue PTCH2. Although HHIP1 functions semi-redundantly with PTCH1 to restrict HH signaling in the developing nervous system, a role for PTCH2 remains unresolved. Data presented here define a novel role for PTCH2 as a ciliary localized HH pathway antagonist. While PTCH2 is dispensable for normal ventral neural patterning, combined removal of PTCH2- and PTCH1-feedback antagonism produces a significant expansion of HH-dependent ventral neural progenitors. Strikingly, complete loss of PTCH2-, HHIP1- and PTCH1-feedback inhibition results in ectopic specification of ventral cell fates throughout the neural tube, reflecting constitutive HH pathway activation. Overall, these data reveal an essential role for ligand-dependent feedback inhibition of vertebrate HH signaling governed collectively by PTCH1, PTCH2 and HHIP1.

EphA7 expression identifies a unique neuronal compartment in the rat striatum	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						matrix; striosomes; matrisome; anatomy; basal ganglia; ephrin	NEURAL CREST MIGRATION; PARAFASCICULAR THALAMIC NUCLEI; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CAT CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; LIFE-SPAN ANALYSIS; BASAL GANGLIA; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; EPHRIN-AS; GENE-EXPRESSION	Prior studies have identified two anatomically and neurochemically distinct cellular compartments within the mammalian striatum, termed striosomes and matrix, which express -opioid receptors (OR) and EphA4, respectively. Here we identify and characterize an additional compartment in the rat striatum composed of neurons that express EphA7. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical data indicate that neurons expressing EphA7 mRNA and protein are arranged in a banded matrisome-like pattern confined to the matrix in the dorsal striatum. Within the ventral striatum, EphA7-positive (+) neurons have a less organized mosaic pattern that partially overlaps areas expressing OR. Immunolabeling data demonstrate that EphA7+ striatofugal axons form distinct fascicles leaving the striatum. Within the globus pallidus, EphA7+ axons terminate primarily within ventromedial areas of the nucleus and along its striatal border. EphA7+ axons avoid regions containing dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra and preferentially innervate areas near the rostral and caudal margins of the nucleus. Within both nuclei, EphA7+ axons have similar but more restricted terminal fields than the entire population of EphA4+ matrix axons, indicating that EphA7+ axons comprise a subpopulation of matrix axons. Ligand binding data demonstrate that ephrin-A5 selectively binds areas of the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra containing EphA7+ neurons and axons, but not areas expressing only EphA4. Our findings demonstrate that EphA7 expression identifies a novel matrisome compartment within the matrix that binds ephrin-A5 and possesses unique axonal projections. Our findings also suggest that EphA7 and ephrin-A5 may participate in the formation of this matrisome subcompartment and its striatofugal projections. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:2663-2679, 2013.

REORGANIZATION OF THE AUDITORY, VISUAL AND MULTIMODAL AREAS IN EARLY DEAF INDIVIDUALS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reorganization; deaf; dorsal visual stream; ventral visual stream; plasticity; fMRI	CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MOVEMENT DETECTION TASK; HUMAN BRAIN PLASTICITY; CONGENITALLY DEAF; EARLY-BLIND; SIGN-LANGUAGE; CEREBRAL ORGANIZATION; ASSOCIATION CORTEX	Plasticity resulting from early sensory deprivation has been investigated in both animals and humans. After sensory deprivation, brain areas that are normally associated with the lost sense are recruited to carry out functions in the remaining intact modalities. Previous studies have reported that it is almost exclusively the visual dorsal pathway which is affected by auditory deprivation. The purpose of the current study was to further investigate the possible reorganization of visual ventral stream functions in deaf individuals in both the auditory and the visual cortices. Fifteen pre-lingual profoundly deaf subjects were compared with a group of 16 hearing subjects. We used fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to explore the areas underlying the processing of two similar visual motion stimuli that however were designed to evoke different types of processing: (1) a global motion stimulus (GMS) which preferentially activates regions of the dorsal visual stream, and (2) a form-from-motion (FFM) stimulus which is known to recruit regions from both visual streams. No significant differences between deaf and hearing individuals were found in target visual and auditory areas when the motion and form components of the stimuli were isolated (contrasted with a static visual image). However, increases in activation were found in the deaf group in the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22 and 42) and in an area located at the junction of the parieto-occipital sulcus and the calcarine fissure (encompassing parts of the cuneus, precuneus and the lingual gyrus) for the GMS and FFM conditions as well as for the static image, relative to a baseline condition absent of any visual stimulation. These results suggest that the observed cross-modal recruitment of auditory areas in deaf individuals does not appear to be specialized for motion processing, but rather is present for both motion and static visual stimuli.

Protein Kinase C epsilon Is Required for Spinal Analgesic Synergy between Delta Opioid and Alpha-2A Adrenergic Receptor Agonist Pairs	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SUBSTANCE-P RELEASE; RAT DORSAL-HORN; MECHANICAL HYPERALGESIA; FUNCTIONAL COMPETENCE; INTRATHECAL MORPHINE; INDUCED NOCICEPTION; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; IN-VIVO; CLONIDINE; MICE	We recently showed that spinal synergistic interactions between delta opioid receptors (delta ORs) and alpha(2A) adrenergic receptors (alpha(2A)ARs) require protein kinase C (PKC). To identify which PKC isoforms contribute to analgesic synergy, we evaluated the effects of various PKC-isoform-specific peptide inhibitors on synergy between delta ORs and alpha(2A)ARs using the tail flick assay of thermal nociception in mice. Only a PKC epsilon inhibitor abolished synergy between a delta OR agonist and an alpha(2A)AR agonist. We tested a panel of combinations of opioid and adrenergic agonists in PKC epsilon knock-out mice and found that all four combinations of a delta OR agonist and an alpha(2A)AR agonist required PKC epsilon for antinociceptive synergy. None of the combinations of a mu OR agonist with an alpha(2)AR agonist required PKC epsilon. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that PKC epsilon could be found in the population of peptidergic primary afferent nociceptors where delta ORs and alpha(2A)ARs have been found to extensively colocalize. Immunoreactivity for PKC epsilon was found in the majority of dorsal root ganglion neurons and intensely labeled laminae I and II of the spinal cord dorsal horn. PKC epsilon is widespread in the spinal nociceptive system and in peptidergic primary afferents it appears to be specifically involved in mediating the synergistic interaction between delta ORs and alpha(2A)ARs.

The induction of growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) was identified as an early event of neurogenesis. The present study tested the hypothesis that the de novo synthesis of neurofilament-M by nestin((+)) cells was preceded by the transient upregulation of GAP43 during the acute phase of reparative fibrosis in the infarcted male rat heart. Secondly, a seminal feature of diabetes is impaired wound healing secondary to an inadequate neurogenic response. In this regard, an additional series of experiments tested the hypothesis that the neurogenic response of cardiac nestin((+)) cells was attenuated in a setting of type I diabetes. Methods: The neurogenic response of cardiac nestin((+)) cells was examined during the early phase of reparative fibrosis following permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the adult male rat heart. The experimental model of type I diabetes was created following a single injection of streptozotocin in adult male rats. The impact of a type I diabetic environment on the neurogenic response of cardiac nestin((+)) cells was examined during myocardial infarction and following the administration of 6-hydroxydopamine. Results: During the early phase of scar formation/healing, the density of GAP43/nestin((+)) fibres innervating the peri-infarct/infarct region was significantly increased, whereas neurofilament-M/nestin((+)) fibres were absent. With ongoing scar formation/healing, a temporal decrease of GAP43/nestin((+)) fibre density and a concomitant increase in the density of innervating neurofilament-M/nestin((+)) fibres were observed. The neurogenic response of cardiac nestin((+)) cells during scar formation/healing was inhibited following the superimposition of type I diabetes. The de novo synthesis of neurofilament-M by nestin((+)) cells after 6-hydroxydopamine administration was likewise attenuated in the heart of type I diabetic rats whereas the density of GAP43/nestin((+)) fibres remained elevated. Conclusion: The transient upregulation of GAP43 apparently represents a transition event during the acquisition of a neuronal-like phenotype and a type I diabetic environment attenuated the neurogenic response of cardiac nestin((+)) cells to ischemia and 6-hydroxydopamine.

Here, we present in vitro and in vivo evidences that the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) is expressed along the retino-thalamic pathway and exerts a modulatory action on axon guidance. These effects are specific to CB2R since no changes were observed in mice where the gene coding for this receptor was altered (cnr2(-/-)). The CB2R induced morphological changes observed at the growth cone are PKA dependent and require the presence of the netrin-1 receptor, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer. Interfering with endogenous CB2R signalling using pharmacological agents increased retinal axon length and induced aberrant projections. Additionally, cnr2(-/-) mice showed abnormal eye-specific segregation of retinal projections in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) indicating CB2R's implication in retinothalamic development. Overall, this study demonstrates that the contribution of endocannabinoids to brain development is not solely mediated by CB1R, but also involves CB2R.

Thomas			Bile acids induce apoptosis selectively in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells	PEERJ			English	Article						Bile acids; Lithocholic acid; Apoptosis; Prostate cancer; Chemotherapy; In vitro; Cell death; Cytotoxicity; Mitochondrial membrane permeability; Extracellular		Prostate cancer is a prevalent age-related disease in North America, accounting for about 15% of all diagnosed cancers. We have previously identified lithocholic acid (LCA) as a potential chemotherapeutic compound that selectively kills neuroblastoma cells while sparing normal human neurons. Now, we report that LCA inhibits the proliferation of androgen-dependent (AD) LNCaP prostate cancer cells and that LCA is the most potent bile acid with respect to inducing apoptosis in LNCaP as well as androgen-independent (AI) PC-3 cells, without killing RWPE-1 immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells. In LNCaP and PC-3 cells, LCA triggered the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and cell death induced by LCA was partially dependent on the activation of caspase-8 and -3. Moreover, LCA increased cleavage of Bid and Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and activation of caspase-9. The cytotoxic actions of LCA occurred despite the inability of this bile acid to enter the prostate cancer cells with about 98% of the nominal test concentrations present in the extracellular culture medium. With our findings, we provide evidence to support a mechanism of action underlying the broad anticancer activity of LCA in various human tissues.	[Goldberg, Alexander A.; Sanderson, J.

We use high resolution melting analysis (HRM) as a simple translatable PCR-based method to define methylation states in clinical samples. We tested seven regions selected from the shortlist of genes hypomethylated in HCC and showed that HRM analysis of several of them distinguishes methylation states in liver cancer specimens from normal adjacent liver and chronic hepatitis in the Shanghai area. Such regions were identified within promoters of neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6-B (GPM6B) and melanoma antigen family A12 (MAGEA12) genes. Differences in HRM in the immunoglobulin superfamily Fc receptor (FCRL1) separated invasive tumors from less invasive HCC. The identified biomarkers differentiated HCC from chronic hepatitis in another set of samples from Dhaka. Although the main thrust in DNA methylation diagnostics in cancer is on hypermethylated genes, our study for the first time illustrates the potential use of hypomethylated genes as markers for solid tumors. After further validation in a larger cohort, the identified DNA hypomethylated regions can become important candidate biomarkers for liver cancer diagnosis and prognosis, especially in populations with high risk for HCC development.

The empirical basis for these discussions is limited, given that the actual nature of factors that influence the acceptability of and willingness to use cognitive enhancement substances remains unclear. In an online factorial survey, contextual and substance-specific characteristics of substances that improve academic performance were varied experimentally and presented to respondents. Students in four German universities rated their willingness to use and moral acceptance of different substances for cognitive enhancement. We found that the overall willingness to use performance enhancing substances is low. Most respondents considered the use of these substances as morally unacceptable. Situational influences such as peer pressure, policies concerning substance use, relative performance level of peers, but also characteristics of the substance, such as perceptions of substance safety, shape the willingness and acceptability of using a substance to enhance academic performance. Among the findings is evidence of a contagion effect meaning that the willingness was higher when the respondents have more CE drug users in their social network. We also found deterrence effects from strong side effects of using the substance, as well as from policy regulations and sanctions. Regulations might activate social norms against usage and sanctions can be seen as costly to users. Moreover, enhancement substances seem to be most tempting to low performers to catch up with others compared to high performers. By identifying contextual factors and substance characteristics influencing the willingness and acceptability of cognitive enhancers, policy approaches could consider these insights to better manage the use of such substances.

A key unanswered question is through which pathways non-visual inputs are funneled to the visual cortex. Here we used tomographic analysis of single trial magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded from one congenitally blind and two sighted subjects after stimulation of the left and right median nerves at three intensities: below sensory threshold, above sensory threshold and above motor threshold; the last sufficient to produce thumb twitching. We identified reproducible brain responses in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices at around 20 ms post-stimulus, which were very similar in sighted and blind subjects. Time-frequency analysis revealed strong 45-70 Hz activity at latencies of 20-50 ms in S1 and M1, and posterior parietal cortex Broadman areas (BA) 7 and 40, which compared to lower frequencies, were substantially more pronounced in the blind than the sighted subjects. Critically, at frequencies from alpha-band up to 100 Hz we found clear, strong, and widespread responses in the visual cortex of the blind subject, which increased with the intensity of the somatosensory stimuli. Time-delayed mutual information (MI) revealed that in blind subject the stimulus information is funneled from the early somatosensory to visual cortex through posterior parietal BA 7 and 40, projecting first to visual areas V5 and V3, and evantually V1. The flow of information through this pathway occurred in stages characterized by convergence of activations into specific cortical regions. In sighted subjects, no linked activity was found that led from the somatosensory to the visual cortex through any of the studied brain regions. These results provide the first evidence from MEG that in blind subjects, tactile information is routed from primary somatosensory to occipital cortex via the posterior parietal cortex.

The Lyapunov function and singularly perturbed techniques are used to develop the stable learning procedures for the hidden layers and output layers of the dynamic neural networks model. The proposed learning algorithm is similar to the well-known propagation rule of the multilayer perceptrons but with the novel correction terms which guarantee bounded tracking errors and bounded weights. The passivity approach is used to prove that the proposed neural identifier is robust and avoids the need for persistently exciting (PE) conditions. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated via simulation of an electric DC motor and an induction motor identification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

METHODS: This is a nested case-control study based on a prospective cohort of 7,929 pregnant women recruited in the Quebec City metropolitan area, including 214 participants who developed a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and 428 normotensive participants in the control group matched for parity, multiple pregnancy, smoking status, gestational, and maternal age at inclusion, and duration of blood sample storage. Serum folate levels were measured at a mean of 14 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: More than 98% of the participants took folic acid or multivitamins before the end of the first trimester. Mean serum folate levels were accordingly high and there were no differences between women who further developed a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy compared with women in the control group (60.1 nmol/L compared with 57.9 nmol/L; P=.51). The proportion of participants with serum folate below the 10th percentile (less than 22.3 nmol/L) of age-matched women in our outpatient population was similar between groups (P=.66) and no participant had levels generally defined as folate deficiency (less than 10 nmol/L). CONCLUSION: In a general cohort of pregnant women benefiting from a national policy of folic acid food fortification combined with a high adherence to folic acid supplementation, serum folate levels are high and do not differ between women who develop a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and women who remain normotensive. Further supplementation with higher doses is unlikely to be beneficial in such populations.

Pain behavior and immunohistological analysis in intervertebral disc (IVD) injury model. Objective. To investigate pain behavior in a rat model of IVD injury using the CatWalk system. Summary of Background Data. There are few reports examining low back pain behavior in animal models. The CatWalk is a computer-assisted gait analysis system that provides an automated way to assess gait function and pain-related alterations of this behavior. Methods. In the IVD injury group, L5-L6 IVDs were injured with a 24-gauge needle. Simultaneously, the neurotracer Fluoro-Gold (FG; Fluorochrome, Denver, CO) was injected into the L5-L6 IVDs. In the sham group, FG was injected into the L5-L6 IVDs only. Animals in the control group received no operation. One, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after surgery, the gait of rats in the 3 groups was investigated using the CatWalk system. One, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery, in IVD injury and sham groups, dorsal root ganglions from the L1 to L6 levels were resected. Dorsal root ganglions were immunostained for calcitonin gene-related peptide. Results. In the IVD injury group, the mean stands of hind paws and the mean duty cycle of front paws at some time points were significantly higher than those in the sham group. Furthermore, the mean stride length of the front and hind paws and the mean swing speed of the front and hind paws at some time points were significantly shorter than those in the sham group. The proportion of calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive, FG-labeled neurons among all FG-labeled dorsal root ganglion neurons in the IVD injury group was significantly higher than the corresponding proportion in the sham group. Conclusion. These results suggest that IVD injury produced significant changes in rat gait, including longer stance phases and shorter strides. In the future, we may be able to apply the CatWalk system to the evaluation of behavior associated with pain in models of low back pain.

Case series and feasibility studies seem to indicate a therapeutic effect; however, randomized sham-controlled, proof-of-principle studies relating clinical effects to activation patterns are missing. Methods Twenty-four patients with subacute poststroke aphasia were randomized to a 10-day protocol of 20-minute inhibitory 1 Hz rTMS over the right triangular part of the posterior inferior frontal gyrus or sham stimulation, followed by 45 minutes of speech and language therapy. Activity in language networks was measured with O-15-water positron emission tomography during verb generation before and after treatment. Language performance was assessed using the Aachen Aphasia Test battery. Results The primary outcome measure, global Aachen Aphasia Test score change, was significantly higher in the rTMS group (t test, P=0.003). Increases were largest for subtest naming (P=0.002) and tended to be higher for comprehension, token test, and writing (P<0.1). Patients in the rTMS group activated proportionally more voxels in the left hemisphere after treatment than before (difference in activation volume index) compared with sham-treated patients (t test, P=0.002).There was a moderate but significant linear relationship between activation volume index change and global Aachen Aphasia Test score change (r(2)=0.25; P=0.015). Conclusions Ten sessions of inhibitory rTMS over the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus, in combination with speech and language therapy, significantly improve language recovery in subacute ischemic stroke and favor recruitment of left-hemispheric language networks.

An association between sleep spindles and IQ has been found in adults, but only two previous studies have explored this topic in children. The goal of this study was to examine whether sleep spindle frequency, amplitude, duration and/or density were associated with performance on the perceptual reasoning, verbal comprehension, working memory, and processing speed subscales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). We recruited 29 typically developing children 7-11 years of age. We used portable polysomnography to document sleep architecture in the natural home environment and evaluated IQ We found that lower sleep spindle frequency was associated with better performance on the perceptual reasoning and working memory WISC-IV scales, but that sleep spindle amplitude, duration and density were not associated with performance on the IQ test.

Design: Multicentered prospective observational study. Setting: Neurological, Neurosurgical, Neurosciences or Surgical Trauma ICUs from three hospitals (two in Canada and one in the United States). Patients: A convenience sample of adult NICU or neurologic, neurosurgical, neurosciences, or surgical trauma ICU patients admitted for greater than 12 hours from November 2011 to April 2012. Interventions: Systematic assessments were simultaneously and independently performed by a neurologist, intensivists, or trauma surgeon, and a nurse in three multispecialty ICUs. Pain was evaluated with the numeric rating scale or behavioral pain scale. Sedation was assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Patients with Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale greater than or equal to -4 were screened for features of delirium with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate inter-rater reliability between the nurse and the physician for pain and sedation scales, and the kappa coefficient was calculated for concordance of the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist items. Measurements and Main Results: 151 patients had 439 assessments. Pain and sedation were always assessable with excellent inter-rater reliability (numeric rating scale intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.92; behavior pain scale intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.83; and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.92). Patients were sufficiently alert for delirium screening 3/4 of the time; Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist items had good concordance (kappa coefficients between 0.58 and 0.91 for the eight Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist items). Nonevaluable items were most often orientation, hallucinations, and speech or mood content. Furthermore, each additional Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist item present in proportion to the total evaluable Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score was associated with a 10% increase in ICU length of stay. Conclusions: Pain and sedation can be systematically assessed in the neurologically critically ill; the majority can also be screened for delirium features with excellent inter-rater reliability. Increased proportion of Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist items is associated with worse outcomes.

In mutant mice carrying loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in Cacna1a, which encodes the 1 pore-forming subunit of Ca(V)2.1 (P/Q-type) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, generalized spike-wave seizures have been suggested to result from excessive bursting of thalamocortical cells. However, other cellular populations including cortical inhibitory interneurons may contribute to this phenotype. We investigated how different cortical interneuron subtypes are affected by the loss of Ca(V)2.1 channel function and how this contributes to the onset of generalized epilepsy. Methods We designed genetic strategies to induce a selective Cacna1a LOF mutation in different cortical -aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) and/or glutamatergic neuronal populations in mice. We assessed the cellular and network consequences of these mutations by combining immunohistochemical assays, in vitro physiology, optogenetics, and in vivo video electroencephalographic recordings. Results We demonstrate that selective Cacna1a LOF from a subset of cortical interneurons, including parvalbumin (PV)(+) and somatostatin (SST)(+) interneurons, results in severe generalized epilepsy. Loss of Ca(V)2.1 channel function compromises GABA release from PV+ but not SST+ interneurons. Moreover, thalamocortical projection neurons do not show enhanced bursting in these mutants, suggesting that this feature is not essential for the development of generalized spike-wave seizures. Notably, the concurrent removal of Ca(V)2.1 channels in cortical pyramidal cells and interneurons considerably lessens seizure severity by decreasing cortical excitability. Interpretation Our findings demonstrate that conditional ablation of Ca(V)2.1 channel function from cortical PV+ interneurons alters GABA release from these cells, impairs their ability to constrain cortical pyramidal cell excitability, and is sufficient to cause generalized seizures.

XIAP Regulates Caspase Activity in Degenerating Axons	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							APOPTOSIS PROTEIN XIAP; LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; STRUCTURAL BASIS; HUMAN INHIBITOR; DROSOPHILA; ACTIVATION; NEURONS; PATHWAY; MECHANISMS	Our knowledge of the destructive events that regulate axonal degeneration is rudimentary. Here, we examine the role of caspases and their endogenous inhibitor, the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), in axonal degeneration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons. We show that caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-9 are present in axons and are cleaved upon nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal. We observed that caspase-3 activity is high in NGF-withdrawn axons and that CASP3(-/-) axons are protected from degeneration. XIAP(-/-) DRG sensory neurons degenerate more rapidly and contain more active caspase-3 than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that axonal caspases are normally regulated by XIAP. Importantly, axonal XIAP levels drop sharply after NGF withdrawal; if XIAP levels are maintained by overexpression, axonal caspase-3 activation and axonal degeneration are suppressed. Finally, we show that XIAP(-/-) embryos have stunted dermal innervation. We propose that XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition plays an important role in regulating morphogenic events that shape the nervous system during development.

Like most cyanobacteria, L wollei produce toxins, named lyngbyatoxin (LYNGTX), an analog of saxitoxin. In order to verify the neurotoxic potential of these filamentous cyanobacteria, we collected amphipods within local vegetation at three sites in summer months: a site rich in L wollei (Lake St-Louis [LSL]) and two urban sites composed of macrophytes but devoid of L wollei mats (Richelieu River [RICH] and L'Assomption River [ASSO] outlets). The body weight of each amphipod was measured, and the neurotoxicity was estimated with the measurement of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activities. Levels of protein-bound phosphates were also evaluated, to rule out contamination by Microcystis sp. The results showed that the activity of acetylcholinesterase measured in amphipods in ASSO and RICH was lower than the activity found in amphipods collected in L wollei mats in LSL. In addition, amphipods found in L wollei mats at the LSL site have significantly higher GST activity than those located at the two devoid sites, RICH and ASSO. No significant change was observed for protein-bound phosphate levels. This study suggests that the presence of L wollei triggers potential toxicity.

Npas4 Is a Novel Activity-Regulated Cytoprotective Factor in Pancreatic beta-Cells	DIABETES			English	Article							ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; ISLET AMYLOID POLYPEPTIDE; INSULIN GENE-EXPRESSION; UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; IN-VIVO; C-FOS; TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROGRAM; GLUCOSE-HOMEOSTASIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ER STRESS	Cellular homeostasis requires intrinsic sensing mechanisms to temper function in the face of prolonged activity. In the pancreatic beta-cell, glucose is likely a physiological trigger that activates an adaptive response to stimulation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. Immediate early genes (IEGs) are activated as a first line of defense in cellular homeostasis and are largely responsible for transmitting an environmental cue to a cellular response. Here we examine the regulation and function of the novel beta-cell IEG, neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4). Using MIN6 cells, mouse and human islets, as well as in vivo infusions, we demonstrate that Npas4 is expressed within pancreatic islets and is upregulated by beta-cell depolarizing agents. Npas4 tempers beta-cell function through a direct inhibitory interaction with the insulin promoter and by blocking the potentiating effects of GLP-1 without significantly reducing glucose-stimulated secretion. Finally, Npas4 expression is induced by classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors and can prevent thapsigargin- and palmitate-induced dysfunction and cell death. These results suggest that Npas4 is a key activity-dependent regulator that improves beta-cell efficiency in the face of stress. We posit that Npas4 could be a novel therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes that could both reduce ER stress and cell death and maintain basal cell function.	[Sabatini, Paul V.; Krentz, Nicole A.

Studies from sleep centers have found that at least 40-65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will develop a defined neurodegenerative phenotype over 10 years. This elevated risk of neurodegeneration has been recently confirmed in a population-based study of probable RBD. When a defined syndrome develops, it is almost always a 'synucleinopathy' (Parkinson's disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies or multiple system atrophy). Often, manifestations of parkinsonism and cognitive impairment overlap. The ability of RBD to predict disease has major implications for development of neuroprotective therapy. First, RBD is a prodromal marker with a disease risk sufficiently high for design of neuroprotective trials. Second, study of idiopathic RBD allows prospective testing of other predictive markers of neurodegeneration. Third, it allows an unprecedented direct examination of the evolution of prodromal disease into defined neurodegenerative syndromes. This review summarizes what is known about the risk of neurodegeneration in idiopathic RBD, the utility of prodromal/predictive markers in synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration, and the evolution of motor and nonmotor markers in prodromal stages.

We aim to analyze in all brain regions the occurrence and significance of this particular pattern. Methods: Twenty patients implanted in mesial temporal and neocortical areas were studied. One minute of slow-wave sleep was reviewed. The background was classified as continuous/semicontinuous, irregular, or sporadic based on the duration of the fast oscillations. Each channel was classified as inside/outside the seizure onset zone (SOZ) or a lesion. Results: The continuous/semicontinuous HFA occurred in 54 of the 790 channels analyzed, with a clearly higher prevalence in hippocampus and occipital lobe. No correlation was found with the SOZ or lesions. In the occipital lobe the continuous/semicontinuous HFA was present independently of whether eyes were open or closed. Conclusions: We describe what appears to be a new physiological High Frequency Activity, independent of epileptogenicity, present almost exclusively in the hippocampus and occipital cortex but independent of the alpha rhythm. Significance: The continuous HFA may be an intrinsic characteristic of specific brain regions, reflecting a particular type of physiological neuronal activity.

Influence of contact size on the detection of HFOs in human intracerebral EEG recordings	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						High frequency oscillations; Ripples; Intracerebral recordings; Stereoelectroencephalography	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; INTRACRANIAL EEG; 80-500 HZ; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FOCAL SEIZURES; FAST RIPPLES; HIPPOCAMPUS	Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are brief electroencephalographic events associated with epileptic activity, and likely representing biological markers of the epileptogenic zone. HFOs are usually detected with intracranial EEG and detection is influenced by contact size. The size of commercially available intracerebral electrodes varies widely. This study assesses HFO detection rates from adjacent electrode contacts in human intracerebral recordings. Methods: Intracerebral recordings were collected from 11 patients undergoing stereoelectroencephalographic investigation using hybrid depth electrodes containing adjacent large (0.8 or 5 mm(2)) and small (0.2 or 0.3 mm(2)) contacts. HFOs were marked manually during 5-min tracings in 131 pairs of adjacent large and small contacts. HFO rates per minute and mean event durations were compared between adjacent contacts. Results: A minimal but statistically significant advantage in ripple detection was found in a subgroup of large contacts. Otherwise, HFO rates and mean event durations were not statistically different between groups. Conclusion: The size of clinical contacts within the studied range did not influence HFO detection in a clinically relevant manner. Larger contacts provide a minimal advantage for ripple detection. Significance: Our findings suggest that commercially available intracerebral electrodes with contacts between 0.2 and 5 mm(2) likely possess similar HFO detection abilities.

This study aimed to examine the age-related changes of the Mismatch Negativity component (MMN) in response to speech and non-speech stimuli in a cross-sectional design. Results revealed distinct patterns of activation according to stimulus type and age. Age-related differences for tone discrimination occurred earlier in children's development than did the discriminative process for speech sounds. Therefore, networks involved in speech processing are still immature in late childhood and may be more vulnerable to physiological changes.

Cough and airway function were assessed by plethysmography following inhaled or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) NGF treatment. Expression of TrkA and/or TRPV1 was determined in bronchi and/or brainstem by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. I.c.v. and inhaled NGF enhanced citric acid induced-cough and airway obstruction. Pretreatment (i.c.v.) with antagonists of TrkA (K252a) or TRPV1 (IRTX) significantly reduced both the NGF (i.c.v.) enhanced cough and airway obstruction whereas the NK1 antagonist (FK888) inhibited only cough. The H-1 antagonist (cetirizine) did not affect either. Inhaled NGF increased phosphorylation of TrkA receptors in the bronchi but not the brainstem at 0.5 h post-treatment. TrkA mRNA was elevated at 0.5 h in the bronchi and at 24 h in the brainstem while TRPV1 mRNA was elevated from 0.5 h to 24h in brainstem and at 24h in the bronchi. Pretreatment (i.c.v.) with IRTX, but not K252a, significantly inhibited the inhaled NGF-enhanced cough. Central NGF administration enhances cough and airway obstruction by mechanisms dependent on central activation of TrkA, TRPV1 and NK1 receptors while inhaled NGF enhances cough via a mechanism dependent on central TRPV1 and not TrkA receptors. These data show that NGF, in addition to its effects on the airways, has an important central mechanism of action in the enhancement of cough. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting NGF signaling in both the airways and CNS may be more effective in the management of cough. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pyroglutamate-3 Amyloid-beta Deposition in the Brains of Humans, Non-Human Primates, Canines, and Alzheimer Disease-Like Transgenic Mouse Models	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							TRUNCATED A-BETA; PRECURSOR-PROTEIN; GLUTAMINYL CYCLASE; PLAQUE-FORMATION; TERMINAL FRAGMENTS; SENILE PLAQUES; MUTANT FORM; EARLY-ONSET; IN-VITRO; MICE	Amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides, starting with pyroglutamate at the third residue (pyroGlu-3 A beta), are a major species deposited in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Recent studies suggest that this isoform shows higher toxicity and amyloidogenecity when compared to full-length A beta peptides. Here, we report the first comprehensive and comparative IHC evaluation of pyroGlu-3 A beta deposition in humans and animal models. PyroGlu-3 A beta immunoreactivity (IR) is abundant in plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy of AD and Down syndrome patients, colocalizing with general A beta IR. PyroGlu-3 A beta is further present in two nontransgenic mammalian models of cerebral amyloidosis, Caribbean vervets, and beagle canines. In addition, pyroGlu-3 A beta deposition was analyzed in 12 different AD-like transgenic mouse models. In contrast to humans, all transgenic models showed general All deposition preceding pyroGlu-3 A beta deposition. The findings varied greatly among the mouse models concerning age of onset and cortical brain region. In summary, pyroGlu-3 A beta is a major species of beta-amyloid deposited early in diffuse and focal plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in humans and nonhuman primates, whereas it is deposited later in a subset of focal and vascular amyloid in AD-like transgenic mouse models. Given the proposed decisive role of pyroGlu-3 A beta peptides for the development of human AD pathology, this study provides insights into the usage of animal models in AD studies.

In experimental models, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) rather than previously myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) are responsible for remyelination. This study compares the relative susceptibility of adult human OPCs and mature OLs to injury in actively demyelinating MS Lesions and under in vitro stress conditions. In all Lesions (n = 20), the number of OLs (Olig2 weak/NogoA positive) was reduced compared to control white matter (mean 38 +/- 4% of control value). In 11 cases, OPC numbers (Olig2 strong; NogoA negative) were also decreased; in eight of these, the reduction was greater for OPCs than for OLs. In the other nine samples, OPC numbers were greater than control white matter, indicating ongoing OPC migration and/or proliferation. Analysis of co-cultures with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons confirmed that OPCs were more capable of contacting and ensheathing axons than OLs. In isolated culture under stress conditions (withdrawal of serum/glucose and/or antioxidants), OPCs showed increased cell death and reduced process extension compared to OLs. Under all culture conditions, OPCs up-regulated expression of genes in the extrinsic proapoptotic pathway, and had increased susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death as compared to OLs. Our data suggest that susceptibility of OPCs to injury within the MS Lesion environment contributes to the limited remyelination in MS.

Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome	CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Restless legs syndrome; RLS; Treatment; Dopaminergics; Dopamine agonists; Augmentation; Levodopa; Opioids; Anticonvulsants; Iron	LONG-TERM SAFETY; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHM; DOUBLE-BLIND; PRACTICE PARAMETERS; SENSORY SYMPTOMS; IRON DEXTRAN; SYNDROME RLS; OPEN-LABEL; AUGMENTATION; MANAGEMENT	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common, sensorimotor, circadian sleep disorder characterized by the urge to move the legs, particularly at nighttime. It is important to differentiate primary and secondary RLS from other conditions, which can mimic the symptoms of RLS, in particular neuropathy and cramps. Despite considerable advances, the understanding of RLS pathophysiology remains incomplete. Many hypotheses focus on central nervous system structures, although there is increasing evidence that peripheral structures may also be important. There is insufficient evidence at the moment to recommend changes in lifestyle, nutritional supplements and any specific nonpharmacologic treatments. The first-line drugs continue to be dopaminergic medications, including pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine transdermal patch and levodopa. However, the phenomenon of RLS augmentation, a paradoxical worsening of symptoms by dopaminergic treatment remains as major problem in treatment of RLS, and prevention of augmentation is one of the main goals in the management of RLS. RLS requires treatment only if it has a significant impact on the patient's nighttime sleep or daily activities. Doses of dopamine agonists should be kept to the minimum required for acceptable symptom reduction. Augmentation may require treatment withdrawal, with prescription of alternate medication. Alternative or additional pharmacologic treatment with a lower level of overall quality of evidence includes opioids (codeine, tramadol, and oxycodone) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin). The choice of the medication should be based on the severity of RLS and the effectiveness of medication for the short-term or long-term treatment of RLS. Iron deficiency must be identified at diagnosis; treatment may improve RLS symptoms and potentially may lower risk of augmentation. There is no clear evidence for treatment of secondary RLS, but agents used in primary RLS should be tried. Comparative long-term trials are required to assess differences in efficacy and augmentation rates between medications used for treatment of RLS.

We propose an approach where sequential scans are jointly segmented, to provide a temporally consistent tissue segmentation while remaining sensitive to newly appearing lesions. The method uses a two-stage classification process: 1) a Bayesian classifier provides a probabilistic brain tissue classification at each voxel of reference and follow-up scans, and 2) a random-forest based lesion-level classification provides a final identification of new lesions. Generative models are learned based on 364 scans from 95 subjects from a multi-center clinical trial. The method is evaluated on sequential brain MRI of 160 subjects from a separate multi-center clinical trial, and is compared to 1) semi-automatically generated ground truth segmentations and 2) fully manual identification of new lesions generated independently by nine expert raters on a subset of 60 subjects. For new lesions greater than 0.15 cc in size, the classifier has near perfect performance (99% sensitivity, 2% false detection rate), as compared to ground truth. The proposed method was also shown to exceed the performance of any one of the nine expert manual identifications.

IMAGEN Consortium	Altered Reward Processing in Adolescents With Prenatal Exposure to Maternal Cigarette Smoking	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DRUG-USE; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; OFFSPRING BRAIN; RISK-TAKING; PREGNANCY; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; REINFORCEMENT; ACTIVATION	IMPORTANCE Higher rates of substance use and dependence have been observed in the offspring of mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Animal studies indicate that prenatal exposure to nicotine alters the development of brain areas related to reward processing, which might be a risk factor for substance use and addiction later in life. However, no study has examined the effect of maternal smoking on the offspring's brain response during reward processing. OBJECTIVE To determine whether adolescents with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking differ from their nonexposed peers in the response of the ventral striatum to the anticipation or the receipt of a reward. DESIGN An observational case-control study. SETTING Data were obtained from the IMAGEN Study, a European multicenter study of impulsivity, reinforcement sensitivity, and emotional reactivity in adolescents. The IMAGEN sample consists of 2078 healthy adolescents (age range, 13-15 years) recruited from March 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, in local schools. PARTICIPANTS We assessed an IMAGEN subsample of 177 adolescents with prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking and 177 nonexposed peers (age range, 13-15 years) matched by sex, maternal educational level, and imaging site. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Response to reward in the ventral striatum measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS In prenatally exposed adolescents, we observed a weaker response in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation (left side, F = 14.98 [P<.001]; right side, F = 15.95 [P<.001]) compared with their nonexposed peers. No differences were found regarding the responsivity of the ventral striatum to the receipt of a reward (left side, F = 0.21 [P=.65]; right side, F = 0.47 [P=.49]). CONCLUSIONS The weaker responsivity of the ventral striatum to reward anticipation in prenatally exposed adolescents may represent a risk factor for substance use and development of addiction later in life. This result highlights the need for education and preventive measures to reduce smoking during pregnancy. Future analyses should assess whether prenatally exposed adolescents develop an increased risk for substance use and addiction and which role the reported neuronal differences during reward anticipation plays in this development.

Decreased hippocampal mineralocorticoid:glucocorticoid receptor ratio is associated with low birth weight in female cynomolgus macaque neonates	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						glucocorticoid receptor; cynomolgus macaque; low birth weight; MR:GR ratio	INTRAUTERINE GROWTH-RESTRICTION; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; MESSENGER-RNA; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; BRAIN; FETAL; EXPRESSION; STRESS; DEXAMETHASONE	During pregnancy, glucocorticoids transfer environmental signals to the growing brain and its associated neuroendocrine system to modulate their maturation and function during adolescence and adulthood. Increased in utero exposure to glucocorticoids is associated with impaired fetal growth resulting in low birth weight (LBW) and compromised neural development. The underlying molecular changes affecting brain development, however, are largely unknown. Here, we compared the relative mRNA expression of genes directly involved in glucocorticoid signaling in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex of female non-human primate neonates (Macaca fascicularis) of naturally occurring normal birth weight and LBW. We focused on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) genes as well as that for 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1) and found a significantly decreased MR:GR mRNA ratio in the hippocampus and lower expression of 11 beta-HSD1 in the amygdala associated with LBW. The MR:GR mRNA ratio in the amygdala and cortex was not associated with birth weight, reflecting tissue-specific effects. Protein quantification in the hippocampus confirmed our finding of a decreased hippocampal MR: GR ratio. Our data suggest that the MR:GR ratio in the hippocampus and the expression of 11 beta-HSD1 in the amygdala are associated with intrauterine growth restriction in non-human primates during early perinatal development.

Method: Data were collected from 97 infants, of whom 16 were high-familial-risk infants later classified as having an ASD, 40 were high-familial-risk infants who did not later meet ASD criteria (high-risk negative), and 41 were low-risk infants. All infants underwent an eye-tracking task at a mean age of 7 months and a clinical assessment at a mean age of 25 months. Diffusion-weighted imaging data were acquired for 84 of the infants at 7 months. Primary outcome measures included average saccadic reaction time in a visually guided saccade procedure and radial diffusivity (an index of white matter organization) in fiber tracts that included corticospinal pathways and the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum. Results: Visual orienting latencies were longer in 7-month-old infants who expressed ASD symptoms at 25 months compared with both high-risk negative infants and low-risk infants. Visual orienting latencies were uniquely associated with the microstructural organization of the splenium of the corpus callosum in low-risk infants, but this association was not apparent in infants later classified as having an ASD. Conclusions: Flexibly and efficiently orienting to salient information in the environment is critical for subsequent cognitive and social-cognitive development. Atypical visual orienting may represent an early prodromal feature of an ASD, and abnormal functional specialization of posterior cortical circuits directly informs a novel model of ASD pathogenesis.

This coordination is in large part based on central pattern generators (CPGs). These neural networks are capable of producing complex rhythmic patterns when activated and modulated by relatively simple control signals. Although the generation of particular gaits by CPGs has been successfully modeled at many levels of abstraction, the principles underlying the generation and selection of a diversity of patterns of coordination in a single neural network are still not well understood. The present work specifically addresses the flexibility of the spinal locomotor networks in salamanders. We compare an abstract oscillator model and a CPG network composed of integrate-and-fire neurons, according to their ability to account for different axial patterns of coordination, and in particular the transition in gait between swimming and stepping modes. The topology of the network is inspired by models of the lamprey CPG, complemented by additions based on experimental data from isolated spinal cords of salamanders. Oscillatory centers of the limbs are included in a way that preserves the flexibility of the axial network. Similarly to the selection of forward and backward swimming in lamprey models via different excitation to the first axial segment, we can account for the modification of the axial coordination pattern between swimming and forward stepping on land in the salamander model, via different uncoupled frequencies in limb versus axial oscillators (for the same level of excitation). These results transfer partially to a more realistic model based on formal spiking neurons, and we discuss the difference between the abstract oscillator model and the model built with formal spiking neurons.

System and methods for wide-field quantitative fluorescence imaging during neurosurgery	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article							TISSUE	We report an accurate, precise and sensitive method and system for quantitative fluorescence image-guided neurosurgery. With a low-noise, high-dynamic-range CMOS array, we performrapid (integration times as low as 50 ms per wavelength) hyperspectral fluorescence and diffuse reflectance detection and apply a correction algorithm to compensate for the distorting effects of tissue absorption and scattering. Using this approach, we generated quantitative wide-field images of fluorescence in tissue-simulating phantoms for the fluorophore PpIX, having concentrations and optical absorption and scattering variations over clinically relevant ranges. The imaging system was tested in a rodent model of glioma, detecting quantitative levels down to 20 ng/ml. The resulting performance is a significant advance on existing wide-field quantitative imaging techniques, and provides performance comparable to a point-spectroscopy probe that has previously demonstrated significant potential for improved detection of malignant brain tumors during surgical resection.

Differential expression and methylation of brain developmental genes define location-specific subsets of pilocytic astrocytoma	ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA			English	Article						Pilocytic astrocytoma; DNA methylation; Development; SUZ12	MAPK PATHWAY ACTIVATION; LOW-GRADE ASTROCYTOMAS; FUSION GENE; DUPLICATION; MUTATIONS; SENESCENCE; RESOLUTION; MAJORITY; CHILDREN; GLIOMAS	Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) are the most common brain tumors in pediatric patients and can cause significant morbidity, including chronic neurological deficiencies. They are characterized by activating alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but little else is known about their development. To map the global DNA methylation profiles of these tumors, we analyzed 62 PAs and 7 normal cerebellum samples using Illumina 450K microarrays. These data revealed two subgroups of PA that separate according to tumor location (infratentorial versus supratentorial), and identified key neural developmental genes that are differentially methylated between the two groups, including NR2E1 and EN2. Integration with transcriptome microarray data highlighted significant expression differences, which were unexpectedly associated with a strong positive correlation between methylation and expression. Differentially methylated probes were often identified within the gene body and/or regions up- or downstream of the gene, rather than at the transcription start site. We also identified a large number of differentially methylated genes between cerebellar PAs and normal cerebellum, which were again enriched for developmental genes. In addition, we found a significant association between differentially methylated genes and SUZ12 binding sites, indicating potential disruption of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2). Taken together, these data suggest that PA from different locations in the brain may arise from region-specific cells of origin, and highlight the potential disruption of key developmental regulators during tumorigenesis. These findings have implications for future basic research and clinical trials, as therapeutic targets and drug sensitivity may differ according to tumor location.

However, the role of these factors and the mechanisms by which they elicit their effects in retina are not known. We investigated whether activated microglia during early stages of ischemic retinopathy produces excessive interleukin-1 (IL-1), which elicits retinal microvascular degeneration not directly but rather by triggering the release of the proapoptotic/repulsive factor semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) from neurons. Approach and Results Sprague Dawley rats subjected to retinopathy induced by hyperoxia (80% O-2; O-2-induced retinopathy) exhibited retinal vaso-obliteration associated with microglial activation, NLRP3 upregulation, and IL-1 and Sema3A release; IL-1 was mostly generated by microglia. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-1 receptor antagonists (Kineret, or rytvela [101.10]) decreased these effects and enhanced retinal revascularization; knockdown of Sema3A resulted in microvessel preservation and, conversely, administration of IL-1 caused vaso-obliteration. In vitro, IL-1 derived from activated primary microglial cells, cultured under hyperoxia, stimulated the release of Sema3A in retinal ganglion cells-5, which in turn induced apoptosis of microvascular endothelium; antagonism of IL-1 receptor decreased microglial activation and on retinal ganglion cells-5 abolished the release of Sema3A inhibiting ensuing endothelial cell apoptosis. IL-1 was not directly cytotoxic to endothelial cells. Conclusions Our findings suggest that in the early stages of O-2-induced retinopathy, retinal microglia are activated to produce IL-1, which sustains the activation of microglia and induces microvascular injury through the release of Sema3A from adjacent neurons. Interference with IL-1 receptor or Sema3A actions preserves the microvascular bed in ischemic retinopathies and, consequently, decreases ensued pathological preretinal neovascularization.

Large-scale natural history studies of gross motor development have shown that children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) plateau during childhood and actually decline through adolescence. Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is a well-recognized treatment for spastic CP, but little is known about long-term outcomes of this treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the durability of functional outcomes in a large number of patients through adolescence and into early adulthood using standardized assessment tools. Methods. The authors analyzed long-term follow-up data in children who had been evaluated by a multidisciplinary team preoperatively and at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years after SDR. These evaluations included quantitative, standardized assessments of lower-limb tone (Ashworth Scale), Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), and performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) by the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory in children who had been stratified by motor severity using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). In addition, group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to identify any heterogeneity of response to SDR among these treated children, and to find which pretreatment variables might be associated with this heterogeneity. Finally, a chart review of adjunct orthopedic procedures required by these children following SDR was performed. Results. Of 102 patients who underwent preoperative evaluations, 97, 62, 57, and 14 patients completed postoperative assessments at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. After SDR, through adolescence and into early adulthood, statistically significant durable improvements in lower-limb muscle tone, gross motor function, and performance of ADLs were found. When stratified by the GMFCS, long-lasting improvements for GMFCS Groups I, II, and III were found. The GBTM revealed 4 groups of patients who responded differently to SDR. This group assignment was associated with distribution of spasticity (diplegia was associated with better outcomes than triplegia or quadriplegia) and degree of hip adductor spasticity (Ashworth score < 3 was associated with better outcomes than a score of 3), but not with age, sex, degree of ankle plantar flexion spasticity, or degree of hamstring spasticity. In a sample of 88 patients who had complete records of orthopedic procedures and botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, 52 (59.1%) underwent SDR alone, 11 (12.5%) received only Botox injections in addition to SDR, while 25 patients (28.4%) needed further lower-extremity orthopedic surgery after SDR. Conclusions. In the majority of patients, the benefits of SDR are durable through adolescence and into early adulthood. These benefits include improved muscle tone, gross motor function, and performance of ADLs, as well as a decreased need for adjunct orthopedic procedures or Botox injections. The children most likely to display these long-term benefits are those in GMFCS Groups I, II, and III, with spastic diplegia, less hip adductor spasticity, and preoperative GMFM scores greater than 60.

Although selective nerve root involvement of the sensory roots has been described and termed chronic inflammatory sensory polyradiculoneuropathy (CISP), selective involvement of the proximal motor roots has not been described. Methods: Clinical, electrophysiological, MRI, and pathological findings are reported. Results: Here, we report a patient with cauda equina hypertrophy presenting with a pure lower motor neuron syndrome without clinical or electrophysiological evidence of sensory fiber involvement. Bowel and bladder functions were spared. Nerve root biopsy demonstrated abundant onion bulb formations. The patient experienced improvement in motor function with immunomodulatory treatment. Conclusions: We suggest the term chronic immune demyelinating motor polyradiculopathy (CIMP) to describe this particular form of CIDP, thereby expanding the clinical spectrum of CIDP.

Surgically inaccessible midline tumors are therapeutically challenging, showing sustained tendency for progression(3) and often becoming a chronic disease with substantial morbidities(4). Here we describe whole-genome sequencing of 96 pilocytic astrocytomas, with matched RNA sequencing (n = 73), conducted by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor Project. We identified recurrent activating mutations in FGFR1 and PTPN11 and new NTRK2 fusion genes in non-cerebellar tumors. New BRAF-activating changes were also observed. MAPK pathway alterations affected all tumors analyzed, with no other significant mutations identified, indicating that pilocytic astrocytoma is predominantly a single-pathway disease. Notably, we identified the same FGFR1 mutations in a subset of H3F3A-mutated pediatric glioblastoma with additional alterations in the NF1 gene(5). Our findings thus identify new potential therapeutic targets in distinct subsets of pilocytic astrocytoma and childhood glioblastoma.	[Jones, David T.

Deprenyl Enhances the Teratogenicity of Hydroxyurea in Organogenesis Stage Mouse Embryos	TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						teratogen; oxidative stress; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; nuclear translocation; glutathione; apoptosis; cell death; caspase-3	GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE; NITRIC-OXIDE; NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; BINDING-PROTEIN; DEATH CASCADE; CELL-DEATH; APOPTOSIS; GAPDH	Hydroxyurea, an antineoplastic drug, is a model teratogen. The administration of hydroxyurea to CD1 mice on gestation day 9 induces oxidative stress, increasing the formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal adducts to redox-sensitive proteins such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the caudal region of the embryo. GAPDH catalytic activity is reduced, and its translocation into the nucleus is increased. Because the nuclear translocation of GAPDH is associated with oxidative stressinduced cell death, we hypothesized that this translocation plays a role in mediating the teratogenicity of hydroxyurea. Deprenyl (also known as selegiline), a drug used as a neuroprotectant in Parkinsons disease, inhibits the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. Hence, timed pregnant CD1 mice were treated with deprenyl (10mg/kg) on gestation day 9 followed by the administration of hydroxyurea (400 or 600mg/kg). Deprenyl treatment significantly decreased the hydroxyurea-induced nuclear translocation of GAPDH in the caudal lumbosacral somites. Deprenyl enhanced hydroxyurea-mediated caudal malformations, inducing specifically limb reduction, digit anomalies, tail defects, and lumbosacral vertebral abnormalities. Deprenyl did not augment the hydroxyurea-induced inhibition of glycolysis or alter the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione. However, it did dramatically increase cleaved caspase-3 in embryos. These data suggest that nuclear GAPDH plays an important, region-specific, role in teratogen-exposed embryos. Deprenyl exacerbated the developmental outcome of hydroxyurea exposure by a mechanism that is independent of oxidative stress. Although the administration of deprenyl alone did not affect pregnancy outcome, this drug may have adverse consequences when combined with exposures that increase the risk of malformations.

Recovery of vesicular storage and release parameters after high frequency stimulation in rat hippocampus	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Synaptic depression; Replenishment rate; Model fitting; Recovery; Hippocampus	TERM SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION; MOTOR-NERVE TERMINALS; CENTRAL SYNAPSES; VESICLES; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; POOL; PLASTICITY; KINETICS; MOBILITY	The replenishment rates estimated from the recovery of synaptic efficacy following synaptic depression are known to be widely scattered. Given the importance of the replenishment during stimulation, especially if it is prolonged, it is important to better understand what influences the recovery of the synaptic efficacy following stimulation. We fit a two-pool model of vesicular secretion to the changes of the excitatory post-synaptic currents recorded in CA1 neurons of rat hippocampal slices to determine how the model parameters change during, and following, long stimulation. The replenishment rate at the end of stimulation inducing synaptic depression differs greatly from that at the beginning of stimulation. It decreases progressively and rapidly (by similar to 75 % and with a time constant of < 10 s) during stimulation, and this is followed by a similarly fast recovery (time constant of similar to 10 s), but to a steady-state that is approximately twice as large as its pre-stimulation value. Both [Ca++](o) and the duration of long stimulation influence the recovery of the replenishment rate. Its new steady-state is significantly higher, if either [Ca++](o) is higher or stimulation longer, but the recovery of the replenishment rate becomes clearly slower if [Ca++](o) is higher, and faster if stimulation is longer. Many factors thus influence the recovery of the replenishment rate and of the synaptic efficacy, but the stimulation induced [Ca++](i) accumulation cannot explain the change of the replenishment rate during recovery. Finally, okadaic acid, which speeds up vesicular trafficking, does not alter the recovery of the replenishment rate. The vesicular replenishment of the RRP following stimulation is thus not likely to be associated with significant vesicular movement.

Ototoxicity of olive oil in a chinchilla animal model	LARYNGOSCOPE			English	Article						Olive oil; ototoxicity; hearing loss; animal model; chinchilla; cerumen; ear wax		Objectives/Hypothesis Olive oil is often used by patients to soften ear wax or to relieve ear canal obstruction. It is also sold in drugstores as a cerumenolytic. To date, no study has assessed the safety of ototopical olive oil on hearing in the presence of tympanic membrane perforation. The present study aimed to assess the safety of ototopic olive oil on hearing in the presence of tympanic membrane perforation. Study Design Prospective, randomized, controlled trial in a chinchilla animal model. Materials and methods Eleven chinchillas underwent bilateral myringotomy. In each animal, one ear was randomly assigned to receive olive oil (experimental ear), while the contralateral control ear received normal saline. Auditory brain response (ABR) test was performed at baseline and then 7, 14, and 30 days following the application. Results At 30 days follow-up, there was no significant change in auditory brain response thresholds at 8, 16, 20, or 25 kHz. Scanning electron microscope imaging showed no damage to the hair cells. Conclusion Olive oil does not seem to cause hearing loss in chinchillas with perforated tympanic membranes. Future clinical studies are required.

Neurometabolic and microstructural alterations have been reported in the chronic phase following a concussion in male athletes, while no study has investigated these alterations in female athletes. Methods: Neurometabolic and microstructural alterations following a concussion were investigated by comparing 10 female athletes with a concussion and 10 control female athletes, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Athletes with concussion were scanned at least 7 months post-concussion (mean = 18.9 months). Results: MRS revealed a significant lower level of myo-inositol in the hippocampus and the primary motor cortices (M1) bilaterally. DTI analysis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) showed no difference in fractional anisotropy (FA) while higher level of mean diffusivity (MD) in athletes with concussion was detected in large white matter tracts including the forceps minors, inferior/superior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiations and corticospinal tract. Moreover, a region of interest approach for the corpus callosum revealed a significant lower level of FA in the segment containing fibres projecting to M1. Conclusions: This study demonstrates persistent neurometabolic and microstructural alterations in female athletes suffering a sports-related concussion.

Brain diseases, structural and/or functional, underlie the appearance of epilepsy, but the notion of epilepsy is larger and cannot be reduced exclusively to the brain. We can therefore look at epilepsy from two angles. The first perspective is intrinsic: the etiology and pathophysiology, problems of therapy, impact on the brain networks, and the "mind" aspects of brain functions - cognitive, emotional, and affective. The second perspective is extrinsic: the social interactions of the person with epilepsy, the influence of the surrounding environment, and the influences of epilepsy on society. All these aspects reaching far beyond the pure biological nature of epilepsy have been the topics of two International Congresses of Epilepsy, Brain, and Mind that were held in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2010 and 2012 (the third Congress will be held in Brno, Czech Republic on April 3-5, 2014; www.epilepsy-brain-mind2014.eu).

Eight healthy control subjects and 71 patients with AS (0.60 cm(2) EOA 1.90 cm(2)) underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and CMR. The valve opening slope (OS) and closing slope (CS) were calculated from instantaneous effective orifice area (EOA) curves obtained by CMR. Intra- and inter-observer variability were 4.8 3.9 and 5.0 4.1, respectively, for OS, 3.8 2.9 and 4.0 3.1 for CS. OS was significantly related to the plasma level of NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (r 0.36, P 0.002), whereas the EOA or gradient were not. This study demonstrates the excellent feasibility and reproducibility of CMR for the measurement of valve kinetic parameters in patients with AS. Larger studies are needed to confirm the incremental prognostic value of these new CMR parameters of aortic valve kinetics in patients with severe AS.

A trunk postural stability test has been proposed earlier, using a chair wobbling on a central pivot and four springs with adjustable positions to modulate task difficulty. An inertial sensor is fixed on the chair to measure postural sway. The aim of this study is to assess the criterion validity and between-day reliability of the calibration and testing components. Methods: Thirty six subjects (with and without low back pain) followed a calibration procedure, four practice trials and three 60-s trials on 2 days. The criterion validity of the inertial sensor was tested against an optoelectronic system and a force platform. The reliability of 38 body sway measures obtained from the inertial sensor angular measures was estimated. Results: The inertial sensor led to valid estimates of postural sway. The reliability of the calibration procedure was moderate. Practically no learning effect was detected except for a few body sway measures in patients with CLBP. Three 60-s trials provided acceptable reliability for approximately half of the body sway measures, although this is more difficult to achieve in patients with CLBP. Discussion: The use of an easy to use inertial sensor led to valid measures of postural sway. A number of body sway measures were identified as reliable tools for individual follow-ups but inter-subject comparisons were anticipated as more difficult when patients with CLBP are involved.

We pursued the present systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of rTMS for OCD and to generate hypotheses for more robustly powered RCTs. Method: We searched the literature for RCTs on rTMS for OCD from 1995 through December 2012 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS. We then performed an exploratory random-effects meta-analysis with the main outcome measures as pre-post changes in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores, response to treatment and overall dropout rates at study end. Results: Data were obtained from 10 RCTs, totaling 282 subjects with OCD. The pooled Hedges' g for pre-post Y-BOCS scores was 0.59 (z = 2.73, p = 0.006), indicating a significant and medium-sized difference in outcome favoring active rTMS. Furthermore, response rates were 35% and 13% for patients receiving active and sham rTMS, respectively (OR = 3.4, p = 0.002). Sub-group analyses indicated that LF-rTMS and rTMS protocols targeting non-DLPFC regions (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex or supplementary motor area) seem to be the most promising for reducing OCD-related symptoms. No differences on baseline depression scores or dropout rates at study end were observed between active and sham rTMS groups, although OCD severity at baseline was higher in the active group. Conclusions: Our exploratory analyses show that active rTMS seems to be efficacious for treating OCD. Moreover, LF-rTMS and protocols targeting the orbitofrontal cortex or the supplementary motor area seem to be the most promising. Nevertheless, future RCTs on rTMS for OCD should include larger sample sizes and be more homogeneous in terms of demographic/clinical variables as well as stimulation parameters and brain targets.

Behavioral evidence for photophobia and stress-related ipsilateral head pain in transgenic Cacna1a mutant mice	PAIN			English	Article						Headache; Migraine; Animal model; Spontaneous pain; Ca(v)2.1; Mutant	FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC MIGRAINE; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; CORTICAL SPREADING DEPRESSION; RATS INFRAORBITAL NERVE; ELEVATED PLUS-MAZE; CALCIUM-CHANNEL; TRIGGER FACTORS; ANIMAL-MODELS; MOUSE; ANXIETY	Migraine is a highly prevalent, disabling and complex episodic brain disorder whose pathogenesis is poorly understood, due in part to the lack of valid animal models. Here we report behavioral evidence of hallmark migraine features, photophobia and unilateral head pain, in transgenic knock-in mice bearing human familial hemiplegic migraine, type 1 (FHM-1) gain-of-function missense mutations (R192Q or S218L) in the Cacna1a gene encoding the Ca(V)2.1 calcium channel alpha(1) subunit. Photophobia was demonstrated using a modified elevated plus maze in which the safe closed arms were brightly illuminated; mutant mice avoided the light despite showing no differences in the standard (anxiety) version of the test. Multiple behavioral measures suggestive of spontaneous head pain were found in 192Q mutants subjected to novelty and/or restraint stress. These behaviors were: (1) more frequent in mutant versus wildtype mice; (2) lateralized in mutant but not in wildtype mice; (3) more frequent in females versus males; and (4) dose-dependently normalized by systemic administration of 2 different acute analgesics, rizatriptan and morphine. Furthermore, some of these behaviors were found to be more frequent and severe in 218L compared to 192Q mutants, consistent with the clinical presentation in humans. We suggest that Cacna1a transgenic mice can experience migraine-related head pain and can thus serve as unique tools to study the pathogenesis of migraine and test novel antimigraine agents.

Both human and mouse COMT genes possess functional polymorphisms contributing to interindividual variability in pain phenotypes such as sensitivity to noxious stimuli, severity of clinical pain, and response to pain treatment. In this study, we found that the effects of Comt functional variation in mice are modality specific. Spontaneous inflammatory nociception and thermal nociception behaviors were correlated the most with the presence of the B2 SINE transposon insertion residing in the 3'UTR mRNA region. Similarly, in humans, COMT functional haplotypes were associated with thermal pain perception and with capsaicin-induced pain. Furthermore, COMT genetic variations contributed to pain behaviors in mice and pain ratings in humans in a sex-specific manner. The ancestral Comt variant, without a B2 SINE insertion, was more strongly associated with sensitivity to capsaicin in female vs male mice. In humans, the haplotype coding for low COMT activity increased capsaicin-induced pain perception in women, but not men. These findings reemphasize the fundamental contribution of COMT to pain processes, and provide a fine-grained resolution of this contribution at the genetic level that can be used to guide future studies in the area of pain genetics.

However, these methods rely on a tight coupling of neuronal activity to hemodynamic changes. Because pain may be associated with hemodynamic changes unrelated to local neuronal activity (eg, increased mean arterial pressure [MAP]), it is essential to determine whether the neurovascular coupling is maintained during nociceptive processing. In this study, local field potentials (LFP) and cortical blood flow (CBF) changes evoked by electrical stimulation of the left hind paw were recorded concomitantly in the right primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in 15 rats. LFP, CBF, and MAP changes were examined in response to stimulus intensities ranging from 3 to 30 mA. In addition, LFP, CBF, and MAP changes evoked by a 10-mA stimulation were examined during immersion of the tail in non-nociceptive or nociceptive hot water (counter-stimulation). SI neurovascular coupling was altered for stimuli of nociceptive intensities (P < 0.001). This alteration was intensity-dependent and was strongly associated with MAP changes (r = 0.98, P < 0.001). However, when the stimulus intensity was kept constant, SI neurovascular coupling was not significantly affected by nociceptive counter-stimulation (P = 0.4), which similarly affected the amplitude of shock-evoked LFP and CBF changes. It remains to be determined whether such neurovascular uncoupling occurs in humans, and whether it also affects other regions usually activated by painful stimuli. These results should be taken into account for accurate interpretation of fMRI studies that involve nociceptive stimuli associated with MAP changes.

Neural processes integrating reward, emotional states and decision-making can supersede satiety signals to promote excessive caloric intake and weight gain. While nutritional habits are influenced by reward-based neural mechanisms, nutrition and its impact on energy metabolism, in turn, plays an important role in the control of food reward. Feeding modulates the release of metabolic hormones that have an important influence on central controls of appetite. Nutrients themselves are also an essential source of energy fuel, while serving as key metabolites and acting as signalling molecules in the neural pathways that control feeding and food reward. Along these lines, this review discusses the impact of nutritionally regulated hormones and select macronutrients on the behavioural and neural processes underlying the rewarding effects of food.

The objective of this study was to compare steroid use in 2 cohorts 5years apart and to document the short- and long-term outcomes of our most recent cohort. Methods Retrospective chart review of infants born under 28weeks of gestational age for two cohorts (January 2002-August 2003 and July 2008-March 2010). Results Two hundred and fourteen infants were included. More infants received steroids in the later cohort (20% vs 35%, p=0.021) but survival rates did not improve. There was a shift towards hydrocortisone use (<7% vs 76%) and pulmonary indications (36% vs 61% of courses; p=0.021). Patients died later (8days vs 30days; p=0.02), with a strong correlation between time of death and total dose of steroids (r=0.91; p=0.01). Neurodevelopmental outcomes for patients who received steroids for pulmonary indications were inferior to those for the rest of the cohort (severe adverse outcome 26% vs 4.8%, p=0.03). Conclusion The improvement in short-term respiratory status of ill preterm patients was offset by a disturbing increase in age at death and no improvement in survival rates.

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in learning to infer correspondences from data using relational, spatiotemporal, and bilinear variants of deep learning methods. These methods use multiplicative interactions between pixels or between features to represent correlation patterns across multiple images. In this paper, we review the recent work on relational feature learning, and we provide an analysis of the role that multiplicative interactions play in learning to encode relations. We also discuss how square-pooling and complex cell models can be viewed as a way to represent multiplicative interactions and thereby as a way to encode relations.

The first model, which we call spike-and-slab sparse coding (S3C), is a preexisting model for which we introduce a faster approximate inference algorithm. We introduce a deep variant of S3C, which we call the partially directed deep Boltzmann machine (PD-DBM) and extend our S3C inference algorithm for use on this model. We describe learning procedures for each. We demonstrate that our inference procedure for S3C enables scaling the model to unprecedented large problem sizes, and demonstrate that using S3C as a feature extractor results in very good object recognition performance, particularly when the number of labeled examples is low. We show that the PD-DBM generates better samples than its shallow counterpart, and that unlike DBMs or DBNs, the PD-DBM may be trained successfully without greedy layerwise training.

There is, however, some controversy concerning the presence of the CB2 receptor (CB2R) within the central nervous system. Only recently, CB2R has been found in the rodent retina, but its presence in the primate retina has not yet been demonstrated. The aim of this study was twofold: 1) to characterize the distribution patterns of CB2R in the monkey retina and compare this distribution with that previously reported for CB1R and 2) to resolve the controversy on the presence of CB2R in the neural component of the retina. We therefore thoroughly examined the cellular localization of CB2R in the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus sabeus) retina, using confocal microscopy. Our results demonstrate that CB2R, like CB1R, is present throughout the retinal layers, but with striking dissimilarities. Double labeling of CB2R and glutamine synthetase shows that CB2R is restricted to Muller cell processes, extending from the internal limiting membrane, with very low staining, to the external limiting membrane, with heavy labeling. We conclude that CB2R is indeed present in the retina but exclusively in the retinal glia, whereas CB1R is expressed only in the neuroretina.

Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to determine whether a link could be established for 2 immune markers at the post-transcriptional level; CD68 and MHC-II, in a normally aged (24-month-old) rat population discriminated for their learning abilities. Using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task, aged rats were divided into aged learning-impaired (AI) or -unimpaired (AU) groups. Western immunoblots of hippocampal tissue revealed a significant increase of CD68 in AI rats compared to the AU group. Moreover, up-regulated CD68 expression correlated with increased latency times in the MWM task. Immunofluorescence for CD68 revealed intense staining in the white matter regions and CA3 subregion of the hippocampus in the AI group. Despite expression of MHC-II in the AI group, no correlation was found. Overall, these data suggest that CD68 could play a role associated with cognitive decline in a subgroup of the normally aged population. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We present both group and single-subject experimental or case-series design options for doing this and address advantages and disadvantages of each. We also discuss general components of and requirements for treatment research studies, including operational definitions of variables, criteria for defining behavioral change and treatment efficacy, and reliability of measurement. Important considerations that are unique to neuroimaging-based treatment research are addressed, pertaining to the relation between the selected treatment approach and anticipated changes in language processes/functions and how such changes are hypothesized to map onto the brain.

CHP1-Mediated NHE1 Biosynthetic Maturation Is Required for Purkinje Cell Axon Homeostasis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CALCINEURIN HOMOLOGOUS PROTEIN; NA+/H+ EXCHANGER NHE1; CA2+-BINDING PROTEIN; ESSENTIAL COFACTOR; PH REGULATION; DEGENERATION; MECHANISMS; EXPRESSION; DISEASE; BINDING	Axon degeneration is a critical pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Misregulation of local axonal ion homeostasis has been recognized as an important yet understudied mechanism for axon degeneration. Here we report a chemically induced, recessive mouse mutation, vacillator (vac), which causes ataxia and concomitant axon degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells. By positional cloning, we identified vac as a point mutation in the calcineurin-like EF hand protein 1 (Chp1) gene that resulted in the production of mutant CHP1 isoforms with an amino acid substitution in a functional EF-hand domain or a truncation of this motif by aberrant splicing and significantly reduced protein levels. CHP1 has been previously shown to interact with the sodium hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), a major regulator of intracellular pH. We demonstrated that CHP1 assists in the full glycosylation of NHE1 that is necessary for the membrane localization of this transporter and that truncated isoforms of CHP1 were defective in stimulating NHE1 biosynthetic maturation. Consistent with this, membrane localization of NHE1 at axon terminals was greatly reduced in Chp1-deficient Purkinje cells before axon degeneration. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Nhe1 also resulted in Purkinje cell axon degeneration, pinpointing the functional convergence of the two proteins. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the polarized presynaptic localization of NHE/CHP1 is an important feature of neuronal axons and that selective disruption of NHE1-mediated proton homeostasis in axons can lead to degeneration, suggesting that local regulation of pH is pivotal for axon survival.

High-grade astrocytomas (HGAs), in particular, are lethal in children across all ages. Integrative genome-wide analyses of the tumor's genome, transcriptome and epigenome, using next-generation sequencing technologies and genome-wide DNA methylation arrays, have provided valuable breakthroughs in our understanding of the pathogenesis of HGAs across all ages. Recent profiling studies have provided insight into the epigenetic nature of gliomas in young adults and HGAs in children, particularly with the identification of recurrent gain-of-function driver mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 genes (IDH1/2) and the epigenetic influence of their oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, as well as mutations in the histone 3 variant 3 gene (H3F3A) and loss-of-function mutations in the histone 3 lysine 36 trimethyltransferase gene (SETD2). Mutations in H3F3A result in amino acid substitutions at residues thought to directly (K27M) or indirectly (G34R/V) affect histone post-translational modifications, suggesting they have the capacity to affect the epigenome in a profound manner. Here, we review recent genomic studies, and discuss evidence supporting the molecular characterization of pediatric HGAs to complement traditional approaches, such as histology of resected tumors. We also describe newly identified molecular mechanisms and discuss putative therapeutic approaches for HGAs specific to pediatrics, highlighting the necessity for the evolution of HGA disease management approaches.

This overlap has encouraged speculation that both "daydreaming" and dreaming may engage similar brain mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we systematically examined published first-person experiential reports of MW and dreaming and found many similarities: in both sates, content is largely audiovisual and emotional, follows loose narratives tinged with fantasy, is strongly related to current concerns, draws on long-term memory, and simulates social interactions. Both states are also characterized by a relative lack of meta-awareness. To relate first-person reports to neural evidence, we compared meta-analytic data from numerous functional neuroimaging (PET, fMRI) studies of the default mode network (DMN, with high chances of MW) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (with high chances of dreaming). Our findings show large overlaps in activation patterns of cortical regions: similar to MW/DMN activity, dreaming and REM sleep activate regions implicated in self-referential thought and memory, including medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial temporal lobe structures, and posterior cingulate. Conversely, in REM sleep numerous PFC executive regions are deactivated, even beyond levels seen during waking MW. We argue that dreaming can be understood as an "intensified" version of waking MW: though the two share many similarities, dreams tend to be longer, more visual and immersive, and to more strongly recruit numerous key hubs of the DMN. Further, where as MW recruits fewer PFC regions than goal-directed thought, dreaming appears to be characterized by an even deeper quiescence of PFC regions involved in cognitive control and metacognition, with a corresponding lack of insight and meta-awareness. We suggest, then, that dreaming amplifies the same features that distinguish MW from goal-directed waking thought.	[Fox, Kieran C.

The Neuroanatomical Organization of Projection Neurons Associated with Different Olfactory Bulb Pathways in the Sea Lamprey, Petromyzon marinus	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYNAPTIC ORGANIZATION; NERVUS TERMINALIS; CHANNEL CATFISH; MEDIAL REGION; MITRAL CELLS; PHEROMONE; INFORMATION; INHIBITION; LOCOMOTION; MORPHOLOGY	Although there is abundant evidence for segregated processing in the olfactory system across vertebrate taxa, the spatial relationship between the second order projection neurons (PNs) of olfactory subsystems connecting sensory input to higher brain structures is less clear. In the sea lamprey, there is tight coupling between olfaction and locomotion via PNs extending to the posterior tuberculum from the medial region of the olfactory bulb. This medial region receives peripheral input predominantly from the accessory olfactory organ. However, the axons from olfactory sensory neurons residing in the main olfactory epithelium extend to non-medial regions of the olfactory bulb, and the non-medial bulbar PNs extend their axons to the lateral pallium. It is not known if the receptive fields of the PNs in the two output pathways overlap; nor has the morphology of these PNs been investigated. In this study, retrograde labelling was utilized to investigate the PNs belonging to medial and non-medial projections. The dendrites and somata of the medial PNs were confined to medial glomerular neuropil, and dendrites of non-medial PNs did not enter this territory. The cell bodies and dendrites of the non-medial PNs were predominantly located below the glomeruli (frequently deeper in the olfactory bulb). While PNs in both locations contained single or multiple primary dendrites, the somal size was greater for medial than for non-medial PNs. When considered with the evidence-to-date, this study shows different neuroanatomical organization for medial olfactory bulb PNs extending to locomotor control centers and non-medial PNs extending to the lateral pallium in this vertebrate.

These network influences could directly impact on how neuronal groups interact together, organizing for different contexts. The cerebellar cortex harbors a variety of such local circuit rhythms, from the rhythms in the cerebellar cortex per se, or those dictated from important afferents. We present here certain cerebellar oscillatory phenomena that have been recorded in rodents and primates. Those take place in a range of frequencies: from the more known oscillations in the 4-25 Hz band, such as the olivocerebellar oscillatory activity and the granule cell layer oscillations, to the more recently reported slow (<1 Hz oscillations), and the fast (>150 Hz) activity in the Purkinje cell layer. Many of these oscillations appear spontaneously in the circuits, and are modulated by behavioral imperatives. We review here how those oscillations are recorded, some of their modulatory mechanisms, and also identify some of the cerebellar nodes where they could interact. A particular emphasis has been placed on how these oscillations could be modulated by movement and certain neuropathological manifestations. Many of those oscillations could have a definite impact on the way information is processed in the cerebellum and how it interacts with other structures in a variety of contexts.

This sprouting correlated with an increase in pain-related sensitivity. We hypothesized that this sprouting and pain-related behavior were caused by an increase in nerve growth factor (NGF) levels. In this study, we investigated whether the inhibition of mature NGF degradation, using a matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) inhibitor, was sufficient to reproduce a similar phenotype. Results: Behavioral tests performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after intra-plantar MMP-2/9 inhibitor administration demonstrated that acute and chronic injections of the MMP-2/9 inhibitor induced sensitization, in a dose dependent manner, to mechanical, hot and cold stimuli as measured by von Frey filaments, Hargreaves and acetone tests, respectively. Moreover, the protein levels of mature NGF (mNGF) were increased, whereas the levels and enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 were reduced in the glabrous skin of the hind paw. MMP-2/9 inhibition also led to a robust sprouting of sympathetic fibers into the upper dermis but there were no changes in the density of peptidergic nociceptive afferents. Conclusions: These findings indicate that localized MMP-2/9 inhibition provokes a pattern of sensitization and fiber sprouting comparable to that previously obtained following CFA injection. Accordingly, the modulation of endogenous NGF levels should be considered as a potential therapeutic target for the management of inflammatory pain associated with arthritis.

The first seven PCs cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues, and SKI-1/S1P cleaves its substrates at non-basic residues in the Golgi. PCSK9 cleaves itself once, and the secreted inactive protease escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation. It regulates the levels of circulating LDL cholesterol and is considered a major therapeutic target in phase III clinical trials.

Implicit self-depressed associations are related to depression status and reduced remission probability. It is unknown whether these cognitive vulnerabilities precede the first onset of depression. Aim: To test the predictive value of cognitive reactivity and implicit self-depressed associations for the incidence of depressive disorders. Methods: Prospective cohort study of 834 never-depressed individuals, followed over a two-year period. The predictive value of cognitive reactivity and implicit self-depressed associations for the onset of depressive disorders was assessed using binomial logistic regression. The multivariate model corrected for baseline levels of subclinical depressive symptoms, neuroticism, for the presence of a history of anxiety disorders, for family history of depressive or anxiety disorders, and for the incidence of negative life events. Results: As single predictors, both cognitive reactivity and implicit self-depressed associations were significantly associated with depression incidence. In the multivariate model, cognitive reactivity was significantly associated with depression incidence, together with baseline depressive symptoms and the number of negative life events, whereas implicit self-depressed associations were not. Conclusion: Cognitive reactivity to sad mood is associated with the incidence of depressive disorders, also when various other depression-related variables are controlled for. Implicit self-depressed associations predicted depression incidence in a bivariate test, but not when controlling for other predictors.	[Kruijt, Anne-Wil; Antypa, Niki; Penninx, Brenda W. J.

Specifically, increased activity in the amygdala and across mesolimbic dopaminergic regions during REM sleep is likely to promote the consolidation of memory traces with high emotional/motivational value. Moreover, coordinated hippocampal-striatal replay during NREM sleep may contribute to the selective strengthening of memories for important events. In this review, we suggest that, via the activation of emotional/motivational circuits, sleep and dreaming may offer a neurobehavioral substrate for the offline reprocessing of emotions, associative learning, and exploratory behaviors, resulting in improved memory organization, waking emotion regulation, social skills, and creativity. Dysregulation of such motivational/emotional processes due to sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, sleep deprivation) would predispose to reward-related disorders, such as mood disorders, increased risk-taking and compulsive behaviors, and may have major health implications, especially in vulnerable populations.

The most notable results were obtained with the shortest cyclic analogues, which showed a significant variation of their binding affinity toward mu and delta opioid receptors in relation to bridge substitution. NMR studies were performed to rationalize these data. Some small analogues were found to exist as at least one major and one minor stable forms, which could be separated by chromatography. In particular, the compounds 13 and 14 with a cyclic substituent were separated in three isomers and the basis of this multiplicity was explored by 2D NMR spectroscopy. All compounds were agonists with slight selectivity for the mu opioid receptor. Compounds 7a (thiourea bridge) and 10a (N-Me-guanidine bridge) showed nanomolar affinity toward mu receptor, the latter being the more selective for this receptor (40-fold).

Riociguat for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							SOLUBLE GUANYLATE-CYCLASE; 6-MINUTE WALK TEST; IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE; THERAPY; TRIALS; SILDENAFIL; DISEASE	BACKGROUND Riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, has been shown in a phase 2 trial to be beneficial in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. METHODS In this phase 3, double-blind study, we randomly assigned 443 patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension to receive placebo, riociguat in individually adjusted doses of up to 2.5 mg three times daily (2.5 mg-maximum group), or riociguat in individually adjusted doses that were capped at 1.5 mg three times daily (1.5 mg-maximum group). The 1.5 mg-maximum group was included for exploratory purposes, and the data from that group were analyzed descriptively. Patients who were receiving no other treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension and patients who were receiving endothelin-receptor antagonists or (nonintravenous) prostanoids were eligible. The primary end point was the change from baseline to the end of week 12 in the distance walked in 6 minutes. Secondary end points included the change in pulmonary vascular resistance, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, time to clinical worsening, score on the Borg dyspnea scale, quality-of-life variables, and safety. RESULTS By week 12, the 6-minute walk distance had increased by a mean of 30 m in the 2.5 mg-maximum group and had decreased by a mean of 6 m in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, 36 m; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 52; P<0.001). Prespecified subgroup analyses showed that riociguat improved the 6-minute walk distance both in patients who were receiving no other treatment for the disease and in those who were receiving endothelin-receptor antagonists or prostanoids. There were significant improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance (P<0.001), NT-proBNP levels (P<0.001), WHO functional class (P=0.003), time to clinical worsening (P=0.005), and Borg dyspnea score (P=0.002). The most common serious adverse event in the placebo group and the 2.5 mg-maximum group was syncope (4% and 1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Riociguat significantly improved exercise capacity and secondary efficacy end points in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Although age is the principal risk factor, other etiological mechanisms have been identified, including gene mutations and exposure to toxins. Deregulation of energy metabolism, mostly through the loss of complex I efficiency, is involved in disease progression in both the genetic and sporadic forms of the disease. In this study, we investigated energy deregulation in the cerebral tissue of animal models (genetic and toxin induced) of PD using an approach that combines metabolomics and mathematical modelling. In a first step, quantitative measurements of energy-related metabolites in mouse brain slices revealed most affected pathways. A genetic model of PD, the Park2 knockout, was compared to the effect of CCCP, a complex I blocker. Model simulated and experimental results revealed a significant and sustained decrease in ATP after CCCP exposure, but not in the genetic mice model. In support to data analysis, a mathematical model of the relevant metabolic pathways was developed and calibrated onto experimental data. In this work, we show that a short-term stress response in nucleotide scavenging is most probably induced by the toxin exposure. In turn, the robustness of energy-related pathways in the model explains how genetic perturbations, at least in young animals, are not sufficient to induce significant changes at the metabolite level.

Since the topographical characteristics of these different pathological processes in AD brain and how these relate to each other is not clear, this motivated further exploration using binding studies in postmortem brain with molecular imaging tracers. This information could aid the development of specific biomarkers to accurately chart disease progression. Results: In vitro binding assays demonstrated increased [H-3]-PIB (fibrillar A beta) and [H-3]-PK11195 (activated microglia) binding in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (HIP), as well as increased binding of [H-3]-L-deprenyl (activated astrocytes) in the HIP, but a decreased [3H]-nicotine (alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)) binding in the FC of AD cases compared to age-matched controls. Quantitative autoradiography binding studies were also performed to investigate the regional laminar distributions of [H-3]-L-deprenyl, [H-3]-PIB as well as [I-125]-alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha 7 nAChRs) and [H-3]-nicotine in hemisphere brain of a typical AD case. A clear lamination pattern was observed with high [H-3]-PIB binding in all layers and [H-3]-deprenyl in superficial layers of the FC. In contrast, [H-3]-PIB showed low binding to fibrillar A beta, but [H-3]-deprenyl high binding to activated astrocytes throughout the HIP. The [H-3]-PIB binding was also low and the [H-3]-deprenyl binding high in all layers of the medial temporal gyrus and insular cortex in comparison to the frontal cortex. Low [H-3]-nicotine binding was observed in all layers of the frontal cortex in comparison to layers in the medial temporal gyrus, insular cortex and hippocampus. Immunohistochemical detection in the AD case revealed abundant glial fibrillary acidic protein positive (GFAP(+)) reactive astrocytes and alpha 7 nAChR expressing GFAP(+) astrocytes both in the vicinity and surrounding A beta neuritic plaques in the FC and HIP. Although fewer A beta plaques were observed in the HIP, some hippocampal GFAP(+) astrocytes contained A beta-positive (6 F/3D) granules within their somata. Conclusions: Astrocytosis shows a distinct regional pattern in AD brain compared to fibrillar A beta, suggesting that different types of astrocytes may be associated with the pathophysiological processes in AD.

Here, we used the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist pioglitazone in an attempt to rescue the pathogenic phenotype in adult (12 months) and aged (>18 months) bitransgenic A/T mice that overexpress a mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APPSwe, Ind) and a constitutively active form of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). A/T mice recapitulate the AD-related cognitive deficits, amyloid beta (A beta) and cerebrovascular pathologies, as well as the altered metabolic and vascular coupling responses to increased neuronal activity. Pioglitazone normalized neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling responses to sensory stimulation, and reduced cortical astroglial and hippocampal microglial activation in both age groups. Spatial learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze were not rescued by pioglitazone, but reversal learning was improved in the adult cohort notwithstanding a progressing A beta pathology. While pioglitazone preserved the constitutive nitric oxide synthesis in the vessel wall, it unexpectedly failed to restore cerebrovascular reactivity in A/T mice and even exacerbated the dilatory deficits. These data demonstrate pioglitazone's efficacy on selective AD hallmarks in a complex AD mouse model of comorbid amyloidosis and cerebrovascular pathology. They further suggest a potential benefit of pioglitazone in managing neuroinflammation, cerebral perfusion and glucose metabolism in AD patients devoid of cerebrovascular pathology.

Twenty-eight scoliotic and twenty-five non-scoliotic able-bodied girls participated in this study. 3D coordinates of ten anatomic body landmarks were used to describe pelvic morphology and trunk posture using a Flock of Birds system. Standing balance was measured using a force plate to identify the center of pressure (COP), and its anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) displacements. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to determine differences between the two groups. A factor analysis was used to identify factors that best describe both groups. Statistical differences were identified between the groups for each of the parameter types. While spatial orientation of the pelvis was similar in both groups, five of the eight trunk postural variables of the scoliotic group were significantly different that the able-bodied group. Also, five out of the seven standing balance variables were higher in the scoliotic girls. Approximately 60% of the variation is supported by 4 factors that can be associated with a set of variables; standing balance variables (factor 1), body posture variables (factor 2), and pelvic morphology variables (factors 3 and 4). Pelvic distortion, body posture asymmetry, and standing imbalance are more pronounced in scoliotic girls, when compared to able-bodied girls. These findings may be beneficial when addressing balance and ankle proprioception exercises for the scoliotic population.

J	Altimimi, HF; Stellwagen, D				Altimimi, Haider F.; Stellwagen, David			Persistent Synaptic Scaling Independent of AMPA Receptor Subunit Composition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; PLASTICITY; LTP; TRAFFICKING; SYNAPSES; GLUR1; EXPRESSION; REQUIRES; ALPHA	Despite long-standing evidence that the specific intracellular domains of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) subunits are critical for trafficking, it has recently been demonstrated that there is no absolute requirement for any AMPAR subunit for the receptor insertion underlying LTP. It is unclear whether this holds true to other forms of plasticity. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is an important form of negative feedback that provides stability to neuronal networks, and results at least in part from the insertion of AMPARs into glutamatergic synapses following chronic reductions in neuronal activity. Similar to LTP, the GluA1 subunit has been suggested to be the requisite subunit for HSP-induced AMPAR insertion and acute treatment with signaling molecules that underlie some forms of HSP results in the preferential incorporation of GluA2-lacking receptors. However, knockdown experiments have instead implicated a requirement for the GluA2 subunit. Here we re-examined the requirement for specific AMPAR subunit during chronic tetrodotoxin-induced HSP using hippocampal cultures derived from AMPAR subunit knock-out mice. We observed HSP in cultures from GluA1(-/-), GluA2(-/-), and GluA2(-/-) GluA3(-/-) mice, and conclude that, as with LTP, there is no subunit requirement for HSP.

J	Konefal, S; Elliot, M; Crespi, B				Konefal, Sarah; Elliot, Mick; Crespi, Bernard			The adaptive significance of adult neurogenesis: an integrative approach	FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY			English	Review						adult neurogenesis; adaptive significance; evolution; pattern separation; olfaction	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NEURAL STEM-CELLS; GENERATED GRANULE CELLS; ENHANCED SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; BORN HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; OLFACTORY-BULB NEURONS; DENTATE GYRUS; PATTERN SEPARATION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NEWBORN NEURONS	Adult neurogenesis in mammals is predominantly restricted to two brain regions, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb (OB), suggesting that these two brain regions uniquely share functions that mediate its adaptive significance. Benefits of adult neurogenesis across these two regions appear to converge on increased neuronal and structural plasticity that subserves coding of novel, complex, and fine-grained information, usually with contextual components that include spatial positioning. By contrast, costs of adult neurogenesis appear to center on potential for dysregulation resulting in higher risk of brain cancer or psychological dysfunctions, but such costs have yet to be quantified directly. The three main hypotheses for the proximate functions and adaptive significance of adult neurogenesis, pattern separation, memory consolidation, and olfactory spatial, are not mutually exclusive and can be reconciled into a simple general model amenable to targeted experimental and comparative tests. Comparative analysis of brain region sizes across two major social ecological groups of primates, gregarious (mainly diurnal haplorhines, visually-oriented, and in large social groups) and solitary (mainly noctural, territorial, and highly reliant on olfaction, as in most rodents) suggest that solitary species, but not gregarious species, show positive associations of population densities and home range sizes with sizes of both the hippocampus and OB, implicating their functions in social territorial systems mediated by olfactory cues. Integrated analyses of the adaptive significance of adult neurogenesis will benefit from experimental studies motivated and structural by ecologically and socially relevant selective contexts.

J	Yusuf, A; Koski, L				Yusuf, Afiqah; Koski, Lisa			A qualitative review of the neurophysiological underpinnings of fatigue in multiple sclerosis	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Multiple sclerosis; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Fatigue; Motor threshold; Motor-evoked potential; Central motor conduction time; Intracortical inhibition; Intracortical facilitation; Exercise	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SILENT PERIOD; EXCITABILITY; DEPRESSION; BRAIN; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; EXERCISE	Fatigue is debilitating in multiple sclerosis (MS) and may have multiple causes. Recent investigations into objectively measurable correlates of fatigue have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine a range of neurophysiological measures of neural excitability that may be altered in patients with MS. This qualitative review was conducted to test the hypothesis that changes in neural excitability are a contributing factor in MS-related fatigue. A search of the English language literature led to the compilation and synthesis of original research papers in which various aspects of neural excitability and neural transmission were measured using TMS in patients with MS. The resulting papers were classified into three categories of study relevant to fatigue: abnormalities in excitability and their correlation with self-reported fatigue; effects of exercise-induced fatigue on neural excitability; and effects of fatigue medications on neural excitability. Evidence of an association between fatigue and intracortical inhibition is both limited and conflicting, and no evidence suggests associations of fatigue with corticomotor excitability or neuronal conduction. Pharmacologically-induced changes in fatigue were found to correlate with changes in intracortical excitability. No conclusions could be drawn regarding neural excitability and exercise-induced fatigue, due to variability in study populations, outcome measures, and exercise protocols across different studies. Suggestions for future studies in this area are proposed with a view to identifying potentially modifiable factors contributing to fatigue in MS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Common parietal activation in musical mental transformations across pitch and time	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory; fMRI; Music; Parietal lobe; Transformation	AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; FMRI; ROTATION; AREAS; LOBE; MECHANISMS; HEMISPHERE; PATHWAYS	We previously observed that mental manipulation of the pitch level or temporal organization of melodies results in functional activation in the human intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region also associated with visuospatial transformation and numerical calculation. Two outstanding questions about these musical transformations are whether pitch and time depend on separate or common processing in IPS, and whether IPS recruitment in melodic tasks varies depending upon the degree of transformation required (as it does in mental rotation). In the present study we sought to answer these questions by applying functional magnetic resonance imaging while musicians performed closely matched mental transposition (pitch transformation) and melody reversal (temporal transformation) tasks. A voxel-wise conjunction analysis showed that in individual subjects, both tasks activated overlapping regions in bilateral IPS, suggesting that a common neural substrate subserves both types of mental transformation. Varying the magnitude of mental pitch transposition resulted in variation of IPS BOLD signal in correlation with the musical key-distance of the transposition, but not with the pitch distance, indicating that the cognitive metric relevant for this type of operation is an abstract one, well described by music-theoretic concepts. These findings support a general role for the IPS in systematically transforming auditory stimulus representations in a nonspatial context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We utilized DTI deterministic tractography and structural network analysis based on graph theory to determine the pattern of structural connectivity asymmetry in 124 normal neonates. We tracted white matter axonal pathways characterizing interregional connections among brain regions and inferred asymmetry in left and right anatomical network properties. Our findings revealed that in neonates, small-world characteristics were exhibited, but did not differ between the two hemispheres, suggesting that neighboring brain regions connect tightly with each other, and that one region is only a few paths away from any other region within each hemisphere. Moreover, the neonatal brain showed greater structural efficiency in the left hemisphere than that in the right. In neonates, brain regions involved in motor, language, and memory functions play crucial roles in efficient communication in the left hemisphere, while brain regions involved in emotional processes play crucial roles in efficient communication in the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that even at birth, the topology of each cerebral hemisphere is organized in an efficient and compact manner that maps onto asymmetric functional specializations seen in adults, implying lateralized brain functions in infancy.

Recent studies have shown that Mec-17 and its paralog are responsible for alpha-tubulin acetylation in Caenorhabditis elegans. There is one such protein known as Atat1 (alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase 1) per higher organism. Zebrafish Atat1 appears to govern embryo development, raising the intriguing possibility that Atat1 is also critical for development in mammals. In addition to Atat1, three other mammalian acetyltransferases, ARD1-NAT1, ELP3, and GCN5, have been shown to acetylate alpha-tubulin in vitro, so an important question is how these four enzymes contribute to the acetylation in vivo. We demonstrate here that Atat1 is a major alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase in mice. It is widely expressed in mouse embryos and tissues. Although Atat1-null animals display no overt phenotypes, alpha-tubulin acetylation is lost in sperm flagella and the dentate gyrus is slightly deformed. Furthermore, human ATAT1 colocalizes on bundled microtubules with doublecortin. These results thus suggest that mouse Atat1 may regulate advanced functions such as learning and memory, thereby shedding novel light on the physiological roles of alpha-tubulin acetylation in mammals.

Identification of a Novel Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response Element Regulated by XBP1	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PRION PROTEIN GENE; CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB-DISEASE; CELLULAR PRION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; MESSENGER-RNA; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; EXPRESSION; SCRAPIE; CELLS	Understanding the regulatory mechanisms mediating PRNP gene expression is highly relevant to elucidating normal cellular prion protein (PrP) function(s) and the transmissibility of prion protein neurodegenerative diseases. Here, luciferase reporter assays showed that an endoplasmic reticulum stress element (ERSE)-like element, CCAAT-N26-CCACG in the human PRNP promoter, is regulated by ER stress and X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) but not by activating transcription factor 6 alpha (ATF6 alpha). Bioinformatics identified the ERSE-26 motif in 37 other human genes in the absence of canonical ERSE sites except for three genes. Several of these genes are associated with a synaptic function or are involved in oxidative stress. Brefeldin A, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin ER stressors induced gene expression of PRNP and four randomly chosen ERSE-26-containing genes, ERLEC1, GADD45B, SESN2, and SLC38A5, in primary human neuron cultures or in the breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell line, although the level of the response depends on the gene analyzed, the genetic background of the cells, the cell type, and the ER stressor. Overexpression of XBP1 increased, whereas siRNA knockdown of XBP1 considerably reduced, PRNP and ERLEC1 mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results identify a novel ER stress regulator, which implicates the ER stress response in previously unrecognized cellular functions.

Here, we address how these synergies are modified during voluntary gait modifications. Data were analysed from 27 bursts of muscle activity (recorded from 18 muscles) recorded in the forelimb of the cat during locomotion. These were grouped into 10 clusters, or synergies, during unobstructed locomotion. Each synergy was comprised of only a small number of muscles bursts (sparse synergies), some of which included both proximal and distal muscles. Eight (8/10) of these synergies were active during the swing phase of locomotion. Synergies observed during the gait modifications were very similar to those observed during unobstructed locomotion. Constraining these synergies to be identical in both the lead (first forelimb to pass over the obstacle) and the trail (second limb) conditions allowed us to compare the changes in phase and magnitude of the synergies required to modify gait. In the lead condition, changes were observed particularly in those synergies responsible for transport of the limb and preparation for landing. During the trail condition, changes were particularly evident in those synergies responsible for lifting the limb from the ground at the onset of the swing phase. These changes in phase and magnitude were adapted to the size and shape of the obstacle over which the cat stepped. These results demonstrate that by modifying the phase and magnitude of a finite number of muscle synergies, each comprised of a small number of simultaneously active muscles, descending control signals could produce very specific modifications in limb trajectory during locomotion. We discuss the possibility that these changes in phase and magnitude could be produced by changes in the activity of neurones in the motor cortex.

A whole-genome linkage mapping effort was made with three HSP-affected families from Spain, Portugal, and Tunisia and it allowed us to reduce the SPG26 locus interval from 34 to 9 Mb. Subsequently, a targeted capture was made to sequence the entire exome of affected individuals from these three families, as well as from two additional autosomal-recessive HSP-affected families of German and Brazilian origins. Five homozygous truncating (n = 3) and missense (n = 2) mutations were identified in B4GALNT1. After this finding, we analyzed the entire coding region of this gene in 65 additional cases, and three mutations were identified in two subjects. All mutated cases presented an early-onset spastic paraplegia, with frequent intellectual disability, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy as well as cortical atrophy and white matter hyperintensities on brain imaging. B4GALNT1 encodes beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 1 (B4GALNT1), involved in ganglioside biosynthesis. These findings confirm the increasing interest of lipid metabolism in HSPs. Interestingly, although the catabolism of gangliosides is implicated in a variety of neurological diseases, SPG26 is only the second human disease involving defects of their biosynthesis.

Lithium normalizes amphetamine-induced changes in striatal FoxO1 phosphorylation and behaviors in rats	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						Akt; amphetamine; behavior; bipolar disorder; Forkhead box; class O1; lithium; prepulse inhibition; schizophrenia; striatum	CELLULAR PLASTICITY CASCADES; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PREPULSE INHIBITION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; SURVIVAL; PATHWAY; KINASE; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Administration of the psychostimulant drug amphetamine (AMPH) to animals causes hyperactivity and deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, behaviors that are often observed in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Enhanced central dopamine (DA) transmission is believed to mediate AMPH-induced behavioral alterations. Lithium, a drug used primarily in the treatment of bipolar disorder, is reported to interact with the DA system and antagonize some DA-related behaviors. Here, we provide evidence that AMPH and lithium reciprocally regulate the activity of the transcription factor forkhead box, class O1 (FoxO1), a downstream target of Akt. Administration of d-AMPH (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) to Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in a concomitant decrease in levels of phosphorylated (p) Akt as well as p-FoxO1 in the striatum, whereas lithium chloride (LiCl,100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) exerted the opposite effect, that is, it increased levels of p-Akt and p-FoxO1. Pretreatment of animals with lithium prevented an AMPH-induced decrease in striatal p-Akt and p-FoxO1 levels. Pretreatment of animals with lithium also attenuated AMPH-induced locomotor activity and decreased prepulse inhibition. These in-vivo data suggest that the Akt-FoxO1 pathway may be a common target for the action of dopaminergic and antidopaminergic drugs, and its modulation may be relevant to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

In the absence of these modulatory inputs, for example during fictive locomotion after spinalization and curarization, spontaneous failures of motor activation (deletions) in a muscle can occur without perturbing the rhythmic cycle structure of the antagonists on the same side or the contralateral side. This suggests that the central pattern generator can maintain the locomotor period when motoneuron discharges fail in a given pool of motoneurons. Here we first examined whether such deletions could occur during real locomotion on a treadmill and determined their consequences on the overt locomotor pattern. We also evaluated the role of supraspinal and sensory inputs in modulating the occurrence of failures of rhythmic activity by comparing the same cats in the intact state, then after a partial spinal cord injury (SCI), and finally after a complete SCI at different treadmill speeds. We showed that deletions: (1) are absent in intact animals and occur only after SCI; (2) affect only flexor muscle activity; (3) neither perturb the timing of rhythmic activity of these muscles in subsequent cycles nor interfere with the timing of the ipsilateral and contralateral agonists and antagonists; (4) do not affect significantly the locomotor pattern kinematics; and (5) are sensitive to treadmill speed and lesion severity, suggesting a role for sensory and supraspinal inputs in stabilizing rhythmic output activity.

The current opioid prescription epidemic and the need for buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone (R); SUBX) as an opioid maintenance substance, and its growing street diversion provided impetus to determine affective states ("true ground emotionality'') in long-term SUBX patients. Toward the goal of effective monitoring, we utilized emotion-detection in speech as a measure of "true'' emotionality in 36 SUBX patients compared to 44 individuals from the general population (GP) and 33 members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Other less objective studies have investigated emotional reactivity of heroin, methadone and opioid abstinent patients. These studies indicate that current opioid users have abnormal emotional experience, characterized by heightened response to unpleasant stimuli and blunted response to pleasant stimuli. However, this is the first study to our knowledge to evaluate "true ground'' emotionality in long-term buprenorphine/naloxone combination (Suboxone (TM)). We found in long-term SUBX patients a significantly flat affect (p<0.01), and they had less self-awareness of being happy, sad, and anxious compared to both the GP and AA groups. We caution definitive interpretation of these seemingly important results until we compare the emotional reactivity of an opioid abstinent control using automatic detection in speech. These findings encourage continued research strategies in SUBX patients to target the specific brain regions responsible for relapse prevention of opioid addiction.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Mutations in ALDH6A1 encoding methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase are associated with dysmyelination and transient methylmalonic aciduria	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Article						Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; ALDH6A1; Methylmalonic acid; Delayed myelination; Whole exome sequencing	3-HYDROXYISOBUTYRIC ACIDURIA; BETA-ALANINE; SEQUENCING DATA; INBORN ERROR; METABOLISM; VALINE; DEFICIENCY; ACIDS	Background: Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with varied metabolite abnormalities, including accumulation of 3-hydroxyisobutyric, 3-hydroxypropionic, 3-aminoisobutyric and methylmalonic acids, as well as beta-alanine. Existing reports describe a highly variable clinical and biochemical phenotype, which can make diagnosis a challenge. To date, only three reported cases have been confirmed at the molecular level, through identification of homozygous mutations in ALDH6A1, the gene encoding MMSDH. Confirmation by enzyme assay has until now not been possible, due to the extreme instability of the enzyme substrate. Methods and results: We report a child with severe developmental delays, abnormal myelination on brain MRI, and transient/variable elevations in lactate, methylmalonic acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric and 3-aminoisobutyric acids. Compound heterozygous mutations were identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing within exon 6 (c.514 T > C; p. Tyr172His) and exon 12 (c.1603C > T; p. Arg535Cys) of ALDH6A1. The resulting amino acid changes, both occurring in residues conserved among mammals, are predicted to be damaging at the protein level. Subsequent MMSDH enzyme assay demonstrated reduced activity in patient fibroblasts, measuring 2.5 standard deviations below the mean. Conclusions: We present the fourth reported case of MMSDH deficiency with confirmation at the molecular level, and expand on what is already an extremely variable clinical and biochemical phenotype. Furthermore, this is the first report to demonstrate a corresponding reduction in MMSDH enzyme activity. This report illustrates the emerging utilization of whole exome sequencing and variant data filtering using clinical data as an early tool in the diagnosis of rare and variable conditions.

Maternal Smoking during Pregnancy and Fetal Organ Growth: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CIGARETTE-SMOKING; NICOTINE; EXPOSURE; PLACENTA; VOLUME; RESTRICTION; STEREOLOGY; SMOKERS; MOTHERS; WEIGHT	Objective: To study whether maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with alterations in the growth of fetal lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, and placenta. Design: A case-control study, with operators performing the image analysis blinded. Setting: Study performed on a research-dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner (1.5 T) with participants recruited from a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Participants: A total of 26 pregnant women (13 current smokers, 13 non smokers) were recruited; 18 women (10 current smokers, 8 nonsmokers) returned for the second scan later in their pregnancy. Methods: Each fetus was scanned with MRI at 22-27 weeks and 33-38 weeks gestational age (GA). Main outcome measures: Images obtained with MRI were used to measure volumes of the fetal brain, kidneys, lungs, liver and overall fetal size, as well as placental volumes. Results: Exposed fetuses showed lower brain volumes, kidney volumes, and total fetal volumes, with this effect being greater at visit 2 than at visit 1 for brain and kidney volumes, and greater at visit 1 than at visit 2 for total fetal volume. Exposed fetuses also demonstrated lower lung volume and placental volume, and this effect was similar at both visits. No difference was found between the exposed and nonexposed fetuses with regards to liver volume. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to show that maternal smoking is associated with reduced growth of fetal brain, lung and kidney; this effect persists even when the volumes are corrected for maternal education, gestational age, and fetal sex. As expected, the fetuses exposed to maternal smoking are smaller in size. Similarly, placental volumes are smaller in smoking versus nonsmoking pregnant women.

PP1 activity is necessary for the induction of long-term depression, whereas downregulation of PP1 activity is required for the normal induction of long-term potentiation. However, how PP1 is activated is not clear. Moreover, it is not known whether PP1 plays a role in homeostatic synaptic scaling, another form of synaptic plasticity which functions to reset the neuronal firing rate in response to chronic neuronal activity perturbations. In this study, we found that PP1 inhibitor-2 (I-2) is phosphorylated at serine 43 (S43) in rat and mouse cortical neurons in response to bicuculine application. Expression of I-2 phosphorylation-blocking mutant I-2 (S43A) blocked the dephosphorylation of GluA2 at serine 880, AMPA receptor trafficking, and synaptic downscaling induced by bicuculline application. Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of I-2 at S43 appears to be mediated by L-type calcium channels and calcium/calmodulin-dependent myosin light-chain kinase. Our work thus reveals a novel calcium-induced PP1 activation pathway critical for homeostatic synaptic plasticity.

Strong Correlations between Sensitivity and Variability Give Rise to Constant Discrimination Thresholds across the Otolith Afferent Population	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VESTIBULAR NERVE AFFERENTS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; SELF-MOTION; LINEAR ACCELERATION; UTRICULAR AFFERENTS; ECCENTRIC ROTATION; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; HORIZONTAL PLANE	The vestibular system is vital for our sense of linear self-motion. At the earliest processing stages, the otolith afferents of the vestibular nerve encode linear motion. Their resting discharge regularity has long been known to span a wide range, suggesting an important role in sensory coding, yet to date, the question of how this regularity alters the coding of translational motion is not fully understood. Here, we recorded from single otolith afferents in macaque monkeys during linear motion along the preferred directional axis of each afferent over a wide range of frequencies (0.5-16 Hz) corresponding to physiologically relevant stimulation. We used signal-detection theory to directly measure neuronal thresholds and found that values for single afferents were substantially higher than those observed for human perception even when a Kaiser filter was used to provide an estimate of firing rate. Surprisingly, we further found that neuronal thresholds were independent of both stimulus frequency and resting discharge regularity. This was because increases in trial-to-trial variability were matched by increases in sensitivity such that their ratio remains constant: a coding strategy that markedly differs from that used by semicircular canal vestibular afferents to encode rotations. Finally, using Fisher information, we show that pooling the activities of multiple otolith afferents gives rise to neural thresholds comparable with those measured for perception. Together, our results strongly suggest that higher-order structures integrate inputs across afferent populations to provide our sense of linear motion and provide unexpected insight into the influence of variability on sensory encoding.

MSNs from the direct pathway express high levels of D1 dopamine receptors, while MSNs from the indirect pathway express high levels of D2 dopamine receptors. There has been much debate over the extent of colocalization of these two major dopamine receptors in MSNs of adult animals. In addition, the ontogeny of the segregation process has never been investigated. In this paper, we crossed bacterial artificial chromosome drd1a-tdTomato and drd2-GFP reporter transgenic mice to characterize these models and estimate D1-D2 co-expression in the developing striatum as well as in striatal primary cultures. We show that segregation is already extensive at E18 and that the degree of co-expression further decreases at P0 and P14. Finally, we also demonstrate that cultured MSNs maintain their very high degree of D1-D2 reporter protein segregation, thus validating them as a relevant in vitro model.

Taking advantage of the gradient of hair cell differentiation along the cochlea, we reconstituted a map of the kinocilia displacements in the mouse embryonic cochlea. We then developed a cochlear organotypic culture and video-microscopy approach to monitor the movements of the kinocilium basal body (mother centriole) and its daughter centriole, which we analyzed using particle tracking and modeling. We found that both hair cell centrioles undergo confined Brownian movements around their equilibrium positions, under the apparent constraint of a radial restoring force of similar to 0.1 pN. This magnitude depended little on centriole position, suggesting nonlinear interactions with constraining, presumably cytoskeletal elements. The only dynamic change observed during the period of kinocilium migration was a doubling of the centrioles' confinement area taking place early in the process. It emerges from these static and dynamic observations that kinocilia migrate gradually in parallel with the organization of hair cells into rows during cochlear neuroepithelium extension. Analysis of the confined motion of hair cell centrioles under normal and pathological conditions should help determine which structures contribute to the restoring force exerting on them.

Moreover recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that the gut might also influence the activity of the brain and the behaviour by different mechanisms including nervous transmission, the immune system and the microbiota. Indeed, the gut-brain axis is not only essential for the maintenance of gastrointestinal homeostasis but is also involved in the regulation of cognitive functions and stress. The purpose of this review is to discuss the recent evidence on the gut-brain axis and how modulation of the microbiota using probiotics may be beneficial to our mental and intestinal health.

A Multidimensional Approach to Pain Assessment in Critically Ill Infants During a Painful Procedure	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); behavioral pain assessment; critically ill infants; cerebral nociceptive response; noncommunicative	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; NEWBORN-INFANTS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; CHILDREN; STIMULATION; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; NEONATE	Objectives: Inferring the pain level of a critically ill infant is complex. The ability to accurately extract the appropriate pain cues from observations is often jeopardized when heavy sedation and muscular blocking agents are administered. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive method that may provide the bridge between behavioral observational indicators and cortical pain processing. We aimed to describe regional cerebral and systemic hemodynamic changes, as well as behavioral reactions in critically ill infants with congenital heart defects during chest-drain removal after cardiac surgery. Methods: Our sample included 20 critically ill infants with congenital heart defects, less than 12 months of age, admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit after surgery. Results: Cerebral deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations significantly differed across the epochs (ie, baseline, tactile stimulus, noxious stimulus) (P=0.01). Physiological systemic responses and Face Leg Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) pain scores differed significantly across the events (P<0.01). The 3 outcome measures were not found to be associated with each other. Mean FLACC pain scores during the painful procedure was 7/10 despite administration of morphine. Midazolam administration accounted for 36% of the variance in pain scores. Discussion: We demonstrated with a multidimensional pain assessment approach that significant cerebral, physiological, and behavioral activity was present in response to a noxious procedure in critically ill infants despite the administration of analgesic treatment. Considering that the sedating agent significantly dampened pain behaviors, assessment of cerebral hemodynamic in the context of pain seems to be an important addition.	[Ranger, Manon; Johnston, C.

Altered Integrated Locomotor and Cognitive Function in Elite Athletes 30 Days Postconcussion: A Preliminary Study	JOURNAL OF HEAD TRAUMA REHABILITATION			English	Article						athletes; clinical testing; concussion; divided attention; neuropsychological tests; return to play	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CONTROL FOLLOWING CONCUSSION; COLLEGIATE FOOTBALL PLAYERS; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; CLOSED-HEAD INJURY; POSTURAL STABILITY; NCAA CONCUSSION; ATTENTION; RECOVERY; DEFICITS	Objective: To begin to understand changes in locomotor navigation in elite athletes following concussion. Methods: Clinical measures and gait analysis were undertaken on average 37.33 days (SD = 4.8) postconcussion for 6 athletes as well as for a control group of athletes matched for age, sex, and team. The locomotor task consisted of walking at a self-selected speed along an unobstructed or obstructed path with and without a visual interference task. The trends for 4 dependent variables were described (2 for gait behavior and 2 for cognitive behavior). A principal component analysis was used to reduce data to root sources of variance among these variables. General group differences were tested with Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests on factorial scores. Results: Athletes with concussion were symptom free at the time of testing and their neuropsychological test results were not different from those of athletes in the control group. However, when the laboratory data between paired groups were compared, descriptive analyses suggested potential group differences in navigating the obstacle. The simultaneous Stroop task appeared to present difficulty for both groups. A significant group effect was found on the component of the factorial analysis that was highly loaded with both gait and cognitive variables (minimum clearance, Stroop task errors, and cognitive dual-task costs), generally supporting the descriptive analyses by suggesting that athletes with concussion do not navigate the targeted complex environments like the control group. Conclusions: Athletes with concussion appear to still show navigational deficits in environments well after being considered fully recovered according to current return-to-play protocols. Although still preliminary and requiring further study, the present findings suggest that functional assessment within complex environment contexts could be considered before sending athletes back to play following a concussion, even in the absence of postconcussion symptoms or with normal clinical outcomes.

The present study was aimed at the issue of whether peripheral nerve injury-induced chronic pain is maintained by supraspinal structures governing descending facilitation to the spinal dorsal horn, or whether altered peripheral nociceptive mechanisms sustain central hyperexcitability and, in turn, neuropathic pain. We examined this question by determining the contribution of peripheral/spinal mechanisms, isolated from supraspinal influence(s), in cutaneous hypersensitivity in an animal model of peripheral neuropathy. Methods. Adult rats were spinalized at T8-T9; 8 days later, peripheral neuropathy was induced by implanting a 2-mm polyethylene cuff around the left sciatic nerve. Hind paw withdrawal responses to mechanical or thermal plantar stimulation were evaluated using von Frey filaments or a heat lamp, respectively. Results. Spinalized rats without cuff implantation exhibited a moderate decrease in mechanical withdrawal threshold on similar to day 10 (P < 0.05) and in thermal withdrawal threshold on similar to day 18 (P < 0.05). However, cuff-implanted spinalized rats developed a more rapid and significant decrease in mechanical (similar to day 4; P < 0.001) and thermal (similar to day 10; P < 0.05) withdrawal thresholds that remained significantly decreased through the duration of the study. Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate an aberrant peripheral/spinal mechanism that induces and maintains thermal and to a greater degree tactile cutaneous hypersensitivity in the cuff model of neuropathic pain, and raise the prospect that altered peripheral/spinal nociceptive mechanisms in humans with peripheral neuropathy may have a pathologically relevant role in both inducing and sustaining neuropathic pain.

Herein, different lentivirus infections in conjunction with neural cell viability were investigated, concentrating on type 1 interferon-regulated pathways. Transcriptomic network analyses showed a preponderance of genes involved in type 1 interferon signaling, which was verified by increased expression of the type 1 interferon-associated genes, Mx1 and CD317, in brains from HIV-infected persons (P < 0.05). Leukocytes infected with different strains of FIV or HIV-1 showed differential Mx1 and CD317 expression (P < 0.05). In vivo studies of animals infected with the FIV strains, FIVch or FIVncsu, revealed that FIVch-infected animals displayed deficits in memory and motor speed compared with the FIVncsu-and mock-infected groups (P < 0.05). TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and CD40 expression was increased in the brains of FIVch-infected animals; conversely, Mx1 and CD317 transcript levels were increased in the brains of FIVncsu-infected animals, principally in microglia (P < 0.05). Gliosis and neuronal loss were evident among FIVch-infected animals compared with mock-and FIVncsu-infected animals (P < 0.05). Lentiviral infections induce type 1 interferon-regulated gene expression in microglia in a viral diversity-dependent manner, representing a mechanism by which immune responses might be exploited to limit neurovirulence.-Polyak, M.

In Experiment 1, we show that by presenting musical excerpts in nonpitched drum timbres, rather than pitched piano tones, amusics show normal metre recognition. Experiment 2 reveals that body movement influences amusics' interpretation of the beat of an ambiguous drum rhythm. Experiment 3 and a subsequent exploratory study show an ability to synchronize movement to the beat of popular dance music and potential for improvement when given a modest amount of practice. Together the present results are consistent with the idea that rhythm and beat processing are spared in pitch deafnessthat is, being pitch-deaf does not mean one is beat-deaf. In the context of drum music especially, amusics can be musical.

The planar cell polarity pathway is involved in neural tube closure and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NTDs both in animal models and human cohorts. Dishevelled (Dvl/Dsh) is a multi-module protein and a key regulator of both the canonical Wnt and the PCP pathway. In mouse, all Dvl1(-/-); Dvl2(-/-) double mutants display craniorachischisis, a severe form of open NTDs. Recently, we have reported a possible role for rare variants of DVL2 as risk factors for NTDs. METHODSIn view of these data, we hypothesized that DVL1 mutations might increase the risk for NTDs in some cases. Resequencing of the DVL1 gene in a cohort of 473 NTDs patients and 150 ethnically matched controls was performed. Prediction of the downstream effects of the nonsynonymous variants was done using computational methods. RESULTSWe identified six missense variants that were absent in our ethnically matched controls group, and four of them (p.Arg153Cys; p.Glu544Arg; p.Arg568Trp; p.Val644Phe) were predicted to have a functional effect on protein structure by one or more bioinformatic programs. However, there was no difference in the overall rate of deleterious variants between the patients and controls (four in patients and three in controls; p=0.36).

This study demonstrates that, relative to control athletes, multiply concussed athletes show significant ERN amplitude reduction elicited by error generation. These cumulative effects of concussions on ERN amplitude were found in two distinct experimental paradigms designed to solicit concussion-sensitive cognitive abilities such as attention and short-term memory. This suggests that the mechanisms that contribute to the evaluation of cognitive performance may be significantly affected following multiple concussions even in low-conflict situations.

J	Schlechtingen, M; Santos, IF; Achiche, S				Schlechtingen, Meik; Santos, Ilmar Ferreira; Achiche, Sofiane			Using Data-Mining Approaches for Wind Turbine Power Curve Monitoring: A Comparative Study	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Condition monitoring; data mining; fuzzy neural networks; machine learning; neural networks; power generation; power system faults; signal analysis; wind energy	FUZZY-LOGIC; PERFORMANCE; MODELS	Four data-mining approaches for wind turbine power curve monitoring are compared. Power curve monitoring can be applied to evaluate the turbine power output and detect deviations, causing financial loss. In this research, cluster center fuzzy logic, neural network, and kappa-nearest neighbor models are built and their performance compared against literature. Recently developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy-interference system models are set up and their performance compared with the other models, using the same data. Literature models often neglect the influence of the ambient temperature and the wind direction. The ambient temperature can influence the power output up to 20%. Nearby obstacles can lower the power output for certain wind directions. The approaches proposed in literature and the ANFIS models are compared by using wind speed only and two additional inputs. The comparison is based on the mean absolute error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and standard deviation using data coming from three pitch regulated turbines rating 2 MW each. The ability to highlight performance deviations is investigated by use of real measurements. The comparison shows the decrease of error rates and of the ANFIS models when taking into account the two additional inputs and the ability to detect faults earlier.

EFFICACY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF HIGH FREQUENCY REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (rTMS) VERSUS ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT) FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED TRIALS	DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY			English	Review							TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PERSPECTIVES; REMISSION; STANDARD; SAFETY	Clinical trials comparing the efficacy and acceptability of high frequency repetitivetranscranial magneticstimulation (HF-rTMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treating major depression (MD) have yielded conflicting results. As this may have been the result of limited statistical power, we have carried out this meta-analysis to examine this issue. We searched the literature for randomized trials on head-to-head comparisons between HF-rTMS and ECT from January 1995 through September 2012 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS. The main outcome measures were remission rates, pre-post changes in depression ratings, as well as overall dropout rates at study end. We used a random-effects model, Odds Ratios (OR), Number Needed to Treat (NNT), and Hedges' g effect sizes. Data were obtained from 7 randomized trials, totalling 294 subjects with MD. After an average of 15.2 HF-rTMS and 8.2 ECT sessions, 33.6% (38/113) and 52% (53/102) of subjects were classified as remitters (OR = 0.46; p = 0.04), respectively. The associated NNT for remission was 6 and favoured ECT. Also, reduction of depressive symptomatology was significantly more pronounced in the ECT group (Hedges' g = -0.93; p = 0.007). No differences on dropout rates for HF-rTMS and ECT groups were found. In conclusion, ECT seems to be more effective than HF-rTMS for treating MD, although they did not differ in terms of dropout rates. Nevertheless, future comparative trials with larger sample sizes and better matching at baseline, longer follow-ups and more intense stimulation protocols are warranted.

Impact of Neonatal Growth on IQ and Behavior at Early School Age	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						neonatal growth; weight gain; head circumference; IQ; behavior	CHILD MENTAL-HEALTH; CATCH-UP GROWTH; POSTNATAL-GROWTH; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; FETAL-GROWTH; INFANCY; BIRTH	OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine associations of neonatal weight gain (NWG) and head circumference gain (HCG) with IQ scores and behavior at early school age. METHODS: We used data from the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial, involving Belarusian infants born full term and weighing >= 2500 g. NWG and HCG were measured as the percentage gain in weight and head circumference over the first 4 weeks relative to birth size. IQ and behavior were measured at 6.5 years of age by using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively, with SDQ collected from parents and teachers. The associations between the exposures (NWG, HCG) and children's IQ and SDQ were examined by using mixed models to account for clustering of measurements, and adjustment for potentially confounding perinatal and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Mean NWG was 26% (SD 10%) of birth weight. In fully adjusted models, infants in the highest versus lowest quartile of NWG had 1.5-point (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 2.2) higher IQ scores (n = 13 840). A weak negative (protective) association between NWG and SDQ total difficulties scores was observed for the teacher-reported (beta = -0.39, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.08, n = 12 016), but not the parent-reported (beta = -0.12, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.15, n = 13 815), SDQ. Similar associations were observed with HCG and IQ and behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Faster gains in weight or head circumference in the 4 weeks after birth may contribute to children's IQ, but reverse causality (brain function affects neonatal growth) cannot be excluded.

Muscle mass index has long been used as a useful index to evaluate the risks of developing functional impairments. However, there is evidence that other indexes (particularly muscle strength-based indexes) may be more relevant. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the association between different indexes of muscle mass or strength with self-reported and measured functional performance to determine which index would be clinically relevant to detect individuals at risk of functional impairments. Methods. Data are from 1,462 women aged 75 years and older recruited in the Toulouse EPIDemiologie de l'OSteoporose cohort. Body composition (assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), handgrip, and knee extension strength were assessed. Physical function was measured using the chair stand test as well as the usual and fast gait speed tests. Participants were also asked if they experienced any difficulty at performing functional tasks. Results. Results showed that knee extension strength relative to body weight was the strongest correlate of physical function measures (.30 < r < .40). Women in the lowest quartile of knee extension strength relative to body weight were 5.9-, 24.7-, 12.1-, and 20.9-fold, respectively, more likely to present impairments at self-reported activities, chair stand test, and usual and fast gait speed compared with women in the highest quartile, respectively. Conclusions. Knee extension strength relative to body weight appears to be well associated with self-reported difficulties and functional impairments. A threshold between 2.78 and 2.86 (knee extension strength [kPa]/body weight [kg]), determined using receiver operating characteristics curves analysis, may be a potential cut point to discriminate women presenting higher functional impairments.

Threats to Validity in the Design and Conduct of Preclinical Efficacy Studies: A Systematic Review of Guidelines for In Vivo Animal Experiments	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Review							REPORTING GUIDELINES; EXPERIMENTAL STROKE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; ARRIVE GUIDELINES; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; THERAPIES; MODELS; RECOMMENDATIONS	Background: The vast majority of medical interventions introduced into clinical development prove unsafe or ineffective. One prominent explanation for the dismal success rate is flawed preclinical research. We conducted a systematic review of preclinical research guidelines and organized recommendations according to the type of validity threat (internal, construct, or external) or programmatic research activity they primarily address. Methods and Findings: We searched MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, and the EQUATOR Network website for all preclinical guideline documents published up to April 9, 2013 that addressed the design and conduct of in vivo animal experiments aimed at supporting clinical translation. To be eligible, documents had to provide guidance on the design or execution of preclinical animal experiments and represent the aggregated consensus of four or more investigators. Data from included guidelines were independently extracted by two individuals for discrete recommendations on the design and implementation of preclinical efficacy studies. These recommendations were then organized according to the type of validity threat they addressed. A total of 2,029 citations were identified through our search strategy. From these, we identified 26 guidelines that met our eligibility criteria-most of which were directed at neurological or cerebrovascular drug development. Together, these guidelines offered 55 different recommendations. Some of the most common recommendations included performance of a power calculation to determine sample size, randomized treatment allocation, and characterization of disease phenotype in the animal model prior to experimentation. Conclusions: By identifying the most recurrent recommendations among preclinical guidelines, we provide a starting point for developing preclinical guidelines in other disease domains. We also provide a basis for the study and evaluation of preclinical research practice.

JAMA NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY; ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; RECOMMENDATIONS; HEMORRHAGE; BURDEN; BRAIN	IMPORTANCE The clinical role of amyloid brain positron emission tomographic imaging in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is currently being formulated. The specificity of a positive amyloid scan is a matter of contention. OBSERVATIONS An 83-year-old Canadian man presented with a 5-year history of predominantly short-term memory loss and functional impairment. Clinical evaluation revealed significant, gradually progressive short-term memory loss in the absence of any history of strokes or other neuropsychiatric symptoms. The patient met clinical criteria for probable Alzheimer disease but had a higher than expected burden of white matter disease on magnetic resonance imaging. A positron emission tomographic Pittsburgh Compound B scan was highly positive in typical Alzheimer disease distribution. The patient died of an intracerebral hemorrhage 6 months after the assessment. Autopsy revealed cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the complete absence of amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This patient demonstrates that a positive Pittsburgh Compound B scan in a patient with clinical dementia meeting criteria for probable Alzheimer disease is not proof of an Alzheimer disease pathophysiological process. A positive Pittsburgh Compound B scan in typical Alzheimer disease distribution in a patient with dementia can be secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy alone.

Naturally derived and synthetic rocaglamide scaffolds have been used to interrogate this pathway; however, there is uncertainty regarding their precise mechanism(s) of action. We exploited the genetic tractability of yeast to define the primary effect of both a natural and a synthetic rocaglamide in a cellular context and characterized the molecular target using biochemical studies and in silico modeling. Chemogenomic profiling and mutagenesis in yeast identified the eIF (eukaryotic Initiation Factor) 4A helicase homologue as the primary molecular target of rocaglamides and defined a discrete set of residues near the RNA binding motif that confer resistance to both compounds. Three of the eIF4A mutations were characterized regarding their functional consequences on activity and response to rocaglamide inhibition. These data support a model whereby rocaglamides stabilize an eIF4A-RNA interaction to either alter the level and/or impair the activity of the eIF4F complex. Furthermore, in silica modeling supports the annotation of a binding pocket delineated by the RNA substrate and the residues identified from our mutagenesis screen. As expected from the high degree of conservation of the eukaryotic translation pathway, these observations are consistent with previous observations in mammalian model systems. Importantly, we demonstrate that the chemically distinct silvestrol and synthetic rocaglamides share a common mechanism of action, which will be critical for optimization of physiologically stable derivatives. Finally, these data confirm the value of the rocaglamide scaffold for exploring the impact of translational modulation on disease.

EEG amplitude spectra before near threshold visual presentations differentially predict detection/omission and short-long reaction time outcomes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Delta; Theta; Beta; Spectral; Top-down; Pre-stimulus; Omissions; Simple-reaction-time	NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MACAQUE MONKEY; SLEEP LOSS; PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATIONS; SENSITIVITY; LUMINANCE; LATENCIES; GRATINGS	Performance in simple stimulus detection manifests as both probability of detection and speed of signaling detected stimuli. These two dimensions of performance across trials were examined with respect to brain states just prior to stimulus delivery, using near threshold stimuli targeting the magnocellular or the parvocellular visual streams in an attempt to isolate differential perceptual preparation. The EEG amplitude of 12 university students was analyzed in spectral bands from 2 to 50 Hz at 9 bilateral channel pairs in a window covering -450 ms to +50 ms relative to stimulus onset. A hierarchical statistical procedure was applied to control false positive results. EEG power in the 2, 4, 8 and 10 Hz bands was found significantly lower at the F7-F8 channel pair both before detected compared to omitted stimuli and before the fastest compared to slowest reaction time quartiles, with no stimulus type effect. In addition, the 22 and 24 Hz band activity was lower prior to better performance frontally (F3-F4, F7-F8) in reaction time but not in detection, while it was larger centro-parietally (CP1-CP2, P3-P4) in detection but not in reaction times. Spectral analysis thus shows stimulus detection and response speed to depend partly on common and partly on distinct pre-stimulus brain states. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It offers an introduction to this medical category and a more detailed discussion of some current debates, including the idea of nervous exhaustion, chronic fatigue, and the malady's presumed somatogenesis. Methods. - The nosological criteria for neurasthenia have been arduously debated within the psychiatric epidemiological literature, without arriving at a consensus on whether it is an important diagnostic entity and without agreeing on its clinical significance. Results. - Presently the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) classifies neurasthenia as a subtype of undifferentiated somatoform disorders, whereas the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) considers neurasthenia as a separate disorder. Modern variants of the concept neurasthenia are "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome", "Fibromyalgia", and "Multiple Chemical Sensitivities" which have more or less inherited the organicity of Beard's former concept of neurasthenia, despite the fact that so far the question of organicity could not be decisively answered. We can ask the question if the later are not just new names of interactional symptoms of social and clinical issues. Conclusion. - Neurasthenia seems to be a prevalent condition deserving further attention from researchers, given its comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders and its association with functional impairment.

Using an acute model of epileptiform activity, the 4-aminopyridine model in live mice, we observe the changes in resting-state networks with the onset of seizure activity and in conditions of spiking activity. Resting-state networks identified before and after the onset of epileptiform activity show both decreased and increased homologous correlations, with a small dependence on seizure intensity. The observed changes are not uniform across the different hemodynamic measures, suggesting a potential decoupling between blood flow and metabolism in the low-frequency networks. This study supports the need for a more extensive investigation of epileptic networks including more than one independent hemodynamic measurement. (C) The Authors.

Both age and sex differences were examined. Participants were 52 children and adolescents (23 boys, mean age = 12.5 years). Over the course of an approximately 2-h testing session participants were exposed to a computerized testing paradigm, the social evaluative stress test (SEST), that lasted for 50 min and includes elements of social evaluation, unpredictability and uncontrollability. Seven saliva samples were obtained to measure cortisol concentrations before, during and after the SEST, to provide pre-stress values, cortisol reactivity to the stressor and recovery after stress. In addition, subjective emotional stress experiences were recorded. The results showed no effect of age on cortisol responses. Furthermore, although both sexes reported experiencing the paradigm as (equally) stressful, only boys reacted with significant cortisol increases (M = 163%). To our knowledge, this is the first computerized stressor that induces cortisol responses in 10- to 15-year-old boys. Whether the girls' perceived stress results in the activation of other biological systems, such as the sympathetic nervous system as well as in differential activation of brain regions, remains to be determined. Future studies investigating sex differences in stress reactivity during adolescence should include neuroimaging, as well as psychophysiological measures, to unveil some of the mechanisms behind the current findings.

BXH2 mice harbor a severely hypomorphic allele at Irf8 (Irf8(R294C)) that causes susceptibility to infection with intracellular pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We report that BXH2 are completely resistant to the development of cerebral malaria (ECM) following Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection. Comparative transcriptional profiling of brain RNA as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to identify IRF8-regulated genes whose expression is associated with pathological acute neuroinflammation. Genes increased by infection were strongly enriched for IRF8 binding sites, suggesting that IRF8 acts as a transcriptional activator in inflammatory programs. These lists were enriched for myeloid-specific pathways, including interferon responses, antigen presentation and Th1 polarizing cytokines. We show that inactivation of several of these downstream target genes (including the Irf8 transcription partner Irf1) confers protection against ECM. ECM-resistance in Irf8 and Irf1 mutants is associated with impaired myeloid and lymphoid cells function, including production of IL12p40 and IFN gamma. We note strong overlap between genes bound and regulated by IRF8 during ECM and genes regulated in the lungs of M. tuberculosis infected mice. This IRF8-dependent network contains several genes recently identified as risk factors in acute and chronic human inflammatory conditions. We report a common core of IRF8-bound genes forming a critical inflammatory host-response network.

Moreover, we have documented evidence for gene-environment interactions where identical gene variants are associated with different phenotypes that are dependent on early life adversity. What are the mechanisms that embed these early life experiences in the genome? DNA methylation is an enzymatically-catalyzed modification of DNA that serves as a mechanism by which similar sequences acquire cell type identity during cellular differentiation and embryogenesis in the same individual. The hypothesis that will be discussed here proposes that the same mechanism confers environmental-exposure specific identity upon DNA providing a mechanism for embedding environmental experiences in the genome, thus affecting long-term phenotypes. Particularly important is the environment early in life including both the prenatal and postnatal social environments.

Using 3D callosal measurements and a letter-matching paradigm, this 2-part study investigated the neural substrate of interhemispheric coupling in individuals with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and age-matched healthy individuals (HC). Method: Thirty-three right-handed participants were MRI scanned to measure the volume of the CC in 5 sections. In Study 1, AD, a-MCI, and HC individuals performed a low-demand perceptual letter shape-matching task (e.g., A-A); in Study 2, a-MCI and HC individuals performed a "case-sensitive" letter-matching task (Study 2A) and a "load-sensitive" letter-matching task (Study 2B). Results: The results showed a positive correlation between Response Times and the midbody of the CC at the lowest cognitive demand level (Study 1) in participants with AD, and the total CC, midbody, caudal body, and isthmus of the CC at high cognitive demand levels (Study 2A) in normal aging. The volume of the anterior part of the CC was significantly negatively correlated with the interhemispheric behavioral indices for the a-MCI group (Study 1 and Study 2B). Conclusion: This study provides evidence that interhemispheric coupling may constitute a flexible mechanism that can improve the brain's ability to meet processing demands for low cognitive demand in AD and for high cognitive demand in normal aging.

Sexuality of women with neurologic disorders	PROGRES EN UROLOGIE			French	Article						Spinal cord injured women; Sexuality; Neurological and physiological assessment; Sexual counselling; Sexual therapy	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; VIBRATORY STIMULATION; AROUSAL; ORGASM; MEN; NEUROPHYSIOLOGY; ISSUES	Introduction. - The. prevalence of sexual dysfunction in spinal cord injured (SCI) women is high. Methods. - Medical literature on sexuality in women with SCI was reviewed and combined with expert opinion of the authors. Results. - The physiology of the female sexual response including vasocongestion and muscular contractions occurring during sexual arousal and orgasm, and their innervation through somatosensory and autonomic pathways (pudendal, pelvic, hypogastric, vagus nerves) is described. Studies on women with SCI demonstrate the presence of a sacral reflex vasocongestion and/or thoracolumbar psychogenic vasocongestion. Fifty percent of women with SCI report orgasm, most often with genital stimulation, suggesting that an autonomic reflex response, but which can be perceived by vagus nerve transmission. Studies on sexual experience show that the frequency of sexual activities decreases, but interest for intercourse remains. More emphasis is placed on oral-genital stimulation, kisses, cuddling, caresses, fantasies, and erogenous stimulation above the lesion level. Sixty-nine percent of women with SCI report sexual satisfaction. Limitations concern positions during intercourse, spasticity, incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia. Alteration of the sexual sense of self and body image are also reported. Facilitating factors include education level, having a stable partner, occurrence of the lesion in adulthood, and increased posttraumatic delay. Treatment should emphasize neurological assessment of thoracolumbar sensitivity and presence of sacral reflexes. Sexual education should be encouraged during rehabilitation and cover the female sexual response, procreation and pregnancy (risks, prevention), along with precautions concerning various contraceptives. Treatment should include a refined assessment of perinea[ sensitivity to allow a mental image of the vulva, and trials with vibrostimulation and medication (PDEI5, midodrine) to maximize sexual responses and facilitate perception of sexual pleasure and orgasm. Conclusion. - Management of sexual dysfunction in SCI women must be holistic and biopsychosocial. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Their presence affects the molecular properties and structure of glycoconjugates, modifying their function and interactions with other molecules. Consequently, the sialylation state of glycoproteins and glycolipids has been recognized as a critical factor modulating molecular recognitions inside the cell, between the cells, between the cells and the extracellular matrix, and between the cells and certain exogenous pathogens. Until recently sialyltransferases that catalyze transfer of sialic acid residues to the glycan chains in the process of their biosynthesis were thought to be mainly responsible for the creation and maintenance of a temporal and spatial diversity of sialylated moieties. However, the growing evidence suggests that in mammalian cells, at least equally important roles belong to sialidases/neuraminidases, which are located on the cell surface and in intracellular compartments, and may either initiate the catabolism of sialoglycoconjugates or just cleave their sialic acid residues, and thereby contribute to temporal changes in their structure and functions. The current review summarizes emerging data demonstrating that mammalian neuraminidase 1, well known for its lysosomal catabolic function, is also targeted to the cell surface and assumes the previously unrecognized role as a structural and functional modulator of cellular receptors.

Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging with a novel whole-brain multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to more fully characterize neural responses and connectivity to intelligible speech. Consistent with previous univariate findings, intelligible speech elicited greater activity in bilateral superior temporal cortex relative to unintelligible speech. However, MVPA identified a more extensive network that discriminated between intelligible and unintelligible speech, including left-hemisphere middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, inferior temporal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis. These fronto temporal parietal areas also showed greater functional connectivity during intelligible, compared with unintelligible, speech. Our results suggest that speech intelligibly is encoded by distinct fine-grained spatial representations and within-task connectivity, rather than differential engagement or disengagement of brain regions, and they provide a more complete view of the brain network serving speech comprehension. Our findings bridge a divide between neural models of speech comprehension and the neuroimaging literature on speech intelligibility, and suggest that speech intelligibility relies on differential multivariate response and connectivity patterns in Wernicke's, Broca's, and Geschwind's areas.

Evidence from humans with focal prefrontal damage	CORTEX			English	Article						Prefrontal cortex; Executive function; Cognitive control; Working memory	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; LATENT VARIABLE ANALYSIS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TEST; TASK CONTROL; STROOP TASK; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; LESION	Executive function encompasses a range of control processes supporting flexible, goal-directed behaviour. Attentional set-shifting, updating of information in working memory, and inhibitory control have been proposed as key components of executive function, but debate continues as to the validity of this conceptual framework, and the neural substrates of these putative components. Here we examined prefrontal structure function relationships for each of these component processes in a large cohort of patients with focal prefrontal damage. Forty-five patients with focal damage to various sectors of prefrontal cortex (PFC), and 50 demographically matched healthy control subjects performed an attention shifting task, the Stroop colour naming task, and a spatial search task. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping revealed that damage to left ventrolateral PFC led to impaired performance on both the Stroop and attention shifting tasks. In contrast, performance of the spatial search task depended on several regions within PFC, but notably not left ventrolateral PFC. These observations were confirmed with direct comparison of performance between patients grouped according to lesion location. This dissociation partly supports the component process view of executive function, distinguishing the goal-directed regulation of attention (perhaps specifically in the verbal domain) from the requirements of the spatial search task, including the updating of information in spatial working memory. These findings are easier to reconcile with modular, material-specific accounts than with more unitary models of executive function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Heterogeneity in the properties of NEFL mutants causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease results in differential effects on neurofilament assembly and susceptibility to intervention by the chaperone-inducer, celastrol	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Neurofilament light protein; Neurofilament aggregation; Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; celastrol; Heat shock proteins	INTERMEDIATE-FILAMENT PROTEINS; PHOSPHORYLATION SITE; AXONAL-TRANSPORT; GENE-MUTATIONS; MOTOR-NEURONS; COILED-COIL; LIGHT GENE; NF-L; SUBUNIT; KINASE	Aberrant aggregation of neurofilament proteins is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, neurofilament light protein (NEFL) mutants causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease induce misassembly of neurofilaments. This study demonstrated that mutations in different functional domains of NEFL have different effects on filament assembly and susceptibility to interventions to restore function. The mouse NEFL mutants, NEFLQ333P and NEFLP8R, exhibited different assembly properties in SW13-cells, cells lacking endogenous intermediate filaments, indicating different consequences of these mutations on the biochemical properties of NEFL. The p.Q333P mutation caused reversible misfolding of the protein. NEFLQ333P could be refolded and form coil-coiled dimers, in vitro using chaotropic agent, and in cultured cells by induction of HSPA1 and HSPB1. Celastrol, an inducer of chaperone proteins, induced HSPA1 expression in motor neurons and prevented the formation of neurofilament inclusions and mitochondrial shortening induced by expression of NEFLQ333P, but not in sensory neurons. Conversely, celastrol had a protective effect against the toxicity of NEFLP8R, a mutant which is sensitive to HSBP1 but not HSPA1 chaperoning, only in large-sized sensory neurons, not in motor neurons. Importantly, sensory and motor neurons do not respond identically to celastrol and different chaperones are upregulated by the same treatment. Thus, effective therapy of CMT not only depends on the identity of the mutated gene, but the consequences of the specific mutation on the properties of the protein and the neuronal population targeted.

Diagnosis and Management of Fetal Heart Failure	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Review							CARDIOVASCULAR PROFILE SCORE; TWIN TRANSFUSION SYNDROME; MYOCARDIAL PERFORMANCE INDEX; PARVOVIRUS B19 INFECTION; TRICUSPID-VALVE DISEASE; DUCTUS-VENOSUS BLOOD; SACROCOCCYGEAL TERATOMA; DIASTOLIC FUNCTION; HUMAN-FETUS; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC DIAGNOSIS	Congestive fetal heart failure, defined as inability of the heart to deliver adequate blood flow to organs such as the brain, liver, and kidneys, is a common final outcome of many intrauterine disease states that may lead to fetal demise. Advances in fetal medicine during the past 3 decades now provide the diagnostic tools to detect and also treat conditions that may lead to fetal heart failure. Fetal echocardiographic findings depend on severity of diastolic and systolic dysfunction of both ventricles. At an advanced stage, findings include cardiomegaly; valvar regurgitation; venous congestion; fetal edema and effusions; oligohydramnios; and preferential shunting of blood flow to the brain, heart, and adrenals in the distressed fetus. A useful diagnostic tool to quantify severity of heart failure is the cardiovascular profile score, which is a composite score based on 5 different echocardiographic parameters. To predict outcomes, the score should be interpreted in the context of the underlying disease, as different causes of intrauterine heart failure may have highly variable outcomes. Low fetal cardiac output may result from a myocardial disease (cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, ischemia), abnormal loading conditions (arterial hypertension, obstructive structural heart disease, atrioventricular malformations, twin-to-twin transfusion), arrhythmia, or external cardiac compression (pleural and/or pericardial effusions, cardiac tumours). Treatment options are available for several of these conditions.

Methods and results Unipolar electrograms were recorded from 191 right atrial (RA) and LA sites in anaesthetized canines prior to and during electrical stimulation of the right vagus nerve (VgN), left VgN, or LAGP at baseline and following (i) bilateral VgN decentralization, and radiofrequency ablation of (ii) periaortic/superior vena cava (Ao/SVC) and (iii) RAGP in 14 animals (anterograde group), and in the reverse order in 7 (retrograde). Repolarization changes were also measured in similar preparations during Ao/SVC (n = 8) and RAGP stimulation (n = 23). Sinus cycle length (SCL) prolongation, and RA and LA repolarization changes (affected atrial surface area) were induced during LAGP stimulation. SCL prolongation and RA repolarization changes were unaffected by VgN decentralization but reduced following Ao/SVC and RAGP ablation in the anterograde group. In the retrograde group, chronotropic and RA repolarization changes were reduced following RAGP and abolished following Ao/SVC ablation. In contrast, LA repolarization responses to LAGP stimulation were reduced following VgN decentralization and each subsequent ablation step, with small residual responses after completing the anterograde protocol. Ao/SVC and RAGP stimulation exerted predominant influences in adjacent regions as well as demonstrating LA extensions. Conclusion Vagal as well as bilateral atrial neural pathways are involved in mediating chronotropic and LA repolarization responses to LAGP stimulation.

This review synthesizes the data suggesting that the cerebellum plays an important role in dystonia etiology, from neuroanatomical research of complex networks showing that the cerebellum is connected to a wide range of other central nervous system structures involved in movement control to animal models indicating that signs of dystonia are due to cerebellum dysfunction and completely disappear after cerebellectomy, and finally to clinical observations in secondary dystonia patients with various types of cerebellar lesions. We propose that dystonia is a large-scale dysfunction, involving not only cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways, but the cortico-ponto-cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop as well. Even in the absence of traditional "cerebellar signs" in most dystonia patients, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction. It is clear that as long as the cerebellum's role in dystonia genesis remains unexamined, it will be difficult to significantly improve the current standards of dystonia treatment or to provide curative treatment.

Methods: Cortical auditory evoked potentials and Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Responses were recorded in 40 children, 9-12 years old: 12 with hearing loss, 12 with central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) and 16 with normal hearing. Passive oddball paradigms were used with nonverbal and verbal stimuli. Results: For P1, no significant group differences were observed. A significant reduction in N2 amplitude with all stimuli was observed in the group of children with hearing loss compared to the results of those with normal hearing. N2 results did not reveal any significant differences between the group of children with hearing loss and the children with CAPD. MMN amplitude indicated a trend toward larger MMN amplitude among the group of children with hearing loss compared to the value of those of children with CAPD. Conclusions: Abnormal N2 characteristics could be a manifestation of a specific signature in children with hearing loss. This cortical response could be considered as a neurophysiologic marker of central auditory processing deficits in these children. Significance: Results suggest maturational delays and/or deficits in central auditory processing in children with hearing loss. (c) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Memantine is administered both as a monotherapy and as an add-on therapy in patients already receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Several meta-analyses have been published that examine the efficacy of memantine in the treatment of AD, based on clinical trial data. However, different disease severities and concomitant medication use in the trial populations means that synthesis of this data is challenging with numerous methodological decisions required. The main objectives of this study were to review the methodologies of different meta-analyses, assess the impact of specific methodological approaches on efficacy results, and to help interpret previous meta-analyses results concerning the efficacy of memantine in moderate to severe stages of AD. The methodologies of five meta-analyses were reviewed in terms of the included trials, combination of data, choice of outcome, and analysis methods. Results were extracted and compared in line with the methodological approach taken. The most robust results were observed on cognition, activities of daily living, and overall assessment, where memantine showed a consistent benefit over placebo. The benefit of memantine on behavioral symptoms was also demonstrated, but results were more heterogeneous. Variability could not be explained by baseline severity and concomitant treatment alone. It is stressed that interpretation of meta-analysis results must be considered within the context of the methodological approach. Overall, results from individual clinical trials and from meta-analyses demonstrate that memantine represents a valuable treatment option in AD.

Our technique relies on the maximization of gradient orientation alignment in a reduced set of high confidence locations of interest and allows for fast, accurate, and robust registration. Performance is compared with multiple state-of-the-art techniques including conventional intensity-based multi-modal registration strategies, as well as other context-specific approaches. All methods were evaluated on fourteen clinical neurosurgical cases with brain tumors, including low-grade and high-grade gliomas, from the publicly available MNI BITE dataset. Registration accuracy of each method is evaluated as the mean distance between homologous landmarks identified by two or three experts. We provide an analysis of the landmarks used and expose some of the limitations in validation brought forward by expert disagreement and uncertainty in identifying corresponding points. The proposed approach yields a mean error of 2.57 mm across all cases (the smallest among all evaluated techniques). Additionally, it is the only evaluated technique that resolves all cases with a mean distance of less than 1 mm larger than the theoretical minimal mean distance when using a rigid transformation. Finally, our proposed method provides reduced processing times with an average registration time of 0.76 s in a GPU-based implementation, thereby facilitating its integration into the operating room.

To assess the neuroprotective effect of GA in a subset of patients in the PreCISe trial, we used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal integrity, in a large central volume of brain. Thirty-four CIS patients randomized to GA 20 mg/day (n = 19) SC or placebo (n = 15) were included. Patients who relapsed (developed clinically definite MS [CDMS]) were removed from the substudy. NAA/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios were compared between GA-treated and placebo-treated patients. Twenty patients with CIS had not converted to CDMS and were still in the double-blind phase of the trial at 12 months of follow-up. Paired changes in NAA/Cr differed significantly in patients treated with GA (+0.14, n = 11) compared with patients receiving placebo (-0.33, n = 9, p = 0.03) at 12 months, consistent with a neuroprotective effect of GA in vivo. Patients with CIS who received GA showed improvement in brain neuroaxonal integrity, as indicated by increased NAA/Cr, relative to comparable patients treated with placebo, who showed a decline in NAA/Cr consistent with findings from natural history studies.

Responses of MST neurons to plaid stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motion integration; vision; electrophysiology; perception; cortex	MACAQUE VISUAL-CORTEX; MOVING 2-DIMENSIONAL PATTERNS; CENTER-SURROUND INTERACTIONS; OPTIC FLOW STIMULI; CORTICAL AREA MT; MOTION PERCEPTION; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; PERCEIVED DIRECTION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; RECEPTIVE FIELDS	The estimation of motion information from retinal input is a fundamental function of the primate dorsal visual pathway. Previous work has shown that this function involves multiple cortical areas, with each area integrating information from its predecessors. Compared with neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area more faithfully represent the velocity of plaid stimuli, and the observation of this pattern selectivity has led to two-stage models in which MT neurons integrate the outputs of component-selective V1 neurons. Motion integration in these models is generally complemented by motion opponency, which refines velocity selectivity. Area MT projects to a third stage of motion processing, the medial superior temporal (MST) area, but surprisingly little is known about MST responses to plaid stimuli. Here we show that increased pattern selectivity in MST is associated with greater prevalence of the mechanisms implemented by two-stage MT models: Compared with MT neurons, MST neurons integrate motion components to a greater degree and exhibit evidence of stronger motion opponency. Moreover, when tested with more challenging unikinetic plaid stimuli, an appreciable percentage of MST neurons are pattern selective, while such selectivity is rare in MT. Surprisingly, increased motion integration is found in MST even for transparent plaid stimuli, which are not typically integrated perceptually. Thus the relationship between MST and MT is qualitatively similar to that between MT and V1, as repeated application of basic motion mechanisms leads to novel selectivities at each stage along the pathway.

Gene expression deficits in pontine locus coeruleus astrocytes in men with major depressive disorder	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; INHIBITORY AMINO-ACIDS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GLUTAMATE UPTAKE; BRAIN-STEM; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; MONOAMINE NUCLEI; MOOD DISORDERS; MESSENGER-RNA; RECEPTOR	Background: Norepinephrine and glutamate are among several neurotransmitters implicated in the neuropathology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Glia deficits have also been demonstrated in people with MDD, and glia are critical modulators of central glutamatergic transmission. We studied glia in men with MDD in the region of the brain (locus coeruleus; LC) where noradrenergic neuronal cell bodies reside and receive glutamatergic input. Methods: The expression of 3 glutamate-related genes (SLC1A3, SLC1A2, GLUL) concentrated in glia and a glia gene (GFAP) were measured in postmortem tissues from men with MDD and from paired psychiatrically healthy controls. Initial gene expression analysis of RNA isolated from homogenized tissue (n = 9-10 pairs) containing the LC were followed by detailed analysis of gene expressions in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (n = 6-7 pairs) laser captured from the LC region. We assessed protein changes in GFAP using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting (n = 7-14 pairs). Results: Astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes, demonstrated robust reductions in the expression of SLC1A3 and SLC1A2, whereas GLUL expression was unchanged. GFAP expression was lower in astrocytes, and we confirmed reduced GFAP protein in the LC using immunostaining methods. Limitations: Reduced expression of protein products of SLC1A3 and SLC1A2 could not be confirmed because of insufficient amounts of LC tissue for these assays. Whether gene expression abnormalities were associated with only MDD and not with suicide could not be confirmed because most of the decedents who had MDD died by suicide. Conclusion: Major depressive disorder is associated with unhealthy astrocytes in the noradrenergic LC, characterized here by a reduction in astrocyte glutamate transporter expression. These findings suggest that increased glutamatergic activity in the LC occurs in men with MDD.

However, this literature has never been thoroughly reviewed, and is generally ignored in neuropsychological accounts of ADHD. The purposes of the present report were (1) to introduce a systematic review of this literature and (2) to prospectively test whether adults with ADHD (combined type) would present left hemi-unawareness measurable on a test of executive function commonly used with children and adults with ADHD, the Colour-Word Interference Test of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functions System. This test requires participants to discriminate unusual stimulus characteristics by stating words aloud while visually scanning plates comprising either 50 colour patches or 50 words. A total of 28 ADHD adults (combined type) and 30 IQ-, age-, and gender-matched controls completed the task. The ADHD group manifested a significantly higher proportion of errors on the left than right sides of the plates. This atypical left-right balance was related to severity of the ADHD according to the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) as well as to several other indicators from the Continuous Performance Test-II.

This study's aim was to compare the diagnosis of migraine in children with moderate to severe headache made by pediatric emergency physicians to the International Classification of Headache Disorders II migraine criteria with annotation for children and a new criteria, the Irma emergency department criteria, using the neurologist's diagnosis as the gold standard. METHODS: This was part of a prospective study with a convenience sample of patients <18 years old, diagnosed with migraine by pediatric emergency physicians and treated with intravenous medication due to severity of symptoms. A standardized questionnaire on the patient's present and past headaches description was completed by the patient and his or her family during their stay in the emergency department. Each patient was assessed by a pediatric neurologist within 3 months to confirm the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Between July 2007 and July 2009,79 children completed a questionnaire. Of these, 11 were not evaluated by the neurologist (eight never reported for follow-up and three were not referred). Of the remaining, four had another final diagnosis, leaving 64 (94%) patients with confirmed diagnoses of migraine. Among these patients, 29 (45%) had headaches that fulfilled the International Classification of Headache Disorders II migraine criteria with annotation for children and 55 (86%) fulfilled the new criteria, the Irma emergency department criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' clinical judgment performed better than the published migraine criteria, which did not have adequate sensitivity to be of use to pediatric emergency physicians.

However, the outcome of the treatment on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis remains largely unknown. PURPOSE: To describe the changes in the HRQOL of patients with pediatric high-grade spondylolisthesis after surgical and nonsurgical managements. STUDY DESIGN: Observational case series with a minimal of 2-year follow-up. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty-eight pediatric patients with high-grade spondylolisthesis from a single institution filled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three patients were managed surgically and five were managed nonsurgically. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report measures: Scoliosis Research Society questionnaires (SRS-22). Neurologic examination, radiographic evaluation of slip grade. METHODS: The SRS-22 questionnaire was collected at the baseline (initial presentation for the nonsurgical group and preoperative visit for the surgical group) and at the last follow-up. Differences between baseline and last follow-up were evaluated in both groups. Correlation between the baseline score of SRS-22 score and improvement in the SRS-22 score was determined in surgical patients. RESULTS: In surgical patients, total SRS-22 scores were 3.31 +/- 0.50 at the baseline and 4.26 +/- 0.50 at the last follow-up. In nonsurgical patients, total SRS-22 scores were 4.12 +/- 0.16 at the baseline and 4.14 +/- 0.38 at the last follow-up. Therefore, variation in the SRS-22 total score was +0.94 +/- 0.77 (p<.001) for surgical patients and +0.02 +/- 0.35 (p=.854) for nonsurgical patients. Improvement of the SRS-22 score was correlated with a low baseline value of SRS-22 (R-2=0.61; p<.001). There was no neurologic or slip deterioration during the follow-up for patients treated nonsurgically. CONCLUSIONS: The HRQOL improves after a surgical intervention for high-grade spondylolisthesis. Patients with lower baseline HRQOL scores are those who benefit the most from surgery. Close observation is a safe and feasible option in selected patients with a good baseline HRQOL and no neurologic impairment. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A preliminary investigation of moral reasoning and empathy after traumatic brain injury in adolescents	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Empathy; moral reasoning; social skills; traumatic brain injury	VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; JUVENILE-DELINQUENTS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; CONDUCT DISORDER; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIOR; EMOTION; METAANALYSIS; DAMAGE	Primary objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during childhood can affect a number of socio-cognitive skills; however, little attention has focused on the integrity of moral reasoning in the assessment of post-TBI social sequelae and the role of empathy and intelligence on moral maturity. Research design: In a quasi-experimental, cross-sectional research design, moral reasoning maturity and empathy in adolescents with mild-to-severe TBI (n = 25) were compared to typically-developing peers (n = 66). Methods and procedures: Participants were administered the So-Moral and So-Mature, tasks of socio-moral reasoning and maturity, the Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and a demographic questionnaire. Main outcomes and results: Participants with TBI had significantly lower levels of moral reasoning maturity. Further, adolescents with moderate-to-severe TBI had lower levels of empathy. Empathy correlated positively with moral reasoning abilities and, together with intellectual function, predicted a small, but significant proportion of moral reasoning outcome. Conclusions: Youth who sustained TBI during childhood have poorer moral reasoning abilities than their non-injured peers, potentially placing them at risk for poor social decision-making and socially maladaptive behaviour. This can have a significant impact on long-term social functioning.	[Beauchamp, M. H.] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Beauchamp, M.

Positive Regulation of Insulin Signaling by Neuraminidase 1	DIABETES			English	Article							PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE ACTIVITY; LYSOSOMAL MULTIENZYME COMPLEX; RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; MOLECULAR-MECHANISM; KINASE-ACTIVITY; CELL-SURFACE; FATTY-ACIDS; RECEPTOR; SIALIDASE	Neuraminidases (sialidases) catalyze the removal of sialic acid residues from sialylated glycoconjugates. We now report that mammalian neuraminidase 1 (Neu1), in addition to its catabolic function in lysosomes, is transported to the cell surface where it is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. Insulin binding to its receptor rapidly induces interaction of the receptor with Neu1, which hydrolyzes sialic acid residues in the glycan chains of the receptor and, consequently, induces its activation. Cells from sialidosis patients with a genetic deficiency of Neu1 show impairment of insulin-induced phosphorylation of downstream protein kinase AKT, and treatment of these cells with purified Neu1 restores signaling. Genetically modified mice with similar to 10% of the normal Neu1 activity exposed to a high-fat diet develop hyperglycemia and insulin resistance twice as fast as their wild-type counterparts. Together, these studies identify Neu1 as a novel component of the signaling pathways of energy metabolism and glucose uptake.

Over the past decades, various attempts have been made to classify specific patterns of hippocampal neuronal cell loss and correlate subtypes with postsurgical outcome. However, no international consensus about definitions and terminology has been achieved. A task force reviewed previous classification schemes and proposes a system based on semiquantitative hippocampal cell loss patterns that can be applied in any histopathology laboratory. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement studies reached consensus to classify three types in anatomically well-preserved hippocampal specimens: HS International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) type 1 refers always to severe neuronal cell loss and gliosis predominantly in CA1 and CA4 regions, compared to CA1 predominant neuronal cell loss and gliosis (HS ILAE type 2), or CA4 predominant neuronal cell loss and gliosis (HS ILAE type 3). Surgical hippocampus specimens obtained from patients with TLE may also show normal content of neurons with reactive gliosis only (no-HS). HS ILAE type 1 is more often associated with a history of initial precipitating injuries before age 5 years, with early seizure onset, and favorable postsurgical seizure control. CA1 predominant HS ILAE type 2 and CA4 predominant HS ILAE type 3 have been studied less systematically so far, but some reports point to less favorable outcome, and to differences regarding epilepsy history, including age of seizure onset. The proposed international consensus classification will aid in the characterization of specific clinicopathologic syndromes, and explore variability in imaging and electrophysiology findings, and in postsurgical seizure control.

Analysis of the effects of rare variants on splicing identifies alterations in GABA(A) receptor genes in autism spectrum disorder individuals	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						autism; schizophrenia; GABRA3; GABRQ; splicing alteration	SEVERE MENTAL-RETARDATION; UNCLASSIFIED VARIANTS; RETT-SYNDROME; MUTATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RNA; ENHANCERS; SITE; MICRODELETION; EXPRESSION	A large-scale sequencing screen of X-linked synaptic genes in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or schizophrenia (SCZ), two common neurodevelopmental disorders, identified many variants most of which have no easily predictable effect on gene function. In this report, we evaluated the impact of these rare missense and silent variants on gene splicing. For this purpose, we used complementary in silico analyses, in vitro minigene-based assays and RNA prepared from lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients with these mutations. Our goal was to identify the variants which might either create or disrupt an acceptor splice site, a donor splice site or an exonic splicing enhancer, thus leading to aberrant splicing that could be involved in the pathogenesis of ASD or SCZ. We identified truncating mutations in distinct X-linked gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor subunit-encoding genes, GABRQ and GABRA3, in two different families. Furthermore, missense and silent variants in nuclear RNA export factor 5 and histone deacetylase 6 were shown to partially disrupt the protein. While genes from the GABAergic pathway have previously been thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of ASD, this is the first report of ASD patients with truncating mutations in GABA receptors genes.

Orientation plasticity in striate cortex occurs either by ocular deprivation or by imposition of a non-preferred stimulus for several minutes. Adaptation of neurons to a non-optimal orientation induces shifts of tuning curves towards the adapting orientation (attractive shift) or away from it (repulsive shift). Here, we investigated the effects of the neurotransmitter serotonin and antidepressant fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) on the modulation of adaptation-induced orientation plasticity. We show that serotonin and fluoxetine promote mostly attractive shifts. Attractive shifts augmented in magnitude towards adapter, whereas repulsive neurons reversed their behavior in the direction of the forced orientation. Furthermore, neurons which retained their original preferred orientation expressed plasticity by shifting their tuning curves after drug administration mostly towards adapter. Our data suggest a pre-eminent role of fluoxetine by inducing and facilitating short-term plasticity in V1.

As several modern (so-called atypical) antipsychotic drugs are common offenders, combined with the widening clinical indications for prescription as well as exposure of vulnerable individuals, TD will remain a significant drug-induced unwanted side effect. In addition, the pathophysiology of TD remains elusive and therapeutics are difficult. Based on rodent experiments, we have previously shown that the transcriptional factor Nur77 (also known as nerve growth factor inducible gene B or Nr4a1) is induced in the striatum following antipsychotic drug exposure as part of a long-term neuroadaptive process. To confirm this, we exposed adult capuchin (Cebus apella) monkeys to prolonged treatments with haloperidol (median 18.5 months, N = 11) or clozapine (median 6 months, N = 6). Six untreated animals were used as controls. Five haloperidol-treated animals developed mild TD movements similar to those found in humans. No TD was observed in the clozapine group. Postmortem analysis of Nur77 expression measured by in situ hybridization revealed a stark contrast between the two drugs, as Nur77 mRNA levels in the caudate-putamen were strongly upregulated in animals exposed to haloperidol but were spared following clozapine treatment. Interestingly, within the haloperidol-treated group, TD-free animals showed higher Nur77 expression in putamen subterritories compared with dyskinetic animals. This suggests that Nur77 expression might be associated with a reduced risk of TD in this experimental model and could provide a novel target for drug intervention.

Method Parents reported the amount of household smoke exposure (at 17, 41, 65 and 86 months) for all 2055 children from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Main outcome measures include teacher- and child-reported antisocial and physically aggressive behaviour (at 121 months). Results In terms of prevalence, 58% of parents reported that their children were never exposed to secondhand smoke in the home, while 34% and 8% of parents reported transient and continuous levels of secondhand smoke, respectively. When compared with never exposed children, children exposed to continuous secondhand smoke scored higher on self-reported aggressive behaviour and teacher- rated antisocial behaviour in fourth grade, B = 0.336 (95% CI 0.155 to 0.517) and B = 0.319 (95% CI 0.107 to 0.531), respectively. Similarly, children exposed to transient levels of secondhand smoke scored higher on aggressive and antisocial behaviour, B = 0.714 (95% CI 0.456 to 0.972) and B = 0.566 (95% CI 0.260 to 0.872), respectively. Conclusions The observed prevalence is concordant with worldwide estimates of children's exposure to secondhand smoke. In comparison with their never exposed peers, children continuously and intermittently exposed to secondhand smoke in childhood showed an increased propensity toward physical aggression and antisocial behaviour by the end of fourth grade. We found no evidence of dose-dependence.

In contrast, little is known about the functions of NF-kappa B during embryonic brain development. It is shown here that NF-kappa B is selectively activated in neocortical neural progenitor cells in the developing mouse telencephalon. Blockade of NF-kappa B activity leads to premature cortical neuronal differentiation and depletion of the progenitor cell pool. Conversely, NF-kappa B activation causes decreased cortical neurogenesis and expansion of the progenitor cell compartment. These effects are antagonized by the proneuronal transcription factor Hes6, which physically and functionally interacts with RelA-containing NF-kappa B complexes in cortical progenitor cells. In turn, NF-kappa B exerts an inhibitory effect on the ability of Hes6 to promote cortical neuronal differentiation. These results reveal previously uncharacterized functions and modes of regulation for NF-kappa B and Hes6 during cortical neurogenesis.

Patterns and Determinants of Dementia Pharmacotherapy in a Population-Based Cohort of Home Care Clients	DRUGS & AGING			English	Article							MINIMUM DATA SET; CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR USE; SEVERE ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; US NURSING-HOMES; PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY; OLDER-PEOPLE; MEMANTINE; DONEPEZIL; SCALE; MDS	Little is known about the needs of older home care clients with dementia or their key quality of care issues, including their use of pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the sociodemographic, psychosocial, and health characteristics of clients with dementia (relative to two control subgroups) from a population-based home care cohort; and, (2) determine the distribution and associated characteristics of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) and/or memantine use among dementia clients overall and according to medication class, comorbid illness, and year of assessment. This cross-sectional study included all home care clients aged 50 years or older assessed with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) in Ontario, Canada from January 2003 to December 2010. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with receiving a dementia medication (a ChEI and/or memantine). There were 104,802 (21.5 %) clients with a diagnosis of dementia, 92,529 (18.9 %) cognitively impaired clients without a dementia diagnosis, and 290,929 (59.6 %) cognitively intact clients. Relative to the comparison groups, dementia clients were more likely to have reported conflicts with others, a distressed caregiver, greater levels of cognitive and functional impairment, and to exhibit wandering, aggressive behaviors, anxiety, hallucinations or delusions, and swallowing problems. Approximately half of dementia clients were taking a dementia medication, most commonly donepezil. Characteristics most strongly associated with use of ChEI monotherapy included age greater than 64 (especially 75-84), absence of economic barriers, availability of a primary caregiver, year of assessment, moderate to severe cognitive impairment, relative independence in function, health stability, no depressive symptoms or hallucinations/delusions, no recent hospitalization, use of at least 9 medications, the absence of chronic health and neurological conditions, and the use of an antipsychotic or antidepressant. For combination therapy, strong positive associations were observed for younger age, year of assessment, increasing cognitive impairment, presence of a primary caregiver, male sex, absence of economic barriers, use of at least 9 medications, and various indicators of positive health status (e.g., stability in health, absence of chronic health and neurological conditions, and no recent hospitalization). The percentage of clients receiving ChEIs increased with cognitive impairment scores but declined slightly at the highest level of impairment, whereas the percentage receiving memantine increased with cognitive impairment level. The number and percentage of dementia clients receiving any pharmacotherapy increased during the study interval. We observed a relatively high prevalence of dementia-specific pharmacotherapy among Ontario long-stay home care clients as well as significant variation in utilization patterns by select sociodemographic, functional, and clinical characteristics, and over time. While physicians generally followed recommended guidelines regarding appropriate dementia pharmacotherapy, continued efforts to monitor practice patterns are required among vulnerable older adults across care settings.

J	Brown, RM; Palmer, C				Brown, Rachel M.; Palmer, Caroline			Auditory and motor imagery modulate learning in music performance	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sensorimotor learning; auditory imagery; motor imagery; individual differences; music performance	MENTAL PRACTICE; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PIANO PERFORMANCE; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTEX; PERCEPTION; MOVEMENTS; SOUNDS; BRAIN; EXPERTISE	Skilled performers such as athletes or musicians can improve their performance by imagining the actions or sensory outcomes associated with their skill. Performers vary widely in their auditory and motor imagery abilities, and these individual differences influence sensorimotor learning. It is unknown whether imagery abilities influence both memory encoding and retrieval. We examined how auditory and motor imagery abilities influence musicians' encoding (during Learning, as they practiced novel melodies), and retrieval (during Recall of those melodies). Pianists learned melodies by listening without performing (auditory learning) or performing without sound (motor learning); following Learning, pianists performed the melodies from memory with auditory feedback (Recall). During either Learning (Experiment 1) or Recall (Experiment 2), pianists experienced either auditory interference, motor interference, or no interference. Pitch accuracy (percentage of correct pitches produced) and temporal regularity (variability of quarter-note interonset intervals) were measured at Recall. Independent tests measured auditory and motor imagery skills. Pianists' pitch accuracy was higher following auditory learning than following motor learning and lower in motor interference conditions (Experiments 1 and 2). Both auditory and motor imagery skills improved pitch accuracy overall. Auditory imagery skills modulated pitch accuracy encoding (Experiment 1): Higher auditory imagery skill corresponded to higher pitch accuracy following auditory learning with auditory or motor interference, and following motor learning with motor or no interference. These findings suggest that auditory imagery abilities decrease vulnerability to interference and compensate for missing auditory feedback at encoding. Auditory imagery skills also influenced temporal regularity at retrieval (Experiment 2): Higher auditory imagery skill predicted greater temporal regularity during Recall in the presence of auditory interference. Motor imagery aided pitch accuracy overall when interference conditions were manipulated at encoding (Experiment 1) but not at retrieval (Experiment 2). Thus, skilled performers' imagery abilities had distinct influences on encoding and retrieval of musical sequences.

Diminished neurokinin-1 receptor availability in patients with two forms of chronic visceral pain	PAIN			English	Article						PET; NK-1 receptor; Irritable bowel syndrome; Inflammatory bowel disease; Somatic pain; Quality of life	IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SUBSTANCE-P; NK1 RECEPTOR; SPINAL-CORD; HUMAN BRAIN; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; PLACEBO ANALGESIA; PERSISTENT PAIN	Central sensitization and dysregulation of peripheral substance P and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) signaling are associated with chronic abdominal pain in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although positron emission tomography (PET) has demonstrated that patients with injury-related chronic pain have diminished NK-1R availability in the brain, it is unknown whether these deficits are present in IBD and IBS patients, who have etiologically distinct forms of non-injury-related chronic pain. This study's aim was to determine if patients with IBD or IBS exhibit deficits in brain expression of NK-1Rs relative to healthy controls (HCs), the extent to which expression patterns differ across patient populations, and if these patterns differentially relate to clinical parameters. PET with [F-18] SPA-RQ was used to measure NK-1R availability by quantifying binding potential (BP) in the 3 groups. Exploratory correlation analyses were performed to detect associations between NK-1R BP and physical symptoms. Compared to HCs, IBD patients had NK-1R BP deficits across a widespread network of cortical and subcortical regions. IBS patients had similar, but less pronounced deficits. BP in a subset of these regions was robustly related to discrete clinical parameters in each patient population. Widespread deficits in NK-1R BP occur in IBD and, to a lesser extent, IBS; however, discrete clinical parameters relate to NK-1R BP in each patient population.

In patients, chronic treatment with rapamycin or its analogues (rapalogues) has been reported to lead to sensory hypersensitivity and pain conditions via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mTORC1 activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in sensory neurons via suppression of S6K1 to insulin receptor substrate 1 negative feedback loop. As a result, increased ERK activity induces sensory neuron sensitization, mechanical hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain. The clinically available adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activator, metformin, which is an antidiabetic drug, prevents rapamycin-induced ERK activation and the development of mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that activation of the ERK pathway in sensory neurons as a consequence of mTORC1 inhibition leads to the development of pain. Importantly, this effect is abolished by co-treatment with metformin, thus providing a potential treatment option for rapalogue-evoked pain. Our findings highlight the physiological relevance of feedback signaling through mTORC1 inhibition and have important implications for development of pain therapeutics that target the mTOR pathway.

Salivary cortisol and interpersonal functioning: An event-contingent recording study in the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Interpersonal functioning; Cortisol; Bipolar disorder; Social behaviours	MAJOR AFFECTIVE-DISORDER; CONDUCT DISORDER; DAYTIME CORTISOL; NEUROENDOCRINE RESPONSES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; ADOLESCENT GIRLS; STRESS-RESPONSE; BASAL CORTISOL; WILD BABOONS	Despite a large body of research in non-human primates, the relationship between naturalistic patterns of social behaviour and basal cortisol levels has been understudied in humans. The present study examined the relationship between patterns of interpersonal functioning and cortisol levels in 23 offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD), at high risk for the development of an affective disorder, and 22 offspring of parents with no affective disorder (controls) in late adolescence and young adulthood. Using event-contingent recording, participants rated their dominance, submissiveness, quarrelsomeness, and agreeableness in naturally occurring social interactions over 14 consecutive days and provided salivary cortisol twice daily in the afternoon over the same period. In the full sample, multilevel modelling analyses revealed that dominance was a significant positive predictor of afternoon basal cortisol levels, t((35)) = 2.58, p < 0.05. Moreover, risk group (having a parent with BD or parents with no affective disorder) significantly interacted with mean levels of quarrelsomeness to predict afternoon cortisol levels, t((29)) = 2.06, p < 0.05. Offspring of parents with BD who reported more frequent quarrelsome behaviours exhibited lower levels of afternoon cortisol relative to high-risk offspring reporting few quarrelsome behaviours and control offspring. The results are consistent with evidence that dominance is associated with high cortisol levels in an unstable environment, and suggest that quarrelsomeness among high risk youth contributes to altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity.

Yet, in functional neuroimaging literature to date, the role of the cerebellum in schizophrenia was not explored in a systematic fashion. Here, we reviewed 234 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies indexed by PubMed and published in 1997-2010 that had at least one group of schizophrenia patients, used blood oxygenation level dependent contrast and the general linear model to assess neuronal activity. We quantified presence/absence of cerebellar findings and the frequency of hypo- and hyperactivations (ie, less or more activity in patients relative to healthy controls). We used peaks of activations reported in these studies to build a topographical representation of group differences on a cerebellar map. Cerebellar activity was reported in patients in 41.02% of the articles, with more than 80% of these dedicated to cognitive, emotional, and executive processes in schizophrenia. Almost two-thirds of group comparisons resulted in cerebellar hypoactivation, with a frequency that presented an inverted U shape across different age categories. The majority of the hypoactivation foci were located in the medial portion of the anterior lobe and the lateral hemispheres (lobules IV-V) of the cerebellum. Even though most experimental manipulations did not target explicitly the cerebellum's functions in schizophrenia, the cerebellar findings are frequent and cerebellar hypoactivations predominant. Therefore, although the cerebellum seems to play an important functional role in schizophrenia, the lack of reporting and interpretation of these data may hamper the full understanding of the disorder.

This has been hypothesized to be a consequence of the influence of conduction delays and cellular costs during development on axonal pruning, both of which increase with fiber length. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) provides a test of this hypothesis: Children with ASD are known to have enlarged brains; thus, adults with ASD should show reductions in interhemispheric connectivity proportional to their degree of brain overgrowth during development. This prediction was tested by assessing the relation between both the size and structure of the corpus callosum and callosal fiber length, adjusting for intracranial volume, which is thought to reflect maximum brain size achieved during development. Using tractography to estimate the length of callosal fibers emanating from all areas of cortex, and through which region of the corpus callosum they pass, we show that adults with ASD show an inverse relation between callosal fiber length, adjusted for intracranial volume, and callosum size, and a positive relation between adjusted callosal fiber length and radial diffusivity. The results provide support for the hypothesized impact of fiber length during development. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This lower frequency modulation is known as the envelope. Envelopes are commonly found in a variety of sensory signals, such as contrast modulations of visual stimuli and amplitude modulations of auditory stimuli. While psychophysical studies have shown that envelopes can carry information that is essential for perception, how envelope information is processed in the brain is poorly understood. Here we review the behavioral salience and neural mechanisms for the processing of envelopes in the electrosensory system of wave-type gymnotiform weakly electric fishes. These fish can generate envelope signals through movement, interactions of their electric fields in social groups or communication signals. The envelopes that result from the first two behavioral contexts differ in their frequency content, with movement envelopes typically being of lower frequency. Recent behavioral evidence has shown that weakly electric fish respond in robust and stereotypical ways to social envelopes to increase the envelope frequency. Finally, neurophysiological results show how envelopes are processed by peripheral and central electrosensory neurons. Peripheral electrosensory neurons respond to both stimulus and envelope signals. Neurons in the primary hindbrain recipient of these afferents, the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL), exhibit heterogeneities in their responses to stimulus and envelope signals. Complete segregation of stimulus and envelope information is achieved in neurons in the target of ELL efferents, the midbrain torus semicircularis (Ts).

Neuromodulation of early electrosensory processing in gymnotiform weakly electric fish	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Review						acetylcholine; serotonin; weakly electric fish	LATERAL-LINE LOBE; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; K+ CHANNELS; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; SENSORY NEURONS; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION	Sensory neurons continually adapt their processing properties in response to changes in the sensory environment or the brain's internal state. Neuromodulators are thought to mediate such adaptation through a variety of receptors and their action has been implicated in processes such as attention, learning and memory, aggression, reproductive behaviour and state-dependent mechanisms. Here, we review recent work on neuromodulation of electrosensory processing by acetylcholine and serotonin in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Specifically, our review focuses on how experimental application of these neuromodulators alters excitability and responses to sensory input of pyramidal cells within the hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe. We then discuss current hypotheses on the functional roles of these two neuromodulatory pathways in regulating electrosensory processing at the organismal level and the need for identifying the natural behavioural conditions that activate these pathways.

Although the generation of such relatively large electric signals over an entire lifetime is expected to be energetically costly, supporting evidence to date is equivocal. In this article, we first provide a theoretical analysis of the energy budget underlying signal production. Our analysis suggests that wave-type and pulse-type species invest a similar fraction of metabolic resources into electric signal generation, supporting previous evidence of a trade-off between signal amplitude and frequency. We then consider a comparative and evolutionary framework in which to interpret and guide future studies. We suggest that species differences in signal generation and plasticity, when considered in an energetics context, will not only help to evaluate the role of energetic constraints in the evolution of signal diversity but also lead to important general insights into the energetics of bioelectric signal generation.

We examine whether breastfeeding in the first 2 months of life is associated with structural markers of brain development in infants from the general population. This study was embedded within the Generation R study. Cranial ultrasounds were obtained at approximately 7 weeks post-natal age. The diameter of the gangliothalamic ovoid, corpus callosum length, ventricular volume and head circumference were measured. Maternal reports of breastfeeding were obtained at 2 months of age. We examined associations in relation to current breastfeeding practices (exclusively breastfed, n=318, breast- and bottle-fed, n=119, and bottle-fed, n=243). Analyses were adjusted for head size and relevant covariates. Secondary analyses were conducted for breastfeeding history (exclusively breastfed, n=318, breast- and bottle-fed, n=281, and never breastfed, n=81). Exclusive breastfeeding was associated with more optimal brain development compared with babies who were bottle-fed or never breastfed. Results were most consistent for gangliothalamic ovoid diameter. Larger gangliothalamic ovoid diameters were evident in babies who were exclusively breastfed compared with bottle-fed babies [difference between means (95% confidence interval)=0.21(0.02, 0.39), P=0.02]. Smaller ventricular volume and larger head circumference were also found for exclusively breastfed babies. Breastfeeding was not significantly associated with corpus callosum length. Maternal reports of breastfeeding are associated with more mature brain development within the first 2 months of life. Results are most consistent for gangliothalamic ovoid diameter, a subcortical structure rich in docosahexaenoic acid. Findings also pointed to non-specific neural developmental advantage for exclusively breastfed babies.

Concomitant developments in informatics have resulted in the acquisition of complex gene information through the application of computational analysis of molecular interaction networks. This approach enables the acquired knowledge on hundreds of genes to be used to view molecular disease mechanisms from a genetic point of view. By analyzing 410 genes which control the complex process of pain, we show by computational analysis, based on functional annotations to pain-related genes, that 12 clearly circumscribed functional areas are essential for pain perception and thus for analgesic drug development. The genetics perspective revealed that future development strategies should focus on substances modulating intracellular signal transduction, ion transport and anatomical structure development. These processes are involved in the genetic-based absence of pain and therefore, provide promising fields for curative or preventive treatments. In contrast, interactions with G-protein coupled receptor pathways seem merely to provide symptomatic, not preventative relief of pain. In addition, biological functions accessed either by analgesic drugs or microRNAs suggest that synergistic therapies may be a future direction for drug development. With modem computational functional genomics, it is possible to exploit genetic information from increasingly available data sets on complex diseases, such as pain, and offers a new insight into drug development and therapy which is complementary to pathway-centered approaches.

Here, we explored strategies to also ensure 5' homogeneity of affinity-purified RNAs. First, we systematically investigated the effect of starting nucleotides on the 5' heterogeneity of a small SLI RNA substrate from the Neurospora VS ribozyme purified from an SLI-ARiBo precursor. A series of 32 SLI RNA sequences with variations in the +1 to +3 region was produced from two T7 promoters (class III consensus and class II phi 2.5) using either the wild-type T7 RNA polymerase or the P266L mutant. Although the P266L mutant helps decrease the levels of 5'-sequence heterogeneity in several cases, significant levels of 5' heterogeneity (>= 1.5%) remain for transcripts starting with GGG, GAG, GCG, GGC, AGG, AGA, AAA, ACA, AUA, AAC, ACC, AUC, and AAU. To provide a more general approach to purifying RNA with 5' homogeneity, we tested the suitability of using a small CRISPR RNA stem-loop at the 5' end of the SLI-ARiBo RNA. Interestingly, we found that complete cleavage of the 5'-CRISPR tag with the Cse3 endoribonuclease can be achieved quickly from CRISPR-SLI-ARiBo transcripts. With this procedure, it is possible to generate SLI-ARiBo RNAs starting with any of the four standard nucleotides (G, C, A, or U) involved in either a single-or a double-stranded structure. Moreover, the 5'-CRISPR-based strategy can be combined with affinity purification using the 3'-ARiBo tag for quick purification of RNA with both 5' and 3' homogeneity.

The severity of these symptoms has been linked to cognitive deficits, including memory; however, its relationship with persistent negative symptoms (PNS) remains unclear. Thus, the goals of the current paper were to explore memory profiles in FEP patients identified as having PNS and to delineate this relationship in PNS over a 1-year period. Patients diagnosed as having a first episode of psychosis were segregated into groups of patients who met the criteria for PNS (N = 39) and patients who did not, or non-PNS (N = 97). At an initial assessment, all subjects were administered neurocognitive tests for three memory domains including verbal, visual and working memory. In addition, in FEP patients, clinical symptoms including negative, positive and depressive symptoms were also measured at the initial assessment as well as months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. A significant interaction of memory x group was observed (F = 4.997, d.f. = 1,181, P = 0.002), with post hoc comparisons indicating that the PNS group performed more poorly than non-PNS only in the verbal memory domain. All three-memory domains remained stable over time. Hence, in comparison to non-PNS patients, FEP patients with PNS appear to have greater (selective) verbal memory impairments throughout the first year of treatment. (C ) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

These cells are often rare, such as stem cells or progenitor cells that their overall properties should be maintained during the separation process for their subsequent application in regenerative medicine. This work, presents separation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from rat brain primary cultures using an integrated thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE)- based multilayer microfluidic device fabricated using hot-embossing technology. OPCs are frequently used in recovery, repair and regeneration of central nervous system after injuries. Indeed, their ability to differentiate in vitro into myelinating oligodendrocytes, are extremely important for myelin repair. OPCs form 5-10% of the glial cells population. The traditional macroscale techniques for OPCs separation require pre-processing of cells and/or multiple time consuming steps with low efficiency leading very often to alteration of their properties. The proposed methodology implies to separate OPCs based on their smaller size compared to other cells from the brain tissue mixture. Using aforementioned microfluidic chip embedded with a 5 mu m membrane pore size and micropumping system, a separation efficiency more than 99% was achieved. This microchip was able to operate at flow rates up to 100 mu l/min, capable of separating OPCs from a confluent 75 cm(2) cell culture flask in less than 10 min, which provides us with a high-throughput and highly efficient separation expected from any cell sorting techniques.

J	Donati, F				Donati, Francois			Residual paralysis: a real problem or did we invent a new disease?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING-AGENTS; POSTANESTHESIA CARE-UNIT; POSTOPERATIVE NAUSEA; SPONTANEOUS-RECOVERY; RESPIRATORY EVENTS; ORBICULARIS OCULI; BLOCKADE; NEOSTIGMINE; ACCELEROMYOGRAPHY; CURARIZATION	Over the past three decades, many studies have shown a high proportion of patients in the recovery room with residual neuromuscular blockade after anesthesia. The purpose of this Continuing Professional Development module is to present the physiological consequences of residual paralysis, estimate the extent of the problem, and suggest solutions to prevent its occurrence. Residual paralysis is defined as a train-of-four ratio (TOFR) < 0.9 at the adductor pollicis. While tidal volume and, to a lesser extent, vital capacity are well preserved as the intensity of blockade increases, the probability of airway obstruction, impaired swallowing, and pulmonary aspiration increases markedly as TOFR decreases. In recent studies, incidences of residual paralysis from 4-57% have been reported, but surveys indicate that anesthesiologists estimate the incidence of the problem at 1% or less. The decision to administer neostigmine or sugammadex should be based on the degree of spontaneous recovery at the adductor pollicis muscle (thumb), not on recovery at the corrugator supercilii (eyebrow). The most important drawback of neostigmine is its inability to reverse profound blockade, which is a consequence of its ceiling effect. When spontaneous recovery reaches the point where TOFR > 0.4 or four equal twitch responses are seen, reduced doses of neostigmine may be given. The dose of sugammadex required in a given situation depends on the intensity of blockade. Careful monitoring and delaying the administration of neostigmine until four twitches are observed at the adductor pollicis can decrease the incidence of residual paralysis. The clinical and pharmacoeconomic effects of unrestricted sugammadex use are unknown at this time.

While the brain interact with the reflexes to allow perception of sexual sensations and to exert excitatory or inhibitory influences, penile reflexes can occur despite complete transections of the spinal cord, as demonstrated by the reviewed animal studies on spinalization and human studies on spinal cord injury. Neurophysiological and neuropharmacological substrates of the male sexual responses will be discussed in this review, starting with the spinal mediation of erection and its underlying mechanism with nitric oxide (NO), followed by the description of the ejaculation process, its neural mediation and its coordination by the spinal generator of ejaculation (SGE), followed by the occurrence of climax as a multisegmental sympathetic reflex discharge. Brain modulation of these reflexes will be discussed through neurophysiological evidence involving structures such as the medial preoptic area of hypothalamus (MPOA), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the nucleus para-gigantocellularis (nPGI), and through neuropharmacological evidence involving neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and oxytocin. The pharmacological developments based on these mechanisms to treat male sexual dysfunctions will complete this review, including phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitors and intracavernous injections (ICI) for the treatment of erectile dysfunctions (ED), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of premature ejaculation, and cholinesterase inhibitors as well as alpha adrenergic drugs for the treatment of ane-jaculation and retrograde ejaculation. Evidence from spinal cord injured studies will be highlighted upon each step.

Neuronal injury in the central nervous system (CNS) causes breakage of axonal connections, release of myelin, inflammation and cell death at the lesion site. Many factors contribute to the failure of spontaneous repair after SCI, including the presence of growth inhibitory proteins in myelin, the inflammatory environment of the injured CNS, and the resulting signaling cascades that result in over-activation of Rho, a signaling switch in neurons and axons. In this review, we provide a general overview of growth inhibition in the CNS, and show evidence that most growth inhibitory proteins signal through a common intracellular pathway. Rho is a convergent signal for growth inhibition, and also for signaling some of the secondary consequences of inflammation after SCI. We review the preclinical evidence that targeting Rho is an effective way to stimulate axon regeneration and functional recovery in preclinical animal models. In the last part of the review, we describe the creation of Cethrin, a new investigational drug, and summarize the results of the Phase I/IIa clinical study to examine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Cethrin in patients with acute SCI. We conclude with some insight for future clinical studies.

The region was named Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR). Since then, this locomotor center was shown to control locomotion in various vertebrate species, including the lamprey, salamander, stingray, rat, guinea-pig, rabbit or monkey. In human subjects asked to imagine they are walking, there is an increased activity in brainstem nuclei corresponding to the MLR (i.e. pedunculopontine, cuneiform and subcuneiform nuclei). Clinicians are now stimulating (deep brain stimulation) structures considered to be part of the MLR to alleviate locomotor symptoms of patients with Parkinson's disease. However, the anatomical constituents of the MLR still remain a matter of debate, especially relative to the pedunculopontine, cuneiform and subcuneiform nuclei. Furthermore, recent studies in lampreys have revealed that the MLR is more complex than a simple relay in a serial descending pathway activating the spinal locomotor circuits. It has multiple functions. Our goal is to review the current knowledge relative to the anatomical constituents of the MLR, and its physiological role, from lamprey to man. We will discuss these results in the context of the recent clinical studies involving stimulation of the MLR in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Effects of resistance training combined with vascular occlusion or hypoxia on neuromuscular function in athletes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Intermittent hypoxia; Blood occlusion; Blood flow restriction; Kaatsu; EMG; Muscle cross-sectional area	BLOOD-FLOW RESTRICTION; HUMAN MUSCLE; HYPOBARIC HYPOXIA; FORCE PRODUCTION; GROWTH-HORMONE; STRENGTH; EXERCISE; INCREASES; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATIONS	The aim was to investigate the effects of low-load resistant training combined with vascular occlusion or normobaric hypoxic exposure, on neuromuscular function. In a randomised controlled trial, well-trained athletes took part in a 5-week training of knee flexor/extensor muscles in which low-load resistant exercise (20 % of one repetition maximum, 1-RM) was combined with either (1) an occlusion pressure of approximately 230 mmHg (KT, n = 10), (2) hypoxic air to generate an arterial blood oxygen saturation of similar to 80 % (HT, n = 10), or (3) with no additional stimulus (CT, n = 10). Before and after training, participants completed the following tests: 3-s maximal voluntary contraction (MVC3), 30-s MVC, and an endurance test (maximal number of repetitions at 20 % 1-RM, Reps(20)). Electromyographic activity (root mean square, RMS) was measured during tests and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the quadriceps and hamstrings was measured pre- and post-training. Relative to CT, KT, and HT showed likely increases in MVC3 (11.0 +/- A 11.9 and 15.0 +/- A 13.1 %, mean +/- A 90 % confidence interval), MVC30 (10.2 +/- A 9.0 and 18.3 +/- A 17.4 %), and Reps(20) (28.9 +/- A 23.7 and 23.3 +/- A 24.0 %). Compared to the CT group, CSA increased in the KT (7.6 +/- A 5.8) and HT groups (5.3 +/- A 3.0). KT had a large effect on RMS during MVC3, compared to CT (effect size 0.8) and HT (effect size 0.8). We suspect hypoxic conditions created within the muscles during vascular occlusion and hypoxic training may play a key role in these performance enhancements.

Modifications of oxysterols have important implications in neurological conditions, especially in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders in which alterations of synaptic plasticity or cell signalling are implicated, such as depression. Oxysterols can diffuse across the blood-brain barrier and have been hypothesized to provide a mechanism by which the brain can eliminate excess Chl to maintain a steady state. Relations of 24-hydroxycholesterol (24OH) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH) specifically may provide a depiction of CNS Chl homeostasis. Thus, the objective of this study was to integrate oxysterol measures and gene expression measures in an effort to identify how they may relate to depression and suicide. Using post-mortem human prefrontal cortex tissue, quantification of metabolites by GC-MS and gene expression by qRT-PCR were performed with the aim to provide a characterization of enzymatic oxidative Chl homeostasis. Results show a significant increase in 24OH, which suggests a higher turnover of Chl to 24OH in the prefrontal cortex of suicide cases. An increase in 24OH may, in combination with liver-X receptor activation, explain the observed reduction of low central and peripheral Chl in suicide and would have implications for synapse maintenance and loss in the neuropathology of depression and suicide.

Mitochondrial Uncoupler Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenylhydrazone Induces the Multimer Assembly and Activity of Repair Enzyme Protein L-Isoaspartyl Methyltransferase	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase; PIMT; Multimerization; Neuroblastoma cells; Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone	PERMEABILITY TRANSITION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CELLS; EXPRESSION; RESIDUES; APOPTOSIS; INJURY; RAT; ACCUMULATION; DYSFUNCTION	The protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) repairs damaged aspartyl residues in proteins. It is commonly described as a cytosolic protein highly expressed in brain tissues. Here, we report that PIMT is an active monomeric as well as a multimeric protein in mitochondria isolated from neuroblastoma cells. Upon treatments with mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), PIMT monomers level decreased by half while that of PIMT multimers was higher. Gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions of CCCP-induced PIMT multimers led to PIMT monomers accumulation, indicating that multimers resulted from disulfide-linked PIMT monomers. The antioxidant ascorbic acid significantly lowered CCCP-induced formation of PIMT multimers, suggesting that reactive oxygen species contributed to PIMT multimerization. In addition, the elevation of PIMT multimers catalytic activity upon treatments with CCCP was severely inhibited by the reducing agent dithiothreitol. This indicated that PIMT monomers have lower enzymatic activity following CCCP treatments and that activation of PIMT multimers is essentially dependent on the formation of disulfide-linked monomers of PIMT. Furthermore, the perturbation of mitochondrial function by CCCP promoted the accumulation of damaged aspartyl residues in proteins with high molecular weights. Thus, this study demonstrates the formation of active PIMT multimers associated with mitochondria that could play a key role in repairing damaged proteins accumulating during mitochondrial dysfunction.

Although aversive brain processing has been shown to involve the sensorimotor cortex, the neural and biochemical mechanisms underlying the interaction between two independent aversive cues are unclear. Based on previous work indicating ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) involvement in the mediation of context-dependent emotional effects, we hypothesized a central role for the vmPFC in modulating sensorimotor cortex activity using a GABAergic mechanism during an aversive-aversive stimulus interaction. This approach revealed differential activations within the aversion-related network (eg, sensorimotor cortex, midcingulate, and insula) for the aversive-aversive, when compared with the aversive-neutral, interaction. Individual differences in sensorimotor cortex signal changes during the aversive-aversive interaction were predicted by GABA(A) receptors in both vmPFC and sensorimotor cortex. Together, these results demonstrate the central role of GABA in mediating context-dependent effects in aversion-related processing.

However, generating novel mouse mutants is often frustratingly slow. It has been shown that access to the mouse brain developing in utero with reasonable post-operatory survival is possible. Still, results with this procedure have been reported almost exclusively for the most superficial and easily accessible part of the developing brain, i.e. the cortex. The thalamus, a narrower and more medial region, has proven more difficult to target. Transfection into deeper nuclei, especially those of the hypothalamus, is perhaps the most challenging and therefore very few results have been reported. Here we demonstrate a procedure to target the entire hypothalamic neuroepithelium or part of it ( hypothalamic regions) for transfection through electroporation. The keys to our approach are longer narcosis times, injection in the third ventricle, and appropriate kind and positioning of the electrodes. Additionally, we show results of targeting and subsequent histological analysis of the most recessed hypothalamic nucleus, the mammillary body.

J	Paradis, M				Paradis, Michel			Late-L2 increased reliance on L1 neurocognitive substrates: A comment on Babcock, Stowe, Maloof, Brovetto & Ullman (2012)	BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION			English	Editorial Material						lexical item; late-learned second language; lexicon; vocabulary; declarative memory		Babcok et al. (2012) claim that Paradis (1994, 2004, 2009) argues that the reliance of late L2 learners on L1 neurocognitive mechanisms increases over time across both lexical and grammatical functions, namely for lexical items as well as rule-governed grammatical procedures, when in fact one can find repeated statements to the contrary in the very publications cited by the authors. Actually, Paradis' main contention over the past 20 years has been that, contrary to grammatical functions, lexical items (as meaning-form relationships) are always of the same nature in L1 and L2 (hence stored declaratively). Thus in L2, only the neurocognitive mechanisms on which aspects of the grammar depend change over time. Consequently, the finding that length of residence (like age of arrival) influences the mechanisms underlying regular (composed), but not irregular (stored) verb forms, is compatible with Paradis' views, in contradiction to what Babcock et al. are also suggesting.

Using these small-animal models of ALS, we previously identified methylene blue (MB) as a potent suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity. Consequently here we investigated how MB might exert its neuroprotective properties and found that it acts through reduction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. We tested other compounds known to be active in the ER unfolded protein response in worms and zebrafish expressing mutant human TDP-43 (mTDP-43). We identified three compounds: salubrinal, guanabenz and a new structurally related compound phenazine, which also reduced paralysis, neurodegeneration and oxidative stress in our mTDP-43 models. Using C elegans genetics, we showed that all four compounds act as potent suppressors of mTDP-43 toxicity through reduction of the ER stress response. Interestingly, these compounds operate through different branches of the ER unfolded protein pathway to achieve a common neuroprotective action. Our results indicate that protein-folding homeostasis in the ER is an important target for therapeutic development in ALS and other TDP-43-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Caspase-6 activity predicts lower episodic memory ability in aged individuals	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Caspase-6; Alzheimer disease; Memory performance; Aged individuals and cognition; Episodic memory; Working memory; Semantic memory; Visuospatial abilities; Perceptual speed	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; BETA-PEPTIDE; NEURON CULTURES; OLDER PERSONS; CA1; ACTIVATION; INVOLVEMENT	Caspase-6 (Casp6), a cysteinyl protease that induces axonal degeneration, is activated early in Alzheimer Disease (AD) brains. To determine whether Casp6 activation is responsible for early cognitive impairment, we investigated the abundance of Casp6 activity, paired helical filament-1 (PHF-1) phosphorylated Tau and amyloid beta peptide (A beta) pathology by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampal formation of aged non-cognitively impaired (NCI) individuals. Casp6 activity was restricted to the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Pathology scores were then correlated with cognitive scores obtained within 1 year of death. Regression analyses revealed that ERC and CA1 Casp6 activity were the main contributor to lower episodic memory performance, whereas ERC PHF-1 pathology predicted lower semantic and working memory performance. A beta did not correlate with any of the cognitive tests. Because Casp6 activity and PHF-1 pathology are intimately associated with AD pathology and memory decline is an early event in AD, we conclude that Casp6 activity and PHF-1 immunoreactivity in ERC identifies aged individuals at risk for developing AD.

The richness of the related literature shows that this new classification approach may be an efficient alternative, in addition to existing paradigms. After describing the various PSC approaches found in the literature, the paper identifies and discusses two data-related problems that may affect PSC efficiency: high-dimensional datasets and mixed-attribute data. The solutions that have been proposed in the literature for each of these issues are described including recent improvements by a novel PSC algorithm developed by the authors. Subsequently, a positioning PSC for these problems with respect to other classification approaches is made. This is accomplished by using one proprietary and five well known benchmark datasets to determine the performances of PSC algorithm and comparing the obtained results with those reported for various other classification approaches. It is concluded that PSC can be efficiently applied to classification problems with large numbers of instances, both in continuous and mixed-attribute problem description spaces. Moreover, the obtained results show that PSC may not only be applied to more demanding problem domains, but it can also be a competitive alternative to well established classification techniques.

Mallar			A novel in vivo atlas of human hippocampal subfields using high-resolution 3 T magnetic resonance imaging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MRI; High-resolution; Hippocampus; Subfields; Segmentation; Atlas	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HUMAN BRAIN; AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION; PROBABILISTIC ATLAS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WARPING TECHNIQUES; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MR-IMAGES; VOLUME; AGE	The hippocampus is a neuroanatomical structure that has been widely studied in the context of learning, memory, stress, and neurodegeneration. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus is subdivided into several subfields with intricate morphologies and complex three-dimensional relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated that the identification of different subfields is possible with high-resolution and -contrast image volumes acquired using ex vivo specimens in a small bore 9.4 T scanner and, more recently, in vivo, at 7 T. In these studies, the neuroanatomical definitions of boundaries between subfields are based upon salient differences in image contrast. Typically, the definition of subfields has not been possible using commonly available magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (i.e.: 15 or 3 T) due to resolution and contrast limitations. To overcome the limited availability of post-mortem specimens and expertise in state-of-the-art high-field imaging, we propose a coupling of MR acquisition and detailed segmentation techniques that allow for the reliable identification of hippocampal anatomy (including subfields). High-resolution and -contrast T1- and T2-weighted image volumes were acquired from 5 volunteers (2 male; 3 female; age range: 29-57, avg. 37) using a clinical research-grade 3 T scanner and have final super-sampled isotropic voxel dimensions of 0.3 mm. We demonstrate that by using these acquisition techniques, our data results in contrast-to-noise ratios that compare well with high-resolution images acquired with long scan times using post-mortem data at higher field strengths. For the subfields, the cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum/stratum moleculare, and subiculum were all labeled as separate structures. Hippocampal volumes are reported for each of the substructures and the hippocampus as a whole (range for hippocampus: 2456.72-3325.02 mm(3)). Intra-rater reliability of our manual segmentation protocol demonstrates high reliability for the whole hippocampus (mean Dice Kappa of 0.91; range 0.90-0.92) and for each of the subfields (range of Dice Kappas: 0.64-0.83). We demonstrate that our reliability is better than the Dice Kappas produced by simulating the following errors: a translation by a single voxel in all cardinal directions and 1% volumetric shrinkage and expansion. The completed hippocampal atlases are available freely online (info2.camh.net/kf-tigr/index.php/Hippocampus) and can be coupled with novel computational neuroanatomy techniques that will allow for them to be customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects, and ultimately be utilized in different analysis pipelines.

To better understand puberty-related effects on brain development, we investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 306 subjects from 4 to 18 years of age. Subjects were grouped into before and during puberty groups according to their sexual maturity levels measured by the puberty scores. An appearance model-based automatic segmentation method with patch-based local refinement was employed to segment the MRI data and extract the volumes of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures including the amygdala (AG), the hippocampus (HC), the entorhinal/perirhinal cortex (EPC), and the parahippocampal cortex (PHC). Our analysis showed age-related volumetric changes for the AG, HC, right EPC, and left PHC but only before puberty. After onset of puberty, these volumetric changes then correlate more with sexual maturity level, as measured by the puberty score. When normalized for brain volume, the volumes of the right HC decrease for boys; the volumes of the left HC increase for girls; and the volumes of the left and right PHC decrease for boys. These findings suggest that the rising levels of testosterone in boys and estrogen in girls might have opposite effects, especially for the HC and the PHC. Our findings on sex-specific and sexual maturity-related volumes may be useful in better understanding the MTL developmental differences and related learning, memory, and emotion differences between boys and girls during puberty.

J	Ko, AHR; Sabourin, R				Ko, Albert Hung-Ren; Sabourin, Robert			Single Classifier-based Multiple Classification Scheme for weak classifiers: An experimental comparison	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ensemble of classifiers; Multiple Classifier System; Bagging; Boosting; Diversity; Multiple Classification Scheme	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; ACCURACY; COMBINATION	In this paper, we propose a Single Classifier-based Multiple Classification Scheme (SMCS) that uses only a single classifier to generate multiple classifications for a given test data point. The SMCS does not require the presence of multiple classifiers, and generates diversity through the creation of pseudo test samples. The pseudo test sample generation mechanism allows the SMCS to adapt to dynamic environments without multiple classifier training. Moreover, because of the presence of multiple classifications, classification combination schemes, such as majority voting, can be applied, and so the mechanism may improve the recognition rate in a manner similar to that of Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS). The experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed SMCS as applicable to many classification systems. Even without parameter selection, the average performance of the SMCS is still comparable to that of Bagging or Boosting. Moreover, the SMCS and the traditional MCS scheme are not mutually exclusive, and the SMCS can be applied along with traditional MCS, such as Bagging and Boosting. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to study the metabolic and electrophysiological correlates of these changes in the DMN regions. We studied six epilepsy patients that underwent scalp EEG-fMRI and later stereotaxic intracerebral EEG (SEEG) sampling regions of DMN (posterior cingulate cortex, Pre-cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral frontal cortex) as well as non-DMN regions. SEEG recordings were subject to frequency analyses comparing sections with interictal epileptic discharges (IED) to IED-free baselines in the IED-generating region, DMN and non-DMN regions. EEG-fMRI and SEEG were obtained at rest. During IEDs, EEG-fMRI demonstrated deactivation in various DMN nodes in 5 of 6 patients, most frequently the pre-cuneus and inferior parietal lobule, and less frequently the other DMN nodes. SEEG analyses demonstrated decrease in gamma power (50150 Hz), and increase in the power of lower frequencies (<30 Hz) at times of IEDs, in at least one DMN node in all patients. These changes were not apparent in the non-DMN regions. We demonstrate that, at the time of IEDs, DMN regions decrease their metabolic demand and undergo an EEG change consisting of decreased gamma and increased lower frequencies. These findings, specific to DMN regions, confirm in a pathological condition a direct relationship between DMN BOLD activity and EEG activity.

No exercise is effective if it is not done and people with MS face unique barriers to exercise engagement which need to be overcome. We have developed and pilot tested a Multiple Sclerosis Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP) and it is ready to be tested against general guidelines for superiority and ultimately for its impact on MS relevant outcomes. The primary research question is to what extent does an MS Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP) result in greater improvements in exercise capacity and related outcomes over a one year period in comparison to a program based on general guidelines for exercise among people with MS who are sedentary and wish to engage in exercise as part of MS self-management. Methods/Design: The proposed study is an assessor-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The duration of the intervention will be one year with follow-up to year two. The targeted outcomes are exercise capacity, functional ambulation, strength, and components of quality of life including frequency and intensity of fatigue symptoms, mood, global physical function, health perception, and objective measures of activity level. Logistic regression will be used to test the main hypothesis related to the superiority of the MSTEP program based on a greater proportion of people making a clinically relevant gain in exercise capacity at 1 year and at 2 years, using an intention-to-treat approach. Sample size will be 240 (120 per group). Discussion: The MS community is clearly looking for interventions to help alleviate the disabling sequelae of MS and promote health. Exercise is a well-known intervention which has known benefits to all, yet few exercise regularly. For people with MS, the role of exercise in MS management needs to be rigorously assessed to inform people as to how best to use exercise to reduce disability and promote health.

Characterization of Maleimide-Based Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) Inhibitors as Stimulators of Steroidogenesis	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; LITHIUM ACTION; POTENT; PROTEIN; IDENTIFICATION; MITOCHONDRIA; THERAPEUTICS; DISEASES; RECEPTOR	Inhibition of GSK-3 beta has been well documented to account for the behavioral actions of the mood stabilizer lithium in various animal models of mood disorders. Recent studies have showed that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3 beta resulted in anxiolytic-like and pro-social behavior. In our ongoing efforts to develop GSK-3 beta inhibitors for the treatment of mood disorders, SAR studies on maleimide-based compounds were undertaken. We present herein for the first time that some of these GSK-3 beta inhibitors, in particular analogues 1 and 9, were able to stimulate progesterone production in the MA-10 mouse tumor Leydig cell model of steroidogenesis without any significant toxicity. These two compounds were tested in the SmartCube behavioral assay and showed anxiolytic-like signatures following daily dose administration (50 mg/kg, ip) for 13 days. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that GSK-3 beta inhibition could influence neuroactive steroid production thereby mediating the modulation of anxiety-like behavior in vivo.

Adrenarche also coincides with the emergence of the prosocial and neurobehavioral skills of middle childhood and may therefore represent a human-specific stage of development. Both DHEA and testosterone have been reported in animal and in vitro studies to enhance neuronal survival and programmed cell death depending on the timing, dose, and hormonal context involved, and to potentially compete for the same signaling pathways. Yet no extant brain-hormone studies have examined the interaction between DHEA- and testosterone-related cortical maturation in humans. Here, we used linear mixed models to examine changes in cortical thickness associated with salivary DHEA and testosterone levels in a longitudinal sample of developmentally healthy children and adolescents 4-22 years old. DHEA levels were associated with increases in cortical thickness of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right temporoparietal junction, right premotor and right entorhinal cortex between the ages of 4-13 years, a period marked by the androgenic changes of adrenarche. There was also an interaction between DHEA and testosterone on cortical thickness of the right cingulate cortex and occipital pole that was most significant in prepubertal subjects. DHEA and testosterone appear to interact and modulate the complex process of cortical maturation during middle childhood, consistent with evidence at the molecular level of fast/nongenomic and slow/genomic or conversion-based mechanisms underlying androgen-related brain development.

GABA INCREASES STIMULUS SELECTIVITY OF NEURONS IN PRIMARY VISUAL CORTICES OF CATS CHRONICALLY TREATED WITH MORPHINE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						primary visual cortex; orientation selectivity; GABA; bicuculline	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE CORTEX; IN-VITRO; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; EXPOSURE AFFECTS; MEDIATED NEUROTRANSMISSION; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; RESPONSE MODULATION	Chronic exposure to opiates leads to maladaptive changes in various functions of the mammalian brain, including properties of neuronal response in the visual pathway. In the present study, we used multibarreled microelectrodes to study the effects of electrophoretic application of GABA or the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline on the properties of individual V1 neurons in cats which were chronically treated with morphine (MTCs) or saline (STCs). The results showed that the application of either GABA or bicuculline significantly altered spontaneous activity as well as orientation selectivity and signal-to-noise ratios of visually evoked responses in both MTCs and STCs. While administration of bicuculline exerted a much stronger effect on neuronal responses of VI neurons of the STCs, administration of GABA resulted in improved visual function mainly in MTCs. Most importantly, GABA-treated cells in area V1 of the MTCs displayed similar responses to those in STCs. These results are consistent with the idea that: (1) there is a decrease in GABA-mediated inhibition in area VI of cats exposed chronically to morphine, and (2) this decrease contributes strongly to the apparent degradation of neuronal function observed in animals exposed chronically to morphine.

Hippocampal volume is heritable, may explain a variety of cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and is thus considered an intermediate phenotype for this mental illness. The aim of our analyses was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) related to hippocampal volume without making prior assumptions about possible candidate genes. In this study, we combined genetics, imaging and neuropsychological data obtained from the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium study of schizophrenia (n = 328). A total of 743,591 SNPs were tested for association with hippocampal volume in a genome-wide association study. Gene expression profiles of human hippocampal tissue were investigated for gene regions of significantly associated SNPs. None of the genetic markers reached genome-wide significance. However, six highly correlated SNPs (rs4808611, rs35686037, rs12982178, rs1042178, rs10406920, rs8170) on chromosome 19p13.11, located within or in close proximity to the genes NR2F6, USHBP1, and BABAM1, as well as four SNPs in three other genomic regions (chromosome 1, 2 and 10) had p-values between 6.75x10(-6) and 8.3x10(-7). Using existing data of a very recently published GWAS of hippocampal volume and additional data of a multicentre study in a large cohort of adolescents of European ancestry, we found supporting evidence for our results. Furthermore, allelic differences in rs4808611 and rs8170 were highly associated with differential mRNA expression in the cis-acting region. Associations with memory functioning indicate a possible functional importance of the identified risk variants. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of a brain structure closely linked to schizophrenia. In silico replication, mRNA expression and cognitive data provide additional support for the relevance of our findings. Identification of causal variants and their functional effects may unveil yet unknown players in the neurodevelopment and the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.

The parkin protein is a RING-in-between-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase that exhibits low basal activity. We describe the crystal structure of full-length rat parkin. The structure shows parkin in an autoinhibited state and provides insight into how it is activated. RING0 occludes the ubiquitin acceptor site Cys(431) in RING2, whereas a repressor element of parkin binds RING1 and blocks its E2-binding site. Mutations that disrupted these inhibitory interactions activated parkin both in vitro and in cells. Parkin is neuroprotective, and these findings may provide a structural and mechanistic framework for enhancing parkin activity.

BigBrain: An Ultrahigh-Resolution 3D Human Brain Model	SCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; CORTICAL AREAS; PATTERNS; ATLASES; MRI; CYTOARCHITECTURE; SYSTEM; MONKEY; MAP	Reference brains are indispensable tools in human brain mapping, enabling integration of multimodal data into an anatomically realistic standard space. Available reference brains, however, are restricted to the macroscopic scale and do not provide information on the functionally important microscopic dimension. We created an ultrahigh-resolution three-dimensional (3D) model of a human brain at nearly cellular resolution of 20 micrometers, based on the reconstruction of 7404 histological sections. "BigBrain" is a free, publicly available tool that provides considerable neuroanatomical insight into the human brain, thereby allowing the extraction of microscopic data for modeling and simulation. BigBrain enables testing of hypotheses on optimal path lengths between interconnected cortical regions or on spatial organization of genetic patterning, redefining the traditional neuroanatomy maps such as those of Brodmann and von Economo.

However, the extent to which those impairments are associated with ASPD, psychopathy, or both is unknown. Methods: The present study examined 17 violent offenders with ASPD and psychopathy (ASPD+P), 28 violent offenders with ASPD without psychopathy (ASPD-P), and 21 healthy non-offenders on tasks assessing cool (verbal working memory and alteration of motor responses to spatial locations) and hot (reversal learning, decision-making under risk, and stimulus-reinforcement-based decision-making) executive function. Results: In comparison to healthy non-offenders, violent offenders with ASPD+P and those with ASPD-P showed similar impairments in verbal working memory and adaptive decision-making. They failed to learn from punishment cues, to change their behaviour in the face of changing contingencies, and made poorer quality decisions despite longer periods of deliberation. Intriguingly, the two groups of offenders did not differ significantly from the non-offenders in terms of their alteration of motor responses to spatial locations and their levels of risk-taking, indicated by betting, and impulsivity, measured as delay aversion. The performance of the two groups of offenders on the measures of cool and hot executive function did not differ, indicating shared deficits. Conclusions: These documented impairments may help to explain the persistence of antisocial behaviours despite the known risks of the negative consequences of such behaviours.

From perception to pleasure: Music and its neural substrates	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cognition; functional imaging; auditory cortex	INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; REWARD PREDICTION; DOPAMINE RELEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN BRAIN; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE	Music has existed in human societies since prehistory, perhaps because it allows expression and regulation of emotion and evokes pleasure. In this review, we present findings from cognitive neuroscience that bear on the question of how we get from perception of sound patterns to pleasurable responses. First, we identify some of the auditory cortical circuits that are responsible for encoding and storing tonal patterns and discuss evidence that cortical loops between auditory and frontal cortices are important for maintaining musical information in working memory and for the recognition of structural regularities in musical patterns, which then lead to expectancies. Second, we review evidence concerning the mesolimbic striatal system and its involvement in reward, motivation, and pleasure in other domains. Recent data indicate that this dopaminergic system mediates pleasure associated with music; specifically, reward value for music can be coded by activity levels in the nucleus accumbens, whose functional connectivity with auditory and frontal areas increases as a function of increasing musical reward. We propose that pleasure in music arises from interactions between cortical loops that enable predictions and expectancies to emerge from sound patterns and subcortical systems responsible for reward and valuation.

The present state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation study is aimed at determining whether speech recognition is indeed mediated by the auditory dorsal pathway, by examining the causal contribution of the left ventral premotor cortex, supramarginal gyrus and posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus during an auditory syllable identification/categorization task. To this aim, participants listened to a sequence of /ba/ syllables before undergoing a two forced-choice auditory syllable decision task on ambiguous syllables (ranging in the categorical boundary between /ba/ and /da/). Consistent with previous studies on selective adaptation to speech, following adaptation to /ba/, participants responses were biased towards /da/. In contrast, in a control condition without prior auditory adaptation no such bias was observed. Crucially, compared to the results observed without stimulation, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered at the onset of each target stimulus interacted with the initial state of each of the stimulated brain area by enhancing the adaptation effect. These results demonstrate that the auditory dorsal pathway contribute to auditory speech adaptation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

G.; Belin, Pascal			Norm-Based Coding of Voice Identity in Human Auditory Cortex	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							VOCAL-TRACT LENGTH; FACE RECOGNITION; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATION; ADAPTATION; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; SPEECH; SIGNAL	Listeners exploit small interindividual variations around a generic acoustical structure to discriminate and identify individuals from their voice-a key requirement for social interactions. The human brain contains temporal voice areas (TVA) [1] involved in an acoustic-based representation of voice identity [2-6], but the underlying coding mechanisms remain unknown. Indirect evidence suggests that identity representation in these areas could rely on a norm-based coding mechanism [4, 7-11]. Here, we show by using fMRI that voice identity is coded in the TVA as a function of acoustical distance to two internal voice prototypes (one male, one female)-approximated here by averaging a large number of same-gender voices by using morphing [12]. Voices more distant from their prototype are perceived as more distinctive and elicit greater neuronal activity in voice-sensitive cortex than closer voices-a phenomenon not merely explained by neuronal adaptation [13, 14]. Moreover, explicit manipulations of distance-to-mean by morphing voices toward (or away from) their prototype elicit reduced (or enhanced) neuronal activity. These results indicate that voice-sensitive cortex integrates relevant acoustical features into a complex representation referenced to idealized male and female voice prototypes. More generally, they shed light on remarkable similarities in cerebral representations of facial and vocal identity.	[Latinus, Marianne; McAleer, Phil; Bestelmeyer, Patricia E.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate functional inhibition of ARTN with monoclonal antibodies and to determine whether ARTN neutralisation could reverse inflammatory pain in mice. We show that monoclonal antibodies with high affinity to ARTN, completely inhibit ARTN-induced Ret and ERK activation in a human neuroblastoma cell line, and block capsaicin-induced CGRP secretion from primary rat DRG cultures. In addition, administration of anti-ARTN antibodies to mice provides a transient, partial reversal (41%) of FCA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Anti-ARTN antibodies had no effect on hypersensitivity in response to partial nerve ligation in mice. These data suggest that ARTN-GFR alpha 3 interactions partially mediate early stage nociceptive signalling following an inflammatory insult. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Overexpression of mutant forms of VAPB leads to cytosolic aggregates, suggesting a gain of function of the mutant protein. However, recent work suggested that the loss of VAPB function could be the major mechanism leading to ALS8. Here, we used multiple genetic and experimental approaches to study whether VAPB loss of function might be sufficient to trigger motor neuron degeneration. In order to identify additional ALS-associated VAPB mutations, we screened the entire VAPB gene in a cohort of ALS patients and detected two mutations (A145V and S160). To directly address the contribution of VAPB loss of function in ALS, we generated zebrafish and mouse models with either a decreased or a complete loss of Vapb expression. Vapb knockdown in zebrafish led to swimming deficits. Mice knocked-out for Vapb showed mild motor deficits after 18 months of age yet had innervated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Importantly, overexpression of VAPB mutations were unable to rescue the motor deficit caused by Vapb knockdown in zebrafish and failed to cause a toxic gain-of-function defect on their own. Thus, Vapb loss of function weakens the motor system of vertebrate animal models but is on its own unable to lead to a complete ALS phenotype. Our findings are consistent with the notion that VAPB mutations constitute a risk factor for motor neuron disease through a loss of VAPB function.

Although a polymorphism in this gene, COMT Val(158)Met, affects human behavior in response to stress little is known about its effect on dopaminergic activity associated with the human stress response, which may be of interest for stress-related psychiatric disorders such as psychosis. We aimed to investigate the effect of variations in COMT genotype on in vivo measures of stress-induced prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopaminergic processing and subjective stress responses. A combined sample of healthy controls and healthy first-degree relatives of psychosis patients (n = 26) were subjected to an [F-18] fallypride Positron Emission Tomography scan. Psychosocial stress during the scan was induced using the Montreal Imaging Stress Task and subjective stress was assessed every 12 minutes. Parametric t-maps, generated using the linear extension of the simplified reference region model, revealed an effect of COMT genotype on the spatial extent of [F-18] fallypride displacement. Detected effects of exposure to psychosocial stress were unilateral and remained restricted to the left superior and right inferior frontal gyrus, with Met-hetero- and homozygotes showing less [F-18] fallypride displacement than Val-homozygotes. Additionally, Met-hetero- and homozygotes experienced larger subjective stress responses than Val-homozygotes. The direction of the effects remained the same when the data was analyzed separately for controls and first-degree relatives. The human stress response may be mediated in part by COMT-dependent dopaminergic PFC activity, providing speculation for the neurobiology underlying COMT-dependent differences in human behaviour following stress. Implications of these results for stress-related psychopathology and models of dopaminergic functioning are discussed.

MODULATION OF LOCAL FIELD POTENTIAL POWER OF THE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS DURING ISOMETRIC FORCE GENERATION IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep brain stimulation (DBS); intraoperative recordings; Granger-causality; squared partial directed coherence; closed-loop stimulation; basal ganglia	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FMRI SIGNAL; TREMOR; DOPAMINE; TIME	Investigations of local field potentials of the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease have provided evidence for pathologically exaggerated oscillatory beta-band activity (13-30 Hz) which is amenable to physiological modulation by, e.g., voluntary movement. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in healthy controls have provided evidence for an increase of subthalamic nucleus blood-oxygenation-level-dependant signal in incremental force generation tasks. However, the modulation of neuronal activity by force generation and its relationship to peripheral feedback remain to be elucidated. We hypothesised that beta-band activity in the subthalamic nucleus is modulated by incremental force generation. Subthalamic nucleus local field potentials were recorded intraoperatively in 13 patients with Parkinson's disease (37 recording sites) during rest and five incremental isometric force generation conditions of the arm with applied loads of 0-400 g (in 100-g increments). Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a modulation of local field potential (LFP) power in the upper beta- band (in 24-30 Hz; F-(3.042) = 4.693, p = 0.036) and the gamma-band (in 70-76 Hz; F-(4) = 4.116, p = 0.036). Granger-causality was computed with the squared partial directed coherence and showed no significant modulation during incremental isometric force generation. Our findings indicate that the upper beta- and gamma-band power of subthalamic nucleus local field potentials are modulated by the physiological task of force generation in patients with Parkinson's disease. This modulation seems to be not an effect of a modulation of peripheral feedback. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Florin, E.; Dafsari, H. S.; Reck, C.; Barbe, M.

However, it has been shown that activation of Gq-coupled and phospholipase C-linked receptors can induce persistent firing, a cellular correlate of working memory, in cortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, despite its importance in stress and cognition, the exact role of norepinephrine in modulating PFC activity remains elusive. Using electrophysiology and optogenetics, we report here that norepinephrine induces persistent firing in pyramidal neurons of the PFC independent of recurrent fast synaptic excitation. This persistent excitatory effect involves presynaptic alpha 1 adrenoceptors facilitating glutamate release and subsequent activation of postsynaptic mGluR5 receptors, and is enhanced by postsynaptic alpha 2 adrenoceptors inhibiting HCN channel activity. Activation of alpha 2 adrenoceptors or inhibition of HCN channels also enhances cholinergic persistent responses in pyramidal neurons, providing a mechanism of crosstalk between noradrenergic and cholinergic inputs. The present study describes a novel cellular basis for the noradrenergic control of cortical information processing and supports a synergistic combination of intrinsic and network mechanisms for the expression of mnemonic properties in pyramidal neurons.

Recently, a sprouting of autonomic sympathetic fibers into the upper dermis of the skin, an area that is normally devoid of them, was found in the skin following chronic inflammation of the rat hindpaw. While this sprouting only occurred when signs of joint and bone damage were present, it remained to be clarified whether it was a consequence of the chronic inflammation of the skin or of the arthritis and whether it also occurred in the joint. In the present study, we used a model of arthritis in which complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected into the rat ankle joint. At 4 weeks following CFA treatment, there was an increase in sympathetic and peptidergic fiber density in the ankle joint synovium. We also observed a sympathetic, but not peptidergic, fiber sprouting in the skin over the joint, which may be a consequence of the increased levels of mature nerve growth factor levels in skin, as revealed by Western blot analysis. The pharmacological suppression of sympathetic fiber function with systemic guanethidine significantly decreased the pain-related behavior associated with arthritis. Guanethidine completely suppressed the heat hyperalgesia and attenuated mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. These results suggest that transmitters released from the sprouted sympathetic fibers in the synovial membrane and upper dermis contribute to the pain-related behavior associated with arthritis. Blocking the sympathetic fiber sprouting may provide a novel therapeutic approach to alleviate pain in arthritis.

This phenomenon has been linked to changes in synaptic function. The synaptic adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NLG1) controls the activity and synaptic localization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which activity is impaired by prolonged wakefulness. We here highlight that this pathway may underlie both the adverse effects of sleep loss on cognition and the subsequent changes in cortical synchrony. We found that the expression of specific Nlg1 transcript variants is changed by sleep deprivation in three mouse strains. These observations were associated with strain-specific changes in synaptic NLG1 protein content. Importantly, we showed that Nlg1 knockout mice are not able to sustain wakefulness and spend more time in nonrapid eye movement sleep than wild-type mice. These changes occurred with modifications in waking quality as exemplified by low theta/alpha activity during wakefulness and poor preference for social novelty, as well as altered delta synchrony during sleep. Finally, we identified a transcriptional pathway that could underlie the sleep/wake-dependent changes in Nlg1 expression and that involves clock transcription factors. We thus suggest that NLG1 is an element that contributes to the coupling of neuronal activity to sleep/wake regulation.

The primary objective is to clarify the associations between traditional and newer biomarkers in the prediction of specific renal and CV events, and of death in patients with CKD managed by nephrologists. This information could then be used to better understand biological variation in outcomes, to develop clinical prediction models and to inform enrolment into interventional studies which may lead to novel treatments. Methods/Designs: Commenced in 2008, 2546 patients have been enrolled with eGFR between 15 and 45 ml/min 1.73m2 from a representative sample in 25 rural, urban, academic and non academic centres across Canada. Patients are to be followed for an initial 3 years at 6 monthly intervals, and subsequently annually. Traditional biomarkers include eGFR, urine albumin creatinine ratio (uACR), hemoglobin (Hgb), phosphate and albumin. Newer biomarkers of interest were selected on the basis of biological relevance to important processes, commercial availability and assay reproducibility. They include asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), troponin I, cystatin C, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1). Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline, and every 6 monthly, and stored at -80 degrees C. Outcomes of interest include renal replacement therapy, CV events and death, the latter two of which are adjudicated by an independent panel. Discussion: The baseline distribution of newer biomarkers does not appear to track to markers of kidney function and therefore may offer some discriminatory value in predicting future outcomes. The granularity of the data presented at baseline may foster additional questions. The value of the cohort as a unique resource to understand outcomes of patients under the care of nephrologists in a single payer healthcare system cannot be overstated. Systematic collection of demographic, laboratory and event data should lead to new insights. The mean age of the cohort was 68 years, 90% were Caucasian, 62% were male, and 48% had diabetes. Forty percent of the cohort had eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73m(2), 22% had eGFR values below 20 mL/min/1.73m(2); 61% had uACR < 30. Serum albumin, hemoglobin, calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) levels were progressively lower in the lower eGFR strata, while parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increased. Cystatin C, ADMA, NT-proBNP, hsCRP, troponin I and IL-6 were significantly higher in the lower GFR strata, whereas 25(OH) D and TGF beta 1 values were lower at lower GFR. These distributions of each of the newer biomarkers by eGFR and uACR categories were variable.

This study aimed to examine the effects of aging on mismatch activity to pitch deviants by using a whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) together with distributed source modeling analysis. The neuromagnetic responses to oddball paradigms consisting of standards (1000 Hz, p = 0.85) and deviants (1100 Hz, p = 0.15) were recorded in healthy young (n = 20) and aged (n = 18) male adults. We used minimum norm estimate of source reconstruction to characterize the spatiotemporal neural dynamics of MMNm responses. Distributed activations to MMNm were identified in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal areas. Compared to younger participants, the elderly exhibited a significant reduction of cortical activation in bilateral superior temporal guri, superior temporal sulci, inferior fontal gyri, orbitofrontal cortices and right inferior parietal lobules. In conclusion, our results suggest an aging-related decline in auditory sensory memory and automatic change detection as indexed by MMNm. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alleviation of chronic neuropathic pain by environmental enrichment in mice well after the establishment of chronic pain	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article						Chronic neuropathic pain; Environmental enrichment; Environmental impoverishment; Animal model; Spared nerve injury	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; LOW-BACK-PAIN; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; TRAP MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; VOLUNTARY EXERCISE; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; MORPHINE ANALGESIA; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE	Background: In animal models, the impact of social and environmental manipulations on chronic pain have been investigated in short term studies where enrichment was implemented prior to or concurrently with the injury. The focus of this study was to evaluate the impact of environmental enrichment or impoverishment in mice three months after induction of chronic neuropathic pain. Methods: Thirty-four CD-1 seven to eight week-old male mice were used. Mice underwent surgery on the left leg under isoflurane anesthesia to induce the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain or sham condition. Mice were then randomly assigned to one of four groups: nerve injury with enriched environment (n = 9), nerve injury with impoverished environment (n = 8), sham surgery with enriched environment (n = 9), or sham surgery with impoverished environment (n = 8). The effects of environmental manipulations on mechanical (von Frey filaments) heat (hot plate) and cold (acetone test) cutaneous hypersensitivities, motor impairment (Rotarod), spontaneous exploratory behavior (open field test), anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus maze) and depression-like phenotype (tail suspension test) were assessed in neuropathic and control mice 1 and 2 months post-environmental change. Finally, the effect of the environment on spinal expression of the pro-nociceptive neuropeptides substance P and CGRP form the lumbar spinal cord collected at the end of the study was evaluated by tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: Environmental enrichment attenuated nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity to mechanical and cold stimuli. In contrast, an impoverished environment exacerbated mechanical hypersensitivity. No antidepressant effects of enrichment were observed in animals with chronic neuropathic pain. Finally, environmental enrichment resulted lower SP and CGRP concentrations in neuropathic animals compared to impoverishment. These effects were all observed in animals that had been neuropathic for several months prior to intervention. Conclusions: These results suggest that environmental factors could play an important role in the rehabilitation of chronic pain patients well after the establishment of chronic pain. Enrichment is a potentially inexpensive, safe and easily implemented non-pharmacological intervention for the treatment of chronic pain.

In the present study, our aim was to characterize changes in functional brain networks following mild traumatic brain injury in patients with post-concussion syndrome using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We investigated 17 injured patients with persistent post-concussion syndrome (under the DSM-IV criteria) at 6 months post-injury compared with 38 mild traumatic brain injury patients with no post-concussion syndrome and 34 healthy controls. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging examinations at the subacute (1-3 weeks) and late (6 months) phases after injury. Group-wise differences in functional brain networks were analyzed using graph theory measures. Patterns of long-range functional networks alterations were found in all mild traumatic brain injury patients. Mild traumatic brain injury patients with post-concussion syndrome had greater alterations than patients without post-concussion syndrome. In patients with post-concussion syndrome, changes specifically affected temporal and thalamic regions predominantly at the subacute stage and frontal regions at the late phase. Our results suggest that the post-concussion syndrome is associated with specific abnormalities in functional brain network that may contribute to explain deficits typically observed in PCS patients.

J	Zerouali, Y; Lina, JM; Jemel, B				Zerouali, Younes; Lina, Jean-Marc; Jemel, Boutheina			Optimal Eye-Gaze Fixation Position for Face-Related Neural Responses	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; RETINA; N170; RECOGNITION; COMPONENT; BRAIN; PARTS	It is generally agreed that some features of a face, namely the eyes, are more salient than others as indexed by behavioral diagnosticity, gaze-fixation patterns and evoked-neural responses. However, because previous studies used unnatural stimuli, there is no evidence so far that the early encoding of a whole face in the human brain is based on the eyes or other facial features. To address this issue, scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye gaze-fixations were recorded simultaneously in a gaze-contingent paradigm while observers viewed faces. We found that the N170 indexing the earliest face-sensitive response in the human brain was the largest when the fixation position is located around the nasion. Interestingly, for inverted faces, this optimal fixation position was more variable, but mainly clustered in the upper part of the visual field (around the mouth). These observations extend the findings of recent behavioral studies, suggesting that the early encoding of a face, as indexed by the N170, is not driven by the eyes per se, but rather arises from a general perceptual setting (upper-visual field advantage) coupled with the alignment of a face stimulus to a stored face template.

We review here the evolving functions of the RGG box along with several sequence variations that we collectively term the RGG/RG motif. Greater than 1,000 human proteins harbor the RGG/RG motif, and these proteins influence numerous physiological processes such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, DNA damage signaling, mRNA translation, and the regulation of apoptosis. In particular, we discuss the role of the RGG/RG motif in mediating nucleic acid and protein interactions, a function that is often regulated by arginine methylation and partner-binding proteins. The physiological relevance of the RGG/RG motif is highlighted by its association with several diseases including neurological and neuromuscular diseases and cancer. Herein, we discuss the evidence for the emerging diverse functionality of this important motif.

Since short-term plasticity (STP) strongly shapes neural dynamics, this diversity suggests a specific and essential role in neural information processing. Therefore, a correct characterization of short-term synaptic plasticity is an important step towards understanding and modeling neural systems. Phenomenological models have been developed, but they are usually fitted to experimental data using least-mean-square methods. We demonstrate that for typical synaptic dynamics such fitting may give unreliable results. As a solution, we introduce a Bayesian formulation, which yields the posterior distribution over the model parameters given the data. First, we show that common STP protocols yield broad distributions over some model parameters. Using our result we propose a experimental protocol to more accurately determine synaptic dynamics parameters. Next, we infer the model parameters using experimental data from three different neocortical excitatory connection types. This reveals connection-specific distributions, which we use to classify synaptic dynamics. Our approach to demarcate connection-specific synaptic dynamics is an important improvement on the state of the art and reveals novel features from existing data.

Here, I review this literature and suggest that many of its findings are relevant to hominin intelligence. In particular, our large brains and increased intelligence may be partly independent of our ape phylogeny and the result of convergent processes similar to those that have molded avian and platyrrhine intelligence. Tool use, innovativeness and cultural transmission might be linked over our past and in our brains as operations of domain-general intelligence. Finally, colonization of new areas may have accompanied increases in both brain size and innovativeness in hominins as they have in other mammals and in birds, potentially accelerating hominin evolution via behavioral drive.

Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by alpha- or beta-secretase results in two soluble metabolites, sAPP alpha and sAPP beta, respectively. However, previous data have shown that both alpha- and beta-secretase have multiple cleavage sites. The aim of this study was to characterize the C-termini of sAPP alpha and sAPP beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by mass spectrometry (MS) and to evaluate whether different combinations of these fragments better separate between AD patients and controls by comparing two different sAPP immunoassays. Methods: Using immunoprecipitation and high resolution MS, the APP species present in CSF were investigated. CSF levels of sAPP alpha and sAPP beta from patients with AD (n=43) and from non-demented controls (n=44) were measured using AlphaLISA and MSD immunoassays that employ different antibodies for C-terminal recognition of sAPP alpha. Results: Four different C-terminal forms of sAPP were identified, sAPP beta-M671, sAPP beta-Y681, sAPP alpha-Q686, and 5APP alpha-K687 (APP770 numbering). Neither immunoassay for the sAPP species could separate the two patient groups. The correlation (R-2) between the two immunoassays was 0.41 for sAPP alpha and 0.45 for sAPP beta. Conclusion: Using high resolution MS, we show here for the first time that sAPP alpha in CSF ends at Q686 and K687. The findings also support the conclusion from several previous studies that sAPP alpha and sAPP beta levels are unaltered in AD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is considerable evidence supporting the involvement of oligomeric amyloid-beta (A beta) in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Historically, AD research has mainly focused on the long-term changes caused by A beta rather than analyzing its immediate effects. Here we show that acute perfusion of hippocampal slice cultures with oligomeric A beta depresses synaptic transmission within 20 minutes. This depression is dependent on synaptic stimulation and the activation of NMDA-receptors, but not on NMDA-receptor mediated ion flux. It, therefore, appears that A beta dependent synaptic depression is mediated through a use-dependent metabotropic-like mechanism of the NMDA-receptor, but does not involve NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic transmission, i.e. it is independent of calcium flux through the NMDA-receptor.

The Primate Cerebellum Selectively Encodes Unexpected Self-Motion	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							HEAD ROTATION; EXPLICIT STRATEGY; VESTIBULAR NUCLEI; NEURAL MECHANISMS; HORIZONTAL TRUNK; NECK INTERACTION; INTERNAL-MODELS; PURKINJE-CELLS; MONKEY; MOVEMENT	Background: The ability to distinguish sensory signals that register unexpected events (exafference) from those generated by voluntary actions (reafference) during self-motion is essential for accurate perception and behavior. The cerebellum is most commonly considered in relation to its contributions to the fine tuning of motor commands and sensorimotor calibration required for motor learning. During unexpected motion, however, the sensory prediction errors that drive motor learning potentially provide a neural basis for the computation underlying the distinction between reafference and exafference. Results: Recording from monkeys during voluntary and applied self-motion, we demonstrate that individual cerebellar output neurons encode an explicit and selective representation of unexpected self-motion by means of an elegant computation that cancels the reafferent sensory effects of self-generated movements. During voluntary self-motion, the sensory responses of neurons that robustly encode unexpected movement are canceled. Neurons with vestibular and proprioceptive responses to applied head and body movements are unresponsive when the same motion is self-generated. When sensory reafference and exafference are experienced simultaneously, individual neurons provide a precise estimate of the detailed time course of exafference. Conclusions: These results provide an explicit solution to the longstanding problem of understanding mechanisms by which the brain anticipates the sensory consequences of our voluntary actions. Specifically, by revealing a striking computation of a sensory prediction error signal that effectively distinguishes between the sensory consequences of self-generated and externally produced actions, our findings overturn the conventional thinking that the sensory errors coded by the cerebellum principally contribute to the fine tuning of motor activity required for motor learning.

Mammalian peroxisome assembly involves the protein products of 16 PEX genes; defects in 14 of these have been shown to cause PBD. Three broad phenotypic groups are described on a spectrum of severity: Zellweger syndrome is the most severe, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy is intermediate and infantile Refsum disease is less severe. Another group is Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata spectrum. Recently, atypical phenotypes have been described, indicating that the full spectrum of these disorders remains to be identified. For most patients, there is a correlation between clinical severity and effect of the mutation on PEX protein function. Diagnosis relies on biochemical measurements of peroxisome functions and PEX gene sequencing. There are no targeted therapies, although management protocols have been suggested and research endeavors continue. In this review we will discuss peroxisome biology and PBD, and research contributions to pathophysiology and treatment. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TRPV1-null mice exhibit a deficiency in sensing noxious heat stimuli, suggesting that TRPV1 is one of the main heat sensors on nociceptive primary afferent neurons and a candidate target for heat hypersensitivity in chronic pain. Several different potent and selective TRPV1 antagonists have been developed by more than 50 companies since the characterization of the receptor in 1997. A consequence of this competitive interest is the crowding of patentable chemical space, because very similar in vitro screening assays are used. To circumvent this issue and to expand our understanding of TRPV1 biology, we sought to take advantage of recent advancements in automated patch-clamp technology to design a novel screening cascade. This SAR-driving assay identified novel modulators that blocked the depolarization-induced activation of outwardly-rectifying TRPV1 currents independent of agonist stimulation, and we correlated the pharmacology to three other innovative assays for higher-throughput screening. Ultimately, we have identified a screening paradigm that would have good predictive value for future TRPV1 drug discovery projects and novel chemical space with a higher probability of gaining intellectual property coverage.

However, its effects on the brain's health are unknown, and there is no animal model available to study the precise impact of arterial stiffness on the brain. Therefore, the objective of the study was to develop and characterize a new model specific to arterial stiffness in order to study its effects on the brain. Methods and Results-Calcium chloride (CaCl2) was applied to carotid arteries of mice, inducing an increase in collagen distribution and intima-media thickness, a fragmentation of elastin, a decrease in arterial compliance and distensibility, and an increase in cerebral blood flow pulsatility (n=3 to 11). Calcium deposits were only present at the site of CaCl2 application, and there was no increase in systemic blood pressure or change in vessel radius making this model specific for arterial stiffness. The effects of carotid stiffness were then assessed in the brain. Carotid calcification induced an increase in the production of cerebral superoxide anion and neurodegeneration, detected with Fluoro-Jade B staining, in the hippocampus (n=3 to 5), a key region for memory and cognition. Conclusions-A new model of arterial stiffness based on carotid calcification was developed and characterized. This new model meets all the characteristics of arterial stiffness, and its specificity allows the study of the effects of arterial stiffness on the brain.

Here, we identify alpha-tanycytes as key components of a hypothalamic niche in the adult mouse. Long-term lineage tracing in vivo using a GLAST::CreER(T2) conditional driver indicates that alpha-tanycytes are self-renewing cells that constitutively give rise to new tanycytes, astrocytes and sparse numbers of neurons. In vitro studies demonstrate that alpha-tanycytes, but not beta-tanycytes or parenchymal cells, are neurospherogenic. Distinct subpopulations of alpha-tanycytes exist, amongst which only GFAP-positive dorsal alpha 2-tanycytes possess stem-like neurospherogenic activity. Fgf-10 and Fgf-18 are expressed specifically within ventral tanycyte subpopulations; alpha-tanycytes require fibroblast growth factor signalling to maintain their proliferation ex vivo and elevated fibroblast growth factor levels lead to enhanced proliferation of alpha-tanycytes in vivo. Our results suggest that alpha-tanycytes form the critical component of a hypothalamic stem cell niche, and that local fibroblast growth factor signalling governs their proliferation.	[Robins, S.

Over the last decade, considerable attention has been given to 2 forms of extended practice therapy for the upper limb, constraint-induced movement therapy and intensive bimanual training. This article reviews the varying nature of these 2 approaches and the existing scientific rationale supporting them. Comparisons between these 2 intensive upper extremity training approaches indicate similar improvements in unimanual capacity and bimanual performance outcomes; however, when considering participant and caregiver goal achievement, evidence favors a bimanual approach. Careful selection of either therapy for this population requires consideration of individual and contextual factors in relation to treatment goals. The key ingredients and dose responses remain unknown. Treatment intensity, intrinsic motivation, and individualization of treatment are hypothesized as requisite in either approach.

With regard to ethics, some of the key aspects to explore include the following: if and how individuals feel respected during the transition process; if and how their values and preferences are developed and integrated within transition; and if and how young patients are prepared to participate in decision making (to be autonomous) within the transition. We carried out a qualitative study on 14 young adults with cerebral palsy. Some participants reported positive experiences. However, several tension points were identified, including before the transition (eg, transition envisaged with fear and apprehension); during the transition (eg, lack of cooperation or communication between providers in the pediatric and adult healthcare systems); and after the transition (eg, feelings of abandonment). We discuss the clinical influence and ethical significance of better capturing ethical values within the transition process and preparing young individuals to engage in discussions about their health and disease management.

It includes outcomes such as independent living, social competence and behavioural problems-all of which are priorities for treatment among schizophrenia patients, mental health care providers, and family members. An important goal for rehabilitation programs is to identify predictors of community functioning which, in turn, could be used as targets for intervention. The present case-control study examined socio-demographic and substance use disorder (SUD) variables as well as psychiatric, extrapyramidal, and cognitive symptoms as predictors of community functioning in schizophrenia patients with (DD patients; n = 31) and without comorbid SUDs (SCZ patients; n = 31), and non-psychosis substance abusers (SUD patients; n = 39). Psychiatric and extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale. Cognition was evaluated using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (speed of processing, explicit and working memory). In SCZ patients, community functioning was predicted by explicit memory performance. In DD patients, community functioning was predicted by substance abuse, depression and speed of processing. In SUD patients, community functioning was predicted by substance abuse, positive symptoms and education. Our results suggest that cognition should be among the top treatment priorities in SCZ patients, whereas the key treatment targets in DD patients should be substance abuse and depression. Future studies will need to replicate the current findings, using prospective research designs.

The lack of potent and selective inhibitors toward these enzymes has limited our Understanding of their function and the development of therapeutic applications. Here we report the evaluation of a,panel of compounds against the four human neuraminidase isoenzymes. Among the compounds tested, we identified the first selective, nanomolar inhibitors of the human neuraminidase 4 enzyme (NEU4). The most potent NEU4 inhibitor (5-acetamido-9-[4-hydroxymethyl[1,2,3]triazol-1-yl]-2,3,5,9-tetradeoxy-D- glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosonic acid) was found to have an inhibitory constant (K-i) of 30 +/- 19 nM and was 500-fold selective for its target over the other hNEU isoenzymes tested in vitro (NEU1, NEU2, and NEU3). This is the first report of any inhibitor of hNEU with nanomolar potency, and this'. confirms that the 2,3-didehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA) scaffold can be exploited to develop new, potent, and selective inhibitors that target this important family of human enzymes.

The coping style model provides a set of predictions about correlations between behavioural and neurophysiological reactions to a stressful situation. According to this model, high levels of activity should be correlated with high levels of aggressiveness at the behavioural level, and to high sympathetic reactivity, low parasympathetic reactivity (higher heart rate levels) and low hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis reactivity (low production of glucocorticoids in response to a stressor). More recent versions of the model, however, are challenging this view and consider the possibility of independent axes of coping style and stress reactivity. The coping style model has mainly been tested on artificially selected or inbred lines in laboratory settings. Such a situation restricts its generalization to a larger number of species and there is a need for studies testing it in the wild under more natural situations. Here, we test the predictions of the coping style model in a wild alpine marmot, Marmota marmota, population. We show that several behavioural (i.e. exploration in an open field, impulsivity and docility) and neurophysiological traits (i.e. heart rate, breathing rate and cortisol production) assumed to represent individual differences in coping style were significantly repeatable over 2-3 years. Not all the correlations between traits predicted by the coping style model were found in marmots, which supports the more recent two-axes model. Furthermore, most correlations were observed at the between-individual level, and the within-individual correlations (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) were weaker. Overall, our results support the prediction of the coping style model, but highlight the fact that the association between traits found in artificial conditions may be weaker in a more natural setting.

To estimate chemical exposures, the Finnish Job Exposure Matrix (FINJEM) was modified to improve its performance in the INTEROCC study and to address some of its limitations, resulting in the development of the INTEROCC JEM. An international team of occupational hygienists developed a crosswalk between the Finnish occupational codes used in FINJEM and the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1968 (ISCO68). For ISCO68 codes linked to multiple Finnish codes, weighted means of the exposure estimates were calculated. Similarly, multiple ISCO68 codes linked to a single Finnish code with evidence of heterogeneous exposure were refined. One of the key time periods in FINJEM (19601984) was split into two periods (19601974 and 19751984). Benzene exposure estimates in early periods were modified upwards. The internal consistency of hydrocarbon exposures and exposures to engine exhaust fumes was improved. Finally, exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and benzo(a)pyrene was modified to include the contribution from second-hand smoke. The crosswalk ensured that the FINJEM exposure estimates could be applied to the INTEROCC study subjects. The modifications generally resulted in an increased prevalence of exposure to chemical agents. This increased prevalence of exposure was not restricted to the lowest categories of cumulative exposure, but was seen across all levels for some agents. Although this work has produced a JEM with important improvements compared to FINJEM, further improvements are possible with the expansion of agents and additional external data.

In the present study, we assessed MSI in autism by measuring whether participants benefited from an auditory cue presented in synchrony with the color change of a target during a complex visual search task. The synchronous auditory pip typically increases search efficacy ( pip and pop effect), indicative of the beneficial use of sensory input from both modalities. We found that for conditions without auditory information, autistic participants were better at visual search compared to neurotypical participants. Importantly, search efficiency was increased by the presence of auditory pip for neurotypical participants only. The simultaneous occurrence of superior unimodal performance with altered audio visual integration in autism suggests autonomous sensory processing in this population. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Chronic behavioral and pharmacological manipulations can be confounded by rising baselines, since females are behaviorally more sensitive to repeated EB injections. The literature lacks a systematic examination of chronic effects of EB administered alone to the sexually experienced OVX rat. Long-Evans rats were repeatedly treated (8 tests) with s.c. injections of 2, 5, or 10 mu g EB at different time intervals (4 or 8 days). Female sexual behaviors as well as receipt of mounts, intromissions and ejaculations from the male were observed in the unilevel 4-hole pacing chamber. The effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) and strain (Long-Evans vs. Wistar) were also assessed. Long-Evans OVX rats treated with 5 mu g EB every 8 days showed persistently low levels of sexual behavior. Sensitization was most robust following 10 mu g LB at 4-day intervals. Very few sexual behaviors were ever induced by 2 mu g EB. ADX did not affect the development of behavioral sensitization by 10 mu g EB. Therefore, to achieve a low steady state of sexual behaviors in sexually experienced Long-Evans OVX rats 5 mu g of EB administered every 8 days is optimal, whereas a persistently high level of sexual behaviors is induced with 10 mu g EB administered every 4 days. OVX Wistar rats are behaviorally more sensitive to EB. Behavioral sensitization to EB may serve as a mechanism to optimize reproductive success. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The new fusion framework consists of three parts: image sampling, measurement fusion and image reconstruction. First, the dual-channel pulse coupled neural network model is used in the image sampling part as an important weighting factor in the fusion scheme. Second, the result from the measurement fusion part is reconstructed through a new reconstruction algorithm called self-adaptively modified Landwebber filter. Finally, computer simulation-based experiment is conducted, showing that the novel fusion framework is capable of saving computational resource and enhancing the fusion result and is easy to implement.

Previous studies have suggested a benefit for memantine on agitation and aggression, but none have examined its efficacy in community-dwelling patients with significant agitation and aggression at baseline, utilizing these behaviors as a primary outcome measure. Methods: Patients with moderate-to-severe AD with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score >= 13 and NPI agitation/aggression score >= 1 were randomized to placebo or 20-mg memantine in a double-blind, 24-week trial. Co-primary outcome measures were behavior, measured by total NPI score, and cognition, using the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). Secondary outcome measures included global assessment, function and other measures of behavior. This trial was registered as Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00857649. Results: A total of 369 patients (average age = 75, average MMSE = 12) were randomized to placebo or memantine. The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment problems. There were no statistically significant differences between memantine and placebo in mean change from baseline in NPI, SIB, or any of the secondary outcome measures. Behavior improved in both groups (total NPI change scores -3.90 +/- 1.24 for memantine and -5.13 +/- 1.23 for placebo). Memantine was generally well tolerated and patient retention in both treatment arms was good. Conclusions: The study failed to show the superiority of memantine in this sample of patients with moderate-to-severe AD with significant baseline agitation and aggression. Methodological limitations could have contributed to these results.

Fourteen adolescent binge drinkers (16-18 years of age) and 14 age-matched adolescents who had never consumed alcohol-never drinkers-were recruited from local high schools in Chengdu, China. Questionnaires were used to assess academic performance, drinking experience, and urgency. Brain regions activated by the IGT performance were identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results showed that, compared to never drinkers, binge drinkers performed worse on the IGT and showed higher activity in the subcomponents of the decision-making neural circuitry implicated in the execution of emotional and incentive-related behaviors, namely, the left amygdala and insula bilaterally. Moreover, measures of the severity of drinking problems in real life, as well as high urgency scores, were associated with increased activity within the insula, combined with decreased activity within the orbitofrontal cortex. These results suggest that hyperreactivity of a neural system implicated in the execution of emotional and incentive-related behaviors can be associated with socially undesirable behaviors, such as binge drinking, among adolescents. These findings have social implications because they potentially reveal underlying neural mechanisms for making poor decisions, which may increase an individual's risk and vulnerability for alcoholism.

EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Schizophrenia and psychosis; fMRI; Binge eating disorder; Antipsychotics	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; BULIMIA-NERVOSA; WEIGHT-GAIN; HUNGER; ANTIPSYCHOTICS; QUESTIONNAIRE; MOTIVATION; DISORDERS; SATIATION	Background. - Given the undesired metabolic side effects of atypical antipsychotic medication it is important to understand the neuronal basis related to processing of appetite regulation in patients affected by schizophrenia. Methods. - Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess brain activity in response to food cues and neutral stimuli in twenty patients with schizophrenia and eleven healthy individuals. In addition to clinical and dietary habits assessments, we collected, in patients, measurements of fasting glucose, ghrelin, leptin, insulin, prolactin and lipids blood concentration and we correlated the cerebral activity with clinical and metabolic measures. Results. - Both groups engaged a common neuronal network while processing food cues, which included the left insula, primary sensorimotor areas, and inferior temporal and parietal cortices. Cerebral responses to appetitive stimuli in thalamus, parahippocampus and middle frontal gyri were specific only to schizophrenic patients, with parahippocampal activity related to hunger state and increasing linearly over time. Antipsychotic medication dosage correlated positively with a cognitive measure reflecting food cravings, whereas the severity of the disease correlated negatively with a cognitive measure indicating dietary restraint in eating habits. These cognitive variables correlated, in turn, with parahippocampal and thalamic neuronal activities, respectively. Conclusions. - We identified a specific neural substrate underlying cognitive processing of appetitive stimuli in schizophrenia, which may contribute to appetite dysfunction via perturbations in processing of homeostatic signals in relation to external stimuli. Our results also suggest that both antipsychotic medication and the disease severity per se could amplify these effects, via different mechanisms and neuronal networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The similarity between the two mechanisms likely facilitates the multi-modal integration of facial and vocal information during everyday social interactions. These findings emphasize a parsimonious principle of cerebral organization, where similar computational problems in different modalities are solved using similar solutions.

Mutations in this gene have also been associated with pancreatic cancer and breast cancer, as well as astrocytomas and other nervous system tumors (NST). Among NST, rare solitary internal neurofibromas have been reported, but multiple cutaneous neurofibromas have only been described in two families. In the first family, the affected individuals all carried a heterozygous G > C mutation at the splice acceptor site of intron 1 resulting in skipping of CDKN2A exon 2, while the affected individuals in the second family had a deletion that encompassed the whole CDKN2A/CDKN2B/ANRIL locus. We now report on a proposita presenting with multiple biopsy-proven cutaneous neurofibromas and a solitary spinal neurofibroma found to have a deletion of 14 nucleotides in exon 2 of CDKN2A, providing further evidence that p14, p16, and/or ANRIL are specifically involved in the pathogenesis of neurofibromas as a feature of the familial atypical multiple malignant melanoma spectrum.

The auditory brain nuclei and the inferior colliculi are often the first part of the brainstem to be involved, often leading to hearing abnormalities. A systematic review of clinical studies was conducted to evaluate the effect of hyperbilirubinemia on hearing in term newborns, to show the relationship between hearing function and bilirubin levels as well as the effect of treatment. Methods: Eligible studies were identified through searches of electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, PubMed and The Cochrane Library. Articles obtained were independently reviewed by 2 authors using inclusion criteria to identify eligible studies. The search was restricted to articles written in English, French and Spanish and published between 1970 and 2010. Data extracted included study type, number of patients, bilirubin levels, hyperbilirubinemia criteria, hearing assessment methods, time of hearing assessment and outcome measures. Results: The nineteen articles included showed heterogeneity regarding the time of hearing test and hyperbilirubinemia criteria. The incidence of hearing loss at initial testing ranged between 13.2-83.3% and 6.7-14.3% at 3 months follow-up. Five studies showed a rising incidence of hearing loss with increasing levels of serum bilirubin. Conclusions: Hyperbilirubinemia resulted in abnormal hearing assessment in up to 83.3% of term newborns. Greater hearing abnormalities were observed with rising serum bilirubin levels. Treatment of hyperbilirubinemia led to a considerable decrease in the incidence of hearing loss. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

[I-125]GR231118, a Y-1 antagonist was used as Y-1 receptor radioligand. [I-125][Leu(31), Pro(34)]PYY, a high affinity agonist of Y-1 and Y-5 subtypes was used in the absence or presence of 100 nM BIBO3304 (a highly selective Y-1 receptor antagonist) to assess the apparent levels of [I-125][Leu(31), Pro34]PYY/BIBO3304 insensitive sites (Y-5-like) from [I-125][Leu(31), Pro(34)]PYY/BIBO3304 sensitive sites (Y-1). [I-125]PYY(3-36) was used to label the Y-2 receptor. In the brain of 3-month-old AL rats, the distribution and densities of Y-1, Y-2 and Y-5 receptors were in agreement with previous reports. In the brain of 20AL rats, a decrease of NPY receptor subtype densities in regions having important physiological functions such as the cingulate cortex, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, thalamus and hypothalamus was observed. In contrast, LTCR had multiple effects. It induced specific decreases of Y-1-receptor densities in the dentate gyrus, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei and lateral hypothalamic area and Y-2-receptor densities in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus. Moreover, it prevented the age-induced increase in Y-1-receptor densities in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and decrease in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, and increased Y-2-receptor densities in the CA2 subfield of the hippocampus. These results indicate that LTCR not only counteracts some of the deleterious effects of aging on NPY receptor subtype densities but exerts specific effects of its own. The overall impact of the regulation of NPY receptor subtypes in the brain of old calorie-restricted rats may protect the neural circuits involved in pain, emotions, feeding and memory functions.

Methods We performed an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of brain responses to bladder filling in normal female subjects, evoked by infusion and withdrawal of fluid in and out of the bladder. Using the contrast (infusion-withdrawal), we imaged brain activity at small bladder volumes with weak filling sensation and also with full bladder and strong desire to void. Results Eleven women, average age 65 years (range: 60-71 years) were included. With full bladder and strong desire to void, filling provoked a well-known pattern of activation near the right insula and (as a trend) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area. There was no significant deactivation. With small bladder volume filling provoked widespread apparent deactivation and no significant activation. Apparent deactivation was associated with increased fMRI signal during withdrawal rather than decrease during infusion, suggesting artifact. A correction for global changes in cerebral blood flow eliminated it and revealed significant subcortical activation, although none in frontal or parietal cortex. Conclusions In older women with normal bladder function, infusion into an already full bladder resulted in strong sensation and brain activation near the insula and in the dorsal anterior cingulate/supplementary motor complex. With near-empty bladder and little sensation, the situation during much of daily life, these cortical areas were not detectably activated, but activation in midbrain and parahippocampal regions presumably indicated unconscious monitoring of ascending bladder signals.

Methods The study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty-seven postnatal women with clinically demonstrated persistent SUI 3 months after delivery participated in 8 weeks of either pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) (28) or PFMT with deep abdominal muscle training (PFMT+TrA) (29). Seven years post-treatment, 35 (61.4%) participants agreed to the follow-up; they were asked to complete a 20-min pad test and three incontinence-specific questionnaires with an assessor blinded to each participant's group assignment. Results: Of the 35 (61.4%) who agreed to the follow-up: 26 (45.6%) took the 20-min pad test (12 PFMT and 14 PFMT+TrA) and 35 (61.4%) completed the questionnaires (18 PFMT and 17 PFMT+TrA). The baseline clinical characteristics of the follow-up and non-follow-up participants were not significantly different; nor did they differ between PFMT and PFMT+TrA participants enrolled in the follow-up study. At 7 years, the pad test scores for the PFMT group did not differ statistically from those of the PFMT+TrA group. When combining both treatment groups, a total of 14/26 (53%) follow-up participants were still continent according to the pad test. Conclusion The addition of deep abdominal training does not appear to further improve the outcome of PFM training in the long term. However, benefits of physiotherapy for postpartum SUI, although not as pronounced as immediately after the initial intervention, is still present 7 years post-treatment. Neurourol.

ERP Evidence That Auditory-Visual Speech Facilitates Working Memory in Younger and Older Adults	PSYCHOLOGY AND AGING			English	Article						aging; speech perception; multisensory interaction; working memory; even-related potentials	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; VISIBLE SPEECH; N-BACK; PERCEPTION; P300; TASK; ATTENTION; CAPACITY; FOCUS	Auditory-visual (AV) speech enhances speech perception and facilitates auditory processing, as measured by event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Considering a perspective of shared resources between perceptual and cognitive processes, facilitated speech perception may render more resources available for higher-order functions. This study examined whether AV speech facilitation leads to better working memory (WM) performance in 23 younger and 20 older adults. Participants completed an n-back task (0- to 3-back) under visual-only (V-only), auditory-only (A-only), and AV conditions. The results showed faster responses across all memory loads and improved accuracy in the most demanding conditions (2- and 3-back) during AV compared with unisensory conditions. Older adults benefited from the AV presentation to the same extent as younger adults. WM performance of older adults during the AV presentation did not differ from that of younger adults in the A-only condition, suggesting that an AV presentation can help to counteract some of the age-related WM decline. The ERPs showed a decrease in the auditory N1 amplitude during the AV compared with A-only presentation in older adults, suggesting that the facilitation of perceptual processing becomes especially beneficial with aging. Additionally, the N1 occurred earlier in the AV than in the A-only condition for both age groups. These AV-induced modulations of auditory processing correlated with improvement in certain behavioral and ERP measures of WM. These results support an integrated model between perception and cognition, and suggest that processing speech under AV conditions enhances WM performance of both younger and older adults.

We have compared the expression of three adhesion molecules, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and Lewis x, by immunohistochemistry during normal trophoblast differentiation, and in hydatidiform moles and choriocarcinomas. Both E-cadherin and beta-catenin were expressed in normal placenta cytotrophoblast, and this expression decreased with trophoblast maturation. E-cadherin was mainly localized along the contact between cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast, which indicates its role in the differentiation of the syncytial layer. Lewis x disappeared progressively during differentiation of normal villous vessels, and was expressed in molar pregnancies. Interestingly, whereas choriocarcinomas were not, or poorly, stained, invasive hydatidiform moles (invHMs) strongly expressed Lewis x in vascular structures. This observation correlated well with E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression and suggests that these three markers are associated with the invasive transformation. The presence of robust endothelial structures in invHMs could also explain their ability to maintain organized villous architecture (contrary to metastatic choriocarcinomas) during their invasion of extrauterine tissues such as the lung or the brain after dissemination through the blood flow. In our hands, Lewis x appeared to be a new, reliable marker that can be used to clearly distinguish invHMs from choriocarcinomas.

Decreased Cortical Representation of Genital Somatosensory Field After Childhood Sexual Abuse	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	50th Annual Meeting of the American-College-of-Neuropsychopharmacology	DEC 04-08, 2011	Waikoloa, HI	Amer Coll Neuropsychopharmacol			HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MRI DATA; PAIN; REORGANIZATION; THICKNESS; REGISTRATION; MALTREATMENT; MECHANISMS; DISORDERS; RESPONSES	Objective: Sexual dysfunction is a common clinical symptom in women who were victims of childhood sexual abuse. The precise mechanism that mediates this association remains poorly understood. The authors evaluated the relationship between the experience of childhood abuse and neuroplastic thinning of cortical fields, depending on the nature of the abusive experience. Method: The authors used MRI-based cortical thickness analysis in 51 medically healthy adult women to test whether different forms of childhood abuse were associated with cortical thinning in areas critical to the perception and processing of specific behavior implicated in the type of abuse. Results: Exposure to childhood sexual abuse was specifically associated with pronounced cortical thinning in the genital representation field of the primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, emotional abuse was associated with cortical thinning in regions relevant to self-awareness and self-evaluation. Conclusions: Neural plasticity during development appears to result in cortical adaptation that may shield a child from the sensory processing of the specific abusive experience by altering cortical representation fields in a regionally highly specific manner. Such plastic reorganization may be protective for the child living under abusive conditions, but it may underlie the development of behavioral problems, such as sexual dysfunction, later in life.

Several functional neuroimaging studies of elderly individuals have reported the occurrence of an interhemispheric neurofunctional reorganization characterized by more bilateral activation patterns. Other studies have indicated that the preservation of some other cognitive abilities is associated with some intrahemispheric reorganization following either a posterior-anterior or an anterior-posterior shift in aging. Interestingly, other studies have shown that age-related neurofunctional reorganization is task-load-dependent. Taken together, these studies suggest that neurofunctional reorganization in aging is based on a more dynamic, flexible and adaptive neurofunctional process than previously proposed. This review summarizes the different factors that are thought to support the preservation of the semantic processing of words in aging, and highlights a multidetermined and complex set of processes such as the nature of the specific cognitive processes, task complexity and cognitive strategy, characterizing the neurofunctional reorganization in aging that allows for optimal cognitive abilities. In so doing, it provides the background for future study looking at the neurofunctional dimensions of the impact of neurodegenerative diseases on cognitive abilities.

Brain oscillatory activity is critical for cognitive function and is altered in AD patients. Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta (A) induces reorganization of hippocampal networks. However, whether fine changes in network activity might be present at very early stages, before A overproduction, remains to be determined. We therefore assessed whether theta and gamma oscillations and their cross-frequency coupling, which are known to be essential for normal memory function, were precociously altered in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological field potential recordings were performed using complete hippocampal preparations in vitro from young transgenic CRND8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice showed robust alterations of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the principal output region of the hippocampus, the subiculum. In addition we showed that, compared to controls, these mice expressed negligible levels of A. Finally, these network alterations were not due to genetic factors as 15-day-old animals did not exhibit theta-gamma coupling alterations. Thus, initial alterations in hippocampal network activity arise before A accumulation and may represent an early biomarker for AD.

The mechanisms underlying the propagation of tau pathology are still poorly understood. Recent studies have provided solid data demonstrating that in several neurodegenerative diseases including AD, the spreading of misfolded protein aggregates in the brain would result from prion-like cell-to-cell transmission. Consistent with this new concept, recent studies have reported that human tau can be released in the extracellular space by an active process of secretion, and can be endocytosed both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, it was reported that the spreading of tau pathology was observed along synaptically connected circuits in a transgenic mouse model where human tau overexpression was restricted in the entorhinal cortex. This indicates that secretion of tau by presynaptic neurons and its uptake by postsynaptic neurons could be the sequential events leading to the propagation of tau pathology in the brain.

Aging and neurogenesis in the adult forebrain: what we have learned and where we should go from here	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Alzheimer's disease; neural stem cells; neurospheres; quiescence; rodent; senescence	NEURAL STEM-CELLS; FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR-2; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; PROGENITOR CELLS; OLFACTORY-BULB; RAT-BRAIN; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; SELF-RENEWAL; IN-VIVO	In the brains of adult vertebrates, including humans, neurogenesis occurs in restricted niches where it maintains cellular turnover and cognitive plasticity. In virtually all species, however, aging is associated with a significant decline in adult neurogenesis. Moreover, an acceleration of neurogenic defects is observed in models of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting an involvement in aging- and disease-associated cognitive deficits. To gain insights into when, how and why adult neurogenesis decreases in the aging brain, we critically reviewed the scientific literature on aging of the rodent subventricular zone, the neurogenic niche of the adult forebrain. Our analysis revealed that deficits in the neurogenic pathway are largely established by middle age, but that there remains striking ambiguity in the underlying mechanisms, especially at the level of stem and progenitor cells. We identify and discuss several challenging issues that have contributed to these key gaps in our current knowledge. In the future, addressing these issues should help untangle the interactions between neurogenesis, aging and aging-associated diseases.

Caspase-6 as a novel early target in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						aged individuals; Alzheimer's disease; caspase-6; cognitive impairment	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODELS; BETA-PEPTIDE; CELL-DEATH; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; AXONAL DEGENERATION; TAU MUTATION; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES	A recent paradigm shift appears to be underway on what scientists believe to be the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The amyloid hypothesis has dominated the field of basic research for the last 25years, and although these massive efforts have culminated in efficient removal of amyloid from the brains of patients, the absence of beneficial effects for the patient have been greatly disappointing. This has created a shift in the focus on amyloid to a much greater focus on Tau protein, in the hope that preventing tangle formation may inhibit or delay the progression of AD. Although there are promising developments in this area of research, diversifying our efforts to identify novel early targets by understanding the upstream molecular mechanisms that lead to, or occur with, neurofibrillary tangle and plaque formation may provide more efficient therapies against AD. Among many areas in development, an emphasis on the role of caspase-6 (Casp6) activity in early neurodegenerative mechanisms brings hope of a novel target against AD. Casp6 activity is intimately associated with the pathologies that define AD, correlates well with lower cognitive performance in aged individuals, and is involved in axonal degeneration in several cellular and in vivo animal models. This is a review of the evidence showing the relevance of Casp6 activation as an early event that could be inhibited to prevent the progression of AD.

The goal of the present experiments was to examine the long-term consequences of early exposure to HF on anticipatory and consumatory nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA responses to HF food rewards. Mothers were maintained on a HF (30% fat) or control diet (CD; 5% fat) from gestation day 13 to postnatal day 22 when offspring from both diet groups were weaned and maintained on the CD until adulthood. In vivo NAc DA responses to food anticipation and consumption were measured in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm using voltammetry in freely moving rats. HF-exposed offspring displayed reduced NAc DA responses to a tone previously paired with the delivery of HF food rewards. In an unconditioned protocol, consumatory NAc DA responses could be isolated, and were similar in HF and control offspring. These data demonstrate that exposure to HF through maternal diet during early development might program behavioral and functional responses associated with mesolimbic DA neurotransmission, thus leading to an increased HF feeding and obesity.

Design: An observational study comparing the performance, using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) and Bonferroni post hoc test, of continent women and women with stress or mixed UI during executive control tasks. Setting: The research center of the Institut universitaire de geriatrie de Montreal. Participants: One hundred and fifty-five community-dwelling women aged 60 and older participated in the study. Measurements: Based on the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI), participants were split into three groups: 35 continent women, 43 women with stress UI, and 78 women with mixed UI. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and a computerized dual-task test. Results: Women with mixed UI showed poorer performances than continent and stress UI women in executive control functions. Deficits were specific to tests involving switching and sharing/dividing attention between two tasks. Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that mixed UI can be associated with executive control deficits in community-dwelling older women. Future intervention studies in the treatment of UI should take the higher risk of an executive control deficit in women with UI under consideration.

Profile analyses revealed that veterans with PTSD and mild TBI did not differ significantly from those with just PTSD across domains, suggesting that comorbid mild TBI does not result in an additive effect. A norms-based comparison also revealed that neither group demonstrated impaired performance on any of the objective neuropsychological measures examined. However, both groups endorsed moderately elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety, indicating that comorbid psychopathology may contribute to subjective cognitive complaints.

Global Et2 knockout mice exhibited severe growth retardation and juvenile lethality. Despite normal milk intake, they suffered from internal starvation characterized by hypoglycemia, ketonemia, and increased levels of starvation-induced genes. Although ET-2 is abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, the intestine was morphologically and functionally normal. Moreover, intestinal epithelium-specific Et2 knockout mice showed no abnormalities in growth and survival. Global Et2 knockout mice were also profoundly hypothermic. Housing Et2 knockout mice in a warm environment significantly extended their median lifespan. However, neuron-specific Et2 knockout mice displayed a normal core body temperature. Low levels of Et2 mRNA were also detected in the lung, with transient increases soon after birth. The lungs of Et2 knockout mice showed emphysematous structural changes with an increase in total lung capacity, resulting in chronic hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and increased erythropoietin synthesis. Finally, systemically inducible ET-2 deficiency in neonatal and adult mice fully reproduced the phenotype previously observed in global Et2 knockout mice. Together, these findings reveal that ET-2 is critical for the growth and survival of postnatal mice and plays important roles in energy homeostasis, thermoregulation, and the maintenance of lung morphology and function.

The transcription factor Pitx3 is expressed selectively in midbrain dopaminergic neurons susceptible to neurodegenerative stress	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						aphakia mouse; calbindin-D28k; development; MPTP; Parkinson's disease; substantia nigra	SPORADIC PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PITX3-DEFICIENT APHAKIA MICE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA NEURONS; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; LENS DEVELOPMENT; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; MESSENGER-RNA; MUTANT MICE; MOUSE	The homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3 is critical for the survival of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. Pitx3-deficient mice exhibit severe but selective developmental loss of mDA neurons, with accompanying locomotor deficits resembling those seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Here, we identify specific mDA cell subpopulations that are consistently spared in adult Pitx3-hypomorphic (aphakia) mice, demonstrating that Pitx3 is not indiscriminately required by all mDA neurons for their survival. In aphakia mice, virtually all surviving mDA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the majority of neurons in the adjacent ventral tegmental area (VTA) also express calbindin-D28k, a calcium-binding protein previously associated with resistance to injury in PD and in animal models. Cell-mapping studies in wild-type mice revealed that Pitx3 is primarily expressed in the ventral SN, a region particularly susceptible to MPTP and other dopaminergic neurotoxins. Furthermore, Pitx3-expressing SN cells are preferentially lost following MPTP treatment. Finally, SN mDA neurons in Pitx3 hemizygous mice show increased sensitivity when exposed to MPTP. Thus, SN mDA neurons are represented by at least two distinct subpopulations including MPTP-resistant Pitx3-autonomous, calbindin-positive neurons, and calbindin-negative Pitx-3-dependent cells that display elevated vulnerability to toxic injury, and probably correspond to the subpopulation that degenerates in PD. Impairment of Pitx3-dependent pathways therefore increases vulnerability of mDA neurons to toxic injury. Together, these data suggest a novel link between Pitx3 function and the selective pattern of mDA cell loss observed in PD.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating major depression and schizophrenia: a systematic review of recent meta-analyses	ANNALS OF MEDICINE			English	Review						Major depression; meta-analysis; neuromodulation; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; schizophrenia; systematic review	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PERSISTENT NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS; DOUBLE-BLIND; BRAIN-STIMULATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY; ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY; SUBTHALAMIC STIMULATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RESISTANT DEPRESSION	Background. In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been developed for the treatment of major depression (MD) and schizophrenia. Although rTMS has shown some promising findings, the lack of standardization in the methodology employed has resulted in discordant findings. Objectives. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize several meta-analytical studies exploring the efficacy of rTMS in either MD or schizophrenia in order to examine the methodologies that increase the efficacy of rTMS and to provide some recommendations for future studies. Methods. We searched the MEDLINE database for potentially relevant meta-analytic studies on the use of rTMS for treating major depression and schizophrenia published from January 2000 to October 2011. Results. Fifteen rTMS meta-analytical studies were reviewed (11 on MD and 5 on schizophrenia). Several variables were reviewed including outcome measures, side-effects of rTMS, site of stimulation, frequency and intensity of stimulation, and number of treatment sessions. Conclusions. Overall, rTMS appears to be an effective and promising therapeutic for both MD and schizophrenia.

The following discussion details the establishment of a research conglomerate designed to prevent AD by means of the systematic detection of biomarker changes in healthy middle-aged or younger people. Among the biomarkers currently being standardized are changes in amyloid-beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and deposition of amyloid-beta plaques in the living brain detectable by means of brain scans. Possession of one specific allele of the APOE gene is an additional biomarker. However, these molecular features are merely indicators of increased risk, and pre-symptomatic dementia cannot be definitively diagnosed on the basis of the presence of one or more of them. The composition, distribution, and function of the key molecule being tracked, amyloid-beta, remains poorly understood and, highly significant, a large number of individuals with a heavy amyloid load in their brains live to old age with no behavioral signs of dementia. The concluding section considers preparations for a randomized controlled trial designed to detect and eliminate amyloid-beta deposition very early in its formation.

The largest genome-wide association analysis of bipolar disorder recently identified a new genome-wide associated variant in OZD4 (rs12576775). The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the role of this risk variant in the disease process using an imaging genetics approach. As increased amygdala and striatal responses during the processing of reward and emotion are characteristic for bipolar disorder patients, it was tested whether the risk variant has an influence on this endophenotype in healthy adolescents. Methods We examined the impact of the risk variant rs12576775 on functional magnetic resonance imaging data in an adolescent sample (N=485). Differential activation between carriers of the risk allele (G-allele) and homozygous A-allele carriers in the amygdala and the striatum during a modification of the monetary incentive delay task (examining reward) and a face task (examining emotion) was analyzed. Results Carriers of the risk allele showed an increased blood oxygen level-dependent response in the amygdala during reward sensitivity (p=0.05) and reward expectation (p<0.05) but not during the face task. No significant group differences were found in the striatum during both reward and emotion processing. Conclusion Our results indicate that the ODZ4 risk variant influences reward processing in the amygdala. Alterations in the processing of emotion may have different underlying mechanisms and need to be further examined.

Wee			Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer shows active perivascular cuffs in multiple sclerosis	BRAIN			English	Article						multiple sclerosis; perivascular cuff; EMMPRIN; metalloproteinases; neuroinflammation	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; CELL-SURFACE; IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY; BASEMENT-MEMBRANE; CORTICAL DEMYELINATION; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; TISSUE INHIBITOR; LAMININ ALPHA-5	Inflammatory perivascular cuffs are comprised of leucocytes that accumulate in the perivascular space around post-capillary venules before their infiltration into the parenchyma of the central nervous system. Inflammatory perivascular cuffs are commonly found in the central nervous system of patients with multiple sclerosis and in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Leucocytes that accumulate in the perivascular space secrete matrix metalloproteinases that aid their transmigration into the neural parenchyma. We described previously that the upstream inducer of matrix metalloproteinase expression, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147), was elevated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and that its inhibition reduced leucocyte entry into the central nervous system. Here we investigated whether the expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer varies with the temporal evolution of lesions in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, whether it was uniformly upregulated across multiple sclerosis specimens, and whether it was a feature of inflammatory perivascular cuffs in multiple sclerosis lesions. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, elevation of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer was correlated with the appearance and persistence of clinical signs of disease. In both murine and human samples, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer was detected on endothelium in healthy and disease states but was dramatically increased in and around inflammatory perivascular cuffs on leucocytes, associated with matrix metalloproteinase expression, and on resident cells including microglia. Leucocyte populations that express extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer in multiple sclerosis lesions included CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages. The extra-endothelial expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer was a marker of the activity of lesions in multiple sclerosis, being present on leucocyte-containing perivascular cuffs but not in inactive lesions. By using a function-blocking antibody, we implicate extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer in the adhesion of leucocytes to endothelial cells and determined that its activity was more crucial on leucocytes than on endothelium in leucocyte-endothelial cell engagement in vitro. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer activity regulated the level of alpha 4 integrin on leucocytes through a mechanism associated with nuclear factor kappa B signalling. Blocking extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer attenuated the transmigration of monocytes and B lymphocytes across a model of the blood-brain barrier in culture. In summary, we describe the prominence of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer in central nervous system inflammatory perivascular cuffs, emphasize its dual role in matrix metalloproteinase induction and leucocyte adhesion, and highlight the elevation of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer as an orchestrator of the infiltration of leucocytes into the central nervous system parenchyma.

We attempted to identify clinical characteristics associated with central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage in a broad population. We performed a retrospective review of the FDA MedWatch database of adverse events reported with bevacizumab from 11/1997 to 5/2009. Our search used keywords: bleeding, hemorrhage, cerebral, intracranial, subarachnoid, cerebellar, hemorrhagic stroke and brain. A total of 17,466 reports were included in the database: 154 described CNS hemorrhage in 99 patients, and 1,041 reports described non-CNS bleeds. Median age was 62 years, and the primary cancers were consistent with indications for bevacizumab. Patients received a median of three (1-36) doses of bevacizumab prior to the bleed. Thirty percent had documented history of hypertension. Sixteen patients with CNS hemorrhage were reported to have CNS metastases. Death was reported as a complication of hemorrhage in 48 %. The most common predisposing factor for CNS bleeds was use of medications associated with bleeding, followed by thrombocytopenia. In this database, 154 of 1,195 reports of bleeding associated with bevacizumab described a CNS bleed.

Gynecological and menstrual disorders in women with vasovagal syncope	CLINICAL AUTONOMIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Syncope; Menstrual cycle; Lightheadedness; Vasovagal; Gynecological	NEURALLY-MEDIATED SYNCOPE; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; CYCLE; TILT	Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is a chronic debilitating condition seen mostly in young women of reproductive age. There are anecdotal reports of increased syncope and presyncope around menstruation. This case-control study assessed the effects of the menstrual cycle on lightheadedness episodes and compared the gynecological and pregnancy history of VVS patients to healthy subjects. A custom-designed gynecological and menstrual cycle questionnaire was previously developed for patients with orthostatic intolerance. This questionnaire was administered to female patients with VVS (n = 128) as a part of the multicenter Second Prevention of Syncope Trial, and to gender-matched healthy subjects (n = 92). VVS patients and healthy subjects reported significant variability in self-reported lightheadedness throughout the menstrual cycle. Both cohorts experienced greatest lightheadedness during menses (53 +/- A 2 vs. 56 +/- A 4), which decreased during the follicular phase (44 +/- A 2 vs. 41 +/- A 4). VVS patients reported less severity in premenstrual symptoms (Fisher's method P = 2.7E-06) compared to healthy controls. There is no difference in the incidence of gynecological abnormalities (Fisher's exact P = 0.193) and pregnancy complications (P = 1.0) between the two cohorts. VVS patients have similar pregnancy rates compared to healthy subjects (P = 0.674). The severity of lightheadedness varies during the menstrual cycle and is similar in both VVS patients and healthy controls. VVS patients have no greater risk of gynecological abnormalities and pregnancy complications than healthy subjects.

The FEF is thought to show eye-fixed visual codes in head-restrained monkeys, but it is not known how it transforms these inputs into spatial codes for head-unrestrained gaze commands. Here, we tested if the FEF influences desired gaze commands within a simple eye-fixed frame, like the superior colliculus (SC), or in more complex egocentric frames like the supplementary eye fields (SEFs). We electrically stimulated 95 FEF sites in two head-unrestrained monkeys to evoke 3D eye-head gaze shifts and then mathematically rotated these trajectories into various reference frames. In theory, each stimulation site should specify a specific spatial goal when the evoked gaze shifts are plotted in the appropriate frame. We found that these motor output frames varied site by site, mainly within the eye-to-head frame continuum. Thus, consistent with the intermediate placement of the FEF within the high-level circuits for gaze control, its stimulation-evoked output showed an intermediate trend between the multiple reference frame codes observed in SEF-evoked gaze shifts and the simpler eye-fixed reference frame observed in SC-evoked movements. These results suggest that, although the SC, FEF and SEF carry eye-fixed information at the level of their unit response fields, this information is transformed differently in their output projections to the eye and head controllers.

Susceptibility to lethal cerebral malaria is regulated by epistatic interaction between chromosome 4 (Berr6) and chromosome 1 (Berr7) loci in mice	GENES AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						cerebral malaria; mouse genetics; complex traits; quantitative trait locus; epistasis	GENETIC-CONTROL; IFN-GAMMA; FALCIPARUM-MALARIA; NATURAL-SELECTION; SKIN-DISEASE; RESISTANCE; PATHOGENESIS; PROTECTION; IDENTIFICATION; OVALOCYTOSIS	In humans, cerebral malaria is a rare but often lethal complication of infection with Plasmodium parasites, the occurrence of which is influenced by complex genetic factors of the host. We used a mouse model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) with Plasmodium berghei ANKA to study genetic factors regulating appearance of neurological symptoms and associated lethality. In a genome-wide screen of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice derived from C57BL/6J (B6) and 129S1/SvImJ (129) mouse strains, we detected a strong interaction between the genetic backgrounds of these strains, which modulates ECM resistance. We have mapped a major gene locus to central chromosome 4 (log of the odds (LOD) 6.7; 79.6-97.3 Mb), which we designate Berr6. B6 alleles at Berr6 are associated with resistance, and are inherited in a co-dominant fashion. In mice heterozygous for Berr6 B6/129 alleles, resistance to ECM is strongly modulated by a second locus, Berr7, that maps to the proximal portion of chromosome 1 (LOD 4.03; 41.4 Mb). 129 alleles at Berr7 are associated with ECM resistance in a dosage-dependent fashion. Results are discussed in view of the possible role of this two-locus system in susceptibility to unrelated inflammatory conditions in mice and humans.

By constructing and testing subcongenic strains combined with gene-expression assays, we provide evidence for the candidacy of the Yy1 gene - encoding the ubiquitously expressed and multifunctional Yin Yang 1 transcription factor - as responsible. To confirm this hypothesis, we used a Cre/lox strategy to produce mutant mice in which Yy1 expression was ablated in Nav1.8-positive neurons of the dorsal root ganglion. These mutants also displayed reduced inflammatory pain sensitivity on the formalin test. Further testing of pain-related phenotypes in these mutants revealed robustly increased sensitivity to systemic and spinal (but not supraspinal) morphine analgesia, and greatly increased endogenous (swim stress-induced) opioid analgesia. None of the known biological roles of Yin Yang 1 were suggestive of such a phenotype, and thus a novel player in pain modulatory systems has been identified.	[Sorge, R. E.; LaCroix-Fralish, M.

Gelastic seizures, the hallmark feature of hypothalamic hamartomas, commonly present in early childhood. However, patients usually also display a disabling clinical syndrome, which may include various other types of refractory seizures with secondary generalization together with progressive cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric dysfunction. The hamartoma itself has been unequivocally shown to be intrinsically epileptogenic. Over the past 2 decades there has been considerable effort to develop neurosurgical techniques to treat the epileptic syndrome effectively as well as to improve the neurocognitive and behavioral outcome.

The cognitive profile of RBD patients is heterogeneous, with impairments in attention, executive functions, episodic memory, and visuospatial abilities. Moreover, over 50% of RBD patients meet the diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment remains the most sensitive way to detect MCI, three cognitive screening tests have been validated in RBD. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment was found to be the most appropriate screening test for detecting MCI in RBD. In addition, RBD in Parkinson's disease may be a risk factor for MCI and dementia.

Idiopathic RBD is a well-established risk factor for neurodegenerative disease; at least 40-65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will develop a defined neurodegenerative phenotype over 10years. This is almost always a synucleinopathy (Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy). Often, patients develop a syndrome with overlapping parkinsonism and cognitive impairment. The ability of RBD to predict disease has major implications for development of neuroprotective therapy, by providing a high-risk prodromal group for neuroprotective trials. In addition, it allows testing of other predictive markers of neurodegeneration. Recent prospective studies found that idiopathic RBD patients with abnormal olfaction at baseline had a 65% 5-year risk of developing neurodegenerative disease, compared with a 14% risk in those with normal olfaction. Those with abnormal color vision had a 74% risk of neurodegenerative disease compared with 26% in those with normal vision. Additionally, neuroimaging markers of the substantia nigra including dopaminergic functional imaging and transcranial ultrasound have been able to predict imminent development of defined neurodegenerative disease in RBD, although sensitivity and lead time have not been established. Future studies will continue to expand the list of predictive markers of neurodegeneration and will better define specificity, sensitivity, and lead time of prodromal markers.

A new lexical card-sorting task for studying fronto-striatal contribution to processing language rules	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Lexical rules; Semantic; Phonology; FMRI; Striatum; Prefrontal cortex; Executive processes	VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; NONTHALAMIC SUBCORTICAL LESIONS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INFERIOR PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; SEMANTIC SYSTEM; HUMAN BRAIN; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; SPEECH PRODUCTION	The role of fronto-striatal regions in processing different language rules such as semantic and (grapho) phonological ones is still under debate. We have recently developed a lexical analog of the Wisconsin card sorting task which measures set-shifting abilities where the visual rules color, number, shape were replaced by three language ones: semantic, rhyme and syllable onset (attack). In the present study we aimed to compare fronto-striatal activations between the different lexical rules that are required for matching the test words to the response ones. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fourteen healthy, native French-speaking participants were scanned. The results showed that some regions within the brain language network are differentially involved in semantic and phonological processes. Semantic decisions activated significantly the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the fusiform gyrus, the ventral temporal lobe and the caudate nucleus, while phonological decisions produced significant activation in posterior Broca's area (area 44), the temporoparietal junction and motor cortical regions. These findings provide critical support for the existence of a ventral subcortical semantic pathway and a more dorsal phonological stream as proposed by Duffau, Leroy, and Gatignol (2008). Furthermore, we propose that the strong involvement of area 47/12 of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus observed in semantic processing, is not specific to language, but to the fact that a category or a rule has to be retrieved amongst competing ones in memory, similarly to what is observed when planning a set-shift in the original (non-lexical) version of the Wisconsin card sorting task.

There is little information about the safety of transitioning patients between oral therapies for PAH. Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been a therapeutic mainstay in PAH, providing benefit to many patients. Three ERAs, bosentan, sitaxsentan, and ambrisentan have been approved for clinical use. Sitaxsentan was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in late 2010 resulting in the need to quickly transition a large number of stable patients. Methods: We transitioned 30 clinically stable patients to either ambrisentan or bosentan. Patients underwent a right heart catheterization, measurement of serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and assessment of functional class before changing ERA and again 4 months later. We present a retrospective analysis of those data. Results: Of the 30 patients transitioned (15 to ambrisentan, 15 to bosentan), 23 had complete hemodynamic data. No significant change was observed in the groups in right atrial, mean pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures, or in cardiac output, pulmonary vascular resistance, or NT-proBNP levels. There was no change in World Health Organization functional class. Four ambrisentan and 2 bosentan-treated patients reported fluid retention, and 3 bosentan-treated patients had elevation of hepatic transaminases. Two of the patients had a right atrial pressure increase of >= 5 mmHg, and 4 had pulmonary artery wedge pressure increase of >= 5 mm Hg. Conclusions: Transitioning between ERAs in stable PAH patients does not result in hemodynamic or clinical deterioration during the first 4 months posttransition. A minority of patients have developed increased cardiac filling pressures.

Early autism research is an evolving field in child psychiatric science. Key objectives are fine mapping of neurodevelopmental trajectories and identifying biomarkers to improve risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment. ESSEA (Enhancing the Scientific Study of Early Autism) is a COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action striving to create a European collaboration to enhance the progress of the discovery and treatment of the earliest signs of autism, and to establish European practice guidelines on early identification and intervention by bringing together European expertise from cognitive neuroscience and clinical sciences. The objective of this article is to clarify the state of current European research on at-risk autism research, and to support the understanding of different contexts in which the research is being conducted. We present ESSEA survey data on ongoing European high-risk ASD studies, as well as perceived challenges and opportunities in this field of research. We conclude that although high-risk autism research in Europe faces several challenges, the existence of several key factors (e.g., new and/or large-scale autism grants, availability of new technologies, and involvement of experienced research groups) lead us to expect substantial scientific and clinical developments in Europe in this field during the next few years.

J	Berlim, MT; Broadbent, HJ; Van den Eynde, F				Berlim, Marcelo T.; Broadbent, Hannah J.; Van den Eynde, Frederique			Blinding integrity in randomized sham-controlled trials of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Blinding integrity; major depression; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation	TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CLINICAL-TRIALS; TMS TREATMENT; EFFICACY; BIAS; RTMS	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and effective treatment for major depression (MD). However, the perceived lack of a suitable sham rTMS condition might have compromised the success of blinding procedures in clinical trials. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on high frequency (HF-), low frequency (LF-) and bilateral rTMS for MD. We searched the literature from January 1995 to July 2012 using Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus. The main outcome measure was participants' ability to correctly guess their treatment allocation at study end. We used a random-effects model and risk difference (RD). Overall, data were obtained from seven and two RCTs on HF- and bilateral rTMS, respectively. No RCT on LF-rTMS reporting on blinding success was found. HF- and bilateral rTMS trials enrolled 396 and 93 depressed subjects and offered an average of approximately 13 sessions. At study end, 52 and 59% of subjects receiving HF-rTMS and sham rTMS were able to correctly guess their treatment allocation, a non-significant difference (RD = -0.04; z = -0.51; p = 0.61). Furthermore, 63.3 and 57.5% of subjects receiving bilateral and sham rTMS were able to correctly guess their treatment allocation, also a non-significant difference (RD = 0.05; z = 0.49; p = 0.62). In addition, the use of angulation and sham coil in HF-rTMS trials produced similar results. In summary, existing sham rTMS interventions appear to result in acceptable levels of blinding regarding treatment allocation.

In central African countries affected by endemic diseases such as human African trypanosomiasis, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and schistosomiasis, delayed diagnosis and treatment often lead to avoidable death or severe sequelae. Confirmatory microbiological and parasitological tests are essential because clinical features of most neurological infections are not specific, brain imaging is seldom feasible, and treatment regimens are often prolonged or toxic. Recognition of this diagnostic bottleneck has yielded major investment in application of advances in biotechnology to clinical microbiology in the past decade. We review the neurological pathogens for which rapid diagnostic tests are most urgently needed in central Africa, detail the state of development of putative rapid diagnostic tests for each, and describe key technical and operational challenges to their development and implementation. Promising field-suitable rapid diagnostic tests exist for the diagnosis of human African trypanosomiasis and cryptococcal meningoencephalifis. For other infections-eg, syphilis and schistosomiasis highly accurate field-validated rapid diagnostic tests are available, but their role in diagnosis of disease with neurological involvement is still unclear. For others-eg, tuberculosis-advances in research have not yet yielded validated tests for diagnosis of neurological disease.

We found that FMRP binds to Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) RNA, a molecule that is involved in neural development and has been implicated in Down syndrome. Elevated Dscam protein levels in FMRP null Drosophila and in flies with three copies of the Dscam gene both produced specific and similar synaptic targeting errors in a hard-wired neural circuit, which impaired the flies' sensory perception. Reducing Dscam levels in FMRP null flies reduced synaptic targeting errors and rescued behavioral responses. Our results indicate that excess Dscam protein may be a common molecular mechanism underlying altered neural wiring in intellectual disabilities such as Fragile X and Down syndromes.

Hydroxyurea Exposure Triggers Tissue-Specific Activation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling and the DNA Damage Response in Organogenesis-Stage Mouse Embryos	TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						oxidative stress; replication stress; MAP2K3; MEK3/6; gamma H2AX; cell death; appendicular skeleton; hindlimb	MAP KINASE; CELL-DEATH; CHECKPOINT; RADIATION; APOPTOSIS; TERATOGEN; P38-ALPHA; PATHWAYS; SURVIVAL	Editors Highlight: Hydroxyurea, a commonly used antineoplastic agent, induces teratogenesis accompanied by oxidative stress in rodent models. Banh and Hales report on the early and transient activation of p38 MAPK downstream of MEK3/6 following in utero exposure of murine embryos to hydroxyurea at gestational day 9. Hydroxyurea had a primary impact on neurological structures, where nuclear translocation of phospho-p38 and formation of H2AX foci, accompanied by an increase in pyknotic nuclei, were observed in the malformation-sensitive caudal neuroepithelium. In contrast, the heart appeared protected despite the accumulation of H2AX foci, the nuclear expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and the development of pyknotic nuclei were minimal in cardiac regions, suggesting that hydroxyurea may induce tissue-specific DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision or crosslink repair. u Matthew Campen.Hydroxyurea (HU) is commonly used to treat myeloproliferative diseases and sickle cell anemia. The administration of HU to gestation day 9 CD1 mice causes predominantly hindlimb, tail, and neural tube defects. HU induces oxidative stress and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in embryos. HU also inactivates ribonucleotide reductase, leading to DNA replication stress and DNA damage response signaling. We hypothesize that HU exposure induces p38 MAPK activation and DNA damage response signaling during organogenesis preferentially in malformation-sensitive tissues. HU treatment (400 or 600mg/kg) induced the activation of MEK3/6, upstream MAP2K3 kinases, within 30min; phospho-MEK3/6 immunoreactivity was increased throughout the embryo. Activation of the downstream p38 MAPK peaked 3h post-HU treatment. At this time, phospho-p38 MAPK immunoreactivity was enhanced in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells in the rostral and caudal neuroepithelium and neural tube; significant increases in p38 MAPK signaling were not observed in the somites or heart. Interestingly, the DNA damage response, as assessed by the formation of H2AX foci, was increased at 3h in HU-exposed embryos in all tissues examined, including the somites and heart. Increases in pyknotic nuclei and cell fragmentation were observed in all tissues except the heart, an organ that is relatively resistant to HU-induced malformations. Thus, although HU induces a widespread DNA damage response, the activation of p38 MAPK is localized to the rostral and caudal neuroepithelium and neural tube, suggesting that p38 MAPK pathways may play a role in mediating the specific malformations observed after HU exposure.

Phase I Trial of AEG35156 an Antisense Oligonucleotide to XIAP Plus Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						antisense oligonucleotide; maximum-tolerated dose; dose-limiting toxicity; gemcitabine; pancreas cancer	X-LINKED INHIBITOR; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; IAP-FAMILY PROTEINS; CANCER-CELLS; PROSTATE-CANCER; APOPTOSIS PROTEINS; DOWN-REGULATION; EXPRESSION; CHEMOTHERAPY; SENSITIVITY	Objectives: AEG35156 is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that targets the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis mRNA. Preclinical studies showed potent activity of AEG35156 in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). A phase I study was conducted to establish the maximum-tolerated dose, safety, and antitumor activity of AEG35156 plus gemcitabine in metastatic PDA. Methods: Fourteen patients with metastatic PDA were enrolled. Nine patients were treated at 350 mg IV and 5 patients at 500 mg IV of AEG35156, 3 weeks on/1 week off of a 28-day cycle. Gemcitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m(2) IV over 30 minutes immediately after AEG35156 in both groups. Because of perceived neurotoxicity dose deescalation to 350 mg was recommended. Results: All 14 patients were evaluable for tolerability and toxicity. Toxicities include neutropenia (grade 3/4, 6 patients), thrombocytopenia (grade 3, 2 patients), peripheral neuropathy (grade 3, 2 patients), fatigue (grade 3, 4 patients), ascites (grade 3, 2 patients), and nausea/vomiting (grade 4, 2 patients). Five patients (45%) experienced stable disease with a median progression-free survival of 58 days (95% CI, 52-107 d). Conclusions: The maximum-tolerated dose is AEG35156 500 mg plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) given on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. AEG35156 plus gemcitabine failed to show significant clinical activity in advanced PDA.

J	Connolly, JF; Granger, E; Sabourin, R				Connolly, Jean-Francois; Granger, Eric; Sabourin, Robert			Dynamic multi-objective evolution of classifier ensembles for video face recognition	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Dynamic multi-objective optimization; Multi-classifier systems; Ensemble methods; Incremental learning; ARTMAP neural networks; Face recognition in video; Adaptive biometrics	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; MULTIMODAL OPTIMIZATION; WEIGHTED-MAJORITY; NEURAL-NETWORK; CONCEPT DRIFT; ENVIRONMENTS; ARCHITECTURE; ALGORITHMS; TRACKING; ONLINE	Due to a limited control over changing operational conditions and personal physiology, systems used for video-based face recognition are confronted with complex and changing pattern recognition environments. Although a limited amount of reference data is initially available during enrollment, new samples often become available over time, through re-enrollment, post analysis and labeling of operational data, etc. Adaptive multi-classifier systems (AMCSs) are therefore desirable for the design and incremental update of facial models. For real time recognition of individuals appearing in video sequences, facial regions are captured with one or more cameras, and an AMCS must perform fast and efficient matching against the facial model of individual enrolled to the system. In this paper, an incremental learning strategy based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to efficiently evolve heterogeneous classifier ensembles in response to new reference data. This strategy is applied to an AMCS where all parameters of a pool of fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural network classifiers (i.e., a swarm of classifiers), each one corresponding to a particle, are co-optimized such that both error rate and network size are minimized. To provide a high level of accuracy over time while minimizing the computational complexity, the AMCS integrates information from multiple diverse classifiers, where learning is guided by an aggregated dynamical niching PSO (ADNPSO) algorithm that optimizes networks according both these objectives. Moreover, pools of FAM networks are evolved to maintain (1) genotype diversity of solutions around local optima in the optimization search space and (2) phenotype diversity in the objective space. Accurate and low cost ensembles are thereby designed by selecting classifiers on the basis of accuracy, and both genotype and phenotype diversity. For proof-of-concept validation, the proposed strategy is compared to AMCSs where incremental learning of FAM networks is guided through mono-and multi-objective optimization. Performance is assessed in terms of video-based error rate and resource requirements under different incremental learning scenarios, where new data is extracted from real-world video streams (IIT-NRC and MoBo). Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy provides a level of accuracy that is comparable to that of using mono-objective optimization and reference face recognition systems, yet requires a fraction of the computational cost (between 16% and 20% of a mono-objective strategy depending on the data base and scenario).

Control of ALK (wild type and mutated forms) phosphorylation: Specific role of the phosphatase PTP1B	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article						ALK; Mutated receptors; Phosphorylation; Phosphatase; PTP1B	ANAPLASTIC LYMPHOMA KINASE; RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE; CELL LUNG-CANCER; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; ACTIVATING MUTATIONS; NEUROBLASTOMA; INHIBITION; GENE; IDENTIFICATION	Phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues is regulated by the activities of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) essentially and transiently expressed during development of the central and peripheral nervous systems. ALK has been identified as a major neuroblastoma predisposition gene and activating mutations have been identified in a subset of sporadic neuroblastoma tumors. We previously established that the mutated receptors were essentially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartments due to their constitutive activity. Intriguingly we demonstrated a stronger phosphorylation for the minor pool of receptor addressed to the plasma membrane. We decided to investigate the potential involvement of tyrosine phosphatase in dephosphorylation of this intracellular pool. In this study we first showed that general inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases resulted in a dramatic increase of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the wild type but also of the mutated receptors. This increase not only required the intrinsic kinase activity of the ALK receptor but also involved the Src tyrosine kinase family. Second we provided strong evidences that the endoplasmic reticulum associated phosphatase PTP1B is key player in the control of ALK phosphorylation. Our data shed a new light on the biological significance of the basal phosphorylation levels of both wild type and mutated ALK receptors and could be essential to further understand their roles in malignancies.

Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) form synapses with dendrites of second order neurons in glomeruli of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Axons of VSNs expressing the same vomeronasal receptor coalesce into multiple glomeruli within spatially conserved regions of the AOB. Here we examine the role of the Kirrel family of transmembrane proteins in the coalescence of VSN axons within the AOB. We find that Kirrel2 and Kirrel3 are differentially expressed in subpopulations of VSNs and that their expression is regulated by activity. Although Kirrel3 expression is not required for early axonal guidance events, such as fasciculation of the vomeronasal tract and segregation of apical and basal VSN axons in the AOB, it is necessary for proper coalescence of axons into glomeruli. Ablation of Kirrel3 expression results in disorganization of the glomerular layer of the posterior AOB and formation of fewer, larger glomeruli. Furthermore, Kirrel3(-/-) mice display a loss of male-male aggression in a resident-intruder assay. Taken together, our results indicate that differential expression of Kirrels on vomeronasal axons generates a molecular code that dictates their proper coalescence into glomeruli within the AOB.

SynI knockout (KO) mice are epileptic, and nonsense and missense mutations in the human SYN1 gene have a causal role in idiopathic epilepsy and autism. To get insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis linked to SYN1 mutations, we analyzed the effects of the recently identified Q555X mutation on neurotransmitter release dynamics and short-term plasticity (STP) in excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We used patch-clamp electrophysiology coupled to electron microscopy and multi-electrode arrays to dissect synaptic transmission of primary SynI KO hippocampal neurons in which the human wild-type and mutant SynI were expressed by lentiviral transduction. A parallel decrease in the SV readily releasable pool in inhibitory synapses and in the release probability in excitatory synapses caused a marked reduction in the evoked synchronous release. This effect was accompanied by an increase in asynchronous release that was much more intense in excitatory synapses and associated with an increased total charge transfer. Q555X-hSynI induced larger facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation in excitatory synapses and stronger depression after long trains in inhibitory synapses. These changes were associated with higher network excitability and firing/bursting activity. Our data indicate that imbalances in STP and release dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory synapses trigger network hyperexcitability potentially leading to epilepsy/autism manifestations.

Interestingly, TDP-43 positive inclusion bodies were first discovered in ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) inclusion bodies, and subsequently observed in the majority of neurodegenerative disorders. To date, 47 missense and one truncating mutations have been described in a large number of familial (FALS) and sporadic (SALS) patients. Fused in sarcoma (FUS) was found to be responsible for a previously identified ALS6 locus, being mutated in both FALS and SALS patients. TARDBP and FUS have a structural and functional similarity and most of mutations in both genes are also clustered in the C-terminus of the proteins. The molecular mechanisms through which mutant TDP-43 and FUS may cause motor neuron degeneration are not well understood. Both proteins play an important role in mRNA transport, axonal maintenance, and motor neuron development. Functional characterization of these mutations in in vitro and in vivo systems is helping to better understand how motor neuron degeneration occurs. This report summarizes the biological and clinical relevance of TARDBP and FUS mutations in ALS.

The high inter-subject variability in cortical morphology complicates the detection of abnormal asymmetries especially if only small samples are available. This work introduces a novel automatic method for the local (vertex-level) statistical shape analysis of gross cerebral hemispheric surface asymmetries which is robust to the individual cortical variations. After segmentation of the cerebral hemispheric volumes from three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) and their spatial normalization to a common space, the right hemispheric masks were reflected to match with the left ones. Cerebral hemispheric surfaces were extracted using a deformable model-based algorithm which extracted the salient morphological features while establishing the point correspondence between the surfaces. The interhemispheric asymmetry, quantified by customized measures of asymmetry, was evaluated in a few thousands of corresponding surface vertices and tested for statistical significance. The developed method was tested on scans obtained from a small sample of healthy volunteers and first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenics. A significant main effect of the disease on the local interhemispheric asymmetry was observed, both in females and males, at the frontal and temporal lobes, the latter being often linked to the cognitive, auditory, and memory deficits in schizophrenia. The findings of this study, although need further testing in larger samples, partially replicate previous studies supporting the hypothesis of schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder.

However, the identification of definitive TS susceptibility genes remains elusive. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TS in 1285 cases and 4964 ancestry-matched controls of European ancestry, including two European-derived population isolates, Ashkenazi Jews from North America and Israel and French Canadians from Quebec, Canada. In a primary meta-analysis of GWAS data from these European ancestry samples, no markers achieved a genome-wide threshold of significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)); the top signal was found in rs7868992 on chromosome 9q32 within COL27A1 (P = 1.85 x 10(-6)). A secondary analysis including an additional 211 cases and 285 controls from two closely related Latin American population isolates from the Central Valley of Costa Rica and Antioquia, Colombia also identified rs7868992 as the top signal ( P = 3.6 x 10(-7) for the combined sample of 1496 cases and 5249 controls following imputation with 1000 Genomes data). This study lays the groundwork for the eventual identification of common TS susceptibility variants in larger cohorts and helps to provide a more complete understanding of the full genetic architecture of this disorder.

Such cells are usually used in acute diseases but few options are available for the treatment of chronic disorders. In this study, we have used a laser-induced model of open angle glaucoma (OAG) to evaluate the potential of bone marrow cell populations and the mechanisms involved in tissue repair. In addition, we investigated laser-induced tissue remodeling as a method of targeting effector cells into damaged tissues. We demonstrate that among bone marrow cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) induce trabecular meshwork regeneration. MSC injection into the ocular anterior chamber leads to far more efficient decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) (p < .001) and healing than hematopoietic cells. This robust effect was attributable to paracrine factors from stressed MSC, as injection of conditioned medium from MSC exposed to low but not to normal oxygen levels resulted in an immediate decrease in IOP. Moreover, MSC and their secreted factors induced reactivation of a progenitor cell pool found in the ciliary body and increased cellular proliferation. Proliferating cells were observed within the chamber angle for at least 1 month. Laser-induced remodeling was able to target MSC to damaged areas with ensuing specific increases in ocular progenitor cells. Thus, our results identify MSC and their secretum as crucial mediators of tissue repair in OAG through reactivation of local neural progenitors. In addition, laser treatment could represent an appealing strategy to promote MSC-mediated progenitor cell recruitment and tissue repair in chronic diseases.

The data contain abundant knowledge about the interactions between a building's energy consumption and the influencing factors. It is highly desirable that the hidden knowledge can be extracted from the data in order to help improve building energy performance. However, the data are rarely translated into useful knowledge due to their complexity and a lack of effective data analysis techniques. This paper first conducts a comprehensive review of the commonly used data analysis methods applied to building-related data. Both the strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed. Then, the critical analysis of the previous solutions to three fundamental problems of building energy performance improvement that remain significant barriers is performed. Considering the limitations of those commonly used data analysis methods, data mining techniques are proposed as a primary tool to analyze building-related data. Moreover, a data analysis process and a data mining framework are proposed that enable building-related data to be analyzed more efficiently. The process refers to a series of sequential steps in analyzing data. The framework includes different data mining techniques and algorithms, from which a set of efficient data analysis methodologies can be developed. The applications of the process and framework to two sets of collected data demonstrate their applicability and abilities to extract useful knowledge. Particularly, four data analysis methodologies were developed to solve the three problems. For demonstration purposes, these methodologies were applied to the collected data. These methodologies are introduced in the published papers and are summarized in this paper. More extensive investigations will be performed in order to further evaluate the effectiveness of the framework.

J	Capilla, A; Belin, P; Gross, J				Capilla, Almudena; Belin, Pascal; Gross, Joachim			The Early Spatio-Temporal Correlates and Task Independence of Cerebral Voice Processing Studied with MEG	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory cortex; human vocalizations; speech; superior temporal sulcus; temporal voice areas	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN BRAIN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; FACE PERCEPTION; DISCRIMINATION; REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION; ADAPTATION; HUMANS	Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have repeatedly provided evidence for temporal voice areas (TVAs) with particular sensitivity to human voices along bilateral mid/anterior superior temporal sulci and superior temporal gyri (STS/STG). In contrast, electrophysiological studies of the spatio-temporal correlates of cerebral voice processing have yielded contradictory results, finding the earliest correlates either at similar to 300-400 ms, or earlier at similar to 200 ms ("fronto-temporal positivity to voice", FTPV). These contradictory results are likely the consequence of different stimulus sets and attentional demands. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography activity while participants listened to diverse types of vocal and non-vocal sounds and performed different tasks varying in attentional demands. Our results confirm the existence of an early voice-preferential magnetic response (FTPVm, the magnetic counterpart of the FTPV) peaking at about 220 ms and distinguishing between vocal and non-vocal sounds as early as 150 ms after stimulus onset. The sources underlying the FTPVm were localized along bilateral mid-STS/STG, largely overlapping with the TVAs. The FTPVm was consistently observed across different stimulus subcategories, including speech and non-speech vocal sounds, and across different tasks. These results demonstrate the early, largely automatic recruitment of focal, voice-selective cerebral mechanisms with a time-course comparable to that of face processing.

However, studies to date have focussed on prenatal testosterone rather than pubertal changes in testosterone. Yet, animal studies have shown a high density of androgen-sensitive receptors in multiple key cortical areas, and puberty is known to coincide with both a significant rise in testosterone and the emergence of behavioral sex differences, suggesting peripubertal influences of testosterone on brain development. Here, we used linear mixed models to examine sex-specific cortical maturation associated with changes in testosterone levels in a longitudinal sample of developmentally healthy children and adolescents. A significant sex by age by testosterone interaction on cortical thickness (CTh) involving widespread areas of the developing brain was found. Testosterone levels were associated with CTh changes in regions of the left hemisphere in males and of the right hemisphere in females. In both sexes, the relationship between testosterone and CTh varied across the age span. These findings show the association between testosterone and CTh to be complex, highly dynamic, and to vary, depending on sex and age; they also suggest sex-related hemispheric lateralization effects of testosterone in humans.

Bilateral coupling facilitates recovery of rhythmical movements from perturbation in healthy and post-stroke subjects	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Bimanual coordination; Motor control; Referent position control; Stroke; Rehabilitation	BIMANUAL COORDINATION; STRETCH REFLEX; MOTOR CONTROL; INTERLIMB COORDINATION; CORTICOSPINAL CONTROL; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; AIMING MOVEMENTS; GAIT STABILITY; NEURAL-CONTROL; ARM MOVEMENTS	The paretic arm of subjects with stroke has a decreased ability to quickly adapt to and recover from perturbations during rhythmical arm swinging. We investigated whether bilateral coupling in the synchronous motion of two arms may facilitate the restoration of rhythmical movement of the paretic arm in subjects with chronic hemiparesis due to stroke. While standing, stroke and age-matched healthy (control) subjects swung one or both arms synchronously at 0.8 Hz from the shoulder joints. In randomly selected cycles, one arm was transiently arrested by an electromagnetic device when moving forward or backward. In the control group, bilateral swinging resumed faster than unilateral swinging regardless of which arm was perturbed. In the stroke group, this effect was observed only when the perturbation was applied to the paretic arm, suggesting that the motion of the non-paretic arm accelerated the recovery from perturbation of the paretic arm. In addition, bilateral swinging resumed after reduced anterior-posterior excursions of both arms in stroke subjects. Results confirm previous findings that bilateral swinging is normally guided by central changes in the referent configuration of the two arms that function as a single unit. As a consequence, both arms cooperate in recovery from perturbation of motion applied to one arm. Results also suggest that stroke-related brain damage alters the symmetry of bilateral interaction, resulting in deficits of inter-manual cooperative action. The involvement of the non-paretic arm could be beneficial for the recovery of swinging of both arms and may also facilitate movements of the paretic arm in certain tasks.

Mechanisms proposed to explain the neuroinflammatory response in ALF include direct effects of systemically-derived proinflammatory cytokines and the effects of brain lactate accumulation on pro-inflammatory cytokine release from activated microglia. Cell culture studies reveal a positive synergistic effect of ammonia and pro-inflammatory cytokines on the expression of proteins involved in glutamate homeostasis and in oxidative/nitrosative stress. Proinflammatory cytokines have the capacity to alter blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and preliminary studies suggest that the presence of infection in ALF results in rupture of the BBB and vasogenic brain edema. Treatments currently under investigation that are effective in prevention of encephalopathy and brain edema in ALF which are aimed at reduction of neuroinflammation in ALF include mild hypothermia, albumin dialysis systems, N-acetyl cysteine and the antibiotic minocycline with potent anti-inflammatory actions that are distinct from its anti-microbial properties.

Oxidative stress is another factor believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome; it represents an imbalance between the production and neutralization of reactive oxygen species, which leads to cellular dysfunction. In the setting of liver disease, oxidative stress represents a systemic phenomenon induced by several mechanisms: decreased antioxidant synthesis, increased systemic release of oxidant enzymes, generation of reactive oxygen species, and impaired neutrophil function. High ammonia concentrations induce cerebral oxidative stress, thus contributing to severe hepatic encephalopathy, as observed in acute liver failure. In chronic liver disease, significantly lower degrees of hyperammonemia (< 500 mu M) do not induce cerebral nor systemic oxidative stress. Data from both animal and human studies sustain that there is a synergistic effect between systemic oxidative stress, and ammonia that is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging reveals T1-weighted hyperintense signals in both globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Estimates of the prevalence of Parkinsonism in cirrhosis have been reported as high as 21 %. The cause of Parkinsonism in cirrhosis has been attributed to manganese deposition in basal ganglia structures, leading to the dysfunction of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system. In particular, there is evidence from both spectroscopic and biochemical investigations for damage to (or dysfunction of) presynaptic dopamine transporters together with a loss of post-synaptic dopamine receptors in basal ganglia of affected patients. Therapeutic options are limited; ammonia-lowering strategies are without substantial benefit, and an effective manganese chelator is not available. In many patients, L-Dopa replacement therapy and the dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine are beneficial, and liver transplantation is generally effective. However, reports of post-transplant residual extrapyramidal symptoms suggest an element of irreversibility in some cases.

Malnutrition is a common complication of cirrhosis and is known to be associated with a greater risk of post-operative complications and mortality, especially following liver transplantation. Neurological complications occur frequently after transplant and the nature and extent of these complications may relate to nutritional deficits such as protein-calorie malnutrition as well as vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies. A consensus document from the International Society on Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen metabolism (ISHEN) has been established in order to address these concerns. Careful assessment of nutritional status followed by prompt treatment of nutritional deficits has the potential to impact on transplant outcome and, in particular, on post-transplant neurological disorders in patients with cirrhosis.

We describe a case where deformation of the device may have contributed to the complication. A patient with a giant, previously unruptured cavernous aneurysm that extended intracranially to cause oedema of the internal capsule was treated with flow diversion. Treatment was followed by multiple episodes of peri-aneurysmal haemorrhages within eight days. A deformation of the device which occurred where it curved to cross the aneurysm neck created residual flows which, in the presence of a stent stenosis immediately beyond the neck, may have contributed to the observed ruptures. Following multiple haemorrhages the patient subsequently died. Autopsy demonstrated early red thrombus partially bridging the struts of the flow diverter, and intra-aneurysmal thrombus of various ages. Microscopic pathology showed an aneurysm wall consisting of collagen infiltrated with neutrophils, but the wall was absent near the cerebral peduncle, adjacent to the brain haemorrhage. Radiographs of the extracted specimen confirmed deformation of the FD construct, located at the transition zone of the stent, leading to increased pore size and porosity. The site of the deformation correlated with the angiographic presence of a continued blood inflow jet into the aneurysm. Stent deformation at the transition zone may promote persistent blood entry into the aneurysm, and in turn potentially contribute to haemorrhagic complications.	[Darsaut, T.

How to Detect Amygdala Activity with Magnetoencephalography using Source Imaging	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 76; Neuroscience; Neurobiology; Molecular Biology; Medicine; Physiology; Anatomy; Psychology; Amygdala; Magnetoencephalography; Fear; awareness; masking; source imaging; conditional stimulus; unconditional stimulus; hippocampus; brain; magnetic resonance imaging; MRI; fMRI; imaging; clinical techniques		In trace fear conditioning a conditional stimulus (CS) predicts the occurrence of the unconditional stimulus (UCS), which is presented after a brief stimulus free period (trace interval)(1). Because the CS and UCS do not co-occur temporally, the subject must maintain a representation of that CS during the trace interval. In humans, this type of learning requires awareness of the stimulus contingencies in order to bridge the trace winterval(2-4). However when a face is used as a CS, subjects can implicitly learn to fear the face even in the absence of explicit awareness*. This suggests that there may be additional neural mechanisms capable of maintaining certain types of "biologically-relevant" stimuli during a brief trace interval. Given that the amygdala is involved in trace conditioning, and is sensitive to faces, it is possible that this structure can maintain a representation of a face CS during a brief trace interval. It is challenging to understand how the brain can associate an unperceived face with an aversive outcome, even though the two stimuli are separated in time. Furthermore investigations of this phenomenon are made difficult by two specific challenges. First, it is difficult to manipulate the subject's awareness of the visual stimuli. One common way to manipulate visual awareness is to use backward masking. In backward masking, a target stimulus is briefly presented (< 30 msec) and immediately followed by a presentation of an overlapping masking stimulus(5). The presentation of the mask renders the target invisible(6-8). Second, masking requires very rapid and precise timing making it difficult to investigate neural responses evoked by masked stimuli using many common approaches. Blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses resolve at a timescale too slow for this type of methodology, and real time recording techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have difficulties recovering signal from deep sources. However, there have been recent advances in the methods used to localize the neural sources of the MEG signal(9-11). By collecting high-resolution MRI images of the subject's brain, it is possible to create a source model based on individual neural anatomy. Using this model to "image" the sources of the MEG signal, it is possible to recover signal from deep subcortical structures, like the amygdala and the hippocampus*.

Recurrent mutations in DNAJC5 cause autosomal dominant Kufs disease. Clin Genet 2013: 83: 571-575. (C) John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2012 We sought to identify the molecular basis of the autosomal dominant form of Kufs disease, an adult onset form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. We used a combination of classic linkage analysis and Next Generation Sequencing to map and identify mutations in DNAJC5 in a total of three families. We analyzed the clinical manifestations in 20 individuals with mutation in DNAJC5. We report here the mapping and the identification of a p. L116del mutation in DNAJC5 segregating with the disease in two distinct American families, as well as a p. L115R mutation in an additional family. The age of onset and clinical manifestations were very homogeneous among mutation positive individuals, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonus, ataxia, speech deterioration, dementia, and premature death. A few individuals also exhibited parkinsonism. DNAJC5, which encodes the cysteine string protein (CSP alpha), a presynaptic protein implicated in neurodegeneration, causes autosomal dominant Kufs disease. The leucine residues at positions 115 and 116 are hotspots for mutations and result in a homogeneous phenotype of progressive myoclonus epilepsy with onset around 30 years old.

Early cortical thickness changes predict beta-amyloid deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Animal model; Beta-amyloid; Cortical thickness; Quantitative immunohistochemistry; Magnetic resonance imaging; Transgenic mice	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL HYPERTROPHY; TRANSGENIC MICE; MRI DATA; BRAIN; PATTERNS; PATHOLOGY; AD	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have identified aberrant cortical structure in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between MM-derived cortical morphometry measures and beta-amyloid, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored the potential relationship between early alterations in cortical thickness and later stage beta-amyloid deposition, using a novel approach, in a transgenic AD mouse model. We acquired longitudinal anatomical MM scans from mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice and age-matched wild-type mice at 1 and 3.5 months-of-age, and employed fully-automated image processing methods to derive objective, quantitative measures of cortical thickness on a region-of-interest basis. We also generated 3D quantitative immunohistochemistry (qIHC) volumes of deposited beta-amyloid burden from 18 month-old transgenic mice using an automated, production-level process. These studies revealed thinner cortex in most regions in the 1 month-old transgenic mice relative to age-matched wild-types, with the exception of the frontal, perirhinal/entorhinal, posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortical regions. Between 1 and 3.5 months-of-age, the transgenic mice demonstrated stable or increasing cortical thickness, while the wild-type mice showed cortical thinning. Based on data from co-registered 3D MM and qIHC volumes, we identified an association between abnormal, early, regional cortical thickness change over 2.5 months and later beta-amyloid deposition. These observations suggest that the spatio-temporal pattern of early (pre-plaque) alterations in cerebral cortical structure is indicative of regional predisposition to later beta-amyloid pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model.

Experimental studies have shown that interictal discharges and ictal events (i.e., seizures) are characterized intracellularly by similar (but for duration) neuronal depolarizations leading to sustained action potential firing, thus indicating that they may share similar cellular and pharmacological mechanisms. It has also been proposed that interictal discharges may herald the onset of electrographic seizures, but other studies have demonstrated that interictal events interfere with the occurrence of ictal activity. The relationship between interictal and ictal activity thus remains ambiguous. Here we will review this issue in animal models of limbic seizures that are electrographically close to those seen in TLE patients. In particular we will: (i) focus on the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of, at least, two types of interictal discharge; (ii) propose that they play opposite roles in leading to ictogenesis; and (iii) discuss the possibility that mimicking one of these two types of interictal activity by low frequency repetitive stimulation can control ictogenesis. Finally, we will also review evidence indicating that specific types of interictal discharge may play a role in epileptogenesis.

The relationship between these in vivo imaging measures and the corresponding underlying pathophysiological changes, however, remains elusive. Recently, attention has turned to neuroimaging of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in which imaging-pathological correlations can be readily performed. In this study, anatomical and arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging scans of amyloid precursor protein transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice were acquired at 3, 12, and 18 months of age. Fully-automated image processing methods were used to derive quantitative measures of cortical thickness and perfusion. These studies revealed increased regional cortical thickness in young transgenic mice relative to age-matched wild-type mice. However, the transgenic mice generally demonstrated a greater rate of cortical thinning over 15 months. Cortical perfusion was significantly reduced in young transgenic mice in comparison with wild-type mice across most brain regions. Previously unreported regional genotype differences and age-related changes in cortical thickness and cerebral perfusion were identified in amyloid precursor protein transgenic and wild-type mice.

One important primary afferent population that transmits such information to the spinal cord expresses substance P (SP). These fibers terminate in contact with lamina I projection neurons that express the SP receptor, also known as the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1r). Three types of lamina I projection neurons have been described: multipolar, fusiform, and pyramidal. Most neurons of the first two types are thought to be nociceptive and express the NK-1r, whereas most pyramidal neurons are nonnociceptive and do not express the NK-1r. In this immunocytochemical and behavioral study, we induced a neuropathic pain-like condition in the rat by means of a polyethylene cuff placed around in the sciatic nerve. We document that this lesion led to a de novo expression of NK-1r on pyramidal neurons as well as a significant increase in SP-immunoreactive innervation onto these neurons. These phenotypic changes were evident at the time of onset of neuropathic pain-related behavior. Additionally, we show that, after a noxious stimulus (intradermal capsaicin injection), these NK-1r on pyramidal neurons were internalized, providing evidence that these neurons become responsive to peripheral noxious stimulation. We suggest that the changes following nerve lesion in the phenotype and innervation pattern of pyramidal neurons are of significance for neuropathic pain and/or limb temperature regulation. J. Comp.

It has roles in development, tumorigenesis, wound healing, neurodegeneration and inflammation. Endothelia in tumors, wounds and placenta express elevated levels of progranulin. In culture, progranulin activates endothelial proliferation and migration. This suggested that progranulin might regulate angiogenesis. It was, however, unclear how elevated endothelial progranulin levels influence vascular growth in vivo. To address this issue, we generated mice with progranulin expression targeted specifically to developing endothelial cells using a Tie2-promoter/enhancer construct. Three Tie2-Grn mouse lines were generated with varying Tie2-Grn copy number, and were called GrnLo, GrnMid, and GrnHi. All three lines showed increased mortality that correlates with Tie2-Grn copy number, with greatest mortality and lowest germline transmission in the GrnHi line. Death of the transgenic animals occurred around birth, and continued for three days after birth. Those that survived beyond day 3 survived into adulthood. Transgenic neonates that died showed vascular abnormalities of varying severity. Some exhibited bleeding into body cavities such as the pericardial space. Smaller localized hemorrhages were seen in many organs. Blood vessels were often dilated and thin-walled. To establish the development of these abnormalities, we examined mice at early (E10.5-14.5) and later (E15.5-17.5) developmental phases. Early events during vasculogenesis appear unaffected by Tie2-Grn as apparently normal primary vasculature had been established at E10.5. The earliest onset of vascular abnormality was at E15.5, with focal cerebral hemorrhage and enlarged vessels in various organs. Aberrant Tie2-Grn positive vessels showed thinning of the basement membrane and reduced investiture with mural cells. We conclude that progranulin promotes exaggerated vessel growth in vivo, with subsequent effects in the formation of the mural cell layer and weakening of vessel integrity. These results demonstrate that overexpression of progranulin in endothelial cells influences normal angiogenesis in vivo.

Spider phobic and control participants imagined visiting different forest locations with the possibility of encountering spiders, snakes, or birds (neutral reference category). In each experimental trial, participants saw a picture of a forest location followed by a picture of a spider, snake, or bird, and then rated their personal risk of encountering these animals in this context, as well as their fear. The greater the visual avoidance of spiders that a phobic participant demonstrated (as measured by eye tracking), the higher were her autonomic arousal and neural activity in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus at picture onset. Visual avoidance of spiders in phobics also went hand in hand with subsequently reduced cognitive risk of encounters. Control participants, in contrast, displayed a positive relationship between gaze duration toward spiders, on the one hand, and autonomic responding, as well as OFC, ACC, and precuneus activity, on the other hand. In addition, they showed reduced encounter risk estimates when they looked longer at the animal pictures. Our data are consistent with the idea that one reason for phobics to avoid phobic information may be grounded in heightened activity in the fear circuit, which signals potential threat. Because of the absence of alternative efficient regulation strategies, visual avoidance may then function to down-regulate cognitive risk evaluations for threatening information about the phobic stimuli. Control participants, in contrast, may be characterized by a different coping style, whereby paying visual attention to potentially threatening information may help them to actively down-regulate cognitive evaluations of risk.

Prefrontal Neurons of Opposite Spatial Preference Display Distinct Target Selection Dynamics	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; CORTICO-CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARIETAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; NORMALIZATION MODEL; GRANULAR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY	Neurons in the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of one hemisphere are selective for the location of attended targets in both visual hemifields. Whether dlPFC neurons with selectivity for opposite hemifields directly compete with each other for target selection or instead play distinct roles during the allocation of attention remains unclear. We explored this issue by recording neuronal responses in the right dlPFC of two macaques while they allocated attention to a target in one hemifield and ignored a distracter on the opposite side. Forty-nine percent of the recorded neurons were target location selective. Neurons selective for contralateral targets (58%) systematically discriminated targets from distracters faster than neurons selective for ipsilateral targets (42%). Additionally, during trials in which sensory stimulation remained the same but both stimuli were task irrelevant and animals were required to detect a change in the color of a fixation spot, contralateral neurons still reliably discriminated the putative target from the distracter, whereas ipsilateral neurons did not. The latter result indicates that target-distracter discrimination by contralateral neurons could occur independently of discrimination by ipsilateral cells; thus, the two cell types may represent two different components of the prefrontal circuitry underlying the allocation of attention to targets in the presence of distracters. Moreover, the response of both contralateral and ipsilateral neurons to a single target was substantially reduced by the presence of a distracter in the contralateral hemifield. This result suggests that the presence of the distracter triggered inhibitory interactions within the dlPFC circuitry that suppressed responses to the attended target.

Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter 3 Interacts with Vav2 to Synchronize the Cell Volume Decrease Response with Cell Protrusion Dynamics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							K-CL COTRANSPORT; GTP-BINDING PROTEINS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; SENSORY NEUROPATHY; HEREDITARY MOTOR; RAC1; KCC3; ACTIVATION; AGENESIS; GROWTH	Loss-of-function of the potassium-chloride cotransporter 3 (KCC3) causes hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), a severe neurodegenerative disease associated with defective midline crossing of commissural axons in the brain. Conversely, KCC3 over-expression in breast, ovarian and cervical cancer is associated with enhanced tumor cell malignancy and invasiveness. We identified a highly conserved proline-rich sequence within the C-terminus of the cotransporter which when mutated leads to loss of the KCC3-dependent regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response in Xenopus Laevis oocytes. Using SH3 domain arrays, we found that this poly-proline motif is a binding site for SH3-domain containing proteins in vitro. This approach identified the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav2 as a candidate partner for KCC3. KCC3/Vav2 physical interaction was confirmed using GST-pull down assays and immuno-based experiments. In cultured cervical cancer cells, KCC3 co-localized with the active form of Vav2 in swelling-induced actin-rich protruding sites and within lamellipodia of spreading and migrating cells. These data provide evidence of a molecular and functional link between the potassium-chloride co-transporters and the Rho GTPase-dependent actin remodeling machinery in RVD, cell spreading and cell protrusion dynamics, thus providing new insights into KCC3' s involvement in cancer cell malignancy and in corpus callosum agenesis in HMSN/ACC.

A minocycline derivative reduces nerve injury-induced allodynia, LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 microglial production and signaling via toll-like receptors 2 and 4	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						12S-Hydroxy-1,12-pyrazolinominocycline; Chemically modified tetracycline; Neuropathic pain; PGE2; TLR2; TLR4	ATTENUATES MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; NON-ANTIBACTERIAL; RAT; HYPERSENSITIVITY; TETRACYCLINES; EXPRESSION; MODELS; ACTIVATION	Many studies have shown that minocycline, an antibacterial tetracycline, suppresses experimental pain. While minocycline's positive effects on pain resolution suggest that clinical use of such drugs may prove beneficial, minocycline's antibiotic actions and divalent cation (Ca2+; Mg2+) chelating effects detract from its potential utility. Thus, we tested the antiallodynic effect induced by a non-antibacterial, non-chelating minocycline derivative in a model of neuropathic pain and performed an initial investigation of its anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Intraperitoneal minocycline (100 mg/kg) and 12S-hydroxy1,12-pyrazolinominocycline (PMIN; 23.75 mg/kg, 47.50 mg/kg or 95.00 mg/kg) reduce the mechanical allodynia induced by chronic constriction injury of mouse sciatic nerve. PMIN reduces the LPS-induced production of PGE(2) by primary microglial cell cultures. Human embryonic kidney cells were transfected to express human toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and the signaling via both receptors stimulated with PAM3CSK4 or LPS (respectively) was affected either by minocycline or PMIN. Importantly, these treatments did not affect the cell viability, as assessed by MTT test. Altogether, these results reinforce the evidence that the anti-inflammatory and experimental pain suppressive effects induced by tetracyclines are neither necessarily linked to antibacterial nor to Ca2+ chelating activities. This study supports the evaluation of the potential usefulness of PMIN in the management of neuropathic pain, as its lack of antibacterial and Ca2+ chelating activities might confer greater safety over conventional tetracyclines.

Previous evidence obtained in vivo links salsolinol with the mesolimbic dopaminergic (DA) system: salsolinolis self-administered into the posterior of the ventral tegmental area (pVTA) of rats; intra-VTA administration of salsolinol induces a strong conditional place preference and increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unclear. Here we present an overview of some of there centre search on this topic. Electrophysiological studies reveal that DA neurons in the pVTA are a target of salsolinol. In acute brain slices from rats, salsolinol increases the excitability and accelerates the ongoing firing of dopamine neurons in the pVTA. Intriguingly, this action of salsolinol involves multiple pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms, including: (1) depolarizing dopamine neurons; (2) by activating mu opioid receptors on the GABAergic inputs to dopamine neurons - which decreases GABAergic activity-dopamine neurons are disinhibited; and(3) enhancing presynaptic glutamatergic transmission on to dopamine neurons via activation of dopamine type 1 receptors, probably situated on the glutamatergic terminals. These novel mechanisms may contribute to there warding/reinforcing properties of salsolinol observed in vivo.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of NMES for preventing skeletal-muscle weakness and wasting in critically ill patients, in comparison with usual care. Methods: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PEDro to identify randomized controlled trials exploring the effect of NMES in critically ill patients, which had a well-defined NMES protocol, provided outcomes related to skeletal-muscle strength and/or mass, and for which full text was available. Two independent reviewers extracted data on muscle-related outcomes (strength and mass), and participant and intervention characteristics, and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. Owing to the lack of means and standard deviations (SDs) in some studies, as well as the lack of baseline measurements in two studies, it was impossible to conduct a full meta-analysis. When means and SDs were provided, the effect sizes of individual outcomes were calculated, and otherwise, a qualitative analysis was performed. Results: The search yielded 8 eligible studies involving 172 patients. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate to high. Five studies reported an increase in strength or better preservation of strength with NMES, with one study having a large effect size. Two studies found better preservation of muscle mass with NMES, with small to moderate effect sizes, while no significant benefits were found in two other studies. Conclusions: NMES added to usual care proved to be more effective than usual care alone for preventing skeletal-muscle weakness in critically ill patients. However, there is inconclusive evidence for its benefit in prevention of muscle wasting.

Depending on the duration of adaptation the shift is attractive (toward the adapter) or repulsive (away from the adapter). Mouse exhibits a salt-and-pepper cortical organization of orientation maps, hence this species may respond differently to adaptation. To examine this question, we determined the effect of twelve minutes of adaptation to one particular orientation on neuronal orientation tuning curves in V1 of anesthetized mice. Multi-unit activity of neurons in V1 was recorded in a conventional fashion. Cells were stimulated with sine-wave drifting gratings whose orientation tilted in steps. Results revealed that similarly to cats and monkeys, majority of cells shifted their optimal orientation in the direction of the adapter while a small proportion exhibited a repulsive shift. Moreover, initially untuned cells showing poor tuning curves reacted to adaptation by displaying sharp orientation selectivity. It seems that modification of the cellular property following adaptation is a general phenomenon observed in all mammals in spite of the different organization pattern of the visual cortex. This study is of pertinence to comprehend the mechanistic pathways of brain plasticity.

Repetition Suppression for Speech Processing in the Associative Occipital and Parietal Cortex of Congenitally Blind Adults	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; PERCEPTION; HUMANS; ACTIVATION; BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; RECOGNITION; REVEALS; MODELS; TASKS	In the congenitally blind (CB), sensory deprivation results in cross-modal plasticity, with visual cortical activity observed for various auditory tasks. This reorganization has been associated with enhanced auditory abilities and the recruitment of visual brain areas during sound and language processing. The questions we addressed are whether visual cortical activity might also be observed in CB during passive listening to auditory speech and whether cross-modal plasticity is associated with adaptive differences in neuronal populations compared to sighted individuals (SI). We focused on the neural substrate of vowel processing in CB and SI adults using a repetition suppression (RS) paradigm. RS has been associated with enhanced or accelerated neural processing efficiency and synchronous activity between interacting brain regions. We evaluated whether cortical areas in CB were sensitive to RS during repeated vowel processing and whether there were differences across the two groups. In accordance with previous studies, both groups displayed a RS effect in the posterior temporal cortex. In the blind, however, additional occipital, temporal and parietal cortical regions were associated with predictive processing of repeated vowel sounds. The findings suggest a more expanded role for cross-modal compensatory effects in blind persons during sound and speech processing and a functional transfer of specific adaptive properties across neural regions as a consequence of sensory deprivation at birth.

Steroidogenesis begins with the transport of the substrate, cholesterol, from intracellular stores into the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the steroidogenic enzyme CYP11A1 converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. This process is accelerated by hormones and involves a number of proteins and protein-protein interactions. Indeed, cholesterol, stored in lipid droplets and membranes, is transferred through a hormone-induced complex of proteins derived from the cytosol, mitochondria, and other organelles termed the transduceosome to the outer mitochondrial membrane. From there, cholesterol reaches CYP11A1 through outer/inner membrane contact sites. Thus, cholesterol transfer is likely achieved through a hormone-dependent reorganization of organelles and protein distribution and interactions. The findings reviewed herein suggest the presence of a hormone-dependent organelle communication network mediated by protein-protein interactions and inter-organelle trafficking, resulting in the efficient and timely delivery of cholesterol into mitochondria for steroid synthesis.

Levels of arousal that are abnormally high may result in inefficient use of internal energy stores and unfocused attention to salient environment stimuli. Alternatively, levels of arousal that are abnormally low may result in the inability to properly seek food, water, sexual partners, and other factors necessary for life. In the brain, neurons that express hypocretin neuropeptides may be uniquely posed to sense the external and internal state of the animal and tune arousal state according to behavioral needs. In recent years, we have applied temporally precise optigenetic techniques to study the role of these neurons and their downstream connections in regulating arousal. In particular, we have found that noradrenergic neurons in the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) are particularly important for mediating the effects of hypocretin neurons on arousal. Here, we discuss our recent results and consider the implications of the anatomical connectivity of these neurons in regulating the arousal state of an organism across various states of sleep and wakefulness.

J	Phan, HL; Pflieger, JF				Ha-Loan Phan; Pflieger, Jean-Francois			Immunolocalization of cation-chloride cotransporters in the developing and mature spinal cord of opossums, Monodelphis domestica	FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						cation-chlorideco transporters; development; inhibition; locomotion; marsupial; motoneurons; spinal cord	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LUMBOSACRAL ENLARGEMENTS; BRAZILIAN OPOSSUM; EXPRESSION; MOUSE; KCC2; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; NKCC1; RAT	Spinal inhibition is required to generate coordinated outputs between antagonistic muscles during locomotion. It relies on low neuronal chloride concentration set by two cation-chloride cotransporters, NKCC1 and KCC2 which, respectively, pumps Cl- in or out of neurons. It is generally accepted that NKCC1 is gradually inactivated during development, while KCC2 is upregulated and activated, resulting in low intracellular [Cl-]. Newborn opossums are very immature but perform rhythmic and alternate movements of the forelimbs to crawl on the mother's belly and attach to a teat. Their hindlimbs are immobile. The alternation of the forlimbs suggests that mechanisms allowing spinal inhibition are present at birth. We studied the anatomical basis of inhibition in the spinal enlargements of postnatal opossums by immunolocalizing NKCC1 and KCC2. In some specimens, motoneurons and sensory afferents were labeled with TRDA prior to immunolabeling. At birth, both NKCC1 and KCC2 are detected in the presumptive gray and white matter of the ventral and the intermediolateral cord of both enlargements, but are sparse in the dorsal horn, where KCC2 is mostly seen on a small bundle of dendrites along primary afferents. KCC2 labeling is bright and has a mesh-like appearance in the gray matter and a radial appearance in the white matter, whereas NKCC1 is the pale and diffuse. The subsequent expression of the cotransporters follows general ventrodorsal and mediolateral gradients, with the lumbar segments slightly lagging the cervical segments, until the mature pattern is observed around the 5th week. At all ages studied, KCC2 labeling is strong in the periphery of neurons. NKCC1 labeling decreases and becomes more uniformly distributed in the cells with age. Despite the significant anatomical and motor differences between the forelimbs and the hindlimbs of neonatal opossums, the maturation of KCC2 and NKCC1 is quite similar in both enlargements.

Rare exonic deletions implicate the synaptic organizer Gephyrin (GPHN) in risk for autism, schizophrenia and seizures	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							MOLYBDENUM COFACTOR DEFICIENCY; SCAFFOLDING PROTEIN SHANK3; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; COPY NUMBER VARIATION; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MENTAL-RETARDATION; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; CANDIDATE GENES	The GPHN gene codes for gephyrin, a key scaffolding protein in the neuronal postsynaptic membrane, responsible for the clustering and localization of glycine and GABA receptors at inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin has well-established functional links with several synaptic proteins that have been implicated in genetic risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia and epilepsy including the neuroligins (NLGN2, NLGN4), the neurexins (NRXN1, NRXN2, NRXN3) and collybistin (ARHGEF9). Moreover, temporal lobe epilepsy has been linked to abnormally spliced GPHN mRNA lacking exons encoding the G-domain of the gephyrin protein, potentially arising due to cellular stress associated with epileptogenesis such as temperature and alkalosis. Here, we present clinical and genomic characterization of six unrelated subjects, with a range of neurodevelopmental diagnoses including ASD, schizophrenia or seizures, who possess rare de novo or inherited hemizygous microdeletions overlapping exons of GPHN at chromosome 14q23.3. The region of common overlap across the deletions encompasses exons 35, corresponding to the G-domain of the gephyrin protein. These findings, together with previous reports of homozygous GPHN mutations in connection with autosomal recessive molybdenum cofactor deficiency, will aid in clinical genetic interpretation of the GPHN mutation spectrum. Our data also add to the accumulating evidence implicating neuronal synaptic gene products as key molecular factors underlying the etiologies of a diverse range of neurodevelopmental conditions.

Neuroanatomic overlap between intelligence and cognitive factors: Morphometry methods provide support for the key role of the frontal lobes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Intelligence; Cognition; Gray matter volume; Cortical surface area; Cortical thickness	CORTICAL SURFACE-AREA; WORKING-MEMORY; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; GRAY-MATTER; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN VOLUME; P-FIT; THICKNESS	Evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that intelligence differences may be supported by a parietofrontal network. Research shows that this network is also relevant for cognitive functions such as working memory and attention. However, previous studies have not explicitly analyzed the commonality of brain areas between a broad array of intelligence factors and cognitive functions tested in the same sample. Here fluid, crystallized, and spatial intelligence, along with working memory, executive updating, attention, and processing speed were each measured by three diverse tests or tasks. These twenty-one measures were completed by a group of one hundred and four healthy young adults. Three cortical measures (cortical gray matter volume, cortical surface area, and cortical thickness) were regressed against psychological latent scores obtained from a confirmatory factor analysis for removing test and task specific variance. For cortical gray matter volume and cortical surface area, the main overlapping clusters were observed in the middle frontal gyrus and involved fluid intelligence and working memory. Crystallized intelligence showed an overlapping cluster with fluid intelligence and working memory in the middle frontal gyrus. The inferior frontal gyrus showed overlap for crystallized intelligence, spatial intelligence, attention, and processing speed. The fusiform gyrus in temporal cortex showed overlap for spatial intelligence and attention. Parietal and occipital areas did not show any overlap across intelligence and cognitive factors. Taken together, these findings underscore that structural features of gray matter in the frontal lobes support those aspects of intelligence related to basic cognitive processes.

One such domain is the enhancement of local processing over global processing. While functional imaging studies of autism spectrum disorder have revealed differential neural patterns compared to controls in response to tests of local versus global processing, no studies have explored such effects in anorexia nervosa. This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with the embedded figures test, to explore the neural correlates of this enhanced attention to detail in the largest anorexia nervosa cohort to date. On the embedded figures tests participants are required to indicate which of two complex figures contains a simple geometrical shape. The findings indicate that whilst healthy controls showed greater accuracy on the task than people with anorexia nervosa, different brain regions were recruited. Healthy controls showed greater activation in the precuneus whilst people with anorexia nervosa showed greater activation in the fusiform gyrus. This suggests that different cognitive strategies were used to perform the task, i.e. healthy controls demonstrated greater emphasis on visuospatial searching and people with anorexia nervosa employed a more object recognition-based approach. This is in accordance with previous findings in autism spectrum disorder using a similar methodology and has implications for therapies addressing the appropriate adjustment of cognitive strategies in anorexia nervosa.

The role of musical training in emergent and event-based timing	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						music; timing; finger tapping; circle drawing; emergent timing; event-based timing	SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR CONTROL; MUSICIANS; MOVEMENTS; DISSOCIATION; COORDINATION; NONMUSICIANS; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTION; DISCRETE	Introduction: Musical performance is thought to rely predominantly on event-based timing involving a clock-like neural process and an explicit internal representation of the time interval. Some aspects of musical performance may rely on emergent timing, which is established through the optimization of movement kinematics, and can be maintained without reference to any explicit representation of the time interval. We predicted that musical training would have its largest effect on event-based timing, supporting the dissociability of these timing processes and the dominance of event-based timing in musical performance. Materials and Methods: We compared 22 musicians and 17 non-musicians on the prototypical event-based timing task of finger tapping and on the typically emergently timed task of circle drawing. For each task, participants first responded in synchrony with a metronome (Paced) and then responded at the same rate without the metronome (Unpaced). Results: Analyses of the Unpaced phase revealed that non-musicians were more variable in their inter-response intervals for finger tapping compared to circle drawing. Musicians did not differ between the two tasks. Between groups, non-musicians were more variable than musicians for tapping but no for drawing. We were able to show that the differences were due to less timer variability in musicians on the tapping task. Correlational analyses of movement jerk and inter-response interval variability revealed a negative association for tapping and a positive association for drawing in non-musicians only. Discussion: These results suggest that musical training affects temporal variability in tapping but not drawing. Additionally, musicians and non-musicians may be employing different movement strategies to maintain accurate timing in the two tasks. These findings add to our understanding of how musical training affects timing and support the dissociability of event-based and emergent timing modes.	[Baer, L. H.; Thibodeau, J. L. N.; Gralnick, T.

Relative performances of artificial neural network and regression mapping tools in evaluation of spinal loads and muscle forces during static lifting	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Static lifting; Muscle forces; Spine loads; Models; Regression; Artificial neural networks	LOW-BACK-PAIN; TRUNK BIOMECHANICAL MODELS; LUMBAR SPINE; PREDICTIVE EQUATIONS; JOINT TORQUES; IN-VIVO; TASKS; STABILITY; COMPRESSION; POSTURE	Two artificial neural networks (ANNs) are constructed, trained, and tested to map inputs of a complex trunk finite element (FE) model to its outputs for spinal loads and muscle forces. Five input variables (thorax flexion angle, load magnitude, its anterior and lateral positions, load handling technique, i.e., one- or two-handed static lifting) and four model outputs (L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc compression and anterior-posterior shear forces) for spinal loads and 76 model outputs (forces in individual trunk muscles) are considered. Moreover, full quadratic regression equations mapping input-outputs of the model developed here for muscle forces and previously for spine loads are used to compare the relative accuracy of these two mapping tools (ANN and regression equations). Results indicate that the ANNs are more accurate in mapping input-output relationships of the FE model (RMSE= 20.7 N for spinal loads and RMSE= 4.7 N for muscle forces) as compared to regression equations (RMSE= 120.4 N for spinal loads and RMSE=43.2 N for muscle forces). Quadratic regression equations map up to second order variations of outputs with inputs while ANNs capture higher order variations too. Despite satisfactory achievement in estimating overall muscle forces by the ANN, some inadequacies are noted including assigning force to antagonistic muscles with no activity in the optimization algorithm of the FE model or predicting slightly different forces in bilateral pair muscles in symmetric lifting activities. Using these user-friendly tools spine loads and trunk muscle forces during symmetric and asymmetric static lifts can be easily estimated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The molecular basis of transient outward current (I-to) in Purkinje fibers (PFs) is poorly understood. We hypothesized that DPP6 contributes to PF I-to and that its overexpression might specifically alter PF I-to properties and repolarization. Objective: To assess the potential role of DPP6 in PF I-to. Methods and Results: Clinical data in 5 idiopathic ventricular fibrillation patients suggested arrhythmia origin in the PF-conducting system. PF and ventricular muscle I-to had similar density, but PF I-to differed from ventricular muscle in having tetraethylammonium sensitivity and slower recovery. DPP6 overexpression significantly increased, whereas DPP6 knockdown reduced, I-to density and tetraethylammonium sensitivity in canine PF but not in ventricular muscle cells. The K+-channel interacting beta-subunit K+-channel interacting protein type-2, essential for normal expression of I-to in ventricular muscle, was weakly expressed in human PFs, whereas DPP6 and frequenin (neuronal calcium sensor-1) were enriched. Heterologous expression of Kv4.3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced small I-to; I-to amplitude was greatly enhanced by coexpression with K+-channel interacting protein type-2 or DPP6. Coexpression of DPP6 with Kv4.3 and K+-channel interacting protein type-2 failed to alter I-to compared with Kv4.3/K+-channel interacting protein type-2 alone, but DPP6 expression with Kv4.3 and neuronal calcium sensor-1 (to mimic PF I-to composition) greatly enhanced I-to compared with Kv4.3/neuronal calcium sensor-1 and recapitulated characteristic PF kinetic/pharmacological properties. A mathematical model of cardiac PF action potentials showed that I-to enhancement can greatly accelerate PF repolarization. Conclusions: These results point to a previously unknown central role of DPP6 in PF I-to, with DPP6 gain of function selectively enhancing PF current, and suggest that a DPP6-mediated PF early-repolarization syndrome might be a novel molecular paradigm for some forms of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.

However, it remains incompletely known which synaptic mechanisms contribute to the process of synchronization. Here, we investigated whether NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity was an important player in synchronization between septal and temporal CA3 areas of the rat hippocampus. We found that both the septal and temporal CA3 regions intrinsically generate weakly synchronized delta frequency oscillations in the complete hippocampus in vitro. Septal and temporal oscillators differed in frequency, power, and rhythmicity, but both required GABA(A) and AMPA receptors. NMDA receptor activation, and most particularly the NR2B subunit, contributed considerably more to rhythm generation at the temporal than the septal region. Brief activation of NMDA receptors by application of extracellular calcium dramatically potentiated the septal-temporal coherence for long durations (>40 min), an effect blocked by the NMDA antagonist AP-5. This long-lasting NMDA-receptor-dependent increase in coherence was also associated with an elevated phase locking of spikes locally and across regions. Changes in coherence between oscillators were associated with increases in phase locking between oscillators independent of oscillator amplitude. Finally, although the septal CA3 rhythm preceded the oscillations in temporal regions in control conditions, this was reversed during the NMDA-dependent enhancement in coherence, suggesting that NMDA receptor activation can change the direction of information flow along the septotemporal CA3 axis. These data demonstrate that plastic changes in communication between septal and temporal hippocampal regions can arise from the NMDA-dependent phase locking of neural oscillators.

Here we explore the circuitry associated with the hippocampus using the pseudorabies virus-Bartha strain (PRV-Bartha) tracer in the rat to examine both direct (first-order) and indirect (second-order) projections to the hippocampus. Based on analysis of PRV-Bartha infection density, we demonstrate two parallel pathways from the limbic cortex to the hippocampus. A dorsal "spatial cognition" pathway provides disynaptic input from the retrosplenial, anterior cingulate, and orbital cortex to the dorsal hippocampus, with potential synaptic relays in the anterior thalamic nuclei and dorsolateral entorhinal cortex. A ventral "executive control" pathway provides disynaptic input from the prelimbic, infralimbic, and orbital cortex to the ventral hippocampus, with potential synaptic relays in the midline thalamic nuclei and the rostral caudo-medial entorhinal cortex. These data suggest a new anatomical framework for understanding the functional interactions between the cortex and hippocampus, especially in cognitive disorders that involve both structures, such as frontotemporal dementia.

The present study aims at identifying the cellular distribution and potentially detrimental role of B1R on cognitive and cerebrovascular functions in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe,Ind), line J20) were treated with a selective and brain penetrant B1R antagonist (SSR240612, 10 mg/kg/day for 5 or 10 weeks) or vehicle. The impact of B1R blockade was measured on i) spatial learning and memory performance in the Morris water maze, ii) cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses to sensory stimulation using laser Doppler flowmetry, and iii) reactivity of isolated cerebral arteries using online videomicroscopy. A beta burden was quantified by ELISA and immunostaining, while other AD landmarks were measured by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: B1R protein levels were increased in APP mouse hippocampus and, prominently, in reactive astrocytes surrounding A beta plaques. In APP mice, B1R antagonism with SSR240612 improved spatial learning, memory and normalized protein levels of the memory-related early gene Egr-1 in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. B1R antagonism restored sensory-evoked CBF responses, endothelium-dependent dilations, and normalized cerebrovascular protein levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and B2R. In addition, SSR240612 reduced (approximately 50%) microglial, but not astroglial, activation, brain levels of soluble A beta(1-42), diffuse and dense-core A beta plaques, and it increased protein levels of the A beta brain efflux transporter lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 in cerebral microvessels. Conclusion: These findings show a selective upregulation of astroglial B1R in the APP mouse brain, and the capacity of the B1R antagonist to abrogate amyloidosis, cerebrovascular and memory deficits. Collectively, these findings provide convincing evidence for a role of B1R in AD pathogenesis.

VLPs are composed of viral antigens but lack nucleic acids making them non-infectious which limit the risk of recombination with wild-type strains. By taking advantage of the advancements in cell culture technologies, the process from strain identification to manufacturing has the potential to be completed rapidly and easily at large scales. After closely reviewing the current research done on influenza VLPs, it is evident that the development of quantification methods has been consistently overlooked. VLP quantification at all stages of the production process has been left to rely on current influenza quantification methods (i.e. Hemagglutination assay (HA), Single Radial Immunodiffusion assay (SRID), NA enzymatic activity assays, Western blot, Electron Microscopy). These are analytical methods developed decades ago for influenza virions and final bulk influenza vaccines. Although these methods are time-consuming and cumbersome they have been sufficient for the characterization of final purified material. Nevertheless, these analytical methods are impractical for in-line process monitoring because VLP concentration in crude samples generally falls out of the range of detection for these methods. This consequently impedes the development of robust influenza-VLP production and purification processes. Thus, development of functional process analytical techniques, applicable at every stage during production, that are compatible with different production platforms is in great need to assess, optimize and exploit the full potential of novel manufacturing platforms.

Given evidence that a live-attenuated varicella-zoster-virus vaccine is effective at reducing the incidence of HZ, PHN and the burden of illness, policymakers and clinicians are being asked to make recommendations regarding the use of the zoster vaccine. In this report, we summarize the evidence regarding the: (1) burden of illness; (2) vaccine efficacy and safety; and (3) cost-effectiveness of vaccination, to assist evidence-based policy making and guide clinicians in their recommendations. First, there is general agreement that the overall burden of illness associated with HZ and PHN is substantial. Second, the safety and efficacy of the zoster vaccine at reducing the burden of illness due to HZ and the incidence of PHN have been clearly demonstrated in large placebo-controlled trials. However, uncertainty remains about the vaccine's duration of protection. Third, vaccination against HZ is likely to be cost-effective when the vaccine is given at approximately 65 y of age, if vaccine duration is longer than 10 y.

IGFBP-4 Anti-Angiogenic and Anti-Tumorigenic Effects Are Associated with Anti-Cathepsin B Activity	NEOPLASIA			English	Article							FACTOR-BINDING-PROTEINS; HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS; GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; GLIOMA PROGRESSION; CYSTEINE PROTEASES; GENE-EXPRESSION; TUBE FORMATION; BRAIN-TUMORS; HEK293 CELLS	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP-4/IBP-4) has potent IGF-independent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic effects. In this study, we demonstrated that these activities are located in the IGFBP-4 C-terminal protein fragment (CIBP-4), a region containing a thyroglobulin type 1 (Tg1) domain. Proteins bearing Tg1 domains have been shown to inhibit cathepsins, lysosomal enzymes involved in basement membrane degradation and implicated in tumor invasion and angiogenesis. In our studies, CIBP-4 was shown to internalize and co-localize with lysosomal-like structures in both endothelial cells (ECs) and glioblastoma U87MG cells. CIBP-4 also inhibited both growth factor-induced EC tubulogenesis in Matrigel and the concomitant increases in intracellular cathepsin B (CatB) activity. In vitro assays confirmed CIBP-4 capacity to block recombinant CatB activity. Biodistribution analysis of intravenously injected CIBP-4-Cy5.5 in a glioblastoma tumor xenograft model indicated targeted accumulation of CIBP-4 in tumors. Most importantly, CIBP-4 reduced tumor growth in this animal model by 60%. Pleiotropic anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic activities of CIBP-4 most likely underlie its observed therapeutic potential against glioblastoma.

OBJECTIVES: To present the evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, management and patient trajectory of individuals with FM. METHODS: A needs assessment following consultation with diverse health care professionals identified questions pertinent to various aspects of FM. A literature search identified the evidence available to address these questions; evidence was graded according to the standards of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Drafted recommendations were appraised by an advisory panel to reflect meaningful clinical practice. RESULTS: The present recommendations incorporate the new clinical concepts of FM as a clinical construct without any defining physical abnormality or biological marker, characterized by fluctuating, diffuse body pain and the frequent symptoms of sleep disturbance, fatigue, mood and cognitive changes. In the absence of a defining cause or cure, treatment objectives should be patient-tailored and symptom-based, aimed at reducing global complaints and enhancing function. Healthy lifestyle practices with active patient participation in health care forms the cornerstone of care. Multimodal management may include nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies, although it must be acknowledged that pharmacological treatments provide only modest benefit. Maintenance of function and retention in the workforce is encouraged. CONCLUSIONS: The new Canadian guidelines for the treatment of FM should provide health professionals with confidence in the complete care of these patients and improve clinical outcomes.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Visual evoked potentials; Sex difference; Contrast; Color; Motion; Children	MOTION-ONSET VEPS; GENDER DIFFERENCES; HEAD SIZE; PATTERN; LATENCY; BRAIN; WOMEN; FMRI; POPULATION; ACTIVATION	Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are known to be influenced by several biological variables, including sex. In adult populations studies using conventional high-contrast checkerboard have shown that females display larger amplitudes and shorter latencies than males. To date, few studies have been conducted in children; the available data suggests that girls display significantly larger amplitudes than boys but the effect on latency is absent or negligible. We investigated sex-related VEP differences in 149 school-age (11.3 +/- 0.6 years) children from Northern Quebec using several VEP protocols: achromatic pattern-reversal VEPs at high (95%) and low contrast (30%, 12% and 4%), as well as motion-onset VEPs and isoluminant pattern-reversal VEPs. Girls showed significantly larger amplitudes in achromatic VEPs for most of the contrast levels as well as in N2 response to motion-onset. No significant difference was found regarding the amplitude of isoluminant VEPs. In addition, girls showed shorter latencies for the achromatic N75 and a trend (p < 0.1) for the P100, regardless of the contrast level. Interestingly, this latency effect appeared mostly due to head size, not sex. No differences in latency were found for motion or isoluminant responses. Overall, these findings show that sex-related differences are present in children mostly in VEP amplitude not only for high contrast achromatic pattern-reversal but also for low contrast levels and motion-onset VEPs, suggesting that sex affects VEP responses in a general fashion.

The aim is to study the diagnostic value of Calretinin in total colonic aganglionosis (TA), prematurity, and superficial biopsy when nerve hyperplasia may not be accessed by ACE activity. Methods: Records of patients diagnosed with HD at our institution from 1985 to 2010 were studied and patients with TA identified. We examined tissue samples from those TA, partial colectomies for HD, biopsies for suspicion of HD, and rectal tissue from aborted fetuses. Immunohistochemical analysis of Calretinin was compared with ACE gold standard method in all cases. Results: In the majority of the cases, the diagnosis was ascertained by ACE activity and Calretinin staining. However, in 9 cases, the diagnosis was possible with Calretinin staining but not with ACE: in 4 TA because of the absence of nerve hyperplasia, and in 5 cases because the biopsies were too superficial to examine the nerve hyperplasia. In addition, Calretinin was expressed in the gut as early as 22 gestational weeks. Conclusion: The use of Calretinin staining may be superior to ACE activity, particularly in the context of TA, superficial biopsies, and prematurity, allowing earlier diagnosis.

Data from eight studies examining 579 exposed and 433 reference participants were included, 28 performance variables analyzed. The performance scores were adjusted for well-known individual-level covariates; the influence of possible, but unknown study-level covariates was attenuated by means of a z-normalization. Associations between performance and exposure were estimated by ANOVAs and ANCOVAs, the latter representing multi-level models. Four cognitive and motor performance variables each indicated significantly lower performances of exposed individuals when confounding was considered; slowed motor performances and deficits in attention and short-term memory were found. Performance on a single test was significantly related to the biomarker manganese in blood. The outcomes on susceptibility were weak. The slowing of responses was the most distinct feature of performances of exposed workers. It remains unclear, whether this result is related to the employed tests or provides important information about early stages of the neurotoxic impairment. More specific cognitive tests need to be employed to answer this question. The lack of dose-response relationships was related to features of the biomarker: it does not reflect the Mn in brain responsible for changes in performances. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A neuroanatomical and neurochemical study of the indusium griseum and anterior hippocampal continuation: Comparison with dentate gyrus	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						Antibody; Afferent projection; Nerve terminal; Lamination; Neurotransmitter	AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ADULT-RAT; NEURONS; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; PARVALBUMIN; HYDROXYLASE; PROJECTION	The indusium griseum (IG) and anterior hippocampal continuation (AHC) are longitudinal and continuous structures that consist of two narrow strips of gray matter overlying the rostrocaudal length of the corpus callosum, extending rostrally to the genu of the corpus callosum and ventrally to the rostrum. The present study aimed to characterize the phenotype of neuronal innervations to the IG-AHC and their intra-structural topographic organization. Using immunohistochemistry, we found nerve fibers expressing choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, the serotonin reuptake transporter as well as glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 and parvalbumin. These suggest that the IG and AHC are innervated by acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine and GABA neurons. More importantly, all these fibers display a topographic laminar distribution in both brain areas. The presence of varicosities along the nerve fibers suggests that these neurotransmitters are released extracellullarly to exert a physiological action. Finally, the structural similarities with the dentate gyrus support the idea that the IC and AHC are anatomically associated, if not continuous, with this area and may represent in mammals a vestige of the hippocampus.

The molecular composition and accessibility of EVs in biofluids open unprecedented diagnostic opportunities in malignancies where tumour tissue is difficult to sample, especially in primary and metastatic brain tumours. The ongoing genetic discovery of driver mutations defines the ever increasing numbers of distinct molecular subtypes of brain tumours (orphan diseases), a complexity that may soon be translated into alterations in functional proteins and their oncogenic networks. This may likely be extended to real time changes engendered by the disease progression, tumour heterogeneity, inter-individual variations and therapeutic responses. Meeting these challenges through EV analysis is dependent on technological progress in such areas as generation of mutation- and phospho-specific antibodies, antibody array platforms, nanotechnology, microfluidics, NMR spectroscopy, MS and MRM approaches of quantitative proteomics, which should not be underestimated. Still, vesiculation emerges as a unique process that could be harnessed for the benefit of more individualised patient care.

The discovery of several ALS genes strongly linked to RNA biology, the proteasome pathway, and axonal transport suggest they have an important role in pathogenesis, but the immense complexity of these processes is also apparent. The increasing rate of genetic discoveries brings the hope of designing more targeted and efficacious therapies.

Anatomical data with magnetic resonance imaging have characterized specific alterations in grey and white matter and their potential implications on disease severity. Functional neuroimaging studies have described changes in brain perfusion or glucose metabolism during resting wakefulness, as well as brain responses to emotional stimulation in narcoleptic patients. These different imaging modalities provide evidence for structural and functional abnormalities compatible with a deficit in the hypocretinergic system. They also indicate the involvement of other neural structures, such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, midbrain, thalamus, hippocampus, and frontotemporal cortical areas. This article reviews the contribution of neuroimaging to the pathophysiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy, focusing on the most recent developments.

Loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1 sensitizes peripheral axons to degeneration in a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease	DISEASE MODELS & MECHANISMS			English	Article							PROTEIN-DEGRADATION; TSG101 PROTEIN; NEUROPATHY; MUTATIONS; EXPRESSION; MICE; GENE; NEURODEGENERATION; LOCALIZATION; PROGRESSION	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by peripheral axon degeneration with subsequent motor and sensory deficits. Several CMT gene products function in endosomal sorting and trafficking to the lysosome, suggesting that defects in this cellular pathway might present a common pathogenic mechanism for these conditions. LRSAM1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is implicated in this process, and mutations in LRSAM1 have recently been shown to cause CMT. We have generated mouse mutations in Lrsam1 to create an animal model of this form of CMT (CMT2P). Mouse Lrsam1 is abundantly expressed in the motor and sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Both homozygous and heterozygous mice have largely normal neuromuscular performance and only a very mild neuropathy phenotype with age. However, Lrsam1 mutant mice are more sensitive to challenge with acrylamide, a neurotoxic agent that causes axon degeneration, indicating that the axons in the mutant mice are indeed compromised. In transfected cells, LRSAM1 primarily localizes in a perinuclear compartment immediately beyond the Golgi and shows little colocalization with components of the endosome to lysosome trafficking pathway, suggesting that other cellular mechanisms also merit consideration.

To better characterize it, the normal esophageal motility is briefly reviewed with emphasis on the specific defects in EA. Multiple studies attempted to describe the dysmotility seen in patients with operated EA using esophageal manometry. Recently, high-resolution manometry has improved our understanding of normal esophageal motility. Using this new technology, it is now possible to better characterize the esophageal motility of patients operated on for EA. Three different patterns are described and presented: aperistalsis, pressurization, and distal peristalsis. Up to now, it has not been possible to find a correlation between the dysmotility severity and the patient's symptomatology. Different pathophysiological hypotheses of esophageal dysmotility in that population are discussed. Developmental neuronal defects are certainly present from the beginning. Surgical trauma can also contribute to the dysmotility. Finally, defective esophageal acid clearance capacity is a cause of gastroesophageal reflux disease, but the resultant esophagitis can also impair the normal esophageal function. The evolution of esophageal dysmotility in patients with repaired EA is not known and further studies will be necessary to clarify it.

Methamphetamine use: A comprehensive review of molecular, preclinical and clinical findings	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Review						Addiction; Cognitive impairment; Drugs of abuse; Methamphetamine; Neurotoxicity; Psychostimulant	VESICULAR MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER-2; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ESCALATING-DOSE SCHEDULE; ABSTINENT METHAMPHETAMINE; D-AMPHETAMINE; DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS; PSYCHIATRIC-SYMPTOMS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOUBLE-BLIND	Methamphetamine (MA) is a highly addictive psychostimulant drug that principally affects the monoamine neurotransmitter systems of the brain and results in feelings of alertness, increased energy and euphoria. The drug is particularly popular with young adults, due to its wide availability, relatively low cost, and long duration of psychoactive effects. Extended use of MA is associated with many health problems that are not limited to the central nervous system, and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in drug users. Numerous studies, using complementary techniques, have provided evidence that chronic MA use is associated with substantial neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment. These pathological effects of the drug, combined with the addictive properties of MA, contribute to a spectrum of psychosocial issues that include medical and legal problems, at-risk behaviors and high societal costs, such as public health consequences, loss of family support and housing instability. Treatment options include pharmacological, psychological or combination therapies. The present review summarizes the key findings in the literature spanning from molecular through to clinical effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, our ability to redefine Parkinson's disease is hampered by its complexity and heterogeneity in genetics, phenotypes, and underlying molecular mechanisms; the absence of biochemical markers or ability to image Parkinson's disease-specific histopathological changes; the long prodromal period during which non-motor manifestations might precede classic motor manifestations; and uncertainty about the status of disorders diagnosed clinically as Parkinson's disease but without Lewy pathology. Although it is too early to confidently redefine Parkinson's disease, the time has come to establish a research framework that could lead to new diagnostic criteria. We propose the establishment of three tiers encompassing clinical features, pathological findings, and genetics or molecular mechanisms. Specific advances in each tier, bridged by neuroimaging and biochemical data, will eventually lead to a redefinition of Parkinson's disease.

METHODS: This was a prospective, comparative, crossover study with 14 unsedated subjects undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation in the medical ICU of Hopital du Sacre-Gem, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The subjects were ventilated alternately in neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) modes. Inspiratory flow/time and pressure/time waveforms and diaphragmatic electrical activity were used to detect central apneas. Ventilatory variability and breathing pattern were evaluated in both modes. Breathing patterns just before central apneas, and associations between apneas and sleep patterns (electroencephalogram) were studied. RESULTS: Switching from PSV to NAVA did not change mean minute ventilation, tidal volume, or breathing frequency. However, tidal volume variability, defined as the coefficient of variability (standard error/mean), was significantly greater with NAVA than with PSV (17.2 +/- 2.8 vs 10.3 +/- 4, P = .045). NAVA induced a greater decrease in central apneas, compared to PSV (to 0 with NAVA vs 10.5 +/- 11 with PSV, P = .005). Central apneas during PSV were detected only during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. CONCLUSIONS: NAVA was associated with increased ventilatory variability, compared to constant-level PSV. With NAVA the absence of over-assistance during sleep coincided with absence of central apneas, suggesting that load capacity and/or neuromechanical coupling were improved by NAVA and that this improvement decreased or abolished central apneas.

A Neural Network-Based Multiplicative Actuator Fault Detection and Isolation of Nonlinear Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Fault detection and isolation; multiplicative actuator faults; nonlinear systems; recurrent neural networks	UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS; DIAGNOSIS; MANIPULATORS; SATELLITES; OBSERVER; SENSOR	The problem of fault detection and isolation/identification (FDI) of nonlinear systems using neural networks is considered in this paper. The proposed FDI approach employs recurrent neural network-based observers for simultaneously detecting, isolating and identifying the severity of actuator faults in presence of disturbances and uncertainties in the model and sensory measurements. The neural network weights are updated based on a modified dynamic backpropagation scheme. The proposed FDI scheme does not rely on the availability of full state measurements. Inmost works in the literature the fault function acts as an additive term on the actuator, whereas in this work the fault acts as a multiplicative term. This will make the formal stability and convergence analysis of the overall FDI scheme nontrivial and challenging. Our stability analysis considers the presence of plant and sensor uncertainties through the use of Lyapunov's direct method with no restrictive assumptions on the system and/or the FDI algorithm. The performance of our proposed FDI approach is evaluated through simulations that are performed for two case studies, namely FDI of 1) reaction wheel type actuators that are commonly utilized in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite and 2) actuators in a two-link flexible joint manipulator.

Attacks are more often reported in spring and summer, but there are many variations, mainly as to summer peaks. This paper, an MSBase collaboration substudy, reports multiple series of relapses from 1980 to 2010, comparing ultradecennal trends of seasonal frequency of attacks in different countries. The MSBase international database was searched for relapses in series recording patient histories from 1980 up to 2010. The number of relapses by month was stratified by decade (1981-1990, 1991-2000, 2001-2010). Positive spring versus summer peaks were compared by odds ratios; different series were compared by weighted odds ratio (Peto OR). Decade comparison of the 1990s versus 2000s shows inversion of spring-summer peak (2000s = March; 1990s = July), significant in the whole group (Peto odds ratio = 1.31, CI = 1.10-1.56, p = 0.003) and in Salerno series (OR = 1.97, CI = 1.14-1.40). The global significance persisted also excluding Salerno series (Peto odds ratio = 1.25, CI = 1.04-1.50, p = 0.002). Multicentric data confirm a summer peak of relapses in the 1991-2000 decade, significantly different from the spring peak of 2001-2010. Seasonal frequency of relapses shows long-term variations, so that other factors such as viral epidemics might have more relevance than ultraviolet exposure.

More recently, differences in promoter DNA methylation between suicide completers and comparison subjects in specific genes have been associated with these changes in gene expression patterns, implicating DNA methylation alterations as a plausible component of the pathophysiology of suicide. The authors used a genome-wide approach to investigate the extent of DNA methylation alterations in the brains of suicide completers. Method: Promoter DNA methylation was profiled using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) followed by microarray hybridization in hippocampal tissue from 62 men (46 suicide completers and 16 comparison subjects). The correlation between promoter methylation and expression was investigated by comparing the MeDIP data with gene expression profiles generated through mRNA microarray. Methylation differences between groups were validated on neuronal and nonneuronal DNA fractions isolated by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting. Results: The authors identified 366 promoters that were differentially methylated in suicide completers relative to comparison subjects (273 hypermethylated and 93 hypomethylated). Overall, promoter methylation differences were inversely correlated with gene expression differences. Functional annotation analyses revealed an enrichment of differential methylation in the promoters of genes involved, among other functions, in cognitive processes. Validation was performed on the top genes from this category, and these differences were found to occur mainly in the neuronal cell fraction. Conclusions: These results suggest broad reprogramming of promoter DNA methylation patterns in the hippocampus of suicide completers. This may help explain gene expression alterations associated with suicide and possibly behavioral changes increasing suicide risk.

Method: This was achieved by administrating a manipulation task and a divided attention task using functional magnetic resonance imaging to 24 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 14 healthy controls matched for age, sex and education. The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale was used to divide persons with MCI into those with better and worse cognitive performances. Results: Both tasks were associated with more brain activation in the MCI group with higher cognition than in healthy controls, particularly in the left frontal areas. Correlational analyses indicated that greater activation in a frontostriatal network hyperactivated by the higher-cognition group was related with better task performance, suggesting that these activations may support functional reorganization of a compensatory nature. By contrast, the lower-cognition group failed to show greater cerebral hyperactivation than controls during the divided attention task and, during the manipulation task, and showed less brain activation than controls in the left ventrolateral cortex, a region commonly hypoactivated in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: These findings indicate that, during the early phase of MCI, executive functioning benefits from neural reorganization, but that a breakdown of this brain plasticity characterizes the late stages of MCI.

However, little is known about common brain systems that support the processing and integration of extended, naturalistic real-world' music stimuli. We examined this question by presenting extended excerpts of symphonic music, and two pseudomusical stimuli in which the temporal and spectral structure of the Natural Music condition were disrupted, to non-musician participants undergoing functional brain imaging and analysing synchronized spatiotemporal activity patterns between listeners. We found that music synchronizes brain responses across listeners in bilateral auditory midbrain and thalamus, primary auditory and auditory association cortex, right-lateralized structures in frontal and parietal cortex, and motor planning regions of the brain. These effects were greater for natural music compared to the pseudo-musical control conditions. Remarkably, inter-subject synchronization in the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate nucleus was also greater for the natural music condition, indicating that synchronization at these early stages of auditory processing is not simply driven by spectro-temporal features of the stimulus. Increased synchronization during music listening was also evident in a right-hemisphere fronto-parietal attention network and bilateral cortical regions involved in motor planning. While these brain structures have previously been implicated in various aspects of musical processing, our results are the first to show that these regions track structural elements of a musical stimulus over extended time periods lasting minutes. Our results show that a hierarchical distributed network is synchronized between individuals during the processing of extended musical sequences, and provide new insight into the temporal integration of complex and biologically salient auditory sequences.

They thus reveal abnormal semantic activations. To start testing whether antipsychotics act by reducing abnormal semantic activations we focused on the N400 event-related brain potential, which is elicited by meaningful stimuli, such as words, and whose distribution on the scalp is known to depend on the semantic category of these stimuli. We used a semantic-categorization task specially designed to reduce the impact of the variations of context processing across subjects' groups and a classical oddball task as a control. Healthy subjects were recruited rather than psychotic patients to ensure that the medication effects could not be secondary to a reduction of symptoms. These participants (n=47) were tested in a double-blind cross-over paradigm where the ERP effects of 2.5 mg of olanzapine taken on the eve of the testing were compared to those of the placebo. The amplitudes of the N400s elicited by the target words were greater at anterior scalp sites in the half of the subjects having higher schizotypal scores. Olanzapine reduced these larger N400s and had no effect on the small anterior N400s of the half of the subjects with lower scores. These results are discussed as consistent with the idea that antipsychotics reduce abnormal activations of particular semantic representations. Further studies should thus be done to see if this reduction correlates with and predicts the decrease of psychotic symptoms in patients. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of breast cancer subtype to the time interval from primary diagnosis (PD) to development of BM (TPDBM), number of BM at initial BM presentation and survival. We analyzed our previously described multi-institutional retrospective database of 865 breast cancer patients treated for newly-diagnosed BM from 1993 to 2010. Several factors found to be associated with survival were incorporated into the Breast-GPA, including tumor subtype. The GPA database was further analyzed to determine if the subtype correlated with the TPDBM, number of BM, and survival from PD. After exclusions for incomplete data, 383 patients remained eligible for analysis. The subtypes were approximated as follows: Luminal B: triple positive; HER2: HER2 positive/ER/PR negative; Luminal A; ER/PR positive/HER2 negative; Basal: triple negative. Patients with Basal (90), HER2 (119), Luminal B (98) and Luminal A (76) tumor subtypes had a median TPDBM of 27.5, 35.8, 47.4 and 54.4 months (p < 0.01), median survival from PD of 39.6, 66.4, 90.3 and 72.7 months (p < 0.01) and median survival from BM of 7.3, 17.9, 22.9 and 10.0 months (p < 0.01), respectively. Tumor subtype is an important prognostic factor for survival in patients with breast cancer and BM. Although TPDBM is not an independent prognostic factor for survival (and thus not part of the Breast-GPA), the TPDBM does correlate with tumor subtype but does not correlate with the number of BM. Patients with Basal and HER2 tumor subtypes have short TPDBM. Prospective studies are needed to determine if screening brain MRIs are indicated in patients with Basal or HER2 subtypes.

This study aimed to examine social function at 6 months post-TBI and to explore the contribution of injury, cognitive, and environmental influences. The sample included 136 children, 93 survivors of TBI, and 43 healthy controls. TBI participants were recruited on admission and underwent magnetic resonance imaging scan within 8 weeks of injury and behavioral assessment at 6 months post-injury. Healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans and behavioral assessment on recruitment. Assessment included parent and child questionnaires tapping social outcome and child-direct testing of cognitive abilities important for social competence (communication, attention/executive function, social cognition). Injury characteristics and environmental measures were collected. At 6-months post-injury, social problems were evident, but not global. Social participation appeared most vulnerable, with more severe injuries leading to greater problems. Greater injury severity and poorer communication skills were associated with poorer social adjustment and social participation, with the impact of family function also significant. Processing speed, younger age, and male gender also contributed to social outcomes. Further follow-up is required to track the recovery of social skills and the changing influences of cognition, brain, and environment over time.

Degeneration of the lateral corticospinal tract (CST) is a key finding in ALS cervical spinal cord autopsies. We hypothesized that in vivo ultra-high-field MRI of the cervical spinal cord can detect abnormality in the CST. Methods: A patient with ALS (disease duration 23 months) and a healthy control were scanned at 7-T MRI using a 19-channel coil. Multi-echo T2*-weighted imaging was performed in the spinal cord, covering C2C6. Cross-sectional resolution was 0.37 x 0.37 mm2. Results: We detected clear signal hyperintensity in both segments of the lateral CST in the ALS patient, which was significant when compared with the normal control subject (P < 107). Conclusion: We believe there are potential benefits of 7-T MRI for increased sensitivity and spatial accuracy in characterizing pathology in the spinal cord.

A Randomized Comparison Between Bifurcation and Prebifurcation Subparaneural Popliteal Sciatic Nerve Blocks	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							LOCAL-ANESTHETIC SPREAD; ULTRASOUND; INJECTION; SHEATH; FOSSA	BACKGROUND: In this prospective, randomized, observer-blinded trial, we compared ultrasound-guided subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve blocks performed either at or proximal to the neural bifurcation (B). We hypothesized that the total anesthesia-related time (sum of performance and onset times) would be decreased with the prebifurcation (PB) technique. METHODS: Ultrasound-guided posterior popliteal sciatic nerve block was performed in 68 patients. All subjects received an identical volume (30 mL) and mix of local anesthetic agent (1% Iidocaine-0.25% bupivacaine-5 mu g/mL epinephrine). In the PB group, the local anesthetic solution was deposited at the level of the common sciatic trunk, just distal to the intersection between its circular and elliptical sonographic appearances, inside the paraneural sheath. In the B group, the injection was performed inside the sheath between the tibial and peroneal divisions. A blinded observer recorded the success rate (complete tibial and peroneal sensory block at 30 minutes) and onset time. The performance time, number of needle passes, and adverse events (paresthesia, neural edema) were also recorded. All subjects were contacted 7 days after the surgery to enquire about the presence of persistent numbness or motor deficit. RESULTS: Both techniques resulted in comparable success rates (85%-88%; 95% confidence interval [Cl] of the intergroup difference, -14% to 19%) and required similar performance times (8.1 minutes; 95% Cl of the difference, -1.65 to 1.71 minutes), onset times (15.0-17.7 minutes; 95% Cl of the difference, -7.65 to 2.31 minutes), and total anesthesia-related times (23.4-26.0 minutes; 95% Cl of the difference, -7.83 to 2.74 minutes). The number of needle passes and incidence of paresthesia (25%-34%) were also similar between the 2 groups. Sonographic neural swelling was detected in 2 and 3 subjects in the PB and B groups, respectively. In all 5 cases, the needle was carefully withdrawn and the injection completed uneventfully. Patient follow-up 1 week after the surgery revealed 2 patients with residual numbness. In both instances, the latter had resolved by 1 month. CONCLUSION: When local anesthetic is injected inside the paraneural sheath, B and PB posterior popliteal sciatic nerve blocks result in comparable success and total anesthesia-related times. However, in light of the 95% CIs, we cannot exclude the possibility that an intergroup difference of 19% and 7.83 minutes might have gone undetected for success rate and total time, respectively.

We examined the association between allergy history and risk of glioma, meningioma, acoustic neuroma, and parotid gland tumors using data on a large number of cases and controls from five INTERPHONE study countries (Australia, Canada, France, Israel, New Zealand), to better understand potential sources of bias in brain tumor case-control studies and to examine associations between allergy and tumor sites where few studies exist. A total of 793 glioma, 832 meningioma, 394 acoustic neuroma, and 84 parotid gland tumor cases were analyzed with 2,520 controls recruited during 2000-2004. Conditional logistic regression models were used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between self-reported allergy and tumor risk. A significant inverse association was observed between a history of any allergy and glioma (OR = 0.73, 95 % CI 0.60-0.88), meningioma (OR = 0.77, 95 % CI 0.63-0.93), and acoustic neuroma (OR = 0.64, 95 % CI 0.49-0.83). Inverse associations were also observed with specific allergic conditions. However, inverse associations with asthma and hay fever strengthened with increasing age of allergy onset and weakened with longer time since onset. No overall association was observed for parotid gland tumors (OR = 1.21, 95 % CI 0.73-2.02). While allergy history might influence glioma, meningioma, and acoustic neuroma risk, the observed associations could be due to information or selection bias or reverse causality.

In order to provide the first in vivo neuroanatomical evidence of this relation, the present study probes the neuroimaging profile of former athletes with concussions in relation to cognition. Former athletes who sustained their last sports concussion >3 decades prior to testing were compared with those with no history of traumatic brain injury. Participants underwent quantitative neuroimaging (optimized voxel-based morphometry hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS; medial temporal lobes and prefrontal cortices), and neuropsychological testing, and they were genotyped for APOE polymorphisms. Relative to controls, former athletes with concussions exhibited: 1) Abnormal enlargement of the lateral ventricles, 2) cortical thinning in regions more vulnerable to the aging process, 3) various neurometabolic anomalies found across regions of interest, 4) episodic memory and verbal fluency decline. The cognitive deficits correlated with neuroimaging findings in concussed participants. This study unveiled brain anomalies in otherwise healthy former athletes with concussions and associated those manifestations to the long-term detrimental effects of sports concussion on cognitive function. Findings from this study highlight patterns of decline often associated with abnormal aging.

Schizophrenia-related prefrontal deficits have been modeled in postpubertal neonatal ventral hippocampal lesioned (NVHL) rats, which displayed a loss of dendritic complexity and spines in layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The influence of dendritic attrition on synaptic function and neuronal excitability in the mPFC remains poorly understood. Here, we performed electrophysiological recordings of layer 5 mPFC pyramidal neurons from postpubertal (postnatal 40-60 days) NVHL rats and sham-operated controls. We found that the dendritic length, complexity, and spine density of neurobiotin-labeled layer 5 mPFC pyramidal neurons in NVHL rats were significantly lower than those in sham-operated rats. However, the excitability of layer 5 mPFC pyramidal neurons remained unchanged after NVHL. We found no significant changes in the expression of vesicular glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters after NVHL. Intriguingly, NVHL increased the amplitude of action potential-independent miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and decreased the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These opposing alterations in excitatory and inhibitory synapses, possibly shifting basal synaptic activity toward increased excitation, could be cellular substrates for mPFC functional deficits reported in NVHL rats.

However, whether differences exist according to the type of epilepsy is largely unknown. We performed a comparative assessment of the impact of removing HFO-generating tissue on surgical outcome between temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). We also assessed the relationship between the extent of surgical resection and surgical outcome. Methods We studied 30 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, 21 with TLE and 9 with ETLE. Two thirds of the patients were included in a previous report and for these, clinical and imaging data were updated and follow-up was extended. All patients underwent iEEG investigations (500Hz high-pass filter and 2,000Hz sampling rate), surgical resection, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HFOs (ripples, 80250Hz; fast ripples, >250Hz) were identified visually on a 510min interictal iEEG sample. HFO rates inside versus outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ), in resected versus nonresected tissue, and their association with surgical outcome (ILAE classification) were assessed in the entire cohort, and in the TLE and ETLE subgroups. We also tested the correlation of resected brain hippocampal and amygdala volumes (as measured on postoperative MRIs) with surgical outcome. Key Findings HFO rates were significantly higher inside the SOZ than outside in the entire cohort and TLE subgroup, but not in the ETLE subgroup. In all groups, HFO rates did not differ significantly between resected and nonresected tissue. Surgical outcome was better when higher HFO rates were included in the surgical resection in the entire cohort and TLE subgroup, but not in the ETLE subgroup. Resected brain hippocampal and amygdala volumes were not correlated with surgical outcome. Significance In TLE, removal of HFO-generating areas may lead to improved surgical outcome. Less consistent findings emerge from ETLE, but these may be related to sample size limitations of this study. Size of resection, a factor that was ignored and that could have affected results of earlier studies did not influence results.

Genetics Commiss Int League	SCN1A testing for epilepsy: Application in clinical practice	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Diagnosis; Epileptic encephalopathy; Guideline; Seizures; severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI); Dravet syndrome; Sodium channel		This report is a practical reference guide for genetic testing of SCN1A, the gene encoding the 1 subunit of neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels (protein name: Nav1.1). Mutations in this gene are frequently found in Dravet syndrome (DS), and are sometimes found in genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), migrating partial seizures of infancy (MPSI), other infantile epileptic encephalopathies, and rarely in infantile spasms. Recommendations for testing: (1) Testing is particularly useful for people with suspected DS and sometimes in other early onset infantile epileptic encephalopathies such as MPSI because genetic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis may allow optimization of antiepileptic therapy with the potential to improve seizure control and developmental outcome. In addition, a molecular diagnosis may prevent the need for unnecessary investigations, as well as inform genetic counseling. (2) SCN1A testing should be considered in people with possible DS where the typical initial presentation is of a developmentally normal infant presenting with recurrent, febrile or afebrile prolonged, hemiclonic seizures or generalized status epilepticus. After age 2, the clinical diagnosis of DS becomes more obvious, with the classical evolution of other seizure types and developmental slowing. (3) In contrast to DS, the clinical utility of SCN1A testing for GEFS+ remains questionable. (4) The test is not recommended for children with phenotypes that are not clearly associated with SCN1A mutations such as those characterized by abnormal development or neurologic deficits apparent at birth or structural abnormalities of the brain. Interpreting test results: (1) Mutational testing of SCN1A involves both conventional DNA sequencing of the coding regions and analyses to detect genomic rearrangements within the relevant chromosomal region: 2q24. Interpretation of the test results must always be done in the context of the electroclinical syndrome and often requires the assistance of a medical geneticist, since many genomic variations are possible and it is essential to differentiate benign polymorphisms from pathogenic mutations. (2) Missense variants may have no apparent effect on the phenotype (benign polymorphisms) or may represent mutations underlying DS, MPSI, GEFS+, and related syndromes and can provide a challenge in interpretation. (3) Conventional methods do not detect variations in introns or promoter or regulatory regions; therefore, a negative test does not exclude a pathogenic role of SCN1A in a specific phenotype. (4) It is important to note that a negative test does not rule out the clinical diagnosis of DS or other conditions because genes other than SCN1A may be involved. Obtaining written informed consent and genetic counseling should be considered prior to molecular testing, depending on the clinical situation and local regulations.

Artificial neural network models to support the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis in adult patients	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						pleurisy; accuracy; artificial intelligence; tuberculosis; diagnosis	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; INTERFERON-GAMMA; ADENOSINE-DEAMINASE; METAANALYSIS; PLEURITIS; VALIDITY; EFFUSION; FLUID; TESTS	BACKGROUND: Clinicians in countries with high tuberculosis (TB) prevalence often treat pleural TB based on clinical grounds, as the availability and sensitivity of diagnostic tests are poor. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of artificial neural networks (ANN) as an aid for the non-invasive diagnosis of pleural TB. These tools can be used in simple computer devices (tablets) without remote internet connection. METHODS: The clinical history and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of 137 patients were prospectively entered in a database. Both non-linear ANN and the linear Fisher discriminant were used to calculate performance indexes based on clinical grounds. The same procedure was performed including pleural fluid test results (smear, culture, adenosine deaminase, serology and nucleic acid amplification test). The gold standard was any positive test for TB. RESULTS: In pre-test modelling, the neural model reached >90% accuracy (Fisher discriminant 74.5%). Under pre-test conditions, ANN had better accuracy compared to each test considered separately. CONCLUSIONS: ANN are highly reliable for diagnosing pleural TB based on clinical grounds and HIV status only, and are useful even in remote conditions lacking access to sophisticated medical or computer infrastructure. In other better-equipped scenarios, these tools should be evaluated as substitutes for thoracocentesis and pleural biopsy.	[Seixas, J.

We wanted to study the role of genetic variants in behavioral problems in this population. Study Design: Behavioral problems in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (n = 138) were investigated longitudinally, using the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire and multilevel statistical modeling. Thirty-four candidate polymorphisms, related to anticancer drug effects, were investigated. Results: NOS3 gene functional polymorphisms showed significant association: patients homozygous for the minor allele at investigated loci showed decreased externalizing behavioral problems scores over time (t tests: T-786C n = 69, P = 0.003; G894T n = 71, P = 0.065). The effect was even more pronounced for individuals that are homozygous for the -786C844T haplotype (t test, n = 69, P < 0.001) and results were supported by multilevel modeling analyses (P < 0.001). No such association was observed for internalizing behavioral problems. Conclusion: NOS3 variants modulate externalizing problems individual trajectories, likely in relationship with glucocorticoid exposure.

Rapid high-yield N-acylation of aminothiols: N-acetylglutathione and N-acetylhomocysteine and their thiol pK(a) values	JOURNAL OF PEPTIDE SCIENCE			English	Article						activated ester; glutathione; homocysteine; thiol pK(a)	S-NITROSOGLUTATHIONE; CALBINDIN D-28K; HUMAN BRAIN; GLUTATHIONE; PROTEIN; MECHANISM; NITROSATION; CYSTEINE	Methodology for the rapid N-acylation of aminothiols in aqueous solution using procedures commonly employed in biochemical studies is described here. Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and homocystine were diN-acetylated in similar to 100% yield in 0.1M aqueous NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) at room temperature by 2.5equiv of the activated ester, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl acetate, an efficient water-soluble acetylating reagent. Following acetone precipitation, diN-acetylGSSG was further purified and desalted on a strong anion-exchange (SAX) cartridge. DiN-acetylhomocystine was simultaneously purified and desalted on a C18 cartridge. The N-acetylated aminothiols were generated using gel-immobilized tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine as a reductant, which obviated the need for further purification. Alternatively, disulfide exchange with dissolved dithiothreitol yielded N-acetylglutathione, which was purified on the SAX cartridge. pH titrations of N-acetylglutathione (8.99) and N-acetylhomocysteine (9.66) as well as those of commercially available N-acetylcysteine (9.53) and N-acetylpenicillamine (10.21) yielded pKa(SH) values of importance for biological studies.

IMAGEN Consortium	Cortical thickness of superior frontal cortex predicts impulsiveness and perceptual reasoning in adolescence	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						cortical thickness; healthy adolescents; impulsiveness; superior frontal cortex; trait	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIAL ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; LOW TRAIT IMPULSIVITY; MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS; WORKING-MEMORY; CHARACTER INVENTORY; REDUCED THICKNESS	Impulsiveness is a pivotal personality trait representing a core domain in all major personality inventories. Recently, impulsiveness has been identified as an important modulator of cognitive processing, particularly in tasks that require the processing of large amounts of information. Although brain imaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex to be a common underlying representation of impulsiveness and related cognitive functioning, to date a fine-grain and detailed morphometric analysis has not been carried out. On the basis of ahigh-resolution magnetic resonance scans acquired in 1620 healthy adolescents (IMAGEN), the individual cortical thickness (CT) was estimated. Correlations between Cloninger's impulsiveness and CT were studied in an entire cortex analysis. The cluster identified was tested for associations with performance in perceptual reasoning tasks of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC IV). We observed a significant inverse correlation between trait impulsiveness and CT of the left superior frontal cortex (SFC; Monte Carlo Simulation P < 0.01). CT within this cluster correlated with perceptual reasoning scores (Bonferroni corrected) of the WISC IV. On the basis of a large sample of adolescents, we identified an extended area in the SFC as a correlate of impulsiveness, which appears to be in line with the trait character of this prominent personality facet. The association of SFC thickness with perceptual reasoning argues for a common neurobiological basis of personality and specific cognitive domains comprising attention, spatial reasoning and response selection. The results may facilitate the understanding of the role of impulsiveness in several psychiatric disorders associated with prefrontal dysfunctions and cognitive deficits.

Mutations in DEPDC5 cause familial focal epilepsy with variable foci	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							CHROMOSOME 22Q12; GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; LOBE EPILEPSY; LINKAGE; MEMBRANE; CELLS; SUGGESTION; SEIZURES; DOMAINS; COMPLEX	The majority of epilepsies are focal in origin, with seizures emanating from one brain region. Although focal epilepsies often arise from structural brain lesions, many affected individuals have normal brain imaging. The etiology is unknown in the majority of individuals, although genetic factors are increasingly recognized. Autosomal dominant familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF) is notable because family members have seizures originating from different cortical regions(1). Using exome sequencing, we detected DEPDC5 mutations in two affected families. We subsequently identified mutations in five of six additional published large families with FFEVF. Study of families with focal epilepsy that were too small for conventional clinical diagnosis with FFEVF identified DEPDC5 mutations in approximately 12% of families (10/82). This high frequency establishes DEPDC5 mutations as a common cause of familial focal epilepsies. Shared homology with G protein signaling molecules and localization in human neurons suggest a role of DEPDC5 in neuronal signal transduction.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Mutations in STAMBP, encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme, cause microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							ESCRT MACHINERY; AMSH; PROTEINS; DOMAIN; ENDOSOMES; STABILITY; INTERACTS; RASA1	Microcephaly-capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome is characterized by severe microcephaly with progressive cortical atrophy, intractable epilepsy, profound developmental delay and multiple small capillary malformations on the skin. We used whole-exome sequencing of five patients with MIC-CAP syndrome and identified recessive mutations in STAMBP, a gene encoding the deubiquitinating (DUB) isopeptidase STAMBP (STAM-binding protein, also known as AMSH, associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) that has a key role in cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and sorting. Patient cell lines showed reduced STAMBP expression associated with accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated protein aggregates, elevated apoptosis and insensitive activation of the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. The latter cellular phenotype is notable considering the established connection between these pathways and their association with vascular and capillary malformations. Furthermore, our findings of a congenital human disorder caused by a defective DUB protein that functions in endocytosis implicates ubiquitin-conjugate aggregation and elevated apoptosis as factors potentially influencing the progressive neuronal loss underlying MIC-CAP syndrome.

Systemic pregabalin attenuates facial hypersensitivity and noxious stimulus-evoked release of glutamate in medullary dorsal horn in a rodent model of trigeminal neuropathic pain	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Nociception; Glutamate; Medullary dorsal horn; Pregabalin; Tooth pulp; Neuropathic pain	CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS; MECHANISMS	Pregabalin is effective in treating many neuropathic pain conditions. However, the mechanisms of its analgesic effects remain poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to determine whether pregabalin suppresses facial mechanical hypersensitivity and evoked glutamate release in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) in a rodent model of trigeminal neuropathic pain. Nociceptive mechanical sensitivity was assessed pre-operatively, and then post-operatively 1 h following pregabalin or vehicle (saline) treatment on post-operative days 2 and 5 following infraorbital nerve transection (IONX). In addition, an in vivo microdialysis probe was inserted into the exposed medulla post-operatively and dialysate samples were collected. Glutamate release was then evoked by mustard oil (MO) application to the tooth pulp, and the effects of pregabalin or vehicle were examined on the MDH glutamate release. Glutamate concentrations in the dialysated samples were determined by HPLC, and data analyzed by ANOVA. IONX animals (but not control animals) showed facial mechanical hypersensitivity for several days post-operatively. In addition, tooth pulp stimulation with MO evoked a transient release of glutamate in the MDH of IONX animals. Compared to vehicle, administration of pregabalin significantly attenuated the facial mechanical hypersensitivity as well as the MO-evoked glutamate release in MDH. This study provides evidence in support of recent findings pointing to the usefulness of pregabalin in the treatment of orofacial neuropathic pain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neural Substrates of Empathic Accuracy in People With Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						social cognition; empathic accuracy; emotional expressivity; schizophrenia; functional imaging	SOCIAL COGNITION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BASES; MIND; ATTRIBUTION; PERCEPTION; EMOTION; EXPRESSIVITY; CIRCUITRY; FEELINGS	Introduction: Empathic deficits in schizophrenia may lead to social dysfunction, but previous studies of schizophrenia have not modeled empathy through paradigms that (1) present participants with naturalistic social stimuli and (2) link brain activity to "accuracy" about inferring other's emotional states. This study addressed this gap by investigating the neural correlates of empathic accuracy (EA) in schizophrenia. Methods: Fifteen schizophrenia patients and 15 controls were scanned while continuously rating the affective state of another person shown in a series of videos (ie, targets). These ratings were compared with targets' own self-rated affect, and EA was defined as the correlation between participants' ratings and targets' self-ratings. Targets' self-reported emotional expressivity also was measured. We searched for brain regions whose activity tracked parametrically with (1) perceivers' EA and (2) targets' expressivity. Results: Patients showed reduced EA compared with controls. The left precuneus, left middle frontal gyms, and bilateral thalamus were significantly more correlated with EA in controls compared with patients. High expressivity in targets was associated with better EA in controls but not in patients. High expressivity was associated with increased brain activity in a large set of regions in controls (eg, fusiform gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex) but not in patients. Discussion: These results use a naturalistic performance measure to confirm that schizophrenic patients demonstrate impaired ability to understand others' internal states. They provide novel evidence about a potential mechanism for this impairment: schizophrenic patients failed to capitalize on targets' emotional expressivity and also demonstrate reduced neural sensitivity to targets' affective cues.

Chronic antipsychotic treatment might contribute to this comorbidity by inducing supersensitivity within the brain's dopamine system. Dopamine supersensitivity can enhance the incentive motivational properties of reward cues, and reward cues contribute to the maintenance and severity of drug addiction. We have shown previously that rats with-drawn from continuous haloperidol (HAL) treatment (via subcutaneous minipump) develop dopamine supersensitivity and pursue reward cues more vigorously than HAL-naive rats following an amphetamine (AMPH) challenge. Atypical antipsychotic drugs are thought to be less likely than typicals to produce dopamine supersensitivity. Thus, we compared the effects of HAL and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (OLZ) on the pursuit of reward cues. Rats were trained to associate a light-tone cue with water then treated with HAL or OLZ. Following antipsychotic withdrawal, we assessed AMPH-induced enhancement of lever pressing for the cue. Withdrawal from HAL, but not from OLZ, enhanced this effect. HAL, but not OLZ, also enhanced AMPH-induced psychomotor activation and c-fos mRNA expression in the caudate-putamen. Thus, prior HAL, but not OLZ, enhanced conditioned reward following an AMPH challenge, and this was potentially linked to enhanced behavioral sensitivity to AMPH and AMPH-induced engagement of the caudate-putamen. These findings suggest that HAL, but not an atypical like OLZ, modifies reward circuitry in ways that increase responsiveness to reward cues. Because enhanced responsiveness to reward cues can promote drug-seeking behavior, it should be investigated whether atypical antipsychotics might be a preferential option in schizophrenic patients at risk for drug abuse or addiction.

Term neonatal encephalopathy antecedent cerebral palsy: A retrospective population-based study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Cerebral palsy; Neonatal encephalopathy	GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION; NEWBORN ENCEPHALOPATHY; RISK-FACTORS; DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; INTRAPARTUM ASPHYXIA; CLASSIFICATION; INFANTS; DEFINITION; CHILDREN; SUBTYPE	Objective: To compare the clinical profile of term-born cerebral palsy children with or without antecedent moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy. We hypothesized that antecedent neonatal encephalopathy is associated with a spastic quadriparesis cerebral palsy clinical profile, a higher severity of functional motor impairment, and a greater number of associated comorbidities. Methods: Using the Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry, neurologic subtype, Gross Motor Function Classification System stratification, and comorbidities were compared in children with cerebral palsy with and without antecedent neonatal encephalopathy. Differences between groups were evaluated using chi square analysis for categorical variables and student t test for continuous variables. Results: We identified 132 children with cerebral palsy born full term over a 4 year-interval (1999-2002 inclusive) within the Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry, of which 44 (33%) had an antecedent neonatal encephalopathy. Spastic quadriplegia subtype of cerebral palsy and Gross Motor Function Classification System Level III-V (non-independent ambulation) were significantly associated with antecedent neonatal encephalopathy. The mean number of comorbidities experienced was not different in the two groups. Of five documented comorbidities, only severe communication difficulties were found to be associated (p < 0.05) with antecedent neonatal encephalopathy. Conclusion: A pattern of increased neuromotor impairment, functional gross motor severity and possible communication difficulties was found in the 33% of children with cerebral palsy born at term and with a history of neonatal encephalopathy.

A generalized procedure for calibrated MRI incorporating hyperoxia and hypercapnia	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						calibrated fMRI; hyperoxia; hypercapnia; oxidative metabolism; visual stimulation	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; BOLD-FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; CARBON-DIOXIDE; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; VOLUME; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES	Calibrated MRI techniques use the changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal evoked by a respiratory manipulation to extrapolate the total BOLD signal attributable to deoxyhemoglobin at rest (M). This parameter can then be used to estimate changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) based on task-induced BOLD and CBF signals. Different approaches have been described previously, including addition of inspired CO2 (hypercapnia) or supplemental O2 (hyperoxia). We present here a generalized BOLD signal model that reduces under appropriate conditions to previous models derived for hypercapnia or hyperoxia alone, and is suitable for use during hybrid breathing manipulations including simultaneous hypercapnia and hyperoxia. This new approach yields robust and accurate M maps, in turn allowing more reliable estimation of CMRO2 changes evoked during a visual task. The generalized model is valid for arbitrary flow changes during hyperoxia, thus benefiting from the larger total oxygenation changes produced by increased blood O2 content from hyperoxia combined with increases in flow from hypercapnia. This in turn reduces the degree of extrapolation required to estimate M. The new procedure yielded M estimates that were generally higher (7.6 +/- 2.6) than those obtained through hypercapnia (5.6 +/- 1.8) or hyperoxia alone (4.5 +/- 1.5) in visual areas. These M values and their spatial distribution represent a more accurate and robust depiction of the underlying distribution of tissue deoxyhemoglobin at rest, resulting in more accurate estimates of evoked CMRO2 changes.

DOES INCREASED GAMMA ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM PARKINSON'S DISEASE COUNTERACT THE MOVEMENT INHIBITING BETA ACTIVITY?	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep brain stimulation; power; nucleus subthalamicus; local field potentials	HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; ZONA INCERTA; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; TREMOR; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYSTONIA; PALLIDUM	Akinesia and rigidity are cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies analysing event-related desynchronization during movement onset associated both symptoms with pathologically increased oscillations in the beta frequency range. By focusing on the movement onset only, these studies cannot, however, shed light onto the question how oscillatory activity is changed during continuous movements. To investigate this issue, we compared the power of the local field potentials (LFP) within and above the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during rest, an isometric hold condition of the forearm, and a fist flexion and extension task in 13 patients with idiopathic PD during implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. During fist flexion and extension (relative to rest), significantly increased activity in the low beta (12-18 Hz) and gamma (30-48 Hz) frequency ranges was observed within the STN, while during hold (compared to rest) no significant difference was found. For the regions above the STN the power during fist movements (compared to rest) was significantly higher, i.e. in the range of 18-30 Hz, with no significant changes in the gamma frequency range. Beta activity is claimed to inhibit movement and thereby could render fist movements more exhausting. Therefore, the observed increase in beta activity in the STN during fist movements might result in bradykinesia as experienced by many patients. We hypothesise that in order to enable repetitive fist movement despite increased beta activity, "prokinetic" gamma activity may be increased as a compensatory mechanism. (C) 2013 IBRO.

Embodied cognition	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Review							MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; PERCEPTUAL SYMBOL SYSTEMS; TOOL USE; AFFORDANCES; RECOGNITION; SIMULATION; IMITATION; EMOTION; SCIENCE; VISION	Traditional views in philosophy of mind and cognitive science depict the mind as an information processor, one whose connections with the body and the world are of little theoretical importance. On the contrary, mounting empirical evidence shows that bodily states and modality-specific systems for perception and action underlie information processing, and that embodiment contributes to various aspects and effects of mental phenomena. This article will briefly review and discuss some of this evidence and what it implies. By challenging mainstream accounts of mind and cognition, embodiment views offer new ways of conceptualizing knowledge and suggest novel perspectives on cognitive variation and mind-body reductionism.

We previously reported that the omega-6 long chain fatty acids, transarachidonic acids (TAAs), which are nitrative stress-induced nonenzymatically generated arachidonic acid derivatives, trigger selective microvascular endothelial cell death in neonatal neural tissue. The primary molecular target of TAAs remains unidentified. GPR40 is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by long chain fatty acids, including omega-6; it is highly expressed in brain, but its functions in this tissue are largely unknown. We hypothesized that TAAs play a significant role in neonatal HI-induced cerebral microvascular degeneration through GPR40 activation. Approach and Results-Within 24 hours of a HI insult to postnatal day 7 rat pups, a cerebral infarct and a 40% decrease in cerebrovascular density was observed. These effects were associated with an increase in nitrative stress markers (3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity and TAA levels) and were reduced by treatment with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. GPR40 was expressed in rat pup brain microvasculature. In vitro, in GPR40-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, [C-14]-14E-AA (radiolabeled TAA) bound specifically, and TAA induced calcium transients, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and proapoptotic thrombospondin-1 expression. In vivo, intracerebroventricular injection of TAAs triggered thrombospondin-1 expression and cerebral microvascular degeneration in wild-type mice, but not in GPR40-null congeners. Additionally, HI-induced neurovascular degeneration and cerebral infarct were decreased in GPR40-null mice. Conclusions-GPR40 emerges as the first identified G protein-coupled receptor conveying actions of nonenzymatically generated nitro-oxidative products, specifically TAAs, and is involved in (neonatal) HI encephalopathy.

Scope of review: Enhancing GSH and associated enzymes represents a longtime and persistent aim in the search for cytoprotective strategies against cancer, neurologic degeneration, pulmonary and inflammatory conditions, as well as cardiovascular ailments. The challenge is to identify effective GSH analogues or precursors that generate mimic molecules with glutathione's cellular protective effects. This review will provide an update on these efforts. Much effort has also been directed at depleting cellular GSH and related cytoprotective effects, in order to sensitize established tumors to the cytotoxic effects of anti-cancer agents. Efforts to deplete GSH have been limited by the challenge of selectivity doing so in tumor and not in normal tissue so as to avoid enhancing the toxicity of anti-cancer drugs. This review will also provide an update of efforts at overcoming the challenge of targeting the desired GSH depletion to tumor cells. Major conclusions: This chapter provides a brief background and update of progress in the development and use of GSH analogues in the therapeutic setting, including the pharmacological aspects of these compounds. General significance: This is an area of enormous research activity, and major advances promise the advent of novel therapeutic opportunities in the near future.

A unified approach to multiple-set canonical correlation analysis and principal components analysis	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS; FACTORIAL; FUSION	Multiple-set canonical correlation analysis and principal components analysis are popular data reduction techniques in various fields, including psychology. Both techniques aim to extract a series of weighted composites or components of observed variables for the purpose of data reduction. However, their objectives of performing data reduction are different. Multiple-set canonical correlation analysis focuses on describing the association among several sets of variables through data reduction, whereas principal components analysis concentrates on explaining the maximum variance of a single set of variables. In this paper, we provide a unified framework that combines these seemingly incompatible techniques. The proposed approach embraces the two techniques as special cases. More importantly, it permits a compromise between the techniques in yielding solutions. For instance, we may obtain components in such a way that they maximize the association among multiple data sets, while also accounting for the variance of each data set. We develop a single optimization function for parameter estimation, which is a weighted sum of two criteria for multiple-set canonical correlation analysis and principal components analysis. We minimize this function analytically. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the performance of the proposed approach based on synthetic data. We also apply the approach for the analysis of functional neuroimaging data to illustrate its empirical usefulness.

Parenting children with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or behaviour problems	CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						child health; externalizing problem behaviours; neurodevelopmental disorders; parenting behaviours; socio-economic status	HEALTH UTILITIES INDEX; DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL; FAMILY; STRESS; MULTIATTRIBUTE; DETERMINANTS; PREDICTORS; MOTHERS	Background Parenting behaviours influence child well-being and development. However, much of the research on parenting behaviours and their correlates has focused on caregivers of healthy, typically developing children. Relatively less is known about the parenting behaviours of caregivers of children with chronic health conditions. Objective To examine and compare three parenting behaviours (positive interactions, consistency and ineffective parenting) among caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or externalizing behaviour problems, before and after accounting for child and family socio-demographic characteristics. Methods Participants (n= 14226) were drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a long-term study of Canadian children that follows their development and well-being from birth to early adulthood. Children (and their caregivers) were divided into four groups according to the presence of a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD; n= 815), the presence of an externalizing behaviour problem (EBP; n= 1322), the presence of both conditions (BOTH; n= 452) or neither of these conditions (NEITHER; n= 11376). Results Caregivers of children in the NEITHER group reported significantly higher positive interaction scores and lower ineffective parenting behaviours than caregivers of children in any of the other three groups. Caregivers of children in the EBP and BOTH groups reported similar levels of consistency, but significantly lower levels than caregivers of NDD or NEITHER children. These associations largely remained after accounting for child and family socio-demographic characteristics, with two exceptions: caregivers' reports of positive interactions were no longer significantly associated with child's NDD and BOTH conditions. Conclusions Parenting children with multiple health conditions can be associated with less positive, less consistent and more ineffective parenting behaviours. Understanding the factors that are associated with the challenges of caring for these children may require additional research attention.	[Garner, R. E.; Arim, R. G.; Kohen, D.

The centrosome is unusually fragmented in 1 integrin null astrocytes. Expression of a 1 integrin cDNA in the null background yields cells with intact centrosomes that polarize and extend processes normally. Fragmented centrosomes rapidly assemble following integrin ligation and cell attachment. However, several experiments indicated that cell adhesion is not necessary. For example, astrocytes in suspension expressing a chimeric 1 subunit that can be activated by an antibody assemble centrosomes suggesting that 1 activation is sufficient to cause centrosome assembly in the absence of cell adhesion. siRNA knockdown of PCM1, a major centrosomal protein, inhibits cell polarization, consistent with the notion that centrosomes are necessary for polarity and that integrins regulate polarity via centrosome integrity. Screening inhibitors of molecules downstream of integrins indicate that neither FAK nor ILK is involved in regulation of centrosome integrity. In contrast, blebbistatin, a specific inhibitor of non-muscle myosin II (NMII), mimics the response of 1 integrin null astrocytes by disrupting centrosome integrity and cell polarization. Blebbistatin also inhibits integrin-mediated centrosome assembly in astrocytes attaching to fibronectin, consistent with the hypothesis that NMII functions downstream of integrins in regulating centrosome integrity.

Active retrieval is an effortful retrieval required to disambiguate information stored in memory. Brain imaging studies and monkey experiments have shown that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is specifically engaged in this retrieval in both adult humans and monkeys. Three groups of 6-, 8-, and 11-year-old children and adults were tested on an active retrieval task. Results showed a marked difference in performance between 6-year olds, who made more errors and had longer response time, and 8- and 11-year olds, who had performance similar to adults. These results provide evidence that the VLPFC and the network supporting its topdown modulation undergo substantial maturational changes between 6 and 8 years old, giving children better active control of visual memory.

Systemic dexamethasone for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity	EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	65th Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Society-of-Otolaryngology-Head-and-Neck-Surgery	MAY 22-24, 2011	Victoria, CANADA	Canadian Soc Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg		Cisplatin; Dexamethasone; Cochlea; Ototoxicity; Inflammation	NF-KAPPA-B; GUINEA-PIG; STRIA VASCULARIS; INTRATYMPANIC DEXAMETHASONE; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; TIME-SEQUENCE; INNER-EAR; COCHLEA; PLATINUM; CELLS	Ototoxicity is a common side effect of cisplatin chemotherapy. This study was undertaken to determine the potential protective effects of a systemic administration of dexamethasone against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. A prospective controlled trial conducted in an animal model. The setting was Animal care research facilities of the Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute. An experimental guinea pig model was used. The animals were divided as follows: group 1 (n = 10): 12 mg/kg intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin, group 2 (n = 14): 15 mg/kg/day dexamethasone IP for 2 days followed by cisplatin 12 mg/kg IP, group 3 (n = 14): 10 mg/kg/day dexamethasone IP for 2 days, on day 3, they received cisplatin 12 mg/kg IP followed by 20 mg/kg/day dexamethasone for 2 days and group 4 (n = 5): 10 ml of saline IP twice a day for 3 days. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shifts were measured at four frequencies (8, 16, 20 and 25 kHz) for groups 1, 2 and 3. Histological changes in the organ of Corti, the stria vascularis, the spiral ligament and the spiral ganglion neurons as well as scanning electron microscopy for outer hair cells were completed. Immunohistochemistry for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was performed. ABR threshold shifts were similar in all groups. Histological and scanning electron findings demonstrate that dexamethasone has greater protective effect on the stria vascularis. Systemic dexamethasone administration in a guinea pig model did not provide significant protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Dexamethasone may be useful in future applications as a complementary treatment.

Methods: For 8 able-bodied (AB) and 6 cervical SCI participants, the net joint moment and electroencephalographic activities were recorded during isometric contractions of the right elbow in flexion and in extension at 3 force levels, that is, during intact and altered muscle contractions for SCI participants. The mean net moment and similar to 20 Hz ERD from C3 electroencephalographic electrode were compared between AB and SCI participants. Results: In flexion, that is, during intact contractions for all participants, the mean net moment and the ERD increased with the required force level. In extension, that is, during altered contractions, the mean net moment increased for 3 SCI participants while it was almost zero for 3 other SCI participants. The associated ERD increased with the required force level for all participants. Conclusion: The cortical desynchronization was modulated by the intent to modulate the force level rather than the actual modulation of the force production. Significance: These results provide a better understanding of the modulation of the cortical desynchronization following SCI. Potential applications could include the control of neuroprostheses.

To do so, the paper uses structurally different methods - neurophysiological and self-reported instruments - to measure three important and commonly used IS constructs: engagement, arousal and cognitive load in two different experimental settings. The experiments involved seventeen (17) and twenty-four (24) participants respectively and consisted in using different IS to execute a set of both instrumental and hedonic tasks. The results generally support MTMM matrix expectations and shed light on the complexity of detecting the nature of mono-method bias. Specifically, the results show that primitive perceptual IS constructs such as arousal seem to be less affected by mono-method bias, whereas more complex perceptual constructs such as engagement or cognitive load have higher within method correlations. There are two complementary explanations for the within method correlations: (a) a combination between complexity of trait and method and (b) method effects that are congeneric.

Other factors such as network reliability, criticality, location, contract size, and rehabilitation method(s) affect the optimization of the scheduling process. This paper presents a method for optimized scheduling of rehabilitation work for water distribution networks. The method utilizes unsupervised neural networks (UNNs) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and performs the scheduling in two stages. In the first stage, UNNs are used to cluster water mains into groups according to locations and rehabilitation methods of water mains. In the second stage, MINLP is used to determine the number of rehabilitation contract packages and the generation of optimized scheduling of these packages considering network reliability, criticality, contract size, and planning time. In order to demonstrate the essential features of the developed method, a case study was analyzed and the results obtained are discussed; highlighting their utilization in practice.

Brain Dev Cooperative Grp	Evidence for a cerebral cortical thickness network anti-correlated with amygdalar volume in healthy youths: Implications for the neural substrates of emotion regulation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Amygdala; Cortical thickness; MRI; Normal development	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; NORMAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; CHRONIC STRESS; OLDER-ADULTS; MRI DATA	Recent functional connectivity studies have demonstrated that in resting humans, activity in a dorsally-situated neocortical network is inversely associated with activity in the amygdalae. Similarly, in human neuroimaging studies, aspects of emotion regulation have been associated with increased activity in dorsolateral, dorsomedial, orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions, as well as concomitant decreases in amygdalar activity. These findings indicate the presence of two countervailing systems in the human brain that are reciprocally related: a dorsally-situated cognitive control network, and a ventrally-situated limbic network We investigated the extent to which this functional reciprocity between limbic and dorsal neocortical regions is recapitulated from a purely structural standpoint. Specifically, we hypothesized that amygdalar volume would be related to cerebral cortical thickness in cortical regions implicated in aspects of emotion regulation. In 297 typically developing youths (162 females, 135 males; 572 MRIs), the relationship between cortical thickness and amygdalar volume was characterized. Amygdalar volume was found to be inversely associated with thickness in bilateral dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal, inferior parietal, as well as bilateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Our findings are in line with previous work demonstrating that a predominantly dorsally-centered neocortical network is reciprocally related to core limbic structures such as the amygdalae. Future research may benefit from investigating the extent to which such cortical-limbic morphometric relations are qualified by the presence of mood and anxiety psychopathology.

Methods: Forty-one (70.1% women, mean age 44.51 +/- 7.43) mildly impaired (EDSS: 2.26 +/- 1.87) MS patients were recruited for this study. In addition to the MoCA, they were administered the MSNQ-P (patient version) and the MSNQ-I (informant version), the bDI-FS and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: there were significant correlations between the MoCA test and the three factors derived from the neuropsychological evaluation (Executive/speed of processing, Learning, Delayed recall). the MoCA test was correlated with the MSNQ-I but only marginally with the MSNQ-P. In addition, there was no significant correlation between the MSNQP and the neuropsychological factors, whereas significant correlations were found between two of those factors (Learning and Delayed recall) and the MSNQ-I, suggesting that the informant version is more reliable than the patient version for the presence of cognitive deficits. Conclusion: the results obtained in the present study support the value of the MoCA test as a screening tool for the presence of cognitive dysfunction in MS patients, even in patients with mild functional disability (EDSS).

Age dependence of hemodynamic response characteristics in human functional magnetic resonance imaging	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Cognitive aging; Calibrated fMRI; Hypercapnia; Vascular reactivity; BOLD signal biases; Cerebral blood flow; Oxidative metabolism; Modified Stroop task	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; ADULT LIFE-SPAN; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; AGING BRAIN; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; OLDER-ADULTS; BOLD FMRI	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of cognitive aging have generally compared the amplitude and extent of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal increases evoked by a task in older and younger groups. BOLD is thus used as a direct index of neuronal activation and it is assumed that the relationship between neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response is unchanged across the lifespan. However, even in healthy aging, differences in vascular and metabolic function have been observed that could affect the coupling between neuronal activity and the BOLD signal. Here we use a calibrated fMRI method to explore vascular and metabolic changes that might bias such BOLD comparisons. Though BOLD signal changes evoked by a cognitive task were found to be similar between a group of younger and older adults (e. g., 0.50 +/- 0.04% vs. 0.50 +/- 0.05% in right frontal areas), comparison of BOLD and arterial spin labelling (ASL) responses elicited in the same set of structures by a controlled global hypercapnic manipulation revealed significant differences between the 2 groups. Older adults were found to have lower responses in BOLD and flow responses to hypercapnia (e.g., 1.48 +/- 0.07% vs. 1.01 +/- 0.06% over gray matter for BOLD and 24.92 +/- 1.37% vs. 20.67 +/- 2.58% for blood flow), and a generally lower maximal BOLD response M (5.76 +/- 0.2% vs. 5.00 +/- 0.3%). This suggests that a given BOLD response in the elderly might represent a larger change in neuronal activity than the same BOLD response in a younger cohort. The results of this study highlight the importance of ancillary measures such as ASL for the correct interpretation of BOLD responses when fMRI responses are compared across populations who might exhibit differences in vascular physiology.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Intellectual disability associated with a homozygous missense mutation in THOC6	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Article						Intellectual disability; THOC6; THO/TREX complex; mRNA export; Hutterite	RECESSIVE MENTAL-RETARDATION; SPLICED MESSENGER-RNA; HUMAN TREX COMPLEX; HUTTERITE POPULATION; TRANSCRIPTION-ELONGATION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; BINDING PROTEIN; POLYMERASE-II; EXPORT; DISORDERS	Background: We recently described a novel autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability in four patients from two related Hutterite families. Identity-by-descent mapping localized the gene to a 5.1 Mb region at chromosome 16p13.3 containing more than 170 known or predicted genes. The objective of this study was to identify the causative gene for this rare disorder. Methods and results: Candidate gene sequencing followed by exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation p.Gly46Arg, in THOC6. No other potentially causative coding variants were present within the critical region on chromosome 16. THOC6 is a member of the THO/TREX complex which is involved in coordinating mRNA processing with mRNA export from the nucleus. In situ hybridization showed that thoc6 is highly expressed in the midbrain and eyes. Cellular localization studies demonstrated that wild-type THOC6 is present within the nucleus as is the case for other THO complex proteins. However, mutant THOC6 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that the mutant protein is unable to carry out its normal function. siRNA knockdown of THOC6 revealed increased apoptosis in cultured cells. Conclusion: Our findings associate a missense mutation in THOC6 with intellectual disability, suggesting the THO/TREX complex plays an important role in neurodevelopment.

J	Vanni, MP; Casanova, C				Vanni, Matthieu P.; Casanova, Christian			Surround suppression maps in the cat primary visual cortex	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						area 17; area 18; intrinsic signals; orientation selectivity; cortical map; receptive field	RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY MAPS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; ORIENTATION MAPS; STRIATE CORTEX; AREA MT; FLAVOPROTEIN AUTOFLUORESCENCE; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS	In the primary visual cortex and higher-order areas, it is well known that the stimulation of areas surrounding the classical receptive field of a neuron can inhibit its responses. In the primate area middle temporal (MT), this surround suppression was shown to be spatially organized into high and low suppression modules. However, such an organization has not been demonstrated yet in the primary visual cortex. Here, we used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to spatially evaluate surround suppression in the cat visual cortex. The magnitude of the response was measured in areas 17 and 18 for stimuli with different diameters, presented at different eccentricities. Delimited regions of the cortex were revealed by circumscribed stimulations of the visual field ("cortical response field"). Increasing the stimulus diameter increased the spread of cortical activation. In the cortical response field, the optimal stimulation diameter and the level of suppression were evaluated. Most pixels (>= 3/4) exhibited surround suppression profiles. The optimal diameter, corresponding to a population of receptive fields, was smaller in area 17 (22 degrees) than in area 18 (36 degrees) in accordance with electrophysiological data. No difference in the suppression strength was observed between both areas (A17: 25%, A18: 21%). Further analysis of our data revealed the presence of surround modulation maps, organized in low and high suppression domains. We also developed a statistical method to confirm the existence of this cortical map and its neuronal origin. The organization for center/surround suppression observed here at the level of the primary visual cortex is similar to those found in higher order areas in primates (e.g., area MT) and could represent a strategy to optimize figure ground discrimination.

In order to identify the cerebral regions involved in these phenomena, we characterized the response to AGS in Fmr1 KO mice and wild type (WT) controls at postnatal day (P) 45 and P90. To characterize the diverse response to AGS in various cerebral regions, we evaluated the activity markers FosB/Delta FosB and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). Wild running (100% of tested mice) followed by clonic/tonic seizures (30%) were observed in P45 Fmr1 KO mice, but not in WT mice. In P90 Fmr1 KO mice, wild running was only present in 25% of tested animals. Basal FosB/Delta FosB immunoreactivity was higher (P < 0.01 vs. WT) in the CA1 and subiculum of P45 Fmr1 KO mice. Following the AGS test, FosB/Delta FosB expression consistently increased in most of the analyzed regions in both groups at P45, but not at P90. Interestingly, FosB/Delta FosB immunoreactivity was significantly higher in P45 Fmr1 KO mice in the medial geniculate body (P < 0.05 vs. WT) and CA3 (P < 0.01). Neurons presenting with immunopositivity to p-ERK1/2 were more abundant in the subiculum of Fmr1 KO mice in control condition (P < 0.05 vs. WT, in both age groups). In this region, p-ERK1/2-immunopositive cells significantly decreased (-75%, P < 0.01) in P90 Fmr1 KO mice exposed to the AGS test, but no changes were found in P45 mice or in other brain regions. In both age groups of WT mice, p-ERK1/2-immunopositive cells increased in the subiculum after exposure to the acoustic test. Our findings illustrate that FosB/Delta FosB markers are overexpressed in the medial geniculate body and CA3 in Fmr1 KO mice experiencing AGS, and that p-ERK1/2 is markedly decreased in the subiculum of Fmr1 KO mice resistant to AGS induction. These findings suggest that resilience to AGS is associated with dephosphorylation of p-ERK1/2 in the subiculum of mature Fmr1 KO mice.

The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) response is a neuronal marker for the detection of sounds that are unexpected, based on the encoded regularities. It is also elicited by violations of more complex regularities and musical expertise has been shown to have an effect on the processing of complex regularities. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we investigated the MMN response to salient or less salient deviants by varying the standard probability (70%, 50% and 35%) of a pattern oddball paradigm. To study the effects of musical expertise in the encoding of the patterns, we compared the responses of a group of non-musicians to those of musicians. Results: We observed significant MMN in all conditions, including the least salient condition (35% standards), in response to violations of the predominant tone pattern for both groups. The amplitude of MMN from the right hemisphere was influenced by the standard probability. This effect was modulated by long-term musical training: standard probability changes influenced MMN amplitude in the group of non-musicians only. Conclusion: This study indicates that pattern violations are detected automatically, even if they are of very low salience, both in non-musicians and musicians, with salience having a stronger impact on processing in the right hemisphere of non-musicians. Long-term musical training influences this encoding, in that non-musicians benefit to a greater extent from a good signal-to-noise ratio (i.e. high probability of the standard pattern), while musicians are less dependent on the salience of an acoustic environment.

Vergence Neurons Identified in the Rostral Superior Colliculus Code Smooth Eye Movements in 3D Space	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OCULOMOTOR NUCLEUS; NEURAL-CONTROL; DISPARITY SENSITIVITY; 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE; DISCHARGE DYNAMICS; MICRO STIMULATION; FIXATION NEURONS; PARIETAL CORTEX; BURST NEURONS; MONKEY	The rostral superior colliculus (rSC) encodes position errors for multiple types of eye movements, including microsaccades, small saccades, smooth pursuit, and fixation. Here we address whether the rSC contributes to the development of neural signals that are suitable for controlling vergence eye movements. We use both single-unit recording and microstimulation techniques in monkey to answer this question. We found that vergence eye movements can be evoked using microstimulation in the rSC. Moreover, among the previously described neurons in rSC, we recorded a novel population of neurons that either increased (i.e., convergence neurons) or decreased (i.e., divergence neurons) their activity during vergence eye movements. In particular, these neurons dynamically encoded changes in vergence angle during vergence tracking, fixation in 3D space and the slow binocular realignment that occurs after disconjugate saccades, but were completely unresponsive during conjugate or the rapid component of disconjugate saccades (i.e., fast vergence) and conjugate smooth pursuit. Together, our microstimulation and single-neuron results suggest that the SC plays a role in the generation of signals required to precisely align the eyes toward targets in 3D space. We propose that accurate maintenance of 3D eye position, critical for the perception of stereopsis, may be mediated via the rSC.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking neuronal activity to activation of mRNA translation are not fully understood. Here, we report that the translational repressor poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-interacting protein 2A (PAIP2A), an inhibitor of PABP, is rapidly proteolyzed by calpains in stimulated neurons and following training for contextual memory. Paip2a knockout mice exhibit a lowered threshold for the induction of sustained long-term potentiation and an enhancement of long-term memory after weak training. Translation of CaMKII alpha mRNA is enhanced in Paip2a(-/-) slices upon tetanic stimulation and in the hippocampus of Paip2a(-/-) mice following contextual fear learning. We demonstrate that activity-dependent degradation of PAIP2A relieves translational inhibition of memory-related genes through PABP reactivation and conclude that PAIP2A is a pivotal translational regulator of synaptic plasticity and-memory.

Calcium imaging studies demonstrate that glial cells actively sense and respond to neuronal activity. Glial cells can produce and release neurotransmitter-like molecules, referred to as gliotransmitters, that can in turn influence the activity of neurons and other glia. One putative gliotransmitter, D-serine is believed to be an endogenous co-agonist for synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity mediated by this receptor. The observation that D-serine levels in the mammalian brain increase during early development. In this review we will examine the data that D-serine and its associated enzyme serine racemase are developmentally regulated. We will consider the evidence that D-serine is actively released by glial cells and examine the studies that have implicated D-serine is a critical player involved in regulating NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission and neuronal migration during development. Furthermore, we will consider how dysregulation of D-serine may play an important role in the etiology of neurological and psychiatric diseases.

Structure of Spike Count Correlations Reveals Functional Interactions between Neurons in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Area 8a of Behaving Primates	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MACAQUE VISUAL-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY TASKS; INTERNEURONAL CORRELATIONS; CORTICAL MICROCIRCUITS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; MT	Neurons within the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) are clustered in microcolumns according to their visuospatial tuning. One issue that remains poorly investigated is how this anatomical arrangement influences functional interactions between neurons during behavior. To investigate this question we implanted 4 mm x 4 mm multielectrode arrays in two macaques' dlPFC area 8a and measured spike count correlations (r(sc)) between responses of simultaneously recorded neurons when animals maintained stationary gaze. Positive and negative r(sc) were significantly higher than predicted by chance across a wide range of inter-neuron distances (from 0.4 to 4 mm). Positive r(sc) were stronger between neurons with receptive fields (RFs) separated by <= 90 degrees of angular distance and progressively decreased as a function of inter-neuron physical distance. Negative r(sc) were stronger between neurons with RFs separated by >90 degrees and increased as a function of inter-neuron distance. Our results show that short- and long-range functional interactions between dlPFC neurons depend on the physical distance between them and the relationship between their visuospatial tuning preferences. Neurons with similar visuospatial tuning show positive r(sc) that decay with inter-neuron distance, suggestive of excitatory interactions within and between adjacent microcolumns. Neurons with dissimilar tuning from spatially segregated microcolumns show negative r(sc) that increase with inter-neuron distance, suggestive of inhibitory interactions. This pattern of results shows that functional interactions between prefrontal neurons closely follow the pattern of connectivity reported in anatomical studies. Such interactions may be important for the role of the prefrontal cortex in the allocation of attention to targets in the presence of competing distracters.

Here, we report that let-7 contributes to a developmental decline in anterior ventral microtubule (AVM) axon regeneration. In older AVM axons, let-7 inhibits regeneration by down-regulating LIN-41, an important AVM axon regeneration-promoting factor. Whereas let-7 inhibits lin-41 expression in older neurons through the lin-41 3' untranslated region, lin-41 inhibits let-7 expression in younger neurons through Argonaute ALG-1. This reciprocal inhibition ensures that axon regeneration is inhibited only in older neurons. These findings show that a let-7-lin-41 regulatory circuit, which was previously shown to control timing of events in mitotic stem cell lineages, is reutilized in postmitotic neurons to control postdifferentiation events.

Changes in brain structure and cortical function associated with many chronic pain conditions have been reported in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC is implicated in pain-related co-morbidities such as depression, anxiety and impaired emotional decision-making ability. We recently reported that this region is subject to significant epigenetic reprogramming following peripheral nerve injury, and normalization of pain-related structural, functional and epigenetic abnormalities in the PFC are all associated with effective pain reduction. In this study, we used the Spared Nerve Injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain to test the hypothesis that peripheral nerve injury triggers persistent long-lasting changes in gene expression in the PFC, which alter functional gene networks, thus providing a possible explanation for chronic pain associated behaviors. Results: SNI or sham surgery where performed in male CD1 mice at three months of age. Six months after injury, we performed transcriptome-wide sequencing (RNAseq), which revealed 1147 differentially regulated transcripts in the PFC in nerve-injured vs. control mice. Changes in gene expression occurred across a number of functional gene clusters encoding cardinal biological processes as revealed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Significantly altered biological processes included neurological disease, skeletal muscular disorders, behavior, and psychological disorders. Several of the changes detected by RNAseq were validated by RT-QPCR and included transcripts with known roles in chronic pain and/or neuronal plasticity including the NMDA receptor (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, NMDA; grin1), neurite outgrowth (roundabout 3; robo3), gliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein; gfap), vesicular release (synaptotagmin 2; syt2), and neuronal excitability (voltage-gated sodium channel, type I; scn1a). Conclusions: This study used an unbiased approach to document long-term alterations in gene expression in the brain following peripheral nerve injury. We propose that these changes are maintained as a memory of an insult that is temporally and spatially distant from the initial injury.

The modern coelacanth looks remarkably similar to many of its ancient relatives, and its evolutionary proximity to our own fish ancestors provides a glimpse of the fish that first walked on land. Here we report the genome sequence of the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis, we conclude that the lungfish, and not the coelacanth, is the closest living relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods, unlike other genomic features. Analyses of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to land highlight genes involved in immunity, nitrogen excretion and the development of fins, tail, ear, eye, brain and olfaction. Functional assays of enhancers involved in the fin-to-limb transition and in the emergence of extra-embryonic tissues show the importance of the coelacanth genome as a blueprint for understanding tetrapod evolution.

In this context, this review aims to address the effects of age on motor sequence learning (MSL) and motor adaptation (MA) with respect to behavioral, neurological, and neuroimaging findings. Previous behavioral research investigating the influence of aging on motor learning has consistently reported the following results. First, the initial acquisition of motor sequences is not altered, except under conditions of increased task complexity. Second, older adults demonstrate deficits in motor sequence memory consolidation. And, third, although older adults demonstrate deficits during the exposure phase of MA paradigms, the aftereffects following removal of the sensorimotor perturbation are similar to young adults, suggesting that the adaptive ability of older adults is relatively intact. This paper will review the potential neural underpinnings of these behavioral results, with a particular emphasis on the influence of age-related dysfunctions in the cortico-striatal system on motor learning.

The phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia is well documented in animal research and individual variability in the stress response in humans may produce corresponding changes in pain. We assessed the magnitude of the acute stress response of 16 chronic back pain (CBP) patients and 18 healthy individuals exposed to noxious thermal stimulations administered in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment and tested its possible contribution to individual differences in pain perception. The temperature of the noxious stimulations was determined individually to control for differences in pain sensitivity. The two groups showed similar significant increases in reactive cortisol across the scanning session when compared with their basal levels collected over 7 consecutive days, suggesting normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity to painful stressors in CBP patients. Critically, after controlling for any effect of group and stimulus temperature, individuals with stronger cortisol responses reported less pain unpleasantness and showed reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent activation in nucleus accumbens at the stimulus onset and in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC), the primary somatosensory cortex, and the posterior insula. Mediation analyses indicated that pain-related activity in the aMCC mediated the relationship between the reactive cortisol response and the pain unpleasantness. Psychophysiological interaction analysis further revealed that higher stress reactivity was associated with reduced functional connectivity between the aMCC and the brainstem. These findings suggest that acute stress modulates pain in humans and contributes to individual variability in pain affect and pain-related brain activity.

MicroRNAs Regulate Human Brain Endothelial Cell-Barrier Function in Inflammation: Implications for Multiple Sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ADVANCE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH; EXPRESSION; ANGIOGENESIS; CANCER; INTEGRITY; MIR-125B; LINE	Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a major hallmark of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Using a genomics approach, we defined a microRNA signature that is diminished at the BBB of MS patients. In particular, miR-125a-5p is a key regulator of brain endothelial tightness and immune cell efflux. Our findings suggest that repair of a disturbed BBB through microRNAs may represent a novel avenue for effective treatment of MS.	[Reijerkerk, Arie; van het Hof, Bert; Drexhage, Joost A.

IMPAIRED STRUCTURAL HIPPOCAMPAL PLASTICITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH EMOTIONAL AND MEMORY DEFICITS IN THE OLFACTORY BULBECTOMIZED RAT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adult neurogenesis; animal model; depression-like behavior; dendritic morphology; Golgi-Cox stain; OBX rat	DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR; MORPHOLOGICAL-CHANGES; MAJOR DEPRESSION; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; DENDRITIC MORPHOLOGY; LEARNING BEHAVIORS; SPATIAL MEMORY; ANIMAL-MODELS; FEMALE RATS; WATER-MAZE	Disturbances in olfactory circuitry have been associated with depression in humans. The olfactory bulbectomized (OBX lesion) has been largely used as a model of depression-like behavior in the rat. However, quantitative neuronal rearrangements in key brain regions in this animal model have not been evaluated yet. Accordingly, we investigated changes in hippocampal plasticity as well as behavioral deficits in this animal model. OBX-induced behavioral deficits were studied in a battery of tests, namely the open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), and spatial memory disturbances in the Morris water maze (MWM). To characterize the neuronal remodeling, neuroanatomical rearrangements were investigated in the CA1 hippocampus and piriform cortex (PirC), brain regions receiving inputs from the olfactory bulbs and associated with emotional or olfactory processes. Additionally, cell proliferation and survival of newborn cells in the adult dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus were also determined. OBX induced hyperlocomotion and enhanced rearing and grooming in the OFT, increased immobility in the FST as well as required a longer time to find the hidden platform in the MWM. OBX also induced dendritic atrophy in the hippocampus and PirC. In addition, cell proliferation was decreased while the survival remained unchanged in the DG of these animals. These various features are also observed in depressed subjects, adding further support to the validity and usefulness of this model to evaluate potential novel antidepressants. (C) 2013 IBRO.

A history of chronic morphine exposure during adolescence increases despair-like behaviour and strain-dependently promotes sociability in abstinent adult mice	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Morphine; Adolescence; Abstinence; Sociability; Depression; Anxiety	MU-OPIOID-RECEPTOR; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; SPONTANEOUS-ALTERNATION PERFORMANCE; COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; ELEVATED PLUS-MAZE; ANIMAL-MODELS; OPIATE WITHDRAWAL; C57BL/6 MICE; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT	A crucial issue in treating opiate addiction, a chronic relapsing disorder, is to maintain a drug-free abstinent state. Prolonged abstinence associates with mood disorders, strongly contributing to relapse. In particular, substance use disorders occurring during adolescence predispose to depression later in adulthood. Using our established mouse model of opiate abstinence, we characterized emotional consequences into adulthood of morphine exposure during adolescence. Our results indicate that morphine treatment in adolescent mice has no effect on anxiety-like behaviours in adult mice, after abstinence. In contrast, morphine treatment during adolescence increases behavioural despair in adult mice. We also show that morphine exposure strain-dependently enhances sociability in adult mice. Additional research will be required to understand where and how morphine acts during brain maturation to affect emotional and social behaviours into adulthood. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Comai, S; Ochoa-Sanchez, R; Gobbi, G				Comai, Stefano; Ochoa-Sanchez, Rafael; Gobbi, Gabriella			Sleep-wake characterization of double MT1/MT2 receptor knockout mice and comparison with MT1 and MT2 receptor knockout mice	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Sleep-wake cycle; Melatonin; MT1 receptor; MT2 receptor; Knockout mice	MELATONIN RECEPTOR; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; DAYTIME SLEEP; RAT; EEG; WAKEFULNESS; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; INSOMNIA; AGONISTS	The neurohormone melatonin activates two G-protein coupled receptors, MT1 and MT2. Melatonin is implicated in circadian rhythms and sleep regulation, but the role of its receptors remains to be defined. We have therefore characterized the spontaneous vigilance states in wild-type (WT) mice and in three different types of transgenic mice: mice with genetic inactivation of MT1 (MT1-/-), MT2 (MT2-/-) and both MT1/MT2 (MT1-/-/MT2-/-) receptors. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic sleep-wake patterns were recorded across the 24-h light-dark cycle. MT(1)(-/-)mice displayed a decrease (-37.3%) of the 24-h rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) time whereas MT(2)(-/-)mice showed a decrease (-17.3%) of the 24-h non rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) time and an increase in wakefulness time (14.8%). These differences were the result of changes occurring in particular during the light/inactive phase. Surprisingly, MT1-/-/MT2-/- mice showed only an increase (8.9%) of the time spent awake during the 24-h. These changes were correlated to a decrease of the REMS EEG theta power in MT(1)(-/-)mice, of the NREMS EEG delta power in MT2-/- mice, and an increase of the REMS and wakefulness EEG theta power in MT1-/-/MT2-/- mice. Our results show that the genetic inactivation of both MT1 and MT2 receptors produces an increase of wakefulness, likely as a result of reduced NREMS due to the lack of MT2 receptors, and reduced REMS induced by the lack of MT1 receptors. Therefore, each melatonin receptor subtype differently regulates the vigilance states: MT2 receptors mainly NREMS, whereas MT1 receptors REMS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Predictions in speech comprehension: fMRI evidence on the meter-semantic interface	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Speech comprehension; Prediction; Facilitation	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; LINKING BASAL GANGLIA; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; SPOKEN SENTENCES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SOURCE MEMORY	When listening to speech we not only form predictions about what is coming next, but also when something is coming. For example, metric stress may be utilized to predict the next salient speech event (i.e. the next stressed syllable) and in turn facilitate speech comprehension. However, speech comprehension can also be facilitated by semantic context, that is, which content word is likely to appear next In the current fMRI experiment we investigated (1) the brain networks that underlie metric and semantic predictions by means of prediction errors, (2) how semantic processing is influenced by a metrically regular or irregular sentence context, and (3) whether task demands influence both processes. The results are three-fold: First, while metrically incongruent sentences activated a bilateral fronto-striatal network, semantically incongruent trials led to activation of fronto-temporal areas. Second, metrically regular context facilitated speech comprehension in the left-fronto-temporal language network. Third, attention directed to metric or semantic aspects in speech engaged different subcomponents of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The current results suggest that speech comprehension relies on different forms of prediction, and extends known speech comprehension networks to subcortical sensorimotor areas.

Methods: The INTEROCC study included cases diagnosed with glioma during 2000-2004 in sub-regions of seven countries. Population controls, selected from various sampling frames in different centers, were frequency or individually matched to cases by sex, age and center. Face-to-face interviews with the subject or a proxy respondent were conducted by trained interviewers. Detailed information was collected on socio-economic and lifestyle characteristics, medical history and work history. Occupational exposure to the 10 selected agents was assessed by a job exposure matrix (JEM) which provides estimates of the probability and level of exposure for different occupations. Using a 25% probability of exposure in a given occupation in the JEM as the threshold for considering a worker exposed, the lifetime prevalence of exposure varied from about 1% to about 15% for the different agents. Associations between glioma and each of the 10 agents were estimated by conditional logistic regression, and using three separate exposure indices: i) ever vs. never; ii) lifetime cumulative exposure; iii) total duration of exposure. Results: The study sample consisted of 1,800 glioma cases and 5,160 controls. Most odds ratio estimates were close to the null value. None of the ten agents displayed a significantly increased odds ratio nor any indication of dose-response relationships with cumulative exposure or with duration of exposure. Conclusion: Thus, there was no evidence that these exposures influence risk of glioma.

Interactions Between the Nucleus Accumbens and Auditory Cortices Predict Music Reward Value	SCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN STRIATUM; HUMAN BRAIN; DOPAMINE; ERRORS; BEHAVIOR; EMOTION; CORTEX	We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural processes when music gains reward value the first time it is heard. The degree of activity in the mesolimbic striatal regions, especially the nucleus accumbens, during music listening was the best predictor of the amount listeners were willing to spend on previously unheard music in an auction paradigm. Importantly, the auditory cortices, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal regions showed increased activity during listening conditions requiring valuation, but did not predict reward value, which was instead predicted by increasing functional connectivity of these regions with the nucleus accumbens as the reward value increased. Thus, aesthetic rewards arise from the interaction between mesolimbic reward circuitry and cortical networks involved in perceptual analysis and valuation.

Identification of Selective Inhibitors for Human Neuraminidase Isoenzymes Using C4,C7-Modified 2-Deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic Acid (DANA) Analogues	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PLASMA-MEMBRANE GLYCOPROTEINS; CYTOSOLIC SIALIDASE NEU2; SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION; LYSOSOMAL SIALIDASE; CELL-SURFACE; ERYTHROCYTE-MEMBRANES; BETA-GALACTOSIDASE; AUTOMATED DOCKING; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; VIRUS SIALIDASE	In the past two decades, human neuraminidases (human sialidases, hNEUs) have been found to be involved in numerous pathways in biology. The development of selective and potent inhibitors of these enzymes will provide critical tools for glycobiology, help to avoid undesired side effects of antivirals, and may reveal new small-molecule therapeutic targets for human cancers. However, because of the high active site homology of the hNEU isoenzymes, little progress in the design and synthesis of selective inhibitors has been realized. Guided by our previous studies of human NEU3 inhibitors, we designed a series of C4,C7-modified analogues of 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA) and tested them against the full panel of hNEU isoenzymes (NEU1, NEU2, NEU3, NEU4). We identified inhibitors with up to 38-fold selectivity for NEU3 and 12-fold selectivity for NEU2 over all other isoenzymes. We also identified compounds that targeted NEU2 and NEU3 with similar potency.

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is critical for cell growth and proliferation. Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain) is one of the most important upstream regulators of mTORC1. Here, we attempted to clarify the role of Rheb in the heart using cardiac-specific Rheb-deficient mice (Rheb(-/-)). Rheb(-/-) mice died from postnatal day 8 to 10. The heart-to-body weight ratio, an index of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in Rheb(-/-) was lower than that in the control (Rheb(+/+)) at postnatal day 8. The cell surface area of cardiomyocytes isolated from the mouse hearts increased from postnatal days 5 to 8 in Rheb(+/+) mice but not in Rheb(-/-) mice. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that sarcomere maturation was impaired in Rheb(-/-) hearts during the neonatal period. Rheb(-/-) hearts exhibited no difference in the phosphorylation level of S6 or 4E-BP1, downstream of mTORC1 at postnatal day 3 but showed attenuation at postnatal day 5 or 8 compared with the control. Polysome analysis revealed that the mRNA translation activity decreased in Rheb(-/-) hearts at postnatal day 8. Furthermore, ablation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 in Rheb(-/-) mice improved mRNA translation, cardiac hypertrophic growth, sarcomere maturation, and survival. Thus, Rheb-dependent mTORC1 activation becomes essential for cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth after early postnatal period.

J	Albert, PR; Benkelfat, C				Albert, Paul R.; Benkelfat, Chawki			The neurobiology of depression-revisiting the serotonin hypothesis. II. Genetic, epigenetic and clinical studies Introduction	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						serotonin; depression; anxiety; genetics; epigenetics; antidepressant	ADULT-RAT NEOCORTEX; ANTIDEPRESSANT FLUOXETINE; NERVE-TERMINALS; RECEPTOR	The serotonin system originates from a small number of neurons (a few hundred thousand of the 100 billion in man) located in the midbrain raphe nuclei, that project widely throughout the central nervous system to influence a large array of inter-related biological functions, not least of which are circuits involved in mood and emotion. The serotonin hypothesis of depression has postulated that a reduction in serotonin leads to increased predisposition to depression. Indeed, it has become evident from therapeutic strategies that affect serotonin activity, that alterations in serotonin may not only predispose to depression, but also to aggressive behaviour, impulsivity, obsessive-compulsive behaviour and suicide. Many potential mechanisms known to alter the genes that regulate the serotonin system, including developmental epigenetic modifications, are presented, as additional evidence implicating the serotonin system. This second issue of two special issues of Philosophical Transactions B presents a series of reviews, perspectives and new findings that argue that the serotonin hypothesis remains an important idea that continues to guide research into the aetiology and treatment of depression.

Alterations in these systems are often associated with depression. However, neither are sufficient to cause depression in and of themselves. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the environment plays a crucial role, particularly, the perinatal environment. In this review, we posit that early environmental stress triggers a series of epigenetic mechanisms that adapt the genome and programme the HPA axis and 5-HT system for survival in a harsh environment. We focus on DNA methylation as it is the most stable epigenetic mark. Given that DNA methylation patterns are in large part set within the perinatal period, long-term gene expression programming by DNA methylation is especially vulnerable to environmental insults during this period. We discuss specific examples of genes in the 5-HT system (serotonin transporter) and HPA axis (glucocorticoid receptor and arginine vasopressin enhancer) whose DNA methylation state is associated with early life experience and may potentially lead to depression vulnerability. We conclude with a discussion on the relevance of studying epigenetic mechanisms in peripheral tissue as a proxy for those occurring in the human brain and suggest avenues for future research.

J	Young, SN				Young, Simon N.			The effect of raising and lowering tryptophan levels on human mood and social behaviour	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						tryptophan; serotonin; mood; social behaviour	ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG-ACTION; HEALTHY FEMALE VOLUNTEERS; AMINO-ACID MIXTURES; MONOAMINE DEPLETION; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; DEPRESSED-PATIENTS; 5-HT1A RECEPTOR; SEROTONIN; BRAIN; RECOGNITION	Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) studies indicate that low serotonin can lower mood and also increase aggression, although results vary somewhat between studies with similar participants. Lowering of mood after ATD is related to the susceptibility of the study participants to clinical depression, and some participants show no effect on mood. This indicates that low serotonin can contribute to lowered mood, but cannot-by itself-cause lowered mood, unless other unknown systems interact with serotonin to lower mood. Studies using tryptophan supplementation demonstrate that increased serotonin can decrease quarrelsomeness and increase agreeableness in everyday life. Social interactions that are more agreeable and less quarrelsome are associated with better mood. Thus, serotonin may have direct effects on mood, but may also be able to influence mood through changes in social behaviour. The increased agreeableness and decreased quarrelsomeness resulting from increases in serotonin will help foster congenial relations with others and should help to increase social support. As social support and social isolation have an important relationship with both physical and mental health, more research is needed on the implications of the ability of serotonin to modulate social behaviour for the regulation of mood, and for future physical and mental health.

Studies in animals have provided insight into the biochemical and connectivity processes underlying such communication. However, to date no experiments that link these factors in humans in vivo have been carried out. To investigate the role of glutamate in individual differences in communication between the cortex - specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) - and subcortical regions in humans, a combination of resting-state fMRI, DTI and MRS was performed. The subcortical target regions were the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsomedial thalamus (DMT), and periaqueductal grey (PAG). It was found that functional connectivity between the mPFC and each of the NAc and DMT was positively correlated with mPFC glutamate concentrations, whilst functional connectivity between the mPFC and PAG was negatively correlated with glutamate concentration. The correlations involving mPFC glutamate and FC between the mPFC and each of the DMT and PAG were mirrored by correlations with structural connectivity, providing evidence that the glutamatergic relationship may, in part, be due to direct connectivity. These results are in agreement with existing results from animal studies and may have relevance for MDD and schizophrenia.

Maturation of basket synapses in postnatal cortex is activity dependent. In particular, activity-dependent downregulation of polysialiac acid carried by the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) regulates the timing of their maturation. Whether and how NCAM per se affects GABAergic synapse development is unknown. Using single-cell genetics to knock out NCAM in individual basket interneurons in mouse cortical slice cultures, at specific developmental time periods, we found that NCAM loss during perisomatic synapse formation impairs the process of basket cell axonal branching and bouton formation. However, loss of NCAM once the synapses are already formed did not show any effect. We further show that NCAM120 and NCAM140, but not the NCAM180 isoform, rescue the phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that a dominant-negative form of Fyn kinase mimics, whereas a constitutively active form of Fyn kinase rescues, the effects of NCAM knockdown. Altogether, our data suggest that NCAM120/NCAM140-mediated Fyn activation promotes GABAergic synapse maturation in postnatal cortex.

Experience-Dependent Modulation of Feedback Integration during Singing: Role of the Right Anterior Insula	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SPEECH PRODUCTION; VOICE F-0; MOTOR CORTEX; HEMISPHERIC LATERALIZATION; SOMATOSENSORY FEEDBACK; FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; LARYNGEAL MUSCLES; BASAL GANGLIA; PITCH CONTROL; BRAIN	Somatosensation plays an important role in the motor control of vocal functions, yet its neural correlate and relation to vocal learning is not well understood. We used fMRI in 17 trained singers and 12 nonsingers to study the effects of vocal-fold anesthesia on the vocal-motor singing network as a function of singing expertise. Tasks required participants to sing musical target intervals under normal conditions and after anesthesia. At the behavioral level, anesthesia altered pitch accuracy in both groups, but singers were less affected than nonsingers, indicating an experience-dependent effect of the intervention. At the neural level, this difference was accompanied by distinct patterns of decreased activation in singers (cortical and subcortical sensory and motor areas) and nonsingers (subcortical motor areas only) respectively, suggesting that anesthesia affected the higher-level voluntary (explicit) motor and sensorimotor integration network more in experienced singers, and the lower-level (implicit) subcortical motor loops in nonsingers. The right anterior insular cortex (AIC) was identified as the principal area dissociating the effect of expertise as a function of anesthesia by three separate sources of evidence. First, it responded differently to anesthesia in singers (decreased activation) and nonsingers (increased activation). Second, functional connectivity between AIC and bilateral A1, M1, and S1 was reduced in singers but augmented in nonsingers. Third, increased BOLD activity in right AIC in singers was correlated with larger pitch deviation under anesthesia. We conclude that the right AIC and sensory-motor areas play a role in experience-dependent modulation of feedback integration for vocal motor control during singing.

Direct comparisons between the results obtained using VBM and the underlying histology are limited, however. To circumvent the problems inherent in comparing VBM data in vivo with tissue samples that must generally be obtained postmortem, we chose to consider GABA(A) receptors, measured using F-18-flumazenil PET (18F-FMZ-PET), as non-invasive neural markers to be compared with VBM data. Consistent with previous cortical thickness findings, GABAA receptor binding potential (BPND) was found to correlate positively across regions with grey matter (GM) density. These findings confirm that there is a general positive relationship between MRI-based GM density measures and GABA(A) receptor BPND on a region-by-region basis (i.e., regions with more GM tend to also have higher BPND).

Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Disease Using Model-Based MR and Magnetization Transfer Imaging	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							RELAXATION; ATROPHY; VALIDATION; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; AD	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early stratification of degenerative processes is a prerequisite to warrant therapeutic options in prodromal Alzheimer disease. Our aim was to investigate differences in cerebral macromolecular tissue composition between patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and age- and sex-matched healthy controls by using model-based magnetization transfer with a binary spin-bath magnetization transfer model and magnetization transfer ratio at 1.5T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated patients with de novo AD (n = 18), MCI (n = 18), and CTRLs (n = 18). A region-of-interest analysis of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampal head and body, insula, and temporal neocortex was performed with fuzzy clustering to associate every subregion to a cluster representative for each group. RESULTS: Cluster analysis achieved a concordance of 0.92 (50 of 54 subjects) between a combination of the calculated mMT parameters (kf, kr, T2r, F, T2f) in the entorhinal cortex and the neuropsychological diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity for the discrimination of AD from MCI reached 1 and 0.94, with a positive predictive value of 0.95 and a negative predictive value of 1. Compared with mMT, the concordance for MTR was 0.83 (45 of 54 subjects) with a lower specificity of 0.5 and positive predictive value of 0.67 to discriminate patients with AD and MCI. CONCLUSIONS: mMT imaging detects macromolecule-related alterations and allows an improved classification of patients with early AD and MCI compared with MTR.

It can be performed and interpreted at the bedside. This review explores the value of the transcranial Doppler technique as a confirmatory tool for brain death. The early confirmation of brain death enables the treating physicians in early decision-making and family counseling toward better care approaches, including the option of organ donation for transplantation at the appropriate time. We recommend this modality be incorporated as part of the brain death criteria in the Saudi Arabian health care system guidelines and utilized in different tiers of our hospital system.

Digital media, the developing brain and the interpretive plasticity of neuroplasticity	TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						adolescence; brain development; cognitive neuroscience; extended mind; Internet; plasticity	VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES; ADOLESCENT BRAIN; NEURAL BASIS; ATTENTION; CHILDREN; TASK; FMRI; INHIBITION; ENGAGEMENT; PREDICTION	The use and misuse of digital technologies among adolescents has been the focus of fiery debates among parents, educators, policy-makers and in the media. Recently, these debates have become shaped by emerging data from cognitive neuroscience on the development of the adolescent brain and cognition. Neuroplasticity has functioned as a powerful metaphor in arguments both for and against the pervasiveness of digital media cultures that increasingly characterize teenage life. In this paper, we propose that the debates concerning adolescents are the meeting point of two major social anxieties both of which are characterized by the threat of abnormal (social) behaviour: existing moral panics about adolescent behaviour in general and the growing alarm about intense, addictive, and widespread media consumption in modern societies. Neuroscience supports these fears but the same kinds of evidence are used to challenge these fears and reframe them in positive terms. Here, we analyze discourses about digital media, the Internet, and the adolescent brain in the scientific and lay literature. We argue that while the evidential basis is thin and ambiguous, it has immense social influence. We conclude by suggesting how we might move beyond the poles of neuro-alarmism and neuro-enthusiasm. By analyzing the neurological adolescent in the digital age as a socially extended mind, firstly, in the sense that adolescent cognition is distributed across the brain, body, and digital media tools and secondly, by viewing adolescent cognition as enabled and transformed by the institution of neuroscience, we aim to displace the normative terms of current debates.

Little is known about the communicating hydrocephalus that is seen with a smaller VS. Methods The clinicopathological findings and follow up of three patients with communicating hydrocephalus associated with a small VS are presented. Results Four patients aged 40 to 66 years (mean: 57.7) presented with ataxia, dementia, and urinary incontinence. The VS were 2.0 to 2.4 cm. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was elevated in three patients in whom it was measured (1.7 to 6 times normal). The VS was resected in two patients. All of the patients required ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS). All of the patients were asymptomatic or improved at follow-up at 9 months to 13 years. Conclusion Communicating hydrocephalus associated with a VS can occur in younger patients than was previously thought. An elevated CSF protein appears to be important, but other factors may be involved. A shunting procedure is often required to relieve the symptoms of hydrocephalus even if the tumor is resected. Possible etiological causes of communicating hydrocephalus in patients with a small VS are discussed.

Herein we model this growth, where chemotropic forcing leads the axon, by a phase field method utilizing two dynamical fields assigned respectively to the cell and to its leading edge. Additionally we quantify the condition for the retraction of the axon which takes place when the cell fails to form a synaptic connection.
