Nonetheless, the in vivo pharmacological binding profile of this drug is still unclear. This study uses mice lacking mu (MOP), kappa (KOP) or delta (DOP) opioid receptors as well as mice lacking all three opioid receptors to provide full characterisation of oxymorphone binding sites in the brain. Saturation binding studies using [H-3]oxymorphone revealed high affinity binding sites in mouse brain displaying Kd of 1.7 nM and Bmax of 147 fmol/mg. Furthermore, we performed quantitative autoradiography binding studies using [H-3]oxymorphone in mouse brain. The distribution of [H-3]oxymorphone binding sites was found to be similar to the selective MOP agonist [H-3]DAMGO in the mouse brain. [H-3]Oxymorphone binding was completely abolished across the majority of the brain regions in mice lacking MOP as well as in mice lacking all three opioid receptors. DOP and KOP knockout mice retained [H-3]oxymorphone binding sites suggesting oxymorphone may not target DOP or KOP. These results confirm that the MOP, and not the DOP or the KOP is the main high affinity binding target for oxymorphone. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						prostate cancer; tumour stroma; stromal markers; asporin	RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; TUMOR PROGRESSION; REACTIVE STROMA; RB DEFICIENCY; PLAP-1/ASPORIN; RECURRENCE; CARCINOMA; CELLS; FIBROBLASTS; GROWTH	Background: Prostate cancer shows considerable heterogeneity in disease progression and we propose that markers expressed in tumour stroma may be reliable predictors of aggressive tumour subtypes. Methods: We have used Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multivariate analysis to correlate the expression of Asporin (ASPN) mRNA and protein with prostate cancer progression in independent cohorts. We used immunohistochemistry and H scoring to document stromal localisation of ASPN in a tissue microarray and mouse prostate cancer model, and correlated expression with reactive stroma, defined using Masson Trichrome staining. We used cell cultures of primary prostate cancer fibroblasts treated with serum-free conditioned media from prostate cancer cell lines to examine regulation of ASPN mRNA in tumour stromal cells. Results: We observed increased expression of ASPN mRNA in a data set derived from benign vs tumour microdissected tissue, and a correlation with biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analysis. ASPN protein localised to tumour stroma and elevated expression of ASPN was correlated with decreased time to biochemical recurrence, in a cohort of 326 patients with a median follow up of 9.6 years. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that ASPN was correlated with progression, as were Gleason score, and clinical stage. Additionally, ASPN expression correlated with the presence of reactive stroma, suggesting that it may be a stromal marker expressed in response to the presence of tumour cells and particularly with aggressive tumour subtypes. We observed expression of ASPN in the stroma of tumours induced by p(53) inhibition in a mouse model of prostate cancer, and correlation with neuroendocrine marker expression. Finally, we demonstrated that ASPN transcript expression in normal and cancer fibroblasts was regulated by conditioned media derived from the PC3, but not LNCaP, prostate cancer cell lines. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ASPN is a stromally expressed biomarker that correlates with disease progression, and is observed in reactive stroma. ASPN expression in stroma may be part of a stromal response to aggressive tumour subtypes.

Food entrainment allows the body to efficiently realign the internal timing of behavioral and physiological functions such that they anticipate food intake. Food entrainment can occur with or without caloric restriction, as seen with daily schedules of restricted feeding (RF) or restricted treat (RT) that restrict food or treat intake to a single feeding time. However, the extent of clock gene control is more pronounced with caloric restriction, highlighting the role of energy balance in regulating clock genes. Recent studies have implicated dopamine (DA) to be involved in food entrainment and caloric restriction is known to affect dopaminergic pathways to enhance locomotor activity. Since food entrainment results in the development of a distinct behavioral component, called food anticipatory activity (FAA), we examined the role of locomotor sensitization (LS) in food entrainment by 1) observing whether amphetamine (AMPH) sensitization results in enhanced locomotor output of FAA and 2) measuring LS of circadian and non-circadian feeding paradigms to an acute injection of AMPH (AMPH cross-sensitization). Unexpectedly, AMPH sensitization did not show enhancement of FAA. On the contrary, LS did develop with sufficient exposure to RF. LS was present after 2 weeks of RF, but not after 1, 3 or 7 days into RF. When food was returned and rats regain their original body weight at 10-15 days post-RF, LS remained present. LS did not develop to RT, nor to feedings of a non-circadian schedule, e.g. variable restricted feeding (VRF) or variable RT (VRT). Further, when RF was timed to the dark period, LS was observed only when tested at night; RF timed to the light period resulted in LS that was present during day and night. Taken together our results show that LS develops with food entrainment to RF, an effect that is dependent on the chronicity and circadian phase of RF but independent of body weight. Given that LS involves reorganization of DA-regulated motor circuitry, our work provides indirect support for the role of DA in the food entrainment pathway of RF. The findings also suggest differences in neuronal pathways involved in LS from AMPH sensitization and LS from RF.

Traditionally, FFRs are recorded under close-field conditions (earphones), but free-field stimulations (loudspeaker) have yet to be attempted, which would increase the applications of FFRs by making this technique accessible to those who cannot wear inserted transducers. Here we test the feasibility and reliability of measuring speech ABRs across free and close-field. New method: The FFR was evoked by a 40-ms consonant-vowel (cv) /da/ syllable which was presented in the standard close-field conditions with insert earphones, and in a novel free-field condition via a loudspeaker. Results: A well-defined FFR was observed for each stimulating method (free or close-field). We show that it is possible and reliable to elicit FFRs from a speaker and that these do not systematically differ from those elicited by conventional earphones. Comparison with existing method: Neural responses were subjected to a comparative within-subjects analysis, using standard measures found in the literature in order to quantify and compare the intrinsic (amplitude, noise, consistency), acoustic (latency, spectral amplitude) and reliability properties (intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland and Altman limits of agreement) of the neural signal. Conclusions: Reliable FFRs can be elicited using free-field presentation with comparable to acoustical, intrinsic and reliability properties as those elicited by standard close-field presentations.

Infant frontal EEG asymmetry in relation with postnatal maternal depression and parenting behavior	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; CHILDREN; MOTHERS; SENSITIVITY; ATTACHMENT; POWER; EMOTION; ADOLESCENTS	Right frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry associates with negative affect and depressed mood, which, among children, are predicted by maternal depression and poor parenting. This study examined associations of maternal depression and maternal sensitivity with infant frontal EEG asymmetry based on 111 mother-6-month-infant dyads. There were no significant effects of postnatal maternal depression or maternal sensitivity, or their interaction, on infant EEG frontal asymmetry. However, in a subsample for which the infant spent at least 50% of his/her day time hours with his/her mother, both lower maternal sensitivity and higher maternal depression predicted greater relative right frontal EEG asymmetry. Our study further showed that greater relative right frontal EEG asymmetry of 6-month-old infants predicted their greater negative emotionality at 12 months of age. Our study suggested that among infants with sufficient postnatal maternal exposure, both maternal sensitivity and mental health are important influences on early brain development.	[Wen, D.

Here, we demonstrate that the induction of three transcription factors (SOX10, OLIG2, NKX6.2) in iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells is sufficient to rapidly generate O4(+) OL with an efficiency of up to 70% in 28 d and a global gene-expression profile comparable to primary human OL. We further demonstrate that iPSC-derived OL disperse and myelinate the CNS of Mbp(shi/shi) Rag(-/-) mice during development and after demyelination, are suitable for in vitro myelination assays, disease modeling, and screening of pharmacological compounds potentially promoting oligodendroglial differentiation. Thus, the strategy presented here to generate OL from iPSC may facilitate the studying of human myelin diseases and the development of high-throughput screening platforms for drug discovery.

Here, we discuss a number of these distinct features, including brain-resident cell types, the blood-brain barrier, and various aspects of the immune-suppressive environment. We also highlight recent advances in therapeutically targeting the brain TME in cancer. By developing a comprehensive understanding of the complex and interconnected microenvironmental landscape of brain malignancies we will greatly expand the range of therapeutic strategies available to target these deadly diseases.

But in the laboratory these transitions afford a unique view of how experience is transformed from the perceptually grounded consciousness of wakefulness to the hallucinatory simulations of dreaming. The present review considers imagery in the sleep-onset transition" microdreams" in particular-as an alternative object of study to dreaming as traditionally studied in the sleep lab. A focus on microdream phenomenology has thus far proven fruitful in preliminary efforts to (i) develop a classification for dreaming's core phenomenology (the "oneiragogic spectrum"), (ii) establish a structure for assessing dreaming's multiple memory inputs ("multi-temporal memory sources"), (iii) further Silberer's project for classifying sleep-onset images in relation to waking cognition by revealing two new imagery types ("autosensory imagery," "exosensory imagery"), and (iv) embed a potential understanding of microdreaming processes in a larger explanatory framework ("multisensory integration approach"). Such efforts may help resolve outstanding questions about dream neurophysiology and dreaming's role in memory consolidation during sleep but may also advance discovery in the neuroscience of consciousness more broadly.

Here, we established the efficacy of cell type-specific low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in controlling ictogenesis in the mouse entorhinal cortex (EC) in an in vitro brain slice preparation. Specifically, we used 1 Hz optogenetic stimulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-positive principal cells as well as of parvalbumin or somatostatin-positive interneurons to study the effects of such repetitive activation on epileptiform discharges induced by 4-aminopyridine. We found that 1Hz stimulation of any of these cell types reduced the frequency and duration of ictal discharges in some trials, while completely blocking them in others. The field responses evoked by the stimulation of each cell type revealed that their duration and amplitude were higher when principal cells were targeted. Furthermore, following a short period of silence ranging from 67 to 135 s, ictal discharges were re-established with similar duration and frequency as before stimulation; however, this period of silence was longer following principal cell stimulation compared with parvalbumin-or somatostatin-positive interneuron stimulation. Our results show that LFS of either excitatory or inhibitory cell networks in EC are effective in controlling ictogenesis. Although optogenetic stimulation of either cell type significantly reduced the occurrence of ictal discharges, principal cell stimulation resulted in a more prolonged suppression of ictogenesis, and, thus, it may constitute a better approach for controlling seizures.

J	Hayward, DA; Ristic, J				Hayward, Dana A.; Ristic, Jelena			Feature and motion-based gaze cuing is linked with reduced social competence	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; EYE GAZE; VISUAL-ATTENTION; ARROW-CUES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; NETWORK SIZE; HUMAN BRAIN; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION	Gaze following is a fundamental ability that plays an important role in human social function. However, the link between these two processes remains elusive. On the one hand, typically developing persons show robust gaze following in laboratory cuing tasks. On the other hand, investigations with individuals with autism suggest that reduced social competence in this population may partly reflect an atypical access to social information through attending to perceptual changes that normally accompany gaze shifts, like luminance or motion transients. Here we investigated if gaze cuing in typically developing individuals was modulated by similar task-irrelevant perceptual changes. In Experiment 1, a social gaze cue was presented with or without a luminance change. In Experiment 2, a social gaze cue was presented together with a motion cue. Both experiments indicated reduced magnitudes of gaze cuing in persons with low social competence on trials containing an irrelevant perceptual change. This suggests that similarly to individuals with autism, typically developing persons with low social competence also utilize idiosyncratic perceptual changes in the environment to access social content, revealing strong links between basic gaze following abilities and a range of social competence within typical individuals.

The sensorimotor synapse of Aplysia expresses different forms of long-term facilitation (LTF)-nonassociative and associative LTF-that require the timely activation of kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC). It is not known which PKC isoforms in the sensory neuron or motor neuron L7 are required to sustain each form of LTF. We show that different PKMs, the constitutively active isoforms of PKCs generated by calpain cleavage, in the sensory neuron and L7 are required to maintain each form of LTF. Different PKMs or calpain isoforms were blocked by overexpressing specific dominant-negative constructs in either presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons. Blocking either PKM Apl I in L7, or PKM Apl II or PKM Apl III in the sensory neuron 2 d after 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) treatment reversed persistent nonassociative LTF. In contrast, blocking either PKM Apl II or PKM Apl III in L7, or PKM Apl II in the sensory neuron 2 d after paired stimuli reversed persistent associative LTF. Blocking either classical calpain or atypical small optic lobe (SOL) calpain 2 d after 5-HT treatment or paired stimuli did not disrupt the maintenance of persistent LTF. Soon after 5-HT treatment or paired stimuli, however, blocking classical calpain inhibited the expression of persistent associative LTF, while blocking SOL calpain inhibited the expression of persistent nonassociative LTF. Our data suggest that different stimuli activate different calpains that generate specific sets of PKMs in each neuron whose constitutive activities sustain long-term synaptic plasticity.

Meta-analysis identifies novel risk loci and yields systematic insights into the biology of male-pattern baldness	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; HAIR-GROWTH CYCLE; DERMAL PAPILLA CELLS; ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA; PROSTATE-CANCER; SUSCEPTIBILITY VARIANTS; HUMAN PIGMENTATION; FOLLICLE; GENE; AGE	Male-pattern baldness (MPB) is a common and highly heritable trait characterized by androgen-dependent, progressive hair loss from the scalp. Here, we carry out the largest GWAS meta-analysis of MPB to date, comprising 10,846 early-onset cases and 11,672 controls from eight independent cohorts. We identify 63 MPB-associated loci (P<5 x 10(-8), METAL) of which 23 have not been reported previously. The 63 loci explain similar to 39% of the phenotypic variance in MPB and highlight several plausible candidate genes (FGF5, IRF4, DKK2) and pathways (melatonin signalling, adipogenesis) that are likely to be implicated in the key-pathophysiological features of MPB and may represent promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic options. The data provide molecular evidence that rather than being an isolated trait, MPB shares a substantial biological basis with numerous other human phenotypes and may deserve evaluation as an early prognostic marker, for example, for prostate cancer, sudden cardiac arrest and neurodegenerative disorders.

Small-Molecule Stabilization of 14-3-3 Protein-Protein Interactions Stimulates Axon Regeneration	NEURON			English	Article							KINASE GCN2; BINDING; CELLS; PHOSPHORYLATION; FUSICOCCIN; RECEPTOR; GROWTH; 14-3-3-EPSILON; IDENTIFICATION; DIMERIZATION	Damaged central nervous system (CNS) neurons have a poor ability to spontaneously regenerate, causing persistent functional deficits after injury. Therapies that stimulate axon growth are needed to repair CNS damage. 14-3-3 adaptors are hub proteins that are attractive targets to manipulate cell signaling. We identify a positive role for 14-3-3s in axon growth and uncover a developmental regulation of the phosphorylation and function of 14-3-3s. We show that fusicoccin-A (FC-A), a small-molecule stabilizer of 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions, stimulates axon growth in vitro and regeneration in vivo. We show that FC-A stabilizes a complex between 14-3-3 and the stress response regulator GCN1, inducing GCN1 turnover and neurite outgrowth. These findings show that 14-3-3 adaptor protein complexes are druggable targets and identify a new class of small molecules that may be further optimized for the repair of CNS damage.

Mitochondrial energy deficiency leads to hyperproliferation of skeletal muscle mitochondria and enhanced insulin sensitivity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						mitochondria; skeletal muscle; ANT1; insulin sensitivity	PERMEABILITY TRANSITION PORE; DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR 15; UNCOUPLING PROTEIN-1; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; LIPID-METABOLISM; RESISTANCE; EXPRESSION; MICE; GENES; DNA	Diabetes is associated with impaired glucose metabolism in the presence of excess insulin. Glucose and fatty acids provide reducing equivalents to mitochondria to generate energy, and studies have reported mitochondrial dysfunction in type II diabetes patients. If mitochondrial dysfunction can cause diabetes, then we hypothesized that increased mitochondrial metabolism should render animals resistant to diabetes. This was confirmed in mice in which the heart-muscle-brain adenine nucleotide translocator isoform 1 (ANT1) was inactivated. ANT1-deficient animals are insulin-hypersensitive, glucose-tolerant, and resistant to high fat diet (HFD)-induced toxicity. In ANT1-deficient skeletal muscle, mitochondrial gene expression is induced in association with the hyperproliferation of mitochondria. The ANT1-deficient muscle mitochondria produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are partially uncoupled. Hence, the muscle respiration under nonphosphorylating conditions is increased. Muscle transcriptome analysis revealed the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, down-regulation of diabetes-related genes, and increased expression of the genes encoding the myokines FGF21 and GDF15. However, FGF21 was not elevated in serum, and FGF21 and UCP1 mRNAs were not induced in liver or brown adipose tissue (BAT). Hence, increased oxidation of dietary-reducing equivalents by elevated muscle mitochondrial respiration appears to be the mechanism by which ANT1-deficient mice prevent diabetes, demonstrating that the rate of mitochondrial oxidation of calories is important in the etiology of metabolic disease.

However, little is known of the specific neural network supporting the sensitivity to social stressors in patients at risk of suicidal acts. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, we investigated brain processing of social rejection in suicide attempters. Thirty-six euthymic women with a history of depression and suicidal behavior were compared to 41 euthymic women with a history of depression but no suicidal attempt, and 28 healthy controls. The Cyberball Game was used as a validated social exclusion paradigm. Relative to healthy controls, both patient groups reported higher levels of social distress related to the task, without significant differences according to suicidal status. Compared to patients without any history of suicide attempt and healthy controls, suicide attempters showed decreased contrast in the left insula and supramarginal gyrus during the exclusion vs. inclusion condition, after controlling for number of depressive episodes, medication, mood disorder type or social phobia. Our study highlights impaired brain response to social exclusion in euthymic female suicide attempters in regions previously implicated in pain tolerance and social cognition. These findings suggest sustained brain dysfunctions related to social perception in suicide attempters.

Subcortical Shape Changes, Hippocampal Atrophy and Cortical Thinning in Future Alzheimer's Disease Patients	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; mild cognitive impairment; cortical thickness; subcortical shape analysis; hippocampal subelds	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BASAL GANGLIA; THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS; MEMORY DEFICITS; HUMAN THALAMUS; TAU-PATHOLOGY; AD DEMENTIA; HUMAN BRAIN; MRI; SUBFIELDS	Efficacy of future treatments depends on biomarkers identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment at highest risk for transitioning to Alzheimer's disease. Here, we applied recently developed analysis techniques to investigate cross-sectional differences in subcortical shape and volume alterations in patients with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 23, age range 59-82, 47.8% female), future converters at baseline (n = 10, age range 66-84, 90% female) and at time of conversion (age range 68-87) compared to group-wise age and gender matched healthy control subjects (n = 23, age range 61-81, 47.8% female; n = 10, age range 66-82, 80% female; n = 10, age range 68-82, 70% female). Additionally, we studied cortical thinning and global and local measures of hippocampal atrophy as known key imaging markers for Alzheimer's disease. Apart from bilateral striatal volume reductions, no morphometric alterations were found in cognitively stable patients. In contrast, we identified shape alterations in striatal and thalamic regions in future converters at baseline and at time of conversion. These shape alterations were paralleled by Alzheimer's disease like patterns of left hemispheric morphometric changes ( cortical thinning in medial temporal regions, hippocampal total and subfield atrophy) in future converters at baseline with progression to similar right hemispheric alterations at time of conversion. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that subcortical shape alterations may outperform hippocampal volume in identifying future converters at baseline. These results further confirm the key role of early cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. But first and foremost, and by distinguishing future converters but not patients with stable cognitive abilities from cognitively normal subjects, our results support the value of early subcortical shape alterations and reduced hippocampal subfield volumes as potential markers for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

To investigate this issue, we have examined (1) if fedratinib can produce or alter the course of this disorder, (2) its effects on thiamine dependent enzyme activity and thiamine status, and (3) its influence on the uptake of thiamine. Animals administered fedratinib for 28 days at a comparable dose used to treat human cases of myelofibrosis showed no evidence of clinical signs of thiamine deficiency (TD). Rats treated with a combination of fedratinib and TD exhibited no neurological differences in their progress to the symptomatic stage when compared to thiamine-deficient animals only. Treatment with the JAK-2 inhibitor did not compromise erythrocyte transketolase activity, and thiamine status was not affected in a major way unlike animals with TD. In addition, treatment of cultured astrocytes with fedratinib did not diminish the uptake of thiamine into these cells. Our findings suggest that treatment with fedratinib does not lead to or alter the progress of TD, and do not support the notion that administration of this JAK-2 inhibitor directly results in the development of WE due to inhibition of thiamine transport. Known adverse effects of fedratinib involving compromised gastrointestinal function may be an important indirect contributing factor to previously reported cases of WE in patients with myelofibrosis.

Surveillance report of Zika virus among Canadian travellers returning from the Americas	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article							GEOSENTINEL SURVEILLANCE; SEXUAL TRANSMISSION; INFECTION; INDICATORS; ILLNESS; DENGUE; FETAL	BACKGROUND: Widespread transmission of Zika virus in the Americas has occurred since late 2015. We examined demographic and travel-related characteristics of returned Canadian travellers with Zika infection acquired in the Americas to illuminate risk factors for acquisition and the clinical spectrum. METHODS: We analyzed demographic and travel-related data for returned Canadian travellers who presented to a CanTravNet site between October 2015 and September 2016 for care of Zika virus acquired in the Americas. Data were collected with use of the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network data platform. RESULTS: During the study period, 1118 travellers presented to a CanTravNet site after returning from the Americas, 41 (3.7%) of whom had Zika infection. Zika infection from the Americas was diagnosed at CanTravNet sites as often as dengue (n = 41) over the study period. In the first half of the study period, Zika virus burden was borne by people visiting friends and relatives in South America. In the latter half, coincident with the increased spread of Zika throughout the Caribbean and Central America, Zika virus occurred more often in tourists in the Caribbean. Forty (98%) of the travellers with Zika infection acquired it through probable mosquito exposure, and 1 had confirmed sexual acquisition. Congenital transmission occurred in 2 of 3 pregnancies. Two (5%) of those with Zika had symptoms resembling those of Guillain-Barre syndrome, 1 of whom also had Zika viral meningitis. INTERPRETATION: Even in this small cohort, we observed the full clinical spectrum of acute Zika virus, including adverse fetal and neurologic outcomes. Our observations suggest that complications from Zika infection are underestimated by data arising exclusively from populations where Zika is endemic. Travellers should adhere to mosquito-avoidance measures and barrier protection during sexual activity.

The aim of this functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study was to analyze interactions between two paradigms to investigate the brain gait control network: (1) mental imagery of gait, and (2) passive mechanical stimulation of the plantar surface of the foot with the Korvit boots. The Korvit stimulator was used through two different modes, namely an organized ("gait like") sequence and a destructured (chaotic) pattern. Eighteen right-handed young healthy volunteers were recruited (mean age, 27 +/- 4.7 years). Mental imagery activated a broad neuronal network including the supplementary motor area-proper (SMA-proper), pre-SMA, the dorsal premotor cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and precuneus/superior parietal areas. The mechanical plantar stimulation activated the primary sensorimotor cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex bilaterally. The paradigms generated statistically common areas of activity, notably bilateral SMA-proper and right pre-SMA, highlighting the potential key role of SMA in gait control. There was no difference between the organized and chaotic Korvit sequences, highlighting the difficulty of developing a walking-specific plantar stimulation paradigm. In conclusion, this combined-fMRI paradigm combining mental imagery and gait-like plantar stimulation provides complementary information regarding gait-related brain activity and appears useful for the assessment of high-level gait control.

In this review, we start by discussing this evidence and methods used to determine expression loci. Next, we discuss the functional consequences of this diversity in pre- and postsynaptic expression of both homeostatic and Hebbian synaptic plasticity. In particular, we explore the functional consequences of a biologically tuned model of pre- and postsynaptically expressed spike-timing-dependent plasticity complemented with postsynaptic homeostatic control. The pre- and postsynaptic expression in this model predicts (i) more reliable receptive fields and sensory perception, (ii) rapid recovery of forgotten information (memory savings), and (iii) reduced response latencies, compared with a model with postsynaptic expression only. Finally, we discuss open questions that will require a considerable research effort to better elucidate how the specific locus of expression of homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity alters synaptic and network computations. This article is part of the themed issue 'Integrating Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity'.	[Costa, Rui Ponte; van Rossum, Mark C.

J	Konefal, SC; Stellwagen, D				Konefal, Sarah C.; Stellwagen, David			Tumour necrosis factor-mediated homeostatic synaptic plasticity in behavioural models: testing a role in maternal immune activation	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						cytokine; homeostatic plasticity; maternal immune activation; inflammation	FACTOR-ALPHA; TNF-ALPHA; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; FETAL-BRAIN; AMPA RECEPTOR; MICE LEADS; DOPAMINERGIC HYPERFUNCTION; ADULT PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; CYTOKINE EXPRESSION	The proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) has long been characterized for its role in the innate immune system, but more recently has been found to have a distinct role in the nervous system that does not overlap with other proinflammatory cytokines. Through regulation of neuronal glutamate and GABA receptor trafficking, TNF mediates a homeostatic form of synaptic plasticity, but plays no direct role in Hebbian forms of plasticity. As yet, there is no evidence to suggest that this adaptive plasticity plays a significant role in normal development, but it does maintain neuronal circuit function in the face of several types of disruption. This includes developmental plasticity in primary sensory cortices, as well as modulating the response to antidepressants, chronic antipsychotics and drugs of abuse. TNF is also a prominent component of the neuroinflammation occurring in most neuropathologies, but the role of TNF-mediated synaptic plasticity in this context remains to be determined. We tested this in a maternal immune activation (MIA) model of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using TNF-/- mice, we observed that TNF is not required for the expression of abnormal social or anxious behaviour in this model. This indicates that TNF does not uniquely contribute to the development of neuronal dysfunction in this model, and suggests that during neuroinflammatory events, compensation between the various proinflammatory cytokines is the norm.

Phenolic compounds isolated from fermented blueberry juice decrease hepatocellular glucose output and enhance muscle glucose uptake in cultured murine and human cells	BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Diabetes; Glucose homeostasis; Glucose-6-phosphatase; Glycogen Synthase; Glucose transport	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS; PROTOCATECHUIC ACID; VACCINIUM-ANGUSTIFOLIUM; CHLOROGENIC ACID; GALLIC ACID; METABOLISM; SURVIVAL; NEURONS; PATHWAY	Background: We recently reported that blueberry juice fermented (FJ) with Serratia vaccinii bacterium has antidiabetic activities both in vivo and in vitro. The purpose of this project was to elucidate the effect of FJ on glucose homeostasis in liver and skeletal muscle cells and to identify active fractions/compounds responsible for this effect. Methods: FJ was fractionated using standard chromatography procedures. Hepatic (H4IIE, HepG2) and skeletal muscle cells (C2C12) were treated with maximum non-toxic concentrations of FJ, fractions and isolated compounds thereof. Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity was measured using glucose oxidase method. To measure glucose uptake and glycogen synthase (GS) activity, radioactive assays were used. Results: Fractionation of FJ yielded seven fractions. FJ and its phenolic fractions F2, F3-1 and F3-2 respectively inhibited G-6Pase by 31, 45, 51 and 26%; activated GS by 2.3-, 2.3-, 2.2- and 2-fold; and stimulated glucose uptake by 19, 25, 18 and 15%, as compared to DMSO vehicle control. Subfractionation of the active fractions yielded 4 compounds (catechol, chlorogenic, gallic and protocatechuic acid). Catechol, yielding the greatest bioactivity in G6Pase and glucose uptake assays, decreased G6Pase activity by 54%, increased GS by 2-fold and stimulated glucose uptake by 44% at 45.5 mu M. Conclusions: This study identifies novel potential antidiabetic compounds that can help standardize FJ.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are highly prevalent in this patient population, with approximately 90% showing some degree of voiding dysfunction and/or incontinence 6-8 years after the initial MS diagnosis. Major therapeutic goals include quality of life improvement and the avoidance of urological complications Owing to the wide divergence of clinical symptoms and disease course, evaluation and treatment differ between patients. Treatment must be customized for each patient based on disease phase, patient independence, manual dexterity, social support, and other medical-or MS-related issues. Ablative or irreversible therapies are indicated only when the disease course is stable. In most cases of "safe" bladder, behavioural treatment is considered first-line defense. Antimuscarinic drugs, alone or in combination with intermittent self-catheterization, are currently the mainstay of conservative treatment, and several other medications may help in specific disease conditions. Second-line treatment includes botulinum toxin A injection, neuromodulation, indwelling catheters, and surgery in well-selected cases.

Position paper on olfactory dysfunction	RHINOLOGY			English	Article							ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY; SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST; OF-PENNSYLVANIA SMELL; UPPER RESPIRATORY-TRACT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTRANASAL TRIGEMINAL FUNCTION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE PATIENTS; CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; NASAL POLYPOSIS	Background: Olfactory dysfunction is an increasingly recognised condition, associated with reduced quality of life and major health outcomes such as neurodegeneration and death. However, translational research in this field is limited by heterogeneity in methodological approach, including definitions of impairment, improvement and appropriate assessment techniques. Accordingly, effective treatments for smell loss are limited. In an effort to encourage high quality and comparable work in this field, among others, we propose the following ideas and recommendations. Whilst the full set of recommendations are outlined in the main document, points include the following: Patients with suspected olfactory loss should undergo a full examination of the head and neck, including rigid nasal endoscopy with small diameter endoscopes. Subjective olfactory assessment should not be undertaken in isolation, given its poor reliability. Psychophysical assessment tools used in clinical and research settings should include reliable and validated tests of odour threshold, and/or one of odour identification or discrimination. Comprehensive chemosensory assessment should include gustatory screening. Smell training can be helpful in patients with olfactory loss of several aetiologies. Conclusions: We hope the current manuscript will encourage clinicians and researchers to adopt a common language, and in so doing, increase the methodological quality, consistency and generalisability of work in this field.

Synapse organization is coordinated by trans-synaptic interactions of various cell adhesion proteins, a representative example of which is the neurexin-neuroligin complex. Recently, a novel role for TrkC as a synapse organizing protein has been established. Post-synaptic TrkC binds to pre-synaptic type-IIa receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP sigma). TrkC-PTP sigma specifically induces excitatory synapses in a kinase domain-independent manner. TrkC has distinct extracellular domains for PTP sigma and NT-3-binding and thus may bind both ligands simultaneously. Indeed, NT-3 enhances the TrkC-PTP sigma interaction, thus facilitating synapse induction at the pre-synaptic side and increasing pre-synaptic vesicle recycling in a kinase-independent fashion. A crystal structure study has revealed the detailed structure of the TrkC-PTP sigma complex as well as competitive modulation of TrkC-mediated synaptogenesis by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which bind the same domain of TrkC as PTP sigma. Thus, there is strong evidence supporting a role for the TrkC-PTP sigma complex in mechanisms underlying the fine turning of neural connectivity. Furthermore, disruption of the TrkC-PTP sigma complex may be the underlying cause of certain psychiatric disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding TrkC (NTRK3), supporting its role in cognitive functions.

These synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) are involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, and the formation of neuronal networks. Recent findings from studies examining the consequences of sleep loss suggest that these molecules are candidates to act in sleep regulation. This review highlights the experimental data that lead to the identification of SAMs as potential sleep regulators, and discusses results supporting that specific SAMs are involved in different aspects of sleep regulation. Further, some potential mechanisms by which SAMs may act to regulate sleep are outlined, and the proposition that these molecules may serve as molecular machinery in the two sleep regulatory processes, the circadian and homeostatic components, is presented. Together, the data argue that SAMs regulate the neuronal plasticity that underlies sleep and wakefulness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

One of the commonly accepted hallmarks of the aging process is thymic involution. At a relatively young age, 12 months old, GIT2(-/-) mice present a prematurely distorted thymic structure and dysfunction compared to age-matched 12 month-old wild-type control (C57BL/6) mice. Disruption of thymic structure in GIT2(-/-) (GIT2KO) mice was associated with a significant reduction in the expression of the cortical thymic marker, Troma-I (cytokeratin 8). Double positive (CD4(+) CD8(+)) and single positive CD4(+) T cells were also markedly reduced in 12 month-old GIT2KO mice compared to age-matched control wild-type mice. Coincident with this premature thymic disruption in GIT2KO mice was the unique generation of a novel cervical 'organ', i.e. 'parathymic lobes'. These novel organs did not exhibit classical peripheral lymph node-like characteristics but expressed high levels of T cell progenitors that were reflexively reduced in GIT2KO thymi. Using signaling pathway analysis of GIT2KO thymus and parathymic lobe transcriptomic data we found that the molecular signaling functions lost in the dysfunctional GIT2KO thymus were selectively reinstated in the novel parathymic lobe-suggestive of a compensatory effect for the premature thymic disruption. Broader inspection of high-dimensionality transcriptomic data from GIT2KO lymph nodes, spleen, thymus and parathymic lobes revealed a systemic alteration of multiple proteins (Dbp, Tef, Per1, Per2, Fbxl3, Ddit4, Sin3a) involved in the multidimensional control of cell cycle clock regulation, cell senescence, cellular metabolism and DNA damage. Altered cell clock regulation across both immune and nonimmune tissues therefore may be responsible for the premature 'aging' phenotype of GIT2KO mice.

And if it happened to children? Adapting medical care during terrorist attacks with multiple pediatric victims	ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE			French	Review							VASCULAR INJURIES; AFGHANISTAN; MANAGEMENT; IRAQ; RESUSCITATION; OPERATIONS; SUPPORT	In light of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, we need to reconsider the organization of rescue and medical management and plan for an attack involving multiple pediatric victims. To ensure quick surgical management, but also to minimize risk for on-site teams (direct threats from secondary terrorist atfacks'targeting deployed emergency services), it is crucial to evacuate patients in a swift but orderly fashion. Children are vulnerable targets in terrorist attacks. Their anatomical and physiological characteristics make it likely that pediatric victims will suffer more brain injuries and require more, often advanced, airway management. Care of multiple pediatric victims would also prove to be a difficult emotional challenge. Civilian medical teams have adapted the military-medicine principles of damage control in their medical practice using the MARCHE algorithm (Massive hemorrhage, Airway, Respiration [breathing], Circulation, Head/Hypothermia, Evacuation). They have also learned to adapt the level of care to the level of safety at the scene. Prehospital damage control principles should now be tailored to the treatment of pediatric patients in extraordinary circumstances. Priorities are given to hemorrhage control and preventing the lethal triad (coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis). Managing hemorrhagic shock involves quickly controlling external bleeding (tourniquets, hemostatic dressing), using small volumes for fluid resuscitation (10-20 ml/kg of normal saline), quickly introducing a vasopressor (noradrenaline 0.1 mu g/kg/min then titrate) after one or two fluid boluses, and using tranexamic acid (15 mg/kg over 10 min for loading dose, maximum 1 g over 10 min). Prehospital resources specifically dedicated to children are limited, and it is therefore important that everyone he trained and prepared for a scene with multiple pediatric patients.

This paper presents an effective technique to predict the gender of an individual from off-line images of handwriting. The proposed technique relies on a global approach that considers writing images as textures. Each handwritten image is converted into a textured image which is decomposed into a series of wavelet sub-bands at a number of levels, The wavelet sub-bands are then extended into data sequences. Each data sequence is quantized to produce a probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA) that generates feature Vectors. These features are used to train two classifiers, artificial neural network and support vector machine to discriminate between male and female writings. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated on two databases, QUWI and MSHD, within a number of challenging experimental scenarios and realized classification rates of up to 80%. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed technique over existing techniques in terms of classification rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mainstay of epidemiological data regarding childhood medulloblastoma is derived from case series, hence population-based studies are warranted to improve the accuracy of survival estimates. To utilize a big-data approach to update survival estimates in a contemporary cohort of children with medulloblastoma. We performed a population-based retrospective observational cohort study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database that captures all children, less than 20 years of age, between 1973 and 2012 in 18 geographical regions representing 28% of the US population. We included all participants with a presumed or histologically diagnosis of medulloblastoma. The main outcome of interest is survivors at 1, 5 and 10 years following diagnosis. A cohort of 1735 children with a median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis of 7 (4-11) years, with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were identified. The incidence and prevalence of pediatric medulloblastoma has remained stable over the past 4 decades. There is a critical time point at 1990 when the overall survival has drastically improved. In the contemporary cohort (1990 onwards), the percentage of participants alive was 86, 70 and 63% at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Multivariate Cox-Regression model demonstrated Radiation (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30-0.46, p < 0.001) and Surgery (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.30-0.58, p < 0.001) independently predict survival. The probability of mortality from a neurological cause is < 5% in patients who are alive 8 years following diagnosis. The SEER cohort analysis demonstrates significant improvements in pediatric medulloblastoma survival. In contrast to previous reports, the majority of patients survive in the modern era, and those alive 8 years following initial diagnosis are likely a long-term survivor. The importance of minimizing treatment-related toxicity is increasingly apparent given the likelihood of long-term survival.

These compounds contain fluorescein (FAM) on the 5' arm of the bRNA that is quenched by a dabcyl moiety on the 2 arm. Dbrl-mediated hydrolysis of the 2',S' linkage induces a large increase in fluorescence, providing a convenient assay for Dbrl hydrolysis. We show that unlabeled bRNAs with non-native 2',5'- phosphodiester linkages, such as phosphoramidate or phosphorothioate, can inhibit Dbrl-mediated debranching with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. In addition to measuring kinetic parameters of the debranching enzyme, these probes can be used for high throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries with the aim of identifying Dbrl inhibitors, compounds that may be useful in treating neurodegenerative diseases and retroviral infections.

Brain Dev Cooperative Grp	Age-related volumetric change of limbic structures and subclinical anxious/depressed symptomatology in typically developing children and adolescents	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Amygdala; Hippocampus; Development; Anxiety	GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; NORMAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; INCREASED AMYGDALA; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; HEALTHY-CHILDREN; NIH MRI	Objective: To investigate the extent to which subclinical variation in anxious/depressed psychopathology is associated with volume and age-related volumetric change of limbic structures in a longitudinal sample of healthy youths. Methods: Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze longitudinal behavioral and neuroimaging data (up to 3 data points per subject, collected at 2 year-intervals) in 371 typically developing youths, from 4 to 18 years of age (196 females; 723 MRIs). Volumetric measures were obtained using a validated segmentation method. The best-fit model (cubic, quadratic, or first-order linear) was determined for the effect of age on amygdalar and hippocampal volume (adjusted for total brain volume). Next, amygdalar and hippocampal volumes were regressed against Child Behavior Checklist Anxious/Depressed (A/D) scores. Age-by-A/D and sex-by-A/D interactions were tested. Results: Analyses revealed age-related linear and quadratic volumetric change in the amygdalae and hippocampi, respectively. A/D was positively associated with total amygdalar volume (p = 0.045), independent of age and sex. Age-by-A/D and sex-by-A/D interactions were not associated with amygdalar or hippocampal volume. Conclusions: Results suggest that amygdalar structure is tied to A/D among typically developing youths, independent of age and sex. Developmental trajectories of amygdalar and hippocampal volume were not associated with subclinical anxiety. Taken together, increased amygdalar volume may serve as a significant marker of anxiety, regardless of developmental phase. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.U. All rights reserved.

Establishing a Standard of Care for Deep Brain Stimulation Centers in Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Parkinson's disease; tremor; essential tremor; dystonia; deep brain stimulation; programming	BILATERAL SUBTHALAMIC STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL PARAMETER SETTINGS; PRIMARY GENERALIZED DYSTONIA; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; THALAMIC-STIMULATION; RATING-SCALE; PATIENTS EXPECTATIONS; PALLIDAL STIMULATION	During the"DBS Canada Day" symposium held in Toronto July 4-5, 2014, the scientific committee invited experts to share their knowledge regarding deep brain stimulation (DBS) management of movement disorders in three domains: (1) the programming algorithms, (2) the necessary team to run a neurosurgery program, and (3) the appropriate scales to better define in a more comprehensive fashion the effect of the brain surgery. Each presentation was followed by an open discussion, and this article reports on the conclusions of this meeting on these three questions. Concerning programming, the role of the pulse width and the switching off of the stimulation at night for thalamic stimulation for the control of tremor have been discussed. The algorithms proposed in the literature for programming in Parkinson's disease (PD) need validation. In dystonia, the use of monopolar vs bipolar parameters, the use of low vs high frequencies and the use of smaller versus larger pulse widths all need to be examined properly. Concerning the necessary team to run a neurosurgical program, recommendations will follow the suggestions for standardized outcome measures. Regarding the outcome measures for DBS in PD, investigations need to focus on the non-motor aspects of PD. Identifying which nonmotor symptoms respond to DBS would allow a better screening before and satisfaction postoperatively. There is an important need for more data to determine the optimal programming protocol and the standard measures that should be performed routinely by all centers.

Concerns have been raised about the timing of electrocerebral inactivity in relation to the cessation of circulatory function in organ donation after cardio-circulatory death. Nonprocessed electroencephalographic (EEG) measures have not been characterized and may provide insight into neurological function during this process. Methods: We assessed electrocortical data in relation to cardiac function after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and in the postmortem period after cardiac arrest for four patients in a Canadian intensive care unit. Subhairline EEG and cardio-circulatory monitoring including electrocardiogram, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and oxygen saturation were captured. Results: Electrocerebral inactivity preceded the cessation of the cardiac rhythmandABP in three patients. In one patient, single delta wave bursts persisted following the cessation of both the cardiac rhythm and ABP. There was a significant difference in EEG amplitude between the 30-minute period before and the 5-minute period following ABP cessation for the group, but we did not observe any well-defined EEG states following the early cardiac arrest period. Conclusions: In a case series of four patients, EEG inactivity preceded electrocardiogram and ABP inactivity during the dying process in three patients. Further study of the electroencephalogram during the withdrawal of life sustaining therapies will add clarity to medical, ethical, and legal concerns for donation after circulatory determined death.

Design: Primary outcomes were functional neurological status and the incidence of cerebral infarction. Search strategies adapted to the different databases were developed by a professional librarian. Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library database, Web of Science, SCOPUS, BIOSIS, Global Health, Health Star, Open SIGLE, Google Scholar and the New York Academy of Medicine Gray Literature were searched as well as clinical trials databases and the proceedings of several scientific meetings. Quality of the evidence for these outcomes across studies was adjudicated using the GRADE Working Group criteria. Results: The search resulted in 284 citations after elimination of duplicates. Of those 9 conference proceedings and 15 studies met inclusion criteria and consisted of case reports, case series and two comparative studies: one non-randomized study with physiological outcomes only and a case series with historical controls. There was considerable variation in dosing and in co-interventions and no case control or randomized controlled studies were found. Conclusion: There is currently only very low quality evidence to support the use of milrinone to improve important outcomes in patients with delayed cerebral ischemia secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Further research is needed to clarify the value and risks of this medication in patients with SAH.

ObjectivesTo characterize and compare parameters of PHEO in patients with NF1 to patients with or without other germline mutations. MethodsA retrospective chart review of patients with histologically proven PHEO at the Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal from 2000 through 2015. ResultsNeurofibromatosis type 1 was diagnosed clinically in nine patients in our cohort of 145 PHEO (6<bold></bold>2%). The mean age at diagnosis was 48 14 years, and seven patients had hypertension. No PHEO was diagnosed by systematic clinical screening. The mode of presentation was adrenal incidentalomas in five patients. Urinary metanephrines were elevated in 5/9 cases. Mean tumour diameter was 3<bold></bold>5 cm (min-max 1<bold></bold>5-12<bold></bold>5 cm). One had bilateral PHEO and none were malignant to date. Statistically significant differences were noted when comparing PHEO in NF1 to other genetic syndromes (n = 20), in terms of age at diagnosis (mean 48 vs 30 years P < 0<bold></bold>05), initial mode of presentation (no PHEO detected by routine screening in NF1 vs 40% in other genetic syndromes P < 0<bold></bold>05) and familial history of catecholamine-secreting tumour (none in NF1 vs 55% in patients with other genetic syndrome P < 0<bold></bold>05). ConclusionsPheochromocytoma in NF1 occurs in older patients with no family history compared to other syndromes; it is mostly unilateral, secretory and benign. The older age at diagnosis of PHEO could be secondary to delay in identification due to lack of systematic screening for PHEO in NF1.

Timing of anticoagulant re-initiation following intracerebral hemorrhage in mechanical heart valves: Survey of neurosurgeons and thrombosis experts	CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Anticoagulant; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Mechanical heart valves; Subdural hematoma; Survey	WEB-BASED SURVEYS; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; ASSOCIATION; GUIDELINES; STROKE; CARE	Background: While oral anticoagulation (OAC) is universally indicated for patients with mechanical heart valves (MHVs), OAC resumption following anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is an area of uncertainty. We sought to determine the practice preferences of North American neurosurgeons and thrombosis experts on optimal timing of OAC re-initiation." Methods: A cross-sectional survey was disseminated to North American members of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Demographic factors, as well as a clinical scenario with 14 modifiable clinical risk factors were included in the survey. Results: 504 physicians completed our survey (response rate 34.3%). Majority of participants were affiliated with academic centres, and managed <= 10 ICH patients with MHV per year. There was wide distribution in response in optimal timing for OAC resumption following an ICH: 59% and 60% preferred to re-start OAC between 3 and 14 days following the hemorrhagic event (median of 6-7 days). Smaller hemorrhages (<30 cm(2)). CHADS(2) score >= 2, concomitant venous thromboembolism, mitral valve prosthesis, caged-ball valves and multiple valves prompted earlier OAC resumption. Conclusion: Wide variation in the current practice of neurosurgeons and thrombosis specialists exist when they encounter patients with ICH and MHV, though decisions were influenced by patient-and valve-related factors.

Methods: Twenty-one participants with CLBP were randomly allocated to [RPMS + training] and [Sham + training] groups for three sessions (S1-S3) over a week where MF was stimulated before training (volitional contraction). Training was also home-practiced twice a day. Changes were tested at S1 and S3 for anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) of MF and semi-tendinosus (ST), MF EMG activation, cortical motor plasticity (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and pain/disability. Results: The RPMS group showed immediate decrease of pain at S1, then improvement of MF activation, ST APA, M1 facilitation, and pain/disability at S3. Changes were larger when brain excitability was lower at baseline. Disability index remained improved one month later. Conclusions: Combining RPMS with training of MF in CLBP impacted motor planning, MF and lumbopelvic spine motor control and pain/ disability one week after the onset of protocol. Brain plasticity might have favoured motor learning and improved daily lumbopelvic spine control without pain generation. Significance: Clinically, RPMS impacted the function by improving the gains beyond those reached by training alone in CLBP. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was employed to construct brain anatomical network for 120 neonates. Clustering coefficients of individual structures were computed and used to classify neonates with similar brain anatomical networks into one group. Internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems were assessed using maternal reports of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 24 and 48 months of age. The profile of CBCL externalizing and internalizing behaviors was then examined in the groups identified based on the neonatal brain network. Finally, support vector machine and canonical correlation analysis were used to identify brain structures whose clustering coefficients together significantly contribute the variation of the behaviors at 24 and 48 months of age. Four meaningful groups were revealed based on the brain anatomical networks at birth. Moreover, the clustering coefficients of the brain regions that most contributed to this grouping of neonates were significantly associated with childhood internalizing and externalizing behaviors assessed at 24 and 48 months of age. Specially, the clustering coefficient of the right amygdala was associated with both internalizing and externalizing behaviors at 24 months of age, while the clustering coefficients of the right inferior frontal cortex and insula were associated with externalizing behaviors at 48 months of age. Our findings suggested that neural organization established during fetal development could to some extent predict individual differences in behavioralemotional problems in early childhood.

Five groups of subjects underwent either continuous or intermittent theta-burst stimulation of one cerebellar hemisphere, or no stimulation just before learning a new motor sequence during fMRI scanning. We identified three phases during initial learning: one rapid, one slow, and one quasi-asymptotic performance phase. These phases were not changed by left cerebellar stimulation. Right cerebellar inhibition, however, accelerated learning and enhanced brain activation in critical motor learning-related areas during the first phase, continuing with reduced brain activation but high-performance in late phase. Right cerebellar excitation did not affect the early learning process, but slowed learning significantly in late phase, along with increased brain activation. We conclude that the right cerebellum is a key factor coordinating other neuronal loops in the early acquisition of an explicit motor sequential skill. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An EMG-based motion detection method is proposed to trigger the rehabilitation assistance according to user intention. An adaptive control scheme that compensates for the exoskeleton's dynamics is employed, and it is able to provide assistance tailored to the human user, who is supposed to participate actively in the training process. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the control method developed in this paper.

Glycylation has so far predominantly been found in motile cilia and flagella, and absence of this modification leads to ciliary disassembly. Here, we demonstrate that the correct functioning of connecting cilia of photoreceptors, which are nonmotile sensory cilia, is also dependent on glycylation. In contrast to many other tissues, only one glycylase, TTLL3, is expressed in retina. Ttll3(-/-) mice lack glycylation in photoreceptors, which results in shortening of connecting cilia and slow retinal degeneration. Moreover, absence of glycylation results in increased levels of tubulin glutamylation in photoreceptors, and inversely, the hyperglutamylation observed in the Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse abolishes glycylation. This suggests that both posttranslational modifications compete for modification sites, and that unbalancing the glutamylation-glycylation equilibrium on axonemes of connecting cilia, regardless of the enzymatic mechanism, invariably leads to retinal degeneration.

Setting: Emergency and intensive care units of a hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: Thirty-five families (34 parent-proxies and 32 children) aged 8 to 18 years (mean child age = 13.29 years) with traumatic brain injury (TBI) of all severities (27 mild, 5 moderate, and 3 severe) admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital. Design: Longitudinal prospective study. Fatigue data collected at 6-week follow-up (mean = 6.9 weeks). Main Outcome Measures: Postinjury child-and parent-rated fatigue (PedsQL MFS), mood, sleep, and pain based on questionnaire report: TBI severity (mild vs moderate/severe TBI). Results: A score greater than 2 standard deviations below healthy control data indicated the presence of abnormal fatigue, rates of which were higher compared with normative data for both parent and child reports (47% and 29%). Fatigue was predicted by postinjury depression and sleep disturbance for parent, but not child ratings. Fatigue, as rated by children, was not significantly predicted by TBI severity or other symptoms. The PedsQL MFS demonstrated acceptable measurement properties in child TBI participants, evidenced by good feasibility and reliability (Cronbach alpha values >0.90). Interrater reliability between parent and child reports was poor to moderate. Conclusions: Results underscore the need to assess fatigue and associated sleep-wake disturbance and depression after child TBI from both parent and child perspectives.

However, about 30% of patients with triple A syndrome symptoms but an unresolved diagnosis do not harbour mutations in AAAS. Objective Search for novel genetic defects in families with a triple A-like phenotype in whom AAAS mutations are not detected. Methods Genome-wide linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing and functional analyses were used to discover and verify a novel genetic defect in two families with achalasia, alacrima, myopathy and further symptoms. Effect and pathogenicity of the mutation were verified by cell biological studies. Results We identified a homozygous splice mutation in TRAPPC11 (c. 1893+3A > G, [NM_021942.5], g. 4: 184,607,904A > G [hg19]) in four patients from two unrelated families leading to incomplete exon skipping and reduction in full-length mRNA levels. TRAPPC11 encodes for trafficking protein particle complex subunit 11 (TRAPPC11), a protein of the transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex. Western blot analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in full-length TRAPPC11 protein levels and hypoglycosylation of LAMP1. Trafficking experiments in patient fibroblasts revealed a delayed arrival of marker proteins in the Golgi and a delay in their release from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Mutations in TRAPPC11 have previously been described to cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2S (MIM # 615356). Indeed, muscle histology of our patients also revealed mild dystrophic changes. Immunohistochemically, beta-sarcoglycan was absent from focal patches. Conclusions The identified novel TRAPPC11 mutation represents an expansion of the myopathy phenotype described before and is characterised particularly by achalasia, alacrima, neurological and muscular phenotypes.

Intrinsic functional architecture of the macaque dorsal and ventral lateral frontal cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cortical areas; in vivo parcellation; functional connectivity; premotor; prefrontal	COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTION PATTERNS; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RESTING-STATE FMRI; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; EYE FIELDS; PARIETAL CORTEX; PARCELLATION SCHEME	Investigations of the cellular and connectional organization of the lateral frontal cortex (LFC) of the macaque monkey provide indispensable knowledge for generating hypotheses about the human LFC. However, despite numerous investigations, there are still debates on the organization of this brain region. In vivo neuroimaging techniques such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to define the functional circuitry of brain areas, producing results largely consistent with gold-standard invasive tract-tracing techniques and offering the opportunity for cross-species comparisons within the same modality. Our results using resting-state fMRI from macaque monkeys to uncover the intrinsic functional architecture of the LFC corroborate previous findings and inform current debates. Specifically, within the dorsal LFC, we show that 1) the region along the midline and anterior to the superior arcuate sulcus is divided in two areas separated by the posterior supraprincipal dimple, 2) the cytoarchitectonically defined area 6DC/F2 contains two connectional divisions, and 3) a distinct area occupies the cortex around the spur of the arcuate sulcus, updating what was previously proposed to be the border between dorsal and ventral motor/premotor areas. Within the ventral LFC, the derived parcellation clearly suggests the presence of distinct areas: 1) an area with a somatomotor/orofacial connectional signature (putative area 44), 2) an area with an oculomotor connectional signature (putative frontal eye fields), and 3) premotor areas possibly hosting laryngeal and arm representations. Our results illustrate in detail the intrinsic functional architecture of the macaque LFC, thus providing valuable evidence for debates on its organization. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Resting-state functional MRI is used as a complementary method to invasive techniques to inform current debates on the organization of the macaque lateral frontal cortex. Given that the macaque cortex serves as a model for the human cortex, our results help generate more fine-tuned hypothesis for the organization of the human lateral frontal cortex.

Segmental specificity in belly dance mimics primal trunk locomotor patterns	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						pattern generators; spinal cord; belly dance; erector spinae; rhythmic trunk movement	MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS; ERECTOR-SPINAE MUSCLES; MOTOR PATTERNS; FLEXION MOVEMENTS; WALKING; COORDINATION; HUMANS; POSTURE; SURFACE; EMG	Belly dance was used to investigate control of rhythmic undulating trunk movements in humans. Activation patterns in lumbar erector spinae muscles were recorded using surface electromyography at four segmental levels spanning T10 to L4. Muscle activation patterns for movement tempos of 2 Hz, 3 Hz, and as fast as possible (up to 6 Hz) were compared to test the hypothesis that frequency modulates muscle timing, causing pattern changes analogous to gait transitions. Groups of trained and untrained female subjects were compared to test the hypothesis that experience modifies muscle coordination patterns and the capacity for selective motion of spinal segments. Three distinct coordination patterns were observed. An ipsilateral simultaneous pattern (S) and a diagonal synergy (D) dominated at lower frequencies. The S pattern was selected most often by novices and resembled the standing wave of activation underlying the alternating lateral trunk bending in salamander trotting. At 2 Hz, most trained subjects selected the D pattern, suggesting a greater capacity for segmental specificity compared with untrained subjects. At 3-4 Hz, there emerged an asynchronous pattern (A) analogous to the rostral-caudal traveling wave in salamander and lamprey swimming. The neural networks and mechanisms identified in primitive vertebrates, such as chains of coupled oscillators and segmental crossed inhibitory connections, could explain the patterns observed in this study in humans. Training allows modification of these patterns, possibly through improved capacity for selectively exciting or inhibiting segmental pattern generators. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Belly dance provides a novel approach for studying spinal cord neural circuits. New evidence suggests that primitive locomotor circuits may be conserved in humans. Erector spinae activation patterns during the hip shimmy at different tempos are similar to those observed in salamander walking and swimming. As movement frequency increases, a sequential pattern similar to lamprey swimming emerges, suggesting that primal involuntary control mechanisms dominate in fast lateral rhythmic spine undulations even in humans.

Contextualized Autonomy and Liberalism: Broadening the Lenses on Complementary and Alternative Medicines in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease	KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF ETHICS JOURNAL			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; ANTIOXIDANT CLINICAL-TRIALS; NATURAL HEALTH PRODUCTS; UNITED-STATES; COMMON GOOD; THERAPIES; RISK; BIOETHICS; CARE	Given advances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, some experts have proposed a state of "preclinical" AD to describe asymptomatic individuals displaying certain biomarkers. The diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers remains debated; however, given economic pressures, this "diagnosis" may eventually reach consumers. Since evidence-based prevention and treatment options remain only modestly effective, patients may turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). We explore ethical challenges associated with CAM use in preclinical AD. We first consider these issues through the liberal lens, which emphasizes informed choice while occasionally disregarding the complexity of decision making, at least as currently applied to CAM policies. We then broaden the liberal lens with a socio contextual lens, which describes the impact of social context on choice. Finally, we describe an alternate lens (contextualized liberalism) and its practical health and policy implications while 1) building on the liberal commitment to autonomy and 2) recognizing contextual determinants of choice.

Brain atrophy after bone marrow transplantation for treatment of multiple sclerosis	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; magnetic resonance imaging; atrophy; models; statistical; transplantation conditioning; bone marrow transplantation	STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION; APPEARING WHITE-MATTER; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; BREAST-CANCER; AXONAL DAMAGE; CHEMOTHERAPY; LESIONS; MRI; SERIAL; GRAY	Background: A cohort of patients with poor-prognosis multiple sclerosis (MS) underwent chemotherapy-based immune ablation followed by immune reconstitution with an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (IA/aHSCT). This eliminated new focal inflammatory activity, but resulted in early acceleration of brain atrophy. Objective: We modeled the time course of whole-brain volume in 19 patients to identify the baseline predictors of atrophy and to estimate the average rate of atrophy after IA/aHSCT. Methods: Percentage whole-brain volume changes were calculated between the baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; mean duration: 5 years). A mixed-effects model was applied using two predictors: total busulfan dose and baseline volume of T1-weighted white-matter lesions. Results: Treatment was followed by accelerated whole-brain volume loss averaging 3.3%. Both the busulfan dose and the baseline lesion volume were significant predictors. The atrophy slowed progressively over approximately 2.5 years. There was no evidence that resolution of edema contributed to volume loss. The mean rate of long-term atrophy was -0.23% per year, consistent with the rate expected from normal aging. Conclusion: Following IA/aHSCT, MS patients showed accelerated whole-brain atrophy that was likely associated with treatment-related toxicity and degeneration of committed tissues. Atrophy eventually slowed to that expected from normal aging, suggesting that stopping inflammatory activity in MS can reduce secondary degeneration and atrophy.

The backpropagated error is with respect to output units that have received an outside driving force pushing them away from the stationary point. Backpropagated error gradients correspond to temporal derivatives with respect to the activation of hidden units. These lead to a weight update proportional to the product of the presynaptic firing rate and the temporal rate of change of the postsynaptic firing rate. Simulations and a theoretical argument suggest that this rate-based update rule is consistent with those associated with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The ideas presented in this article could be an element of a theory for explaining how brains perform credit assignment in deep hierarchies as efficiently as backpropagation does, with neural computation corresponding to both approximate inference in continuous-valued latent variables and error backpropagation, at the same time.

The goals of the current longitudinal study were to determine whether these findings are the result of a brain-injury-specific effect or rather a general-injury effect, to examine the long-term evolution of ToM skills following preschool mTBI, as well as to investigate the links between ToM abilities and general social functioning. Method: Seventy-two children who sustained mTBI between the ages of 18 and 60 months were evaluated 6 and 18 months postinjury on ToM tasks including desires and emotions reasoning and false belief understanding. They were compared with 58 participants who sustained an orthopedic injury (OI) and 83 typically developing children (TDC). Results: The 3 groups did not differ on demographic and baseline characteristics. The mTBI group obtained poorer scores relative to both comparison groups on the desires and emotions reasoning task, both at 6 and 18 months injury. No correlations were found between injury characteristics and ToM performance. For the mTBI group, associations were found between ToM performance and global social competence. Conclusion: These findings suggest a brain-injury-specific effect that persists in the long-term following mTBI in preschool children.

The timing, progression, and functional impact of delayed brain maturation in the absence of structural brain injury remain unknown. Preterm infants without structural brain injury are known to have impaired brain development at term-equivalent age, including decreased cerebral and cerebellar volume, altered cortical surface area, and microstructural organization, as well as impaired functional connectivity. Advanced quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been used to study normal brain development in healthy fetuses at a single time point at the end of the third trimester. This study aimed to compare global and regional brain volumes and brain growth trajectories in very preterm infants with no structural brain injury versus healthy in utero fetuses using 3-dimensional volumetric MRI and also to examine the relationship between clinical risk factors and brain volume in preterm infants. This cross-sectional study included only a single observation for each participant, and the results were expressed as regression (slope) coefficients with 95% confidence intervals. This study consisted of 75 very preterm infants (< 32 weeks' gestational age, weight < 1500 g) and 130 healthy fetuses. Normal MRI scan measures established absence of parenchymal brain injury or malformations in both cohorts. It was noted that brain volumes were lower (P < 0.05), and the third-trimester brain growth trajectories were slower in the ex utero preterm cohort compared with in utero healthy fetuses in all the brain regions examined (cerebrum P = 0.001, cerebellumP = 0.05, and brainstem P = 0.06). It was also observed that postnatal dexamethasone treatment, the presence of extra-axial blood, sepsis, and length of oxygen support were associated with reduced brain volumes. In conclusion, this study used MRI and compared the third-trimester brain development of preterm fetuses with healthy fetuses and showed that global and regional brain development could be impaired even in the absence of parenchymal brain injury in preterm infants. Further studies are recommended to clarify the effects of altered third-trimester regional brain growth on neurodevelopmental outcome.

BIDS apps: Improving ease of use, accessibility, and reproducibility of neuroimaging data analysis methods	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED TEMPLATES; PIPELINES; SEGMENTATION; CONNECTOME; FRAMEWORK; PLATFORM; MACHINE	The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the BIDS standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.

Here, we illustrate a rapid, simple protocol by which patient derived cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using an episomal vector and differentiated into neurons. Using this platform enables patient somatic cells to be converted to physiologically active neurons in less than two months with minimal labor. This platform includes a method to combine somatic cell reprogramming with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing at single cell resolution, which enables the concurrent development of clonal knockout or knock-in models that can be used as isogenic control lines. This platform reduces the logistical barrier for using iPSC technology, allows for the development of appropriate control lines for use in rare neurodevelopmental disease research, and establishes a fundamental component to targeted therapeutics and precision medicine.

HE is associated with autoimmune thyroiditis and is thus considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The prevalence of HE is low, but death and status epilepticus have been reported. HE manifests with a wide range of symptoms that include behavioral changes and confusion. Elevated thyroid antibodies are present in the majority of cases and are required for the diagnosis of HE. Normal brain MRI findings are found in the majority of patients diagnosed with HE. The most consistent CSF abnormality noted in HE patients is the presence of elevated protein. Most HE patients respond well to steroid therapy. Clinical improvements are also observed with IV immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis. In conclusion, it is now generally accepted that the diagnosis of HE must include encephalopathy characterized by cognitive impairment associated with psychiatric features, such as hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Autoimmune encephalitis and prion disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the similarity of the clinical features of these conditions to those of HE.	[Zhou, J.

Our aim is to compare diagnostic process and management of AD in PC and specialist care (SC). Design: cross-sectional study. Subjects: a total of, 9,625 patients diagnosed with AD registered 2011-14 in SveDem, the Swedish Dementia Registry. Methods: descriptive statistics are shown. Odds ratios are presented for test performance and treatment in PC compared to SC, adjusted for age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and number of medication. Results: a total of, 5,734 (60%) AD patients from SC and 3,891 (40%) from PC. In both, 64% of patients were women. PC patients were older (mean age 81 vs. 76; P < 0.001), had lower MMSE (median 21 vs. 22; P < 0.001) and more likely to receive home care (31% vs. 20%; P < 0.001) or day care (5% vs. 3%; P < 0.001). Fewer diagnostic tests were performed in PC and diagnostic time was shorter. Basic testing was less likely to be complete in PC. The greatest differences were found for neuroimaging (82% in PC vs. 98% in SC) and clock tests (84% vs. 93%). These differences remained statistically significant after adjusting for MMSE and demographic characteristics. PC patients received less antipsychotic medication and more anxiolytics and hypnotics, but there were no significant differences in use of cholinesterase inhibitors between PC and SC. Conclusion: primary and specialist AD patients differ in background characteristics, and this can influence diagnostic work-up and treatment. PC excels in restriction of antipsychotic use. Use of head CT and clock test in PC are areas for improvement in Sweden.

Experienced pipeline engineers are able to recognize those patterns in magnetic flux leakage (MFL) scans of pipelines, and use them to characterize defect types (e.g., corrosion, cracks, dents, etc.) and estimate their lengths and depths. This task, however, can be highly cumbersome to a human operator, because of the large amount of data to be analyzed. This paper proposes a solution to automate the analysis of MFL signals. The proposed solution uses pattern-adapted wavelets to detect and estimate the length of metal-loss defects. Once the parts of MFL signals corresponding to metal-loss defects are isolated, artificial neural networks are used to predict their depth. The proposed technique is computationally efficient, achieves high levels of accuracy, and works for a wide range of defect shapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Examining the Prospective Relationship between Family Affective Responsiveness and Theory of Mind in Chronic Paediatric Traumatic Brain Injury	BRAIN IMPAIRMENT			English	Article						child; brain injuries; theory of mind; social cognition; family environment	WEIGHTED IMAGING SWI; BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; SOCIAL BRAIN; EMOTION RECOGNITION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; NEURAL BASIS; SHORT-TERM; ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD; OUTCOMES	Childhood and adolescence coincide with rapid structural and functional maturation of brain networks implicated in Theory of Mind (ToM); however, the impact of paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the development of these higher order skills is not well understood. ToM can be partitioned into conative ToM, defined as the ability to understand how indirect speech acts involving irony and empathy are used to influence the mental or affective state of the listener; and affective ToM, concerned with understanding that facial expressions are often used for social purposes to convey emotions that we want people to think we feel. In a sample of 84 children with mild-severe TBI and 40 typically developing controls, this study examined the effect of paediatric TBI on affective and conative ToM; and evaluated the respective contributions of injury-related factors (injury severity/lesion location) and non-injury-related environmental variables (socio-economic status (SES)/family functioning) to long-term ToM outcomes. Results showed that the poorest ToM outcomes were documented in association with mild-complicated and moderate TBI, rather than severe TBI. Lesion location and SES did not significantly contribute to conative or affective ToM. Post-injury family affective responsiveness was the strongest and most significant predictor of conative ToM. Results suggest that clinicians should exercise caution when prognosticating based on early clinical indicators, and that group and individual-level outcome prediction should incorporate assessment of a range of injury-and non-injury-related factors. Moreover, the affective quality of post-injury family interactions represents a potentially modifiable risk factor, and might be a useful target for family-centred interventions designed to optimise social cognitive outcomes after paediatric TBI.

Clinical studies of individuals with early brain insults (EBI) to frontotemporal regions suggest that such lesions may interfere with the maturation of sociocognitive skills and lead to increased sociobehavioural problems. However, little attention has focussed on the direct assessment of sociocognitive skills, such as moral reasoning, following focal EBI. In the present study, the performance of 15 patients with focal EBI (8-16 years) was compared to that of 15 demographically matched controls on basic neuropsychological measures (IQ and executive functions), sociocognitive tasks (moral reasoning, moral decision-making and empathy) and parent reports of sociobehavioural problems and social adaptive skills. Patients with focal EBI had significantly lower levels of moral reasoning maturity, moral decision-making, and empathy than their matched controls, but did not differ on more general measures of cognition. Their parents also reported increased sociobehavioural problems. These findings suggest that focal EBI to frontotemporal regions can result in reduced sociocognitive capacities, more specifically moral reasoning, and increased vulnerability to sociobehavioural problems.

The objective of this study is to describe how family environment has been measured in research on families of children with neurodisabilities, in order to support researchers and clinicians to select appropriate methods for use. A three-step approach was used and 13 measures of family environment were identified within 77 studies. Five measures were used most commonly across a majority of studies (n=50). The measures varied considerably in terms of theoretical background, content, subscales, and populations for which they were developed and validated. These measures were used with considerable variability between studies and with a limited range of research respondents, most typically the child's mother. Challenges, opportunities, and suggestions on how to improve the application of family environment measures in research are discussed.

E.; Bedell, Barry J.; Caudill, Marie A.; Rozen, Rima			High dietary folate in pregnant mice leads to pseudo-MTHFR deficiency and altered methyl metabolism, with embryonic growth delay and short-term memory impairment in offspring	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							GESTATIONAL FOLIC-ACID; ONE-CARBON METABOLISM; METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE; CHOLINE METABOLISM; HIPPOCAMPUS; GENES; NEURODEVELOPMENT; POLYMORPHISMS; ASSOCIATIONS; EXPRESSION	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) generates methyltetrahydrofolate for methylation reactions. Severe MTHFR deficiency results in homocystinuria and neurologic impairment. Mild MTHFR deficiency (677C>T polymorphism) increases risk for complex traits, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Although low dietary folate impacts brain development, recent concerns have focused on high folate intake following food fortification and increased vitamin use. Our goal was to determine whether high dietary folate during pregnancy affects brain development in murine offspring. Female mice were placed on control diet (CD) or folic acid-supplemented diet (FASD) throughout mating, pregnancy and lactation. Three-weekold male pups were evaluated for motor and cognitive function. Tissues from E17.5 embryos, pups and dams were collected for choline/methyl metabolite measurements, immunoblotting or gene expression of relevant enzymes. Brains were examined for morphology of hippocampus and cortex. Pups of FASD mothers displayed short-termmemory impairment, decreased hippocampal size and decreased thickness of the dentate gyrus. MTHFR protein levels were reduced in FASD pup livers, with lower concentrations of phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine in liver and hippocampus, respectively. FASD pup brains showed evidence of altered acetylcholine availability and Dnmt3a mRNA was reduced in cortex and hippocampus. E17.5 embryos and placentas from FASD dams were smaller. MTHFR protein and mRNA were reduced in embryonic liver, with lower concentrations of choline, betaine and phosphocholine. Embryonic brain displayed altered development of cortical layers. In summary, high folate intake during pregnancy leads to pseudo-MTHFR deficiency, disturbed choline/methyl metabolism, embryonic growth delay and memory impairment in offspring. These findings highlight the unintended negative consequences of supplemental folic acid.

Children (n = 25; median age 7.8 years) presenting to Canadian centers between July 1 and October 31, 2014, and who met diagnostic criteria for acute flaccid paralysis were evaluated retrospectively. The predominant presenting features included prodromal respiratory illness (n = 22), cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytic pleocytosis (n = 18), pain in neck/back (n = 14) and extremities (n = 10), bowel/bladder dysfunction (n = 9), focal central gray matter lesions found in all regions of the spinal cord within the cohort (n = 16), brain stem lesions (n = 8), and bulbar symptoms (n = 5). Enterovirus D68 was detectable in nasopharyngeal specimens (n = 7) but not in cerebrospinal fluid. Acute therapies (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis) were well tolerated with few side effects. Fourteen of 16 patients who were followed beyond 12 months post onset had neurologic deficits but showed ongoing clinical improvement and motor recovery.	[Yea, Carmen; Vajsar, Jiri; Yeh, E.

The "polyenviromic risk score": Aggregating environmental risk factors predicts conversion to psychosis in familial high-risk subjects	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Psychosis; Familial high risk; Schizophrenia; Prediction; Environment	2 HIT HYPOTHESIS; CANNABIS USE; MULTIVARIATE PREDICTION; OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS; PRODROMAL SYMPTOMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; METAANALYSIS; MODEL; VULNERABILITY; ANTECEDENTS	Background: Young relatives of individuals with schizophrenia (i.e. youth at familial high-risk, FHR) are at increased risk of developing psychotic disorders, and show higher rates of psychiatric symptoms, cognitive and neurobiological abnormalities than non-relatives. It is not known whether overall exposure to environmental risk factors increases risk of conversion to psychosis in FHR subjects. Methods: Subjects consisted of a pilot longitudinal sample of 83 young FHR subjects. As a proof of principle, we examined whether an aggregate score of exposure to environmental risk factors, which we term a 'polyenviromic risk score' (PERS), could predict conversion to psychosis. The PERS combines known environmental risk factors including cannabis use, urbanicity, season of birth, paternal age, obstetric and perinatal complications, and various types of childhood adversity, each weighted by its odds ratio for association with psychosis in the literature. Results: A higher PERS was significantly associated with conversion to psychosis in young, familial high-risk subjects (OR = 1.97, p = 0.009). A model combining the PERS and clinical predictors had a sensitivity of 27% and specificity of 96%. Conclusion: An aggregate index of environmental risk may help predict conversion to psychosis in FHR subjects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of BST-2 on influenza A virus (IAV) infection has been inconclusive. In the present study, we report that BST-2 diminishes the production of IAV virus-like particles (VLPs) that are generated by viral neuraminidase and hemagglutinin proteins to a much greater degree than it inhibits the production of wild-type IAV particles. This relatively weaker inhibition of IAV is associated with reduction in BST-2 levels, which is caused by the M2 protein that interacts with BST-2 and leads to down-regulation of cell surface BST-2 via the proteasomal pathway. Similarly to the viral antagonist Vpu, M2 also rescues the production of human immunodeficiency virus-1 VLPs and IAV VLPs in the presence of BST-2.

Cortical and subcortical abnormalities have been associated with gait instability but not yet with falls. This study aims to compare the global and regional brain subvolumes between healthy older fallers and non-fallers. A total of 77 healthy older individuals (23 fallers and 54 non-fallers, 69.8 +/- 3.5 years; 45.5 % female) were included in this study using a cross-sectional design. Based on an a priori hypothesis, the following brain subvolumes were quantified from three-dimensional T-1-weighted MRI using FreeSurfer software: total white matter abnormalities, total white matter, total cortical and subcortical gray matter, hippocampus, motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex volumes. Gait performances were also recorded. Age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, use of psychoactive drugs, far-distance visual acuity, lower-limb proprioception, depressive symptoms and cognitive scores (Mini-Mental State Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery) were used as covariates. Fallers have more frequently depressive symptoms (P = 0.048), a lower far distance visual acuity (P = 0.026) and a higher coefficient of variation of stride time (P = 0.008) compared to non-fallers. There was a trend to greater subvolumes for the somatosensory cortex (P = 0.093) and the hippocampus (P = 0.060) in the falls group. Multiple logistic regressions showed that subvolumes of the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus (P < 0.042) were increased in fallers compared to non-fallers, even after adjustment for clinical and brain characteristics. The greater subvolumes of the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus reported in fallers compared to non-fallers suggests a possible brain compensatory mechanism involving spatial navigation and integration of sensory information.

As performing music scales involves the production of predictable successive pitches, the expectation of the subsequent note may facilitate patients to explore a larger extension of space in the left affected side, during the production of music scales from right to left. Eleven right-brain-damaged stroke patients with left spatial neglect, 12 patients without neglect, and 12 age-matched healthy participants played descending scales on a music keyboard. In a counterbalanced design, the participants' exploratory performance was assessed while producing scales in three feedback conditions: With congruent sound, no-sound, or random sound feedback provided by the keyboard. The number of keys played and the timing of key press were recorded. Spatial exploration by patients with left neglect was superior with congruent sound feedback, compared to both Silence and Random sound conditions. Both the congruent and incongruent sound conditions were associated with a greater deceleration in all groups. The frame provided by the music scale improves exploration of the left side of space, contralateral to the right hemisphere, damaged in patients with left neglect. Performing a scale with congruent sounds may trigger at some extent preserved auditory and spatial multisensory representations of successive sounds, thus influencing the time course of space scanning, and ultimately resulting in a more extensive spatial exploration. These findings offer new perspectives also for the rehabilitation of the disorder.

The role of claudins in cancer metastasis	ONCOGENE			English	Review							CLOSTRIDIUM-PERFRINGENS ENTEROTOXIN; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; HUMAN OVARIAN-CANCER; CELL LUNG-CANCER; JUNCTION PROTEINS CLAUDIN-3; TIGHT-JUNCTION; BREAST-CANCER; COLORECTAL-CANCER; GASTRIC-CANCER; EPITHELIAL-CELLS	TJs are large intercellular adhesion complexes that maintain cell polarity in normal epithelia and endothelia. During the metastatic process, TJs must be 'loosened' or dismantled in cancer cells to enable migration and dissemination. Diminished TJ integrity must also occur within endothelial cells to allow intravasation and extravasation of cancer cells across endothelial barriers. Claudins are critical components of TJs, forming homo-and heteromeric interactions between the adjacent cells, which have been implicated as key modulators of carcinogenesis and metastasis. Numerous epithelial- derived cancers display altered claudin expression patterns and certain claudins can now be used as biomarkers to predict patient prognosis. Moreover, claudins have been functionally implicated in numerous steps of the metastatic cascade. The distinct roles played by claudins during the cancer progression to metastatic disease are just starting to be elucidated. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms through which claudins augment cancer metastasis is required to develop new therapeutic agents against this family of proteins. In this review, we will summarize the relationship between the claudin expression and clinical outcomes in diverse cancers, discuss tumor intrinisic roles through which claudins regulate metastasis and explore claudin-mediated functions within stromal cells that influence the metastatic process. Finally, we will consider possible strategies for targeting claudins that have the potential to improve the management of metastatic cancer.	[Tabaries, S.; Siegel, P.

(Bayley-III) in preterm infants at 18 to 21 months corrected age. Design An observational study was performed on preterm infants born before 29 weeks' gestation between 2010 and 2011. Primary caregivers were categorized by their highest education level and cognitive and language composite scores of the Bayley-III were compared among infants between these groups with adjustment for perinatal and neonatal factors. Results In total, 1,525 infants/caregivers were included in the multivariate analysis. Compared with those with less than a high school education, infants with primary caregivers who received partial college/specialized training displayed higher cognitive (adjusted difference [AD]: 4.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-7.4) and language scores (AD: 4.0, 95% CI: 0.8-7.1); infants with primary caregivers with university graduate education or above also demonstrated higher cognitive (AD: 6.4, 95% CI: 2.6-10.1) and language scores (AD: 9.9, 95% CI: 5.7-14.1). Conclusion Higher levels of education of the primary caregiver were associated with increased cognitive and language composite scores at 18 to 21 months corrected age in preterm infants.

Design Study subjects included preterm infants (< 29 weeks' gestation) born in 2010 and 2011. Univariate analyses were conducted and regression estimates were calculated for variables where odds of a good ND outcome, composite scores >= 100 in three domains (cognitive, language, and motor) in the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd ed. (Bayley-III), were estimated. Results In total, 2,069 infants were included in the analyses. For all three domains evaluated on the Bayley-III, cognition, language, motor, respectively, the absence of three major morbidities was associated with a score >= 100: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and severe neurological injury. Less time spent on positive pressure support and on total parenteral nutrition administration were associated with a positive motor outcome and showed a positive trend for both cognition and language scores. Conclusion The absence of neonatal comorbidities was associated with good ND outcome. Less time spent on positive pressure support and parenteral nutrition may also contribute to a good ND outcome.

The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes the viability of nerve cells and is known to decrease oxidative stress and apoptosis in different cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BDNF treatment on human sperm functions that are known to be essential for fertilisation. Our findings showed that treatment of human spermatozoa with 0.133 nM BDNF significantly increased the percentages of both total (P = 0.001) and progressive (P < 0.01) motile sperm cells compared to those observed in the nontreated (control) group. We also showed that the mean fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA, as an indicator of intracellular reactive oxygen species, was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in spermatozoa treated with BDNF compared to the control group. Treatment of spermatozoa with BDNF significantly decreased the percentages of both dead (P = 0.001) and apoptotic-like sperm cells (P < 0.05) compared to the control group. On the other hand, BDNF treatment significantly increased the percentage of viable sperm cells compared to the control (P = 0.001). In conclusion, BDNF has protective effects against oxidative stress in spermatozoa and could improve sperm functions that are essential for sperm-egg fusion and subsequent fertilisation.

In this paper, we introduce the Intraoperative Brain Imaging System (IBIS), an open-source image-guided neurosurgery research platform that implements a novel workflow where navigation accuracy is improved using tracked intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) and the visualization of navigation information is facilitated through the use of augmented reality (AR). The IBIS platform allows a surgeon to capture tracked iUS images and use them to automatically update preoperative patient models and plans through fast GPU-based reconstruction and registration methods. Navigation, resection and iUS-based brain shift correction can all be performed using an AR view. IBIS has an intuitive graphical user interface for the calibration of a US probe, a surgical pointer as well as video devices used for AR (e.g., a surgical microscope). The components of IBIS have been validated in the laboratory and evaluated in the operating room. Image-to-patient registration accuracy is on the order of and can be improved with iUS to a median target registration error of 2.54 mm. The accuracy of the US probe calibration is between 0.49 and 0.82 mm. The average reprojection error of the AR system is . The system has been used in the operating room for various types of surgery, including brain tumor resection, vascular neurosurgery, spine surgery and DBS electrode implantation. The IBIS platform is a validated system that allows researchers to quickly bring the results of their work into the operating room for evaluation.

The present study evaluated regional patterns of cerebral hypoperfusion and atrophy in patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy older adults. In each participant, cerebral perfusion and gray matter structure were extracted within selected brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease using magnetic resonance imaging. Measures were compared between diagnostic groups with/without adjustment for covariates. In mild cognitive impairment patients, cerebral blood flow was significantly reduced in comparison with healthy controls in temporo-parietal regions and the basal ganglia in the absence of local gray matter atrophy. By contrast, gray matter structure was significantly reduced in the hippocampus in the absence of local hypoperfusion. Both, cerebral perfusion and gray matter structure were significantly reduced in the entorhinal and isthmus cingulate cortex in mild cognitive impairment patients compared with healthy older adults. Our results demonstrated partly divergent patterns of temporo-parietal hypoperfusion and medial-temporal atrophy in mild cognitive impairment patients, potentially indicating biomarker sensitivity to dissociable pathological mechanisms. The findings support applicability of cerebral perfusion and gray matter structure as complementary magnetic resonance imaging-based biomarkers in early Alzheimer's disease detection, a hypothesis to be further evaluated in longitudinal studies.

The soluble, highly toxic amyloid-beta species, generated from the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein, are known instigators of the chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency observed in both Alzheimer's disease patients and transgenic mouse models. We have previously demonstrated that pioglitazone potently reverses cerebrovascular impairments in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease overexpressing amyloid-beta. In this study, we sought to characterize the effects of amyloid-beta overproduction on the cerebrovascular proteome; determine how pioglitazone treatment affected the altered proteome; and analyze the relationship between normalized protein levels and recovery of cerebrovascular function. Three-month-old wildtype and amyloid precursor protein mice were treated with pioglitazone- (20mg/kg/day, 14 weeks) or control-diet. Cerebral arteries were surgically isolated, and extracted proteins analyzed by gel-free and gel-based mass spectrometry. 193 cerebrovascular proteins were abnormally expressed in amyloid precursor protein mice. Pioglitazone treatment rescued a third of these proteins, mainly those associated with oxidative stress, promotion of cerebrovascular vasocontractile tone, and vascular compliance. Our results demonstrate that amyloid-beta overproduction perturbs the cerebrovascular proteome. Recovery of cerebrovascular function with pioglitazone is associated with normalized levels of key proteins in brain vessel function, suggesting that pioglitazone-responsive cerebrovascular proteins could be early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.

Here, we report that P12-20 LIF infusion inhibits somatic maturation of pyramidal neurons and of all interneuron types in vivo. Likewise, DIV 12-20 LIF treatment in organotypic cultures prevents somatic growth GABA-ergic neurons. Further, while NPY expression is increased in the LIF-infused hemispheres, the expression of parvalbumin mRNA and protein, Kv3.1 mRNA, calbindin D 28k protein, and GAD-65 mRNA, but not of GAD-67 mRNA or calretinin protein is substantially reduced. Also, LIF treatment decreases parvalbumin, Kv3.1,Kv3.2 and GAD-65, but not GAD-67 mRNA expression in OTC. Developing cortical neurons are known to depend on neurotrophins. Indeed, LIF alters neurotrophin mRNA expression, and prevents the growth promoting action of neurotophin-4 in GABA-ergic neurons. The results imply that LIF, by altering neurotrophin expression and/or signaling, could counteract neurotrophin-dependent growth and neurochemical differentiation of cortical neurons.

Among polyphenols, the anthocyanidins are known to possess anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, anti-angiogenic, and anti-carcinogenic properties. Despite the well-known role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in high grade gliomas, the impact of anthocyanidins on TGF-b-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that allows benign tumor cells to infiltrate surrounding tissues, remains poorly understood. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of anthocyanidins such as cyanidin (Cy), delphinidin (Dp), malvidin (Mv), pelargonidin (Pg), and petunidin (Pt) on TGF-b-induced EMT and to determine the mechanism(s) underlying such action. Human U-87 glioblastoma (U-87 MG) cells were treated with anthocyanidins prior to, along with or following the addition of TGF-b. We found that anthocyanidins differently affected TGF-b-induced EMT, depending on the treatment conditions. Dp was the most potent EMT inhibitor through its inhibitory effect on the TGF-b Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. These effects altered expression of the EMT mesenchymal markers fibronectin and Snail, as well as markedly reducing U-87 MG cell migration. Our study highlights a new action of anthocyanidins against EMT that supports their beneficial health and chemopreventive effects in dietary-based strategies against cancer.

The nearly invisible intraneural cyst: a new and emerging part of the spectrum	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Article						peroneal nerve; ganglion cyst; intraneural; articular branch; superior tibiofibular joint	SUPERIOR TIBIOFIBULAR JOINT; ARTICULAR BRANCH; GANGLION CYSTS; PERONEAL; NERVE; COMMUNICATION; ORIGIN	OBJECTIVE The authors have observed that a subset of patients referred for evaluation of peroneal neuropathy with "negative" findings on MRI of the knee have subtle evidence of a peroneal intraneural ganglion cyst on subsequent closer inspection. The objective of this study was to introduce the nearly invisible peroneal intraneural ganglion cyst and provide illustrative cases. The authors further wanted to identify clues to the presence of a nearly invisible cyst. METHODS Illustrative cases demonstrating nearly invisible peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts were retrospectively reviewed and are presented. Case history and physical examination, imaging, and intraoperative findings were reviewed for each case. The outcomes of interest were the size and configuration of peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts over time, relative to various interventions that were performed, and in relation to physical examination and electrodiagnostic findings. RESULTS The authors present a series of cases that highlight the dynamic nature of peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts and introduce the nearly invisible cyst as a new and emerging part of the spectrum. The cases demonstrate changes in size and morphology over time of both the intraneural and extraneural compartments of these cysts. Despite "negative" MR imaging findings, nearly invisible cysts can be identified in a subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS The authors demonstrate here that peroneal intraneural ganglion cysts ride a roller coaster of change in both size and morphology over time, and they describe the nearly invisible cyst as one end of the spectrum. They identified clues to the presence of a nearly invisible cyst, including deep peroneal predominant symptoms, fluctuating symptoms, denervation changes in the tibialis anterior muscle, and abnormalities of the superior tibiofibular joint, and they correlate the subtle imaging findings to the internal fascicular topography of the common peroneal nerve. The description of the nearly invisible cyst may allow for increased recognition of this pathological entity that occurs with a spectrum of findings.

The present case-control study explores the impact of underlying indications on this potential association. Methods Physicians collected the medical history; prior 12-month drug use was obtained from standardized telephone interviews with patients. The association between AED use and SA was explored using multivariate conditional logistic regression. The analyses were replicated after stratification on depression and neurological disorders (epilepsy, migraine, and chronic neuropathic pain). Results Between 2008 and 2012, 506 adults with an incident SA were recruited in suicide treatment centers from across France and socio-demographically matched to 2829 controls from primary care settings. The association between AED use and odds of SA was not significant overall (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-2.4). No association was observed for patients with neurological disorders (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.5-2.4) as opposed to patients with depression (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5), but unmeasured confounding was suspected. Conclusions Our results suggest that the association observed between AED use and increased odds of non-fatal SA in patients with either a lifetime history of depression or no neurological disorder may be explained by the presence of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Accounting for underlying indications is crucial in drug safety studies, as these can cause a reported association (or lack thereof) to be misleading. This may require the prospective collection of medical data at a patient level. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Neutrophil perversion is well documented in a variety of inflammatory disorders (e.g. arthritis, lupus, psoriasis), but is only beginning to be demystified in autoimmune demyelination, the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. Using the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), several molecules that help neutrophils invade the central nervous system (CNS) have been identified. Mechanisms by which neutrophils may contribute to demyelination have also been proposed (e.g. secretion of endothelial/leukocytic modulators, antigen presentation to T cells, myelin degradation and phagocytosis). In human, neutrophils are seen in the CNS of people with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and other severe variants of autoimmune demyelinating diseases. At the time of autopsy for multiple sclerosis (MS) often many years after its onset neutrophils appear to have escaped the scene of the crime. However, new clues implicate neutrophils in MS relapses and progression. This warrants further investigating 1) the differential importance of neutrophils among demyelinating diseases, 2) the largely unknown effects of current MS therapies on neutrophils, and 3) the potential of neutrophil proteins as clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

Since it is especially difficult to study long-term effects of high-energy diet in individuals at risk for AD, we addressed this question by using the McGill-R-Thyl-APP transgenic rat model (Tg(+/-)) that mimics presymptomatic AD. Wild-type and Tg(+/-) rats were exposed during 6 months to a standard diet or a Western diet (WD), high in saturated fat and sugar. Results from peripheral and hippocampal biochemical analysis and in situ respirometry showed that WD induced a metabolic syndrome and decreased presynaptic bioenergetic parameters without alterations in hippocampal insulin signaling or lipid composition. Cognitive tests, ELISA multiplex, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR indicated that WD worsened cognition in Tg(+/-) rats, increased hippocampal levels of monomericA beta isoforms and oligomeric species, promoted deposits of N-Terminal pyroglutamate-A(3 (A beta N3 (pE)) in CAl pyramidal neurons and interneurons, decreased transcript levels of genes involved in neuroprotective pathways such as Sirtuin-1 and increased nitrated proteins. Our results support the concept that in the presence of early A beta pathology, diet -induced metabolic dysfunctions may contribute as a "second hit" to impair cognition. Noteworthy, such effect is not mediated by higher microglia activation or disruption of blood brain barrier. However, it may be attributed to increased amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein, generation of A beta N3(pE) and dysregulation of pathways governed by Sirtuin-1. This evidence reinforces the implementation of prophylactic interventions in individuals at risk for AD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deficits in IJA provide strong early indicators for autism spectrumdisorder, and therapies targeting joint attention have shown tremendous promise. However, the brain systems underlying IJA in early childhood are poorly understood, due in part to significantmethodological challenges in imaging localized brain function that supports social behaviors during the first 2 years of life. Herein, we showthat the functional organization of the brain is intimately related to the emergence of IJA using functional connectivitymagnetic resonance imaging and dimensional behavioral assessments in a large semilongitudinal cohort of infants and toddlers. In particular, though functional connections spanning the brain are involved in IJA, the strongest brain-behavior associations clusterwithin connections between a small subset of functional brain networks; namely between the visual network and dorsal attention network and between the visual network and posterior cingulate aspects of the defaultmode network. These observationsmark the earliest known description of how functional brain systems underlie a burgeoning fundamental social behavior, may help improve the design of targeted therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders, and, more generally, elucidate physiologicalmechanisms essential to healthy social behavior development.

This is probably due to the small sample sizes used in most studies, and important differences in sample characteristics, particularly age, as well as to the heterogeneity of the disorder. To address these issues, we assessed abnormalities in ASD within the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange data set, which comprises data from approximately 1100 individuals (similar to 6-55 years). A subset of these data that met stringent quality control and inclusion criteria (560 male subjects; 266 ASD; age = 6-35 years) were used to compute age-specific differences in cortical thickness in ASD and the relationship of any such differences to symptom severity of ASD. Our results show widespread increased cortical thickness in ASD, primarily left lateralized, from 6 years onwards, with differences diminishing during adulthood. The severity of symptoms related to social affect and communication correlated with these cortical abnormalities. These results are consistent with the conjecture that developmental patterns of cortical thickness abnormalities reflect delayed cortical maturation and highlight the dynamic nature of morphological abnormalities in ASD.

However, no consistent pathology regarding the relationship of these abilities to brain structure has emerged. Recent developments in anatomical correlation-based approaches to map structural covariance networks (SCNs), combined with detailed behavioral characterization, offer an alternative for studying these relationships. In this study, such an approach was used to study the integrity of SCNs of cortical thickness and surface area associated with language and communication, in 46 high-functioning, school-age children with ASD compared with 50 matched, typically developing controls (all males) with IQ > 75. Findings showed that there was alteration of cortical structure and disruption of fronto-temporal cortical covariance in ASD compared with controls. Furthermore, in an analysis of a subset of ASD participants, alterations in both cortical structure and covariance were modulated by structural language ability of the participants, but not communicative function. These findings indicate that structural language abilities are related to altered fronto-temporal cortical covariance in ASD, much more than symptom severity or cognitive ability. They also support the importance of better characterizing ASD samples while studying brain structure and for better understanding individual differences in language and communication abilities in ASD.

Understanding structural brain network topology in FXS provides an important link between neurobiological and behavioral/cognitive symptoms of this disorder. We investigated the connectome via whole-brain structural networks created from group-level morphological correlations. Participants included 100 individuals: 50 with FXS and 50 with typical development, age 11-23 years. Results indicated alterations in topological properties of structural brain networks in individuals with FXS. Significantly reduced small-world index indicates a shift in the balance between network segregation and integration and significantly reduced clustering coefficient suggests that reduced local segregation shifted this balance. Caudate and amygdala were less interactive in the FXS network further highlighting the importance of subcortical region alterations in the neurobiological signature of FXS. Modularity analysis indicates that FXS and typically developing groups' networks decompose into different sets of interconnected sub networks, potentially indicative of aberrant local interconnectivity in individuals with FXS. These findings advance our understanding of the effects of fragile X mental retardation protein on large-scale brain networks and could be used to develop a connectomelevel biological signature for FXS.

Whether changes in clinical insight are associated with progressive structural brain changes is unknown. We aimed to evaluate 1) associations between clinical insight and cortical thickness at a baseline assessment, 2) covariation between clinical insight and cortical thickness across baseline, one-year and two-year follow-up assessments, and 3) the predictive value of clinical insight for cortical thickness at one-year and two-year follow-ups. Scale for the assessment of Unawareness of Mental Disorder ratings and magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired at baseline, one-year, and two-year follow-ups in 128, 74, and 44 individuals with a first-episode psychosis, respectively. Cortical thickness metrics were then computed at baseline, one-year and two-year follow-ups and analyzed with linear mixed models. At baseline, clinical insight was not significantly associated with cortical thickness in any region. Longitudinal mixed effects models showed that a worsening in clinical insight between the one-year and two-year assessments was significantly associated with cortical thinning in dorsal pre-central and post central gyri. Cortical thinning in left fusiform gyrus at two-years was predicted by poorer clinical insight at baseline. Results suggest that poor clinical insight soon after the onset of a first-episode psychosis may lead to progressive cortical changes in temporal lobe, while changes in clinical insight during the second year covary with cortical thinning in circumscribed dorsal frontal and parietal cortices.

The World Health Organization reports that 95% of all childhood injury deaths occur in Low-Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). Injury scores have been developed to facilitate risk stratification, clinical decision making, and research. Trauma registries in LMIC depend on adapted trauma scores that do not rely on investigations that require unavailable material or human resources. We sought to review and assess the existing trauma scores used in pediatric patients. Our objective is to determine their wideness of use, validity, setting of use, outcome measures, and criticisms. We believe that there is a need for an adapted trauma score developed specifically for pediatric patients in low-resource settings. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify and compare existing injury scores used in pediatric patients. We constructed a search strategy in collaboration with a senior hospital librarian. Multiple databases were searched, including Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Articles were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria by two reviewers and underwent qualitative analysis. The scores identified are suboptimal for use in pediatric patients in low-resource settings due to various factors, including reliance on precise anatomic diagnosis, physiologic parameters maladapted to pediatric patients, or laboratory data with inconsistent accessibility in LMIC. An important gap exists in our ability to simply and reliably estimate injury severity in pediatric patients and predict their associated probability of outcomes in settings, where resources are limited. An ideal score should be easy to calculate using point-of-care data that are readily available in LMIC, and can be easily adapted to the specific physiologic variations of different age groups.

Of the candidate proinflammatory mediators, IL-1 appears central and is sufficient to trigger fetal loss. Therefore, we elucidated the effects of antenatal IL-1 exposure on postnatal development and investigated two IL-1 receptor antagonists, the competitive inhibitor anakinra (Kineret) and a potent noncompetitive inhibitor 101.10, for efficacy in blocking IL-1 actions. Antenatal exposure to IL-1b induced Tnfa, Il6, Ccl2, Pghs2, and Mpges1 expression in placenta and fetal membranes, and it elevated amniotic fluid IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and PGF(2 alpha), resulting in PTB and marked neonatal mortality. Surviving neonates had increased Il1b, Il6, Il8, Il10, Pghs2, Tnfa, and Crp expression in WBCs, elevated plasma levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8, increased IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in fetal lung, intestine, and brain, and morphological abnormalities: e.g., disrupted lung alveolarization, atrophy of intestinal villus and colonresident lymphoid follicle, and degeneration and atrophy of brain microvasculature with visual evoked potential anomalies. Late gestation treatment with 101.10 abolished these adverse outcomes, whereas Kineret exerted only modest effects and no benefit for gestation length, neonatal mortality, or placental inflammation. In a LPS-induced model of infection-associated PTB, 101.10 prevented PTB, neonatal mortality, and fetal brain inflammation. There was no substantive deviation in postnatal growth trajectory or adult body morphometry after antenatal 101.10 treatment. The results implicate IL-1 as an important driver of neonatal morbidity in PTB and identify 101.10 as a safe and effective candidate therapeutic.

Study design In this case-control study, DTI studies were performed in 73 premature infants born <= 32 weeks and <= 1500 g birth weight and 73 full-term-born controls from healthy pregnancies. Using a region of interest approach, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted in 7 cerebellar regions including the anterior vermis, the right/left superior cerebellar peduncles, the middle cerebellar peduncle, and the dentate nuclei. To validate further our DTI measurements, we measured FA and MD in the genu of the corpus callosum and splenium. FA and MD were compared between groups using analyses of multiple linear regression models. Results Preterm infants at term-equivalent age presented with higher FA in the dentate nuclei (<.001) and middle cerebellar peduncle (.028), and lower MD in the vermis (.023) compared with controls. Conversely, preterm infants showed reduced FA and increased MD in both the genu of the corpus callosum and splenium (P<.001). Independent risk factors associated with altered FA and MD in the cerebellum included low Apgar score, supratentorial injury, compromised cardiorespiratory function, and surgery for necrotizing enterocolitis and patent ductus arteriosus. Conclusions This DTI study provides evidence that complications of premature birth are associated with altered cerebellar microstructural organization when compared with term-born control infants.

A mutation in 1 of over 40 monogenic genes can be detected in approximately 30% of individuals with SRNS whose symptoms manifest before 25 years of age. However, in many patients, the genetic etiology remains unknown. Here, we have performed whole exome sequencing to identify recessive causes of SRNS. In 7 families with SRNS and facultative ichthyosis, adrenal insufficiency, immunodeficiency, and neurological defects, we identified 9 different recessive mutations in SGPL1, which encodes sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase. All mutations resulted in reduced or absent SGPL1 protein and/or enzyme activity. Overexpression of cDNA representing SGPL1 mutations resulted in subcellular mislocalization of SGPL1. Furthermore, expression of WT human SGPL1 rescued growth of SGPL1-deficient dpl1. yeast strains, whereas expression of disease-associated variants did not. Immunofluorescence revealed SGPL1 expression in mouse podocytes and mesangial cells. Knockdown of Sgpl1 in rat mesangial cells inhibited cell migration, which was partially rescued by VPC23109, an S1P receptor antagonist. In Drosophila, Sply mutants, which lack SGPL1, displayed a phenotype reminiscent of nephrotic syndrome in nephrocytes. WT Sply, but not the disease-associated variants, rescued this phenotype.

A multicomponent approach to nonrigid registration of diffusion tensor images	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Diffusion tensor imaging; Image registration; Nonrigid; Tsallis entropy	SPATIAL NORMALIZATION; INFORMATION	Diffusion tensor imaging has shown promise in the early detection and diagnosis of a host of disorders and neurologic conditions. In this paper, we propose a nonrigid registration approach for diffusion tensor images using a multicomponent information-theoretic measure. Explicit orientation optimization is enabled by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary for wrapping diffusion tensor images. Experimental results on diffusion tensor images indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach and a much better performance compared to the affine registration method based on mutual information in terms of registration accuracy in the presence of geometric distortion.

The aim of this study is to review the clinical use of vHIT in patients with vestibular disorders in different diseases. PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for all articles that defined vHIT, compared vHIT with another clinical test, and studied the efficacy of vHIT as diagnostic tools with vestibular disease. 37 articles about vHIT were reviewed. All articles studied the vHIT in English and French languages up to May 2015 were included in the review. Editorial articles or short comments, conference abstracts, animal studies, and language restriction were excluded from the review. Four systems were used in the literature to do the vHIT. vHIT is physiological quick test, which studied the VOR at high frequency of each semicircular canal by calculating the duration ratio between the head impulse and gaze deviation. vHIT is more sensitive than clinical head impulse test (cHIT), especially in patient with isolated covert saccades. vHIT test is diagnostic of vestibular weakness by gain reduction and the appearance of overt and covert saccades. If the vHIT is normal, then caloric test is mandatory to rule out a peripheral origin of vertigo. It is recommended to test each semicircular canal, as isolated vertical canal weakness was identified in the literature. More investigation would be required to determine the evolution of the VOR gain with the progression of the vestibular disease.

We investigate two different regression estimates based on polynomial splines and on neural networks, and show that if the regression function satisfies a hierarchical interaction model and all occurring functions in the model are smooth, the rate of convergence of these estimates depends on d* (and not on d). Hence, in this case, the estimates can achieve good rate of convergence even for large d, and are in this sense able to circumvent the so-called curse of dimensionality.

A monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A showed a positive effect in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS, and a humanised form of this antibody (ozanezumab) was well tolerated in a first-in-human trial. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanezumab in patients with ALS. Methods This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done in 34 centres in 11 countries. Patients aged 18-80 years with a diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally according to a computer-generated allocation schedule, to receive ozanezumab (15 mg/kg) or placebo as intravenous infusions over 1 h every 2 weeks for 46 weeks, followed by assessments at week 48 and week 60. Patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was a joint-rank analysis of function (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) and overall survival, analysed at 48 weeks in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01753076, and with GSK-ClinicalStudyRegister.com, NOG112264, and is completed. Findings Between Dec 20,2012, and Nov 1,2013, we recruited 307 patients, of whom 303 were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=151) or ozanezumab (n=152). The adjusted mean of the joint-rank score was -14.9 (SE 13.5) for the ozanezumab group and 15.0 (13.6) for the placebo group, with a least squares mean difference of -30.0 (95% CI -67.9 to 7.9; p=0.12). Overall, reported adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study were similar between the treatment groups, except for dyspepsia (ten [7%] in the ozanezumab group vs four [3%] in the placebo group), depression (11 [7%] vs five [3%]), and diarrhoea (25 [16%] vs 12 [8%]). Respiratory failure was the most common serious adverse event (12 [8%] vs seven [5%]). At week 60, the number of deaths was higher in the ozanezumab group (20 [13%]) than in the placebo group (16 [11%]), mainly as a result of respiratory failure (ten [7%] vs five [3%]). Two deaths were considered related to the study drug (bladder transitional cell carcinoma in the ozanezumab group and cerebrovascular accident in the placebo group). Interpretation Ozanezumab did not show efficacy compared with placebo in patients with ALS. Therefore, Nogo-A does not seem to be an effective therapeutic target in ALS.

While emphasizing its specific strengths in terms of millisecond source imaging, we also identify and discuss current practical challenges, in particular in signal extraction and interpretation. We also take issue with some perceived disadvantages of MEG, including the misconception that the technique is redundant with electroencephalography. Overall, MEG contributes uniquely to our deeper comprehension of both regional and large-scale brain dynamics: from the functions of neural oscillations and the nature of event-related brain activation, to the mechanisms of functional connectivity between regions and the emergence of modes of network communication in brain systems. We expect MEG to play an increasing and pivotal role in the elucidation of these grand mechanistic principles of cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience.

Driven by these limitations, quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a non-invasive and more convenient technique to study AD. Published works on EEG-based AD diagnosis typically share two main characteristics: EEG is manually selected by experienced clinicians to discard artefacts that affect AD diagnosis, and reliance on EEG devices with 20 or more electrodes. Recent work, however, has suggested promising results by using automated artefact removal (AAR) algorithms combined with medium-density EEG setups. Over the last couple of years, however, low-density, portable EEG devices have emerged, thus opening the doors for low-cost AD diagnosis in low-income countries and remote regions, such as the Canadian Arctic. Unfortunately, the performance of automated diagnostic solutions based on low-density portable devices is still unknown. The work presented here aims to fill this gap. We propose an automated EEG-based AD diagnosis system based on AAR and a low-density (7- channel) EEG setup. EEG data was acquired during resting-awake protocol from control and AD participants. After AAR, common EEG features, spectral power and coherence, are computed along with the recently proposed amplitude-modulation features. The obtained features are used for training and testing of the proposed diagnosis system. We report and discuss the results obtained with such system and compare the obtained performance with results published in the literature using higher-density EEG layouts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods and Materials: Adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and a Karnofsky Performance Status >60 were eligible. Neoadjuvant TMZ administration started 2 to 3 weeks from surgery at a daily dose of 75 mg/m(2) for 2 weeks prior to delivery of HART (60 Gy in 20 daily fractions) with concurrent and adjuvant TMZ. The primary endpoints were feasibility and toxicity. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. Results: Fifty patients were accrued. The median follow-up period was 44.0 months for patients at risk and 22.3 months for all 50 patients. Except for 1 patient in whom infection developed and another patient with progression during HART, all patients completed protocol therapy as planned. The median OS and progression-free survival were 22.3 months (95% confidence interval, 14.6-42.7 months) and 13.7 months (95% confidence interval, 8.0-33.3 months), respectively. The 4-year OS rates were 30.4% for the entire cohort and 53.3% and 14.0% for patients with methylated (n = 21) and unmethylated (n = 27) MGMT gene promoter tumors, respectively. One patient had grade 5 pancytopenia during HART, and another patient had transient grade 4 hepatotoxicity. A second surgical procedure was performed in 13 patients: 2 had intracranial infection, 3 had recurrences, 4 had recurrences and radiation-induced damage, and 4 had only radiation-induced damage. Conclusions: This novel approach of neoadjuvant TMZ is associated with an encouraging favorable long-term survival with acceptable toxicity. A future comparative trial of the efficacy of this regimen is warranted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Decision tree (DT) is one of the most popular learning models in data mining. The performance of a DT in a complex decision problem depends on the efficiency of its construction. However, obtaining the optimal DT is not a straightforward process. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary meta-heuristic optimization based approach for identifying the best settings during the construction of a DT. We designed a genetic algorithm coupled with a multitask objective function to pull out the optimal DT with the best parameters. This objective function is based on three main factors: (1) Precision over the test samples, (2) Trust in the construction and validation of a DT using the smallest possible training set and the largest possible testing set, and (3) Simplicity in terms of the size of the generated candidate DT, and the used set of attributes. We extensively evaluate our approach on 13 benchmark datasets and a fault diagnosis dataset. The results show that it outperforms classical DT construction methods in terms of accuracy and simplicity. They also show that the proposed approach outperforms Ant-Tree-Miner (an evolutionary DT construction approach), Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine in terms of accuracy and F-measure.

Caspase vinyl sulfone small molecule inhibitors prevent axonal degeneration in human neurons and reverse cognitive impairment in Caspase-6-overexpressing mice	MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; Caspases; Caspase-6; Axonal degeneration; Peptide inhibitors; Primary human neurons; Caspase-6 transgenic mice; Vinyl sulfone inhibitors	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MUTANT HUNTINGTIN; IN-VITRO; INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION; MICHAEL ACCEPTORS; PEPTIDE INHIBITOR; BETA-PEPTIDE; CELL-DEATH; APOPTOSIS	Background: The activation of the aspartate-specific cysteinyl protease, Caspase-6, is proposed as an early pathogenic event of Alzheimer disease (AD) and Huntington's disease. Caspase-6 inhibitors could be useful against these neurodegenerative diseases but most Caspase-6 inhibitors have been exclusively studied in vitro or show acute liver toxicity in humans. Here, we assessed vinyl sulfone small molecule peptide caspase inhibitors for potential use in vivo. Methods: The IC50 of NWL vinyl sulfone small molecule caspase inhibitors were determined on Caspase-1 to 10, and Caspase-6-transfected human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. Inhibition of Caspase-6-mediated axonal degeneration was assessed in serum-deprived or amyloid precursor protein-transfected primary human CNS neurons. Cellular toxicity was measured by phase contrast microscopy, mitochondrial and lactate dehydrogenase colorimetric activity assays, or flow cytometry. Caspase inhibition was measured by fluorogenic activity assays, fluorescence microscopy, and western blot analyses. The effect of inhibitors on age-dependent cognitive deficits in Caspase-6 transgenic mice was assessed by the novel object recognition task. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry assessed the blood-brain barrier permeability of inhibitors in Caspase-6 mice. Results: Vinyl sulfone NWL-117 caspase inhibitor has a higher selectivity against Caspase-6, -4, -8, -9, and -10 whereas NWL-154 has higher selectivity against Caspase-6, -8, and -10. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of NWL-117 and NWL-154 is 192 nM and 100 nM against Caspase-6 in vitro, and 4.82 mu M and 3.63 mu M in Caspase-6-transfected HCT116 cells, respectively. NWL inhibitors are not toxic to HCT116 cells or to human primary neurons. NWL-117 and NWL-154 inhibit serum deprivation-induced Caspase-6 activity and prevent amyloid precursor protein-mediated neurite degeneration in human primary CNS neurons. NWL-117 crosses the blood brain barrier and reverses age-dependent episodic memory deficits in Caspase-6 mice. Conclusions: NWL peptidic vinyl methyl sulfone inhibitors are potent, non-toxic, blood-brain barrier permeable, and irreversible caspase inhibitors with neuroprotective effects in HCT116 cells, in primary human CNS neurons, and in Caspase-6 mice. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of vinyl sulfone inhibitors as caspase inhibitors against neurodegenerative diseases and sanction additional work to improve their selectivity against different caspases.

High-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous HCT for relapsing-remitting MS	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION; AGGRESSIVE MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; DISEASE-ACTIVITY; NO EVIDENCE; MARROW-TRANSPLANTATION; CLINICAL-TRIAL; MRI LESIONS; FOLLOW-UP; DISABILITY; EXPERIENCE	Objective: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and durability of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease stabilization after high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Methods: High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) is a phase II clinical trial of HDIT/HCT for patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS who experienced relapses with disability progression (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 3.0-5.5) while on MS disease-modifying therapy. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), defined as survival without death or disease activity from any one of: disability progression, relapse, or new lesions on MRI. Participants were evaluated through 5 years posttransplant. Toxicities were reported using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AE). Results: Twenty-five participants were evaluated for transplant and 24 participants underwent HDIT/HCT. Median follow-up was 62 months (range 12-72). EFS was 69.2% (90% confidence interval [CI] 50.2-82.1). Progression-free survival, clinical relapse-free survival, and MRI activity-free survival were 91.3% (90% CI 74.7%-97.2%), 86.9% (90% CI 69.5%-94.7%), and 86.3% (90% CI 68.1%-94.5%), respectively. AE due to HDIT/HCT were consistent with expected toxicities and there were no significant late neurologic adverse effects noted. Improvements were noted in neurologic disability with a median change in EDSS of 20.5 (interquartile range -1.5 to 0.0; p = 0.001) among participants who survived and completed the study. Conclusion: HDIT/HCT without maintenance therapy was effective for inducing long-term sustained remissions of active RRMS at 5 years.

Abnormal Capillary Vasodynamics Contribute to Ictal Neurodegeneration in Epilepsy	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; APOPTOSIS-INDUCING FACTOR; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CELL-DEATH; KAINIC ACID; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; PERICYTES; RAT; NEURONS	Seizure-driven brain damage in epilepsy accumulates over time, especially in the hippocampus, which can lead to sclerosis, cognitive decline, and death. Excitotoxicity is the prevalent model to explain ictal neurodegeneration. Current labeling technologies cannot distinguish between excitotoxicity and hypoxia, however, because they share common molecular mechanisms. This leaves open the possibility that undetected ischemic hypoxia, due to ictal blood flow restriction, could contribute to neurodegeneration previously ascribed to excitotoxicity. We tested this possibility with Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) and novel stereological analyses in several models of epileptic mice. We found a higher number and magnitude of NG2+ mural-cell mediated capillary constrictions in the hippocampus of epileptic mice than in that of normal mice, in addition to spatial coupling between capillary constrictions and oxidative stressed neurons and neurodegeneration. These results reveal a role for hypoxia driven by capillary blood flow restriction in ictal neurodegeneration.

J	Zengin-Toktas, Y; Woolley, SC				Zengin-Toktas, Yildiz; Woolley, Sarah Cushing			Singing modulates parvalbumin interneurons throughout songbird forebrain vocal control circuitry	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXTERNAL GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUIT; TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ZEBRA FINCH; NEURAL ACTIVITY; SOCIAL-CONTEXT; PERINEURONAL NETS; TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA; PROJECTION NEURONS; GENE-EXPRESSION	Across species, the performance of vocal signals can be modulated by the social environment. Zebra finches, for example, adjust their song performance when singing to females ('female-directed' or FD song) compared to when singing in isolation ('undirected' or UD song). These changes are salient, as females prefer the FD song over the UD song. Despite the importance of these performance changes, the neural mechanisms underlying this social modulation remain poorly understood. Previous work in finches has established that expression of the immediate early gene EGR1 is increased during singing and modulated by social context within the vocal control circuitry. Here, we examined whether particular neural subpopulations within those vocal control regions exhibit similar modulations of EGR1 expression. We compared EGR1 expression in neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV), a calcium buffer that modulates network plasticity and homeostasis, among males that performed FD song, males that produced UD song, or males that did not sing. We found that, overall, singing but not social context significantly affected EGR1 expression in PV neurons throughout the vocal control nuclei. We observed differences in EGR1 expression between two classes of PV interneurons in the basal ganglia nucleus Area X. Additionally, we found that singing altered the amount of PV expression in neurons in HVC and Area X and that distinct PV interneuron types in Area X exhibited different patterns of modulation by singing. These data indicate that throughout the vocal control circuitry the singing-related regulation of EGR1 expression in PV neurons may be less influenced by social context than in other neuron types and raise the possibility of cell-type specific differences in plasticity and calcium buffering.

Dynamics of contextual modulation of perceived shape in human vision	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; TEXTURE-SURROUND SUPPRESSION; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE AREA V4; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; TEMPORAL PROPERTIES; CORTICAL-NEURONS; TILT ILLUSION; PRIMATE V1	In biological vision, contextual modulation refers to the influence of a surround pattern on either the perception of, or the neural responses to, a target pattern. One studied form of contextual modulation deals with the effect of a surround texture on the perceived shape of a contour, in the context of the phenomenon known as the shape aftereffect. In the shape aftereffect, prolonged viewing, or adaptation to a particular contour's shape causes a shift in the perceived shape of a subsequently viewed contour. Shape aftereffects are suppressed when the adaptor contour is surrounded by a texture of similarly-shaped contours, a surprising result given that the surround contours are all potential adaptors. Here we determine the motion and temporal properties of this form of contextual modulation. We varied the relative motion directions, speeds and temporal phases between the central adaptor contour and the surround texture and measured for each manipulation the degree to which the shape aftereffect was suppressed. Results indicate that contextual modulation of shape processing is selective to motion direction, temporal frequency and temporal phase. These selectivities are consistent with one aim of vision being to segregate contours that define objects from those that form textured surfaces.

Neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are thought to critically contribute to this process; however, the neural circuits and synaptic mechanisms by which distinct populations of RVM neurons facilitate or diminish pain remain elusive. Here we used in vivo opto/chemogenetic manipulations and trans-synaptic tracing of genetically identified dorsal horn and RVM neurons to uncover an RVM-spinal cord-primary afferent circuit controlling pain thresholds. Unexpectedly, we found that RVM GABAergic neurons facilitate mechanical pain by inhibiting dorsal horn enkephalinergic/GABAergic interneurons. We further demonstrate that these interneurons gate sensory inputs and control pain through temporally coordinated enkephalin-and GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition of somatosensory neurons. Our results uncover a descending disynaptic inhibitory circuit that facilitates mechanical pain, is engaged during stress, and could be targeted to establish higher pain thresholds.

Methods: We carried out a multimodal 3T MRI profiling of 33 histologically proven FCD type IIA (9) and IIB (24) lesions. A multisurface approach operating on manual consensus labels systematically sampled intracortical and subcortical lesional features. Geodesic distance mapping quantified the same features in the lesion perimeter. Logistic regression assessed the relationship between MRI and histology, while supervised pattern learning was used for individualized subtype prediction. Results: FCD type IIB was characterized by abnormal morphology, intensity, diffusivity, and function across all surfaces, while type IIA lesions presented only with increased fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal and reduced diffusion anisotropy close to the gray-white matter interface. Similar to lesional patterns, perilesional anomalies were more marked in type IIB extending up to 16 mm. Structural MRI markers correlated with categorical histologic characteristics. A profile-based classifier predicted FCD subtypes with equal sensitivity of 85%, while maintaining a high specificity of 94% against healthy and disease controls. Conclusions: Image processing applied to widely available MRI contrasts has the ability to dissociate FCD subtypes at a mesoscopic level. Integrating in vivo staging of pathologic traits with automated lesion detection is likely to provide an objective definition of lesional boundary and assist emerging approaches, such as minimally invasive thermal ablation, which do not supply tissue specimen.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulation suppresses pathogenic astrocyte activation and chronic progressive CNS inflammation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						multiple sclerosis; sphingolipid metabolism; astrocytes; EAE; secondary progression	EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; FTY720 FINGOLIMOD; BAF312 SIPONIMOD; ORAL FINGOLIMOD; SLICE CULTURES; DOUBLE-BLIND; IN-VITRO	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS that causes disability in young adults as a result of the irreversible accumulation of neurological deficits. Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing-remitting phase, these therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for the identification of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches for SPMS. Here, we show that the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator fingolimod (FTY720) ameliorated chronic progressive experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in nonobese diabetic mice, an experimental model that resembles several aspects of SPMS, including neurodegeneration and disease progression driven by the innate immune response in the CNS. Indeed, S1PR modulation by FTY720 in murine and human astrocytes suppressed neurodegeneration-promoting mechanisms mediated by astrocytes, microglia, and CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory monocytes. Genome-wide studies showed that FTY720 suppresses transcriptional programs associated with the promotion of disease progression by astrocytes. The study of the molecular mechanisms controlling these transcriptional modules may open new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies for progressive MS.

Previous research has not clarified whether neural hyper- or hypo-responsiveness to anticipated rewards promotes vulnerability in these individuals. Here we use a longitudinal design to track 144 novelty-seeking adolescents at age 14 and 16 to determine whether neural activity in response to anticipated rewards predicts problematic drug use. We find that diminished BOLD activity in mesolimbic (ventral striatal and midbrain) and prefrontal cortical (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) regions during reward anticipation at age 14 predicts problematic drug use at age 16. Lower psychometric conscientiousness and steeper discounting of future rewards at age 14 also predicts problematic drug use at age 16, but the neural responses independently predict more variance than psychometric measures. Together, these findings suggest that diminished neural responses to anticipated rewards in novelty-seeking adolescents may increase vulnerability to future problematic drug use.

However, since nociceptive stimulation is associated with increases in systemic arterial pressure, it is essential to determine whether this coupling remains the same during different levels of nociception and pain. The main objective of the present study was to compare the amplitude of local field potentials (LFP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in the primary somatosensory cortex during nociceptive electrical stimulation of the contralateral or ipsilateral forepaw in isoflurane-anesthetized rats, while manipulating mean arterial pressure (MAP). MAP changes induced by nociceptive stimulation were manipulated by transecting the spinal cord at the upper thoracic segments (T1-T2), which interrupts sympathetic pathways and prevents nociception-related MAP increases, while sensory pathways between the forepaws and the brain remain intact. Intensity dependent increases in MAP and CBF were observed and these effects were abolished or significantly decreased after spinal transection (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the intensity-dependent changes in LFP amplitude were decreased for the contralateral stimulation but increased for the ipsilateral stimulation after spinal transection (p < 0.05). Thus, neurovascular coupling was altered differently by stimulus-induced MAP changes, depending on stimulus intensity and location. This demonstrates that CBF changes evoked by nociceptive processing do not always match neuronal activity, which may lead to inaccurate estimation of neuronal activity from hemodynamic changes. These results have important implications for neuroimaging of nociceptive and pain-related processes. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, there are disagreements on determinant factors and associated comorbidities of RLS. We aimed to estimate prevalence of RLS and investigate its associated comorbid conditions and risk factors in a large population-based door-to-door survey. Methods Following a multistage random sampling from the households lived in 22 urban districts of Tehran, Iran, 19176 participants with >= 30 years of age were recruited. Trained surveyors filled study checklist consisting of baseline characteristics, risk factors and comorbidity profile and the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) diagnostic criteria through face-toface interviews. Results In total, 1580 individuals were positively screened for RLS resulting in a standardized prevalence rate of 60.0/1000. There was a gradual increase in RLS prevalence by advancing age, however, sex difference disappeared after adjustment. Parkinsonism [adjusted odds' ratio (adj-OR) = 7.4 (95% CI: 5.3-10.4)], peripheral neuropathy [adj-OR = 3.7 (95% CI: 3.3-4.1)], subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) [adj-OR = 3.1 (95% CI: 2.7-3.4)], acting out dreams [adj-OR = 2.8 (95% CI: 2.5-3.2)], hyposmia [adj-OR = 2.5 (95% CI: 2.2-2.9)], active smoking [adj-OR = 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9)] and additional number of cardiometabolic diseases associated with higher risk of RLS [adj-OR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2-2.3)]. Conclusion Our findings showed that neuro-cognitive co-morbidities such as parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, SCI, acting out dreams and hyposmia as well as cardio-metabolic risk factors and diseases were independent determinants of RLS. It is recommended to screen individuals with either these comorbid conditions for RLS or the ones with RLS for the accompanying diseases.

Retrospective head circumference and longitudinal brain volume studies of two-year olds followed up at four years of age have provided evidence that increased brain volume may emerge early in development(1,2). Studies of infants at high familial risk of autism can provide insight into the early development of autism and have shown that characteristic social deficits in ASD emerge during the latter part of the first and in the second year of life(3,4). These observations suggest that prospective brain-imaging studies of infants at high familial risk of ASD might identify early postnatal changes in brain volume that occur before an ASD diagnosis. In this prospective neuroimaging study of 106 infants at high familial risk of ASD and 42 low-risk infants, we show that hyperexpansion of the cortical surface area between 6 and 12 months of age precedes brain volume overgrowth observed between 12 and 24 months in 15 high-risk infants who were diagnosed with autism at 24 months. Brain volume overgrowth was linked to the emergence and severity of autistic social deficits. A deep-learning algorithm that primarily uses surface area information from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain of 6-12-month-old individuals predicted the diagnosis of autism in individual high-risk children at 24 months (with a positive predictive value of 81% and a sensitivity of 88%). These findings demonstrate that early brain changes occur during the period in which autistic behaviours are first emerging.

Accordingly, neurons invest considerable cellular resources in chaperones, protein degradation, autophagy and mitophagy to maintain proteostasis and mitochondrial quality(3,4). Complicating the challenges of neuroprotection, misfolded human disease proteins and mitochondria can move into neighbouring cells via unknown mechanisms, which may promote pathological spread(5,6). Here we show that adult neurons from Caenorhabditis elegans extrude large (approximately 4 mu m) membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers that can contain protein aggregates and organelles. Inhibition of chaperone expression, autophagy or the proteasome, in addition to compromising mitochondrial quality, enhances the production of exophers. Proteotoxically stressed neurons that generate exophers subsequently function better than similarly stressed neurons that did not produce exophers. The extruded exopher transits through surrounding tissue in which some contents appear degraded, but some non-degradable materials can subsequently be found in more remote cells, suggesting secondary release. Our observations suggest that exopher-genesis is a potential response to rid cells of neurotoxic components when proteostasis and organelle function are challenged. We propose that exophers are components of a conserved mechanism that constitutes a fundamental, but formerly unrecognized, branch of neuronal proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control, which, when dysfunctional or diminished with age, might actively contribute to pathogenesis in human neurodegenerative disease and brain ageing.

Dance and music share gray matter structural correlates	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Dance; Music; Brain; Cortical thickness; Superior temporal gyrus	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; RHYTHM SYNCHRONIZATION PERFORMANCE; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ACTION OBSERVATION NETWORK; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL THICKNESS; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; BIOLOGICAL MOTION	Intensive practise of sensorimotor skills, such as music and dance, is associated with brain structural plasticity. While the neural correlates of music have been well-investigated, less is known about the neural correlates of dance. Additionally, the gray matter structural correlates of dance versus music training have not yet been directly compared. The objectives of the present study were to compare gray matter structure as measured by surface- and voxel-based morphometry between expert dancers, expert musicians and untrained controls, as well as to correlate gray matter structure with performance on dance and music-related tasks. Dancers and musicians were found to have increased cortical thickness compared to controls in superior temporal regions. Gray matter structure in the superior temporal gyrus was also correlated with performance on dance imitation, rhythm synchronization and melody discrimination tasks. These results suggest that superior temporal regions are important in both dance- and music-related skills and may be affected similarly by both types of long-term intensive training. This work advances knowledge of the neural correlates of dance and music, as well as training-associated brain plasticity in general. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, many articles report intrahemispheric alteration in functional networks. However, little is known about age-related changes within the Ventral Attention Network (VAN), which underlies selective attention. The aim of this study is to examine age-related changes within the VAN, focusing on connectivity between its regions. Here we report our findings on the analysis of 27 participants' (13 younger and 14 older healthy adults) BOLD signals as well as their performance on a letter-matching task. We identified the VAN independently for both groups using spatial independent component analysis. Three main findings emerged: First, younger adults were faster and more accurate on the task. Second, older adults had greater connectivity among posterior regions (right temporoparietal junction, right superior parietal lobule, right middle temporal gyrus and left cerebellum crus I) than younger adults but lower connectivity among anterior regions (right anterior insula, right medial superior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus). Older adults also had more connectivity between anterior and posterior regions than younger adults. Finally, correlations between connectivity and response time on the task showed a trend toward connectivity in posterior regions for the older group and in anterior regions for the younger group. Thus, this study shows that intrahemispheric neurofunctional changes in aging also affect the VAN. The results suggest that, in contexts of selective attention, posterior regions increased in importance for older adults, while anterior regions had reduced centrality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This microstructure regulates monoaminergic systems, notably dopamine and serotonin, and integrates cognitive with emotional and sensory processing. Early preclinical data have described Hb as a brain nucleus activated in anticipation of aversive outcomes. Evidence has now accumulated to show that the Hb encodes both rewarding and aversive aspects of external stimuli, thus driving motivated behaviors and decision making. Human Hb research is still nascent but develops rapidly, alongside with the growth of neuroimaging and deep brain stimulation techniques. Not surprisingly, Hb dysfunction has been associated with psychiatric disorders, and studies in patients have established evidence for Hb involvement in major depression, addiction, and schizophrenia, as well as in pain and analgesia. Here, we summarize current knowledge from animal research and overview the existing human literature on anatomy and function of the Hb. We also discuss challenges and future directions in targeting this small brain structure in both rodents and humans. By combining animal data and human experimental studies, this review addresses the translational potential of preclinical Hb research.

METHODS: With the use of postmortem brain tissue, mouse models of defeat stress, and in vitro analysis, we assessed microRNA (miRNA) regulation of DCC and whether changes in DCC levels in the PFC lead to vulnerability to depression-like behaviors. RESULTS: We identified miR-218 as a posttranscriptional repressor of DCC and detected coexpression of DCC and miR-218 in pyramidal neurons of human and mouse PFC. We found that exaggerated expression of DCC and reduced levels of miR-218 in the PFC are consistent traits of mice susceptible to chronic stress and of major depressive disorder in humans. Remarkably, upregulation of Dcc in mouse PFC pyramidal neurons causes vulnerability to stress-induced social avoidance and anhedonia. CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first demonstration of microRNA regulation of DCC and suggest that, by regulating DCC, miR-218 may be a switch of susceptibility versus resilience to stress-related disorders.

Specifically, when somatosensory input was reduced via anesthesia of the vocal fold mucosa, right AI activity was down regulated in trained singers. In the current fMRI study, we examined how masking of auditory feedback affects pitch-matching accuracy and corresponding brain activity in the same participants. We found that pitch-matching accuracy was unaffected by masking in trained singers yet declined in nonsingers. The corresponding brain region with the most differential and interesting activation pattern was the right Al, which was up regulated during masking in singers but down regulated in nonsingers. Likewise, its functional connectivity with inferior parietal, frontal, and voice-relevant sensorimotor areas was increased in singers yet decreased in nonsingers. These results indicate that singers relied more on somatosensory feedback, whereas nonsingers depended more critically on auditory feedback. When comparing auditory us somatosensory feedback involvement, the right anterior insula emerged as the only region for correcting intended vocal output by modulating what is heard or felt as a function of singing experience. We propose the right anterior insula as a key node in the brain's singing network for the integration of signals of salience across multiple sensory and cognitive domains to guide vocal behavior.

Studies have shown that MIT is an important aspect of spontaneous thought, yet we lack a clear understanding of how the neurocognitive architecture of the brain constrains this element of human cognition. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that MIT involves the coordination between multiple regions that include mesiotemporal structures such as the hippocampus, as well as prefrontal and parietal regions commonly associated with the default mode network (DMN). The current study used a multimodal neuroimaging approach to identify the structural and functional brain organisation that underlies individual differences in the capacity to spontaneously engage in MIT. Using regionally unconstrained diffusion tractography analysis, we found increased diffusion anisotropy in right lateralised temporo-limbic, corticospinal, inferior fronto-occipital tracts in participants who reported greater MIT. Probabilistic connectivity mapping revealed a significantly higher connection probability of the right hippocampus with these tracts. Resting-state functional MRI connectivity analysis using the right hippocampus as a seed region revealed greater functional coupling to the anterior regions of the DMN with increasing levels of MIT. These findings demonstrate that the interactions between the hippocampus and regions of the cortex underlie the capacity to engage in MIT, and support contemporary theoretical accounts that suggest that the integration of the hippocampus with the DMN provides the neurocognitive landscape that allows us to imagine distant times and places.

In particular, movement initiation and execution are mediated by patterns of synchronization and desynchronization that occur concurrently across distinct frequency bands and across multiple motor cortical areas. To date, motor-related local oscillatory modulations have been predominantly examined by quantifying increases or suppressions in spectral power. However, beyond signal power, spectral properties such as phase and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) have also been shown to carry information with regards to the oscillatory dynamics underlying motor processes. Yet, the distinct functional roles of phase, amplitude and PAC across the planning and execution of goal-directed motor behavior remain largely elusive. Here, we address this question with unprecedented resolution thanks to multi-site intracerebral EEG recordings in human subjects while they performed a delayed motor task. To compare the roles of phase, amplitude and PAC, we monitored intracranial brain signals from 748 sites across six medically intractable epilepsy patients at movement execution, and during the delay period where motor intention is present but execution is withheld. In particular, we used a machine-learning framework to identify the key contributions of various neuronal responses. We found a high degree of overlap between brain network patterns observed during planning and those present during execution. Prominent amplitude increases in the delta (2-4 Hz) and high gamma (60-200 Hz) bands were observed during both planning and execution. In contrast, motor alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) power were suppressed during execution, but enhanced during the delay period. Interestingly, single-trial classification revealed that low-frequency phase information, rather than spectral power change, was the most discriminant feature in dissociating action from intention. Additionally, despite providing weaker decoding, PAC features led to statistically significant classification of motor states, particularly in anterior cingulate cortex and premotor brain areas. These results advance our understanding of the distinct and partly overlapping involvement of phase, amplitude and the coupling between them, in the neuronal mechanisms underlying motor intentions and executions.

In particular, reduced RSFC coupling between occipital (visual) and temporal (auditory) regions has been reliably observed in early blind individuals (EB) at rest. In contrast, task-dependent activation studies have repeatedly demonstrated enhanced co-activation and connectivity of occipital and temporal regions during auditory processing in EB. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, the functional coupling between temporal and occipital networks at rest was directly compared to that of an auditory task in both EB and sighted controls (SC). Functional brain clusters shared across groups and cognitive states (rest and auditory task) were defined. In EBs, we observed higher occipito-temporal correlations in activity during the task than at rest. The reverse pattern was observed in SC. We also observed higher temporal variability of occipito-temporal RSFC in EB suggesting that occipital regions in this population may play the role of a multiple demand system. Our study reveals how the connectivity profile of sighted and early blind people is differentially influenced by their cognitive state, bridging the gap between previous task-dependent and RSFC studies. Our results also highlight how inferring group-differences in functional brain architecture solely based on resting-state acquisition has to be considered with caution.

Comparison of Interleaved silent steady state (ISSS) and conventional imaging in resting-state fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Acoustic scanner noise; Resting-state fMRI; Interleaved silent steady state; Auditory networks	INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; ACOUSTIC NOISE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; BACKGROUND-NOISE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DEFAULT-MODE; SCANNER; MRI	Resting-state fMRI studies have become very important in cognitive neuroscience because they are able to identify BOLD fluctuations in brain circuits involved in motor, cognitive, or perceptual processes without the use of an explicit task. Such approaches have been fruitful when applied to various disordered populations, or to children or the elderly. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the consequences of the loud acoustic scanner noise associated with conventional fMRI acquisition, which could be an important confounding factor affecting auditory and/or cognitive networks in resting-state fMRI. Several approaches have been developed to mitigate the effects of acoustic noise on fMRI signals, including sparse sampling protocols and interleaved silent steady state (ISSS) acquisition methods, the latter being used only for task-based fMRI. Here, we developed an ISSS protocol for resting-state fMRI (rs-ISSS) consisting of rapid acquisition of a set of echo planar imaging volumes following each silent period, during which the steady state longitudinal magnetization was maintained with a train of relatively silent slice-selective excitation pulses. We evaluated the test-retest reliability of intensity and spatial extent of connectivity networks of fMRI BOLD signal across three different days for rs-ISSS and compared it with a standard resting-state fMRI (rs-STD). We also compared the strength and distribution of connectivity networks between rs-ISSS and rs-STD. We found that both rs-ISSS and rs-STD showed high reproducibility of fMRI signal across days. In addition, rs-ISSS showed a more robust pattern of functional connectivity within the somatosensory and motor networks, as well as an auditory network compared with rs-STD. An increased connectivity between the default mode network and the language network and with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) network was also found for rs-ISSS compared with rs-STD. Finally, region of interest analysis showed higher interhemispheric connectivity in Heschl's gyri in rs-ISSS compared with rs-STD, with lower variability across days. The present findings suggest that rs-ISSS may be advantageous for detecting network connectivity in a less noisy environment, and that resting-state studies carried out with standard scanning protocols should consider the potential effects of loud noise on the measured networks.

CERES: A new cerebellum lobule segmentation method	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MRI; Cerebellum lobule segmentation; Non-local multi-atlas patch-based label fusion; Optimized PatchMatch	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MR-IMAGES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISEASE	The human cerebellum is involved in language, motor tasks and cognitive processes such as attention or emotional processing. Therefore, an automatic and accurate segmentation method is highly desirable to measure and understand the cerebellum role in normal and pathological brain development. In this work, we propose a patch-based multi-atlas segmentation tool called CERES (CEREbellum Segmentation) that is able to automatically parcellate the cerebellum lobules. The proposed method works with standard resolution magnetic resonance T1-weighted images and uses the Optimized PatchMatch algorithm to speed up the patch matching process. The proposed method was compared with related recent state-of-the-art methods showing competitive results in both accuracy (average DICE of 0.7729) and execution time (around 5 minutes).

Recovery of White Matter following Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Depends on Injury Severity	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						diffusion tensor imaging; pediatric; severity; traumatic brain injury; white matter	SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSION; TENSOR IMAGING DETECTS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; AXONAL INJURY; DIFFUSION; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; DTI; INTEGRITY; MICROSTRUCTURE	Previous studies in pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been variable in describing the effects of injury severity on white-matter development. The present study used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate prospective sub-acute and longitudinal relationships between early clinical indicators of injury severity, diffusion metrics, and neuropsychological outcomes. Pediatric patients with TBI underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 78, mean [M] = 10.56, standard deviation [SD] = 2.21 years) at the sub-acute stage after injury (M = 5.55, SD = 3.05 weeks), and typically developing children were also included and imaged (n = 30, M = 10.60, SD = 2.88 years). A sub-set of the patients with TBI (n = 15) was followed up with MRI 2 years post-injury. Diffusion MRI images were acquired at sub-acute and 2-year follow-up time points and analyzed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. At the sub-acute stage, mean diffusivity and axial diffusivity were significantly higher in the TBI group compared with matched controls (p < 0.05). TBI severity significantly predicted diffusion profiles at the sub-acute and 2-year post-injury MRI. Patients with more severe TBI also exhibited poorer information processing speed at 6-months post-injury, which in turn correlated with their diffusion metrics. These findings highlight that the severity of the injury not only has an impact on white-matter microstructure, it also impacts its recovery over time. Moreover, findings suggest that sub-acute microstructural changes may represent a useful prognostic marker to identify children at elevated risk for longer term deficits.

Cortical Thickness Changes and Their Relationship to Dual-Task Performance following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Youth	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						concussion; cortical thickness; dual-task paradigm; mTBI; working memory	SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSION; CHILDREN; MODERATE; MEMORY; MRI; CORTEX; VOLUME; CLASSIFICATION; REGISTRATION; ADULTS	Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in youth, especially in those who participate in sport. Recent investigations from our group have shown that asymptomatic children and adolescents with mTBI continue to exhibit alterations in neural activity and cognitive performance compared with those without a history of mTBI. This is an intriguing finding, given that current return-to-learn and return-to-play protocols rely predominately on subjective symptom reports, which may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle injury-related changes. As a result, youth may be at greater risk for re-injury and long-term consequences if they are cleared for activity while their brains continue to be compromised. It is currently unknown whether mTBI also affects brain microstructure in the developing brain, particularly cortical thickness, and whether such changes are also related to cognitive performance. The present study examined cortical thickness in 13 asymptomatic youth (10-14 years old) who had sustained an mTBI 3-8 months prior to testing compared with 14 age-matched typically developing controls. Cortical thickness was also examined in relation to working memory performance during single and dual task paradigms. The results show that youth who had sustained an mTBI had thinner cortices in the left dorsolateral prefrontal region and right anterior and posterior inferior parietal lobes. Additionally, cortical thinning was associated with slower reaction time during the dual-task condition in the injured youth only. The results also point to a possible relationship between functional and structural alterations as a result of mTBI in youth, and lend evidence for neural changes beyond symptom resolution.

IMAGEN Consortium	GABRB1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Associated with Altered Brain Responses (but not Performance) during Measures of Impulsivity and Reward Sensitivity in Human Adolescents	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alcohol abuse; stop signal; monetary incentive delay; fMRI; GABAA receptor; inferior frontal gyrus; insula; supramarginal gyrus	INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDERS; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; ALPHA-2 SUBUNIT; FUNCTIONAL MRI; DEPENDENCE; INHIBITION; GENES; TASK	Variations in genes encoding several GABA(A) receptors have been associated with human drug and alcohol abuse. Among these, a number of human studies have suggested an association between GABRB1, the gene encoding GABA(A) receptor beta 1 subunits, with Alcohol dependence (AD), both on its own and comorbid with other substance dependence and psychiatric illnesses. In the present study, we hypothesized that the GABRB1 genetically-associated increased risk for developing alcoholism may be associated with impaired behavioral control and altered sensitivity to reward, as a consequence of altered brain function. Exploiting the IMAGEN database (Schumann et al., 2010), we explored in a human adolescent population whether possession of the minor (T) variant of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2044081 is associated with performance of tasks measuring aspects of impulsivity, and reward sensitivity that are implicated in drug and alcohol abuse. Allelic variation did not associate with altered performance in either a stop-signal task (SST), measuring one aspect of impulsivity, or a monetary incentive delay (MID) task assessing reward anticipation. However, increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response in the right hemisphere inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left hemisphere caudate/insula and left hemisphere inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) during MID performance was higher in the minor (T) allelic group. In contrast, during SST performance, the BOLD response found in the right hemisphere supramarginal gyrus, right hemisphere lingual and left hemisphere inferior parietal gyrus indicated reduced responses in the minor genotype. We suggest that beta 1-containing GABA(A) receptors may play a role in excitability of brain regions important in controlling reward-related behavior, which may contribute to susceptibility to addictive behavior.

Quantitative assessment of white matter injury in preterm neonates	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TERM-EQUIVALENT AGE; BRAIN-INJURY; PREMATURE-INFANTS; PERIVENTRICULAR LEUKOMALACIA; IMAGE REGISTRATION; OUTCOMES; BORN; MATURATION; BIRTH; MRI	Objective: To quantitatively assess white matter injury (WMI) volume and location in very preterm neonates, and to examine the association of lesion volume and location with 18-month neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods: Volume and location of WMI was quantified on MRI in 216 neonates (median gestational age 27.9 weeks) who had motor, cognitive, and language assessments at 18 months corrected age (CA). Neonates were scanned at 32.1 postmenstrual weeks (median) and 68 (31.5%) had WMI; of 66 survivors, 58 (87.9%) had MRI and 18-month outcomes. WMI was manually segmented and transformed into a common image space, accounting for intersubject anatomical variability. Probability maps describing the likelihood of a lesion predicting adverse 18-month outcomes were developed. Results: WMI occurs in a characteristic topology, with most lesions occurring in the periventricular central region, followed by posterior and frontal regions. Irrespective of lesion location, greater WMI volumes predicted poor motor outcomes (p = 0.001). Lobar regional analysis revealed that greater WMI volumes in frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes have adverse motor outcomes (all, p < 0.05), but only frontal WMI volumes predicted adverse cognitive outcomes (p = 0.002). To account for lesion location and volume, voxel-wise odds ratio (OR) maps demonstrate that frontal lobe lesions predict adverse cognitive and language development, with maximum odds ratios (ORs) of 78.9 and 17.5, respectively, while adverse motor outcomes are predicted by widespread injury, with maximum OR of 63.8. Conclusions: The predictive value of frontal lobe WMI volume highlights the importance of lesion location when considering the neurodevelopmental significance of WMI. Frontal lobe lesions are of particular concern.

Comparative genomics reveals high biological diversity and specific adaptations in the industrially and medically important fungal genus Aspergillus	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article						Aspergillus; Genome sequencing; Comparative genomics; Fungal biology	AFFINITY NITRATE TRANSPORTER; AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTERS; CYTOSINE METHYLTRANSFERASE HOMOLOG; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; BIOSYNTHETIC-PATHWAY; FILAMENTOUS FUNGI; NITRIC-OXIDE; G-PROTEIN	Background: The fungal genus Aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. Species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. The genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. Results: We have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse Aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. Comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. Observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. This revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. A genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. Conclusions: Many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. The comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. Insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi.

Comprehensive patient care includes not only adherence to clinical guidelines to control and when possible cure the disease but also appropriate symptom control. Pain is one of the most prevalent symptoms in patients diagnosed with lung cancer; it can arise from local invasion of chest structures or metastatic disease invading bones, nerves, or other anatomical structures potentially painful. Pain can also be a consequence of therapeutic approaches like surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Conventional medical management of cancer pain includes prescription of opioids and coadjuvants at doses sufficient to control the symptoms without causing severe drug effects. When an adequate pharmacological medical management fails to provide satisfactory analgesia or when it causes limiting side effects, interventional cancer pain techniques may be considered. Interventional pain management is devoted to the use of invasive techniques such as joint injections, nerve blocks and/or neurolysis, neuromodulation, and cement augmentation techniques to provide diagnosis and treatment of pain syndromes resistant to conventional medical management. Advantages of interventional approaches include better analgesic outcomes without experiencing drug-related side effects and potential for opioid reduction thus avoiding central side effects. This review will describe various pain syndromes frequently described in lung cancer patients and those interventional techniques potentially indicated for those cases.

Low-frequency theta oscillations in the human hippocampus during real-world and virtual navigation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							STRATEGIES; LESIONS; BRAIN; CELLS; RAT	Low-Frequency Oscillations (LFO) in the range of 7-9 Hz, or theta rhythm, has been recorded in rodents ambulating in the real world. However, intra-hippocampus EEG recordings during virtual navigation in humans have consistently reported LFO that appear to predominate around 3-4 Hz. Here we report clear evidence of 7-9 Hz rhythmicity in raw intra-hippocampus EEG traces during real as well as virtual movement. Oscillations typically occur at a lower frequency in virtual than real world navigation. This study highlights the possibility that human and rodent hippocampal EEG activity are not as different as previously reported and this difference may arise, in part, due to the lack of actual movement in previous human navigation studies, which were virtual.

Quantifying cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PHYSICAL PAIN; BACK-PAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN MEDIATORS; BASAL GANGLIA; FMRI; MECHANISMS	Cerebral processes contribute to pain beyond the level of nociceptive input and mediate psychological and behavioural influences. However, cerebral contributions beyond nociception are not yet well characterized, leading to a predominant focus on nociception when studying pain and developing interventions. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with machine learning to develop a multivariate pattern signature-termed the stimulus intensity independent pain signature-1 (SIIPS1)-that predicts pain above and beyond nociceptive input in four training data sets (Studies 1-4, N = 137). The SIIPS1 includes patterns of activity in nucleus accumbens, lateral prefrontal and parahippocampal cortices, and other regions. In cross-validated analyses of Studies 1-4 and in two independent test data sets (Studies 5-6, N = 46), SIIPS1 responses explain variation in trial-by-trial pain ratings not captured by a previous fMRI-based marker for nociceptive pain. In addition, SIIPS1 responses mediate the pain-modulating effects of three psychological manipulations of expectations and perceived control. The SIIPS1 provides an extensible characterization of cerebral contributions to pain and specific brain targets for interventions.

Luman contributes to brefeldin A-induced prion protein gene expression by interacting with the ERSE26 element	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM-STRESS; BZIP TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; ANTI-BAX FUNCTION; MEDIATED CELL-DEATH; ER STRESS; RESPONSE ELEMENT; FAMILY-MEMBERS; GASTRIC-CANCER; MESSENGER-RNA; HUMAN NEURONS	The cellular prion protein (PrP) is essential for transmissible prion diseases, but its exact physiological function remains unclear. Better understanding the regulation of the human prion protein gene (PRNP) expression can provide insight into this elusive function. Spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) was recently shown to mediate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced PRNP expression. In this manuscript, we identify Luman, a ubiquitous, non-canonical unfolded protein response (UPR), as a novel regulator of ER stress-induced PRNP expression. Luman activity was transcriptionally and proteolytically activated by the ER stressing drug brefeldin A (BFA) in human neurons, astrocytes, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Over-expression of active cleaved Luman (Delta Luman) increased PrP levels, while siRNA-mediated Luman silencing decreased BFA-induced PRNP expression. Site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Delta Luman regulates PRNP expression by interacting with the ER stress response element 26 (ERSE26). Co-over-expression and siRNA-mediated silencing experiments showed that sXBP1 and Delta Luman both up-regulate ER stress-induced PRNP expression. Attempts to understand the function of PRNP up-regulation by Luman excluded a role in atorvastatininduced neuritogenesis, ER-associated degradation, or proteasomal inhibition-induced cell death. Overall, these results refine our understanding of ER stress-induced PRNP expression and function.

While soluble A beta oligomers (A beta Os) have deleterious effects on synapse function and reduce synapse number, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we screened synaptic organizer proteins for cell-surface interaction with A beta Os and identified a novel interaction between neurexins (NRXs) and A beta Os. A beta Os bind to NRXs via the N-terminal histidine-rich domain (HRD) of beta-NRX1/2/3 and alternatively-spliced inserts at splicing site 4 of NRX1/2. In artificial synapse-formation assays, A beta Os diminish excitatory presynaptic differentiation induced by NRX-interacting proteins including neuroligin1/2 (NLG1/2) and the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein LRRTM2. Although A beta Os do not interfere with the binding of NRX1 beta to NLG1 or LRRTM2, time-lapse imaging revealed that A beta O treatment reduces surface expression of NRX1 beta on axons and that this reduction depends on the NRX1 beta HRD. In transgenic mice expressing mutated human amyloid precursor protein, synaptic expression of beta-NRXs, but not alpha-NRXs, decreases. Thus our data indicate that A beta Os interact with NRXs and that this interaction inhibits NRX-mediated presynaptic differentiation by reducing surface expression of axonal beta-NRXs, providing molecular and mechanistic insights into how A beta Os lead to synaptic pathology in AD.

The objectives of the current analyses were to evaluate T1 lesions and other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, including whole brain volume and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of normal appearing brain tissue (NABT), and the proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), over 2 years. Methods: Patients enrolled in the ADVANCE study received continuous peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4 weeks for 2 years, or delayed treatment (placebo in Year 1; peginterferon beta-1a every 2 or 4 weeks in Year 2). MRI scans were performed at baseline and Weeks 24, 48, and 96. Proportions of patients with NEDA were calculated based on radiological criteria (absence of Gd + and new/newly-enlarging T2 lesions) and clinical criteria (no relapse or confirmed disability progression) separately and overall. Results: Peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks significantly reduced the number and volume of T1-hypointense lesions compared with delayed treatment over 2 years. Changes in whole brain volume and MTR of NABT were suggestive of pseudoatrophy during the first 6 months of peginterferon beta-1a treatment, which subsequently began to resolve. Significantly more patients in the peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks group compared with the delayed treatment group met MRI-NEDA criteria (41% vs 21%; odds ratio [OR] 2.56; p < 0.0001), clinical-NEDA criteria (71% vs 57%; OR 1.90; p < 0.0001) and achieved overall-NEDA (37% vs 16%; OR 3.09; p < 0.0001).

Shorter time in bed during weekdays, and later weekend sleeping hours correlate with smaller brain grey matter volumes in frontal, anterior cingulate, and precuneus cortex regions. Poor school grade average associates with later weekend bedtime and smaller grey matter volumes in medial brain regions. The medial prefrontal anterior cingulate cortex appears most tightly related to the adolescents' variations in sleep habits, as its volume correlates inversely with both weekend bedtime and wake up time, and also with poor school performance. These findings suggest that sleep habits, notably during the weekends, have an alarming link with both the structure of the adolescent brain and school performance, and thus highlight the need for informed interventions.

It is unknown whether this relationship remains reliable under altered brain states associated with acetylcholine (ACh) levels, such as attention and arousal and in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Wetherefore assessed the effects of varying ACh tone on whisker-evokedNVCresponses in rat barrel cortex, measured by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neurophysiological recordings (local field potentials, LFPs). Wefound that acutely enhanced ACh tone significantly potentiated whisker-evoked CBF responses through muscarinic ACh receptors and concurrently facilitated neuronal responses, as illustrated by increases in the amplitude and power in high frequencies of the evoked LFPs. However, the cellular identity of the activated neuronal network within the responsive barrel was unchanged, as characterized by c-Fos upregulation in pyramidal cells and GABA interneurons coexpressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. In contrast, chronic ACh deprivation hindered whisker-evoked CBF responses and the amplitude and power in most frequency bands of the evoked LFPs and reduced the rostrocaudal extent and area of the activated barrel without altering its identity. Correlations between LFP power and CBF, used to estimate NVC, were enhanced under high ACh tone and disturbed significantly by ACh depletion. We conclude that ACh is not only a facilitator but also a prerequisite for the full expression of sensory-evoked NVC responses, indicating that ACh may alter the fidelity of hemodynamic signals in assessing changes in evoked neuronal activity.

Perception and Modeling of Affective Qualities of Musical Instrument Sounds across Pitch Registers	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						musical timbre; emotion; pitch register; musical instruments; valence; tension arousal; energy arousal; preference	EMOTIONAL RESPONSES; TIMBRE; DIMENSIONS; EXPRESSION; REGRESSION; EXCERPTS; FEATURES; CUES	Composers often pick specific instruments to convey a given emotional tone in their music, partly due to their expressive possibilities, but also due to their timbres in specific registers and at given dynamic markings. Of interest to both music psychology and music informatics from a computational point of view is the relation between the acoustic properties that give rise to the timbre at a given pitch and the perceived emotional quality of the tone. Musician and nonmusician listeners were presented with 137 tones produced at a fixed dynamic marking (forte) playing tones at pitch class D# across each instrument's entire pitch range and with different playing techniques for standard orchestral instruments drawn from the brass, woodwind, string, and pitched percussion families. They rated each tone on six analogical-categorical scales in terms of emotional valence (positive/negative and pleasant/unpleasant), energy arousal (awake/tired), tension arousal (excited/calm), preference (like/dislike), and familiarity. Linear mixed models revealed interactive effects of musical training, instrument family, and pitch register, with non-linear relations between pitch register and several dependent variables. Twenty-three audio descriptors from the Timbre Toolbox were computed for each sound and analyzed in two ways: linear partial least squares regression (PLSR) and nonlinear artificial neural net modeling. These two analyses converged in terms of the importance of various spectral, temporal, and spectrotemporal audio descriptors in explaining the emotion ratings, but some differences also emerged. Different combinations of audio descriptors make major contributions to the three emotion dimensions, suggesting that they are carried by distinct acoustic properties. Valence is more positive with lower spectral slopes, a greater emergence of strong partials, and an amplitude envelope with a sharper attack and earlier decay. Higher tension arousal is carried by brighter sounds, more spectral variation and more gentle attacks. Greater energy arousal is associated with brighter sounds, with higher spectral centroids and slower decrease of the spectral slope, as well as with greater spectral emergence. The divergences between linear and nonlinear approaches are discussed.

Anhedonia to music and mu-opioids: Evidence from the administration of naltrexone	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; FOOD REWARD; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; BLOCKADE; EMOTION; PAIN; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	Music's universality and its ability to deeply affect emotions suggest an evolutionary origin. Previous investigators have found that naltrexone (NTX), a mu-opioid antagonist, may induce reversible anhedonia, attenuating both positive and negative emotions. The neurochemical basis of musical experience is not well-understood, and the NTX-induced anhedonia hypothesis has not been tested with music. Accordingly, we administered NTX or placebo on two different days in a double-blind crossover study, and assessed participants' responses to music using both psychophysiological (objective) and behavioral (subjective) measures. We found that both positive and negative emotions were attenuated. We conclude that endogenous opioids are critical to experiencing both positive and negative emotions in music, and that music uses the same reward pathways as food, drug and sexual pleasure. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence for the evolutionary biological substrates of music.

Methods: Multimodal neuroimaging data were obtained from a total of 572 older individuals without dementia (cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and included assessments of regional amyloid load with AV45-PET, glucose metabolism with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and gray matter volume with structural MRI. Imaging indexes of APOE2 carriers were contrasted to risk-neutral APOE3 homozygotes, and analyses were controlled for age, sex, education, and clinical diagnosis. Additional models examined genotype-specific effects of age on the imaging markers. Results: In region-of-interest-based analyses, APOE2 carriers had significantly less precuneal amyloid pathology and did not show the typical age-related increase in amyloid load, although the age 3 genotype interaction was only trend-level significant. In contrast, parietal metabolism and hippocampal volume did not differ between APOE2 and APOE3 genotypes, and both groups showed comparable negative effects of age on these markers. The amyloid specificity of APOE2-related brain changes was corroborated in 2 complementary analyses: spatially unbiased voxel-wise analyses showing widespread reductions in amyloid deposition but no differences in gray matter volume or metabolism and an analysis of CSF-based biomarkers showing a significant effect on amyloid but not on tau pathology. Conclusions: Regarding the range of Alzheimer disease biomarkers considered in the present study, the APOE2 allele appears to have a relatively selective effect on reduced accumulation of amyloid pathology in the aged brain.

Identification of shared risk loci and pathways for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; GENE-EXPRESSION; ENRICHMENT; COMMON; METAANALYSIS; POPULATIONS; GLUTAMATE	Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric disease characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. BD shows substantial clinical and genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders, in particular schizophrenia (SCZ). The genes underlying this etiological overlap remain largely unknown. A recent SCZ genome wide association study (GWAS) by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium identified 128 independent genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The present study investigated whether these SCZ-associated SNPs also contribute to BD development through the performance of association testing in a large BD GWAS dataset (9747 patients, 14278 controls). After re-imputation and correction for sample overlap, 22 of 107 investigated SCZ SNPs showed nominal association with BD. The number of shared SCZ-BD SNPs was significantly higher than expected (p = 1.46x10(-8)). This provides further evidence that SCZ-associated loci contribute to the development of BD. Two SNPs remained significant after Bonferroni correction. The most strongly associated SNP was located near TRANK1, which is a reported genome-wide significant risk gene for BD. Pathway analyses for all shared SCZ-BD SNPs revealed 25 nominally enriched gene-sets, which showed partial overlap in terms of the underlying genes. The enriched gene-sets included calcium-and glutamate signaling, neuropathic pain signaling in dorsal horn neurons, and calmodulin binding. The present data provide further insights into shared risk loci and disease-associated pathways for BD and SCZ. This may suggest new research directions for the treatment and prevention of these two major psychiatric disorders.

There is preliminary evidence that a functional modulation within and between primary motor cortices as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) might be one candidate mechanism mediating the observed behavioral effects. Recently, studies using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have indicated that MVF-induced functional changes might not be restricted to the primary motor cortex (M1) but also include higher order regions responsible for perceptual-motor coordination and visual attention. However, aside from these instantaneous task-induced brain changes, little is known about learning-related neuroplasticity induced by MVF. Thus, in the present study, we assessed MVF-induced functional network plasticity with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). We performed rs-fMRI of 35 right-handed, healthy adults before and after performing a complex ball-rotation task. The primary outcome measure was the performance improvement of the untrained left hand (LH) before and after right hand (RH) training with MVF (mirror group [MG], n = 17) or without MVF (control group [CG], n = 18). Behaviorally, the MG showed superior performance improvements of the untrained LH. In resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC), an interaction analysis between groups showed changes in left visual cortex (V1, V2) revealing an increase of centrality in the MG. Within group comparisons showed further functional alterations in bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1), left V4 and left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIP) in the MG, only. Importantly, a correlation analysis revealed a linear positive relationship between MVF-induced improvements of the untrained LH and functional alterations in left SM1. Our results suggest that MVF-induced performance improvements are associated with functional learning-related brain plasticity and have identified additional target regions for non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, a finding of potential interest for neurorehabilitation.

However, little is known of the in vivo biochemical alterations that could be markers of suicidal risk. Methods: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure at-rest levels of 9 metabolites (glutamate, glutamine, glutathione, GABA, N-acetylaspartate (NM), N-acetylaspartylglutamate, myo-inositol, aspartate, total choline), in the right dorsal prefrontal cortex of 25 unmedicated depressed patients, including 15 with a history of suicidal behavior, and 33 healthy controls. We compared metabolite levels between groups, and run correlations with 9 clinical variables relevant for suicide risk. Results: We found very significant associations between NM levels and psychological pain measured by a simple analog scale (r = -0.47, p < 10(-3)), and between choline levels and current suicidal ideas (r = 0.53, p < 10(-3)). These associations were independent from group, gender, age or depression level. While psychological pain and suicidal ideas were highly inter-correlated (r = 0.61, p < 10(-3)), the above-mentioned associations with-compounds were independent. Mental pain was also correlated with Stroop interference, verbal fluency and (indirectly) decision-making, all cognitive measures previously associated with suicidal risk. Lower NM levels, and higher glutamine levels were found in suicide attempters and in all patients relative to healthy controls, but these differences did not survive co-variation with age or Bonferroni's correction. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that markers of impaired neuronal and glial functioning in right dorsal prefrontal cortex underlie cardinal symptoms of the suicidal crisis. Targeting this region may be relevant for the short-term suicidal prevention. This study also supports a dimensional perspective in research on suicidal behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in-vivo analysis of brain structures has become possible. Among different sub-cortical structures, the basal ganglia (BG) has been investigated as a putative anatomical biomarker in MR-based studies of Mn toxicity. However, previous investigations have yielded inconsistent results in terms of regional MR signal intensity changes. These discrepancies may be due to the subtlety of brain alterations caused by Mn toxicity, coupled to analysis techniques that lack the requisite detection power. Here, based on brain MRI, we apply a 3D surface-based morphometry method on 3 bilateral basal ganglia structures in school-age children chronically exposed to Mn through drinking water to investigate the effect of Mn exposure on brain anatomy. Our method successfully pinpointed significant enlargement of many areas of the basal ganglia structures, preferentially affecting the putamen. Moreover, these areas showed significant correlations with fine motor performance, indicating a possible link between altered basal ganglia neurodevelopment and declined motor performance in high Mn exposed children.

Mutations in EXTL3 Cause Neuro-immuno-skeletal Dysplasia Syndrome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							HEPARAN-SULFATE PROTEOGLYCANS; TUMOR SUPPRESSORS EXT1; COPY-NUMBER VARIATION; EXOME SEQUENCE DATA; DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; GENE; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; BIOSYNTHESIS; MORPHOGENESIS	EXTL3 regulates the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), important for both skeletal development and hematopoiesis, through the formation of HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). By whole-exome sequencing, we identified homozygous missense mutations c.1382C>T, c.1537C>T, c.1970A>G, and c.2008T>G in EXTL3 in nine affected individuals from five unrelated families. Notably, we found the identical homozygous missense mutation c.1382C>T (p.Pro461Leu) in four affected individuals from two unrelated families. Affected individuals presented with variable skeletal abnormalities and neurodevelopmental defects. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with a complete absence of T cells was observed in three families. EXTL3 was most abundant in hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitor T cells, which is in line with a SCID phenotype at the level of early T cell development in the thymus. To provide further support for the hypothesis that mutations in EXTL3 cause a neuro-immuno-skeletal dysplasia syndrome, and to gain insight into the pathogenesis of the disorder, we analyzed the localization of EXTL3 in fibroblasts derived from affected individuals and determined glycosaminoglycan concentrations in these cells as well as in urine and blood. We observed abnormal glycosaminoglycan concentrations and increased concentrations of the non-sulfated chondroitin disaccharide D0a0 and the disaccharide D0a4 in serum and urine of all analyzed affected individuals. In summary, we show that biallelic mutations in EXTL3 disturb glycosaminoglycan synthesis and thus lead to a recognizable syndrome characterized by variable expression of skeletal, neurological, and immunological abnormalities.

Short-term monocular occlusion produces changes in ocular dominance by a reciprocal modulation of interocular inhibition	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; PLASTICITY; COMPONENTS; BRAIN; MEG; EYE	Ocular dominance can be modulated by short-term monocular deprivation. This changes the contribution that each eye makes to binocular vision, an example of adult cortical neuroplasticity. Optical imaging in primates and psychophysics in humans suggest these neuroplastic changes occur in V1. Here we use brain imaging (MEG) in normal adults to better understand the nature of these neuroplastic changes. The results suggest that short-term monocular deprivation, whether it be by an opaque or translucent patch, modulates dichoptic inhibitory interactions in a reciprocal fashion; the unpatched eye is inhibited, the patched eye is released from inhibition. These observations locate the neuroplastic changes to a level of visual processing where there are interocular inhibitory interactions prior to binocular combination and help to explain why both binocular rivalry and fusional tasks reveal them.

Prior History of Feeding-Swallowing Difficulties in Children With Language Impairment	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY			English	Article							PRETERM INFANTS; CEREBRAL-PALSY; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT; SUCKING BEHAVIOR; EATING PROBLEMS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; TEST-SCORES; DISORDERS; ASSOCIATION	Purpose: This study updated and extended our previous investigation (Malas et al., 2015) of feeding-swallowing difficulties and concerns (FSCs) in children with language impairments (LI) by using more stringent inclusion criteria and targeting children earlier in the care delivery pathway. Method: Retrospective analyses were performed on the clinical files of 29 children (average age: 60 months, SD = 9.0) diagnosed as having LI using standardized testing, nonstandardized testing and final speech-language pathologist judgment. The files of children born prematurely or with a history of anatomical, structural, neurodevelopmental, cognitive, sensory, motor, or speech disorders were excluded. Literature-based indicators were used to determine the prevalence of difficulties in sucking, food transition, food selectivity, and salivary control. Values were compared with the general population estimate of Lindberg et al. (1992). Results: A significantly higher percentage of histories of FSCs (48%) were found in the files of children with LI when compared with the population estimate (x(2) = 13.741, df = 1, p <.001). Difficulties in food transition (31%) and food selectivity (14%) were the most frequent. Data confirm and extend our previous findings and suggest that a previous history of FSCs may characterize children with LI early in their care delivery pathway.

Assays that measure endogenous GPCR signalling in vivo are needed to specify the intracellular signalling pathways leading to therapeutic vs. adverse outcomes in animal models. To this end, genetically encoded biosensors can be expressed in vivo with cell type specificity to report GPCR signalling in real time. Biosensor imaging is facilitated by novel microscopic and photometric techniques developed for imaging in behaving animals. The techniques discussed here herald a new wave of in vivo signalling studies that will help identify therapeutically relevant signalling, and design functionally selective drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases.

Although several validated tools are available to assess sexual function in healthy and clinical populations, items on orgasm are limited to frequency or dichotomous responses. A neurophysiologic model of orgasm developed from previous research in able-bodied and spinally injured populations offers a promising framework for the construction of a new questionnaire. Aim: To develop and validate a brief self-report measurement of orgasm by the assessment of bodily and physiologic sensations perceived during climax by able-bodied individuals. Although the currently available tool focuses on the phenomenological sensations associated with climax, the goal of this questionnaire was to capture the more specific genital and extragenital sensations associated with orgasm. Main Outcome Measures: The current Bodily Sensations of Orgasm questionnaire and the Orgasm Rating Scale. Methods: Data from previous research conducted on individuals with spinal cord injury and the available empirical literature provided a pool of 45 items organized into four categories, which were reviewed by an expert panel. Upon review, a 28-item questionnaire was created and administered to a community sample of 227 participants, including men and women, 18 to 73 years old. Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported the four-factor model, in which orgasm is comprised of extragenital sensations, genital sensations and spasms, nociceptive sensations, and sweating responses. Overall, a high degree of internal consistency was found for the final 22-item questionnaire (Cronbach alpha = 0.87), with individual reliability coefficients showing moderate to high internal consistency (r = 0.65e0.79) for each dimension. Overall temporal stability of the measurement was acceptable (r = 0.74). Using the Orgasm Rating Scale, satisfying convergent validity was confirmed, thereby indicating that the two measurements are complementary. Conclusion: The Bodily Sensations of Orgasm questionnaire allows for a brief evaluation of the physical and physiologic sensations associated with orgasm. Findings also suggest perceptual differences between men and women with regard to climax, with women reporting a larger repertoire of climactic sensations during orgasm.

Haemorrhagic shock and brain injury are the leading causes of death following trauma. While intravenous fluids have traditionally been used to support organ perfusion in the setting of haemorrhage, recent investigations have suggested that restricting fluid therapy by tolerating more severe hypotension may improve survival. However, the safety of permissive hypotension remains uncertain, particularly among patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. Vasopressors preferentially vasoconstrict blood vessels that supply non-vital organs and capacitance vessels, thereby mobilising the unstressed blood volume. Used as fluid-sparing adjuncts, these drugs can complement resuscitative measures by correcting hypotension without diluting clotting factors or increasing the risk for tissue oedema. Methods and analysis: We will identify randomised control trials comparing early resuscitation with vasopressors versus placebo or standard care in adults following traumatic injury. Data sources will include MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, clinical trial registries and conference proceedings. Two reviewers will independently determine trial eligibility. For each included trial, we will conduct duplicate independent data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We will assess the overall quality of the data for each individual outcome using the GRADE approach. Ethics and dissemination: We will report this review in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We will disseminate our findings at critical care and trauma conferences and through a publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Methods: Thirty-three high-intensity intermittent-trained athletes completed two 30-s Wingate anaerobic test sessions, 3 x 30-s (WAnT 1-3) and 1 x 30-s (WAnT 4), on a cycling ergometer. WAnT 1-3 and WAnT 4 were separated by a randomly assigned 24-min recovery intervention selected from among blood-flow restriction, passive rest, placebo stimulation, or neuromuscular electrical-stimulation-induced blood flow. Calf arterial inflow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography at regular intervals throughout the recovery period. Performance was measured in terms of peak and mean power output during WAnT 1 and WAnT 4. Results: After the recovery interventions, a large (r =.68 [90% CL.42;.83]) and very large (r =.72 (90% CL.49;.86]) positive correlation were observed between the change in calf arterial inflowand the change in mean and peak power output, respectively. Calf arterial inflow was significantly higher during the neuromuscular-electrical-stimulation recovery intervention than with the blood-flow-restriction, passive-rest, and placebo-stimulation interventions (P <.001). This corresponds to the only intervention that allowed performance recovery (I) >.05). No recovery effect was linked to heart rate or blood lactate concentration levels. Conclusions: For the first time, these data support the existence of a positive correlation between an increase in blood flow and performance recovery between bouts of high-intensity exercise. As a practical consideration, this effect can be obtained by using neuromuscular electrical stimulation-induced blood flow since this passive, simple strategy could be easily applied during short-term recovery.

GBS is the leading cause of chorioamnionitis and cerebral injuries in newborns, occurring most often in the absence of maternofetal pathogen translocation. Despite GBS being the most frequent bacterium colonizing pregnant women, no preclinical studies have investigated the impact of end-gestational maternal GBS exposure on the offspring's brain development and its behavioral correlates. Our hypothesis is that GBS-induced gestational infection/inflammation has a deleterious neurodevelopmental impact on uninfected offspring. Our goal was to study the impact of maternal GBS infection on the placental and neurodevelopmental features in the offspring using a new preclinical rat model. GBS-exposed placentas exhibited chorioamnionitis characterized by the presence of Gram-positive cocci and polymorphonuclear cells, with the latter being significantly more prominent in the labyrinth of male offspring. GBS-exposed male offspring had reduced thickness of periventricular white matter. In addition, they exhibited autistic-like behaviors, such as abnormal social interaction and communication, impaired processing of sensory information and hyperactivity. Overall, these data show for the first time that gestational exposure to GBS plays an important role in the generation of neurodevelopmental abnormalities reminiscent of human autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These results provide new evidence in favor of the role of a common and modifiable infectious/inflammatory environmental factor in human ASD pathophysiology. Autism Res2017, 10: 233-245.

Automatic classification of the coronary artery layers (intima, media, and scar features) is important for analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT) images recorded in pediatric patients. OCT has been known as an intracoronary imaging modality using near-infrared light which has recently been used to image the inner coronary artery tissues of pediatric patients, providing high spatial resolution (ranging from 10 to 20 mu m). This study aims to develop a robust and fully automated tissue classification method by using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractor and comparing the predictions of three state-of-the-art classifiers, CNN, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show the robustness of CNN as the feature extractor and random forest as the classifier with classification rate up to 96%, especially to characterize the second layer of coronary arteries (media), which is a very thin layer and it is challenging to be recognized and specified from other tissues.

Although they are primarily localized within the cytosol, 14-3-3s are also known to be present in the extracellular environment. Externalization of 14-3-3 can occur as a result of cell death or physiologically via release in exosomes. Interesting biological activities with relevance for tissue homeostasis and disease are now being described for extracellular 14-3-3s. Moreover, aminopeptidase N (APN) has been identified as a cell surface receptor for 14-3-3s. Here we review the array of bioactivities that have been ascribed to extracellular 14-3-3s and discuss applications as biomarkers and as targets for drug development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Tracing studies on nonhuman primates reveal a wide array of cortical connections in the frontal (orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortices, cingulate areas and supplementary motor area), parietal (primary and secondary somatosensory cortices) and temporal (temporal pole, auditory, prorhinal and entorhinal cortices) lobes. However, recent human tractography studies have not observed connections between the insula and the cingulate cortices, although these structures are thought to be functionally intimately connected. In this work, we try to unravel the structural connectivity between these regions and other known functionally connected structures, benefiting from a higher number of subjects and the latest state-of-the-art high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography algorithms with anatomical priors. By performing an HARDI tractography analysis on 46 young normal adults, our study reveals a wide array of connections between the insula and the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes as well as limbic regions, with a rostro-caudal organization in line with tracing studies inmacaques. Notably, we reveal for the first time in humans a clear structural connectivity between the insula and the cingulate, parahippocampal, supramarginal and angular gyri as well as the precuneus and occipital regions.

In this study, we investigated whether second-order responses are present in the cat posteromedial lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) cortex, a possible homolog of the primate area MT. The stimuli used were luminance-based sine-wave gratings (first-order) and contrast-modulated carrier stimuli (second-order), which consisted of a high-spatial-frequency static grating (carrier) whose contrast was modulated by a low-spatial-frequency drifting grating (envelope). Results indicate that most PMLS neurons responded to second-order motion and for the vast majority of cells, first-and second-order preferred directions were conserved. However, responses to secondorder stimuliwere significantly reduced when compared to those evoked by first-order gratings. Circular variancewas increased for second-order stimuli, indicating that PMLS direction selectivity was weaker for this type of stimulus. Finally, carrier orientation selectivity was either absent or very broad and had no influence on the envelope's orientation selectivity. In conclusion, our data show that PMLS neurons exhibit similar first- and second-order response profiles and that, akin primate area MT cells, they perform a form-cue invariant analysis of motion signals.

To address whether these networks can also be dissociated at the level of brain structure, we combined behavioral phenotyping across multiple socio-cognitive tasks with 3-Tesla MRI cortical thickness and structural covariance analysis in 270 healthy adults, recruited across 2 sites. Regional thickness mapping only provided partial support for divergent substrates, highlighting that individual differences in empathy relate to left insular-opercular thickness while no correlation between thickness and mentalizing scoreswas found. Conversely, structural covariance analysis showed clearly divergent network modulations by socio-cognitive and -affective phenotypes. Specifically, individual differences in theory of mind related to structural integration between temporo-parietal and dorsomedial prefrontal regions while empathy modulated the strength of dorsal anterior insula networks. Findings were robust across both recruitment sites, suggesting generalizability. At the level of structural network embedding, our study provides a double dissociation between empathy and mentalizing. Moreover, our findings suggest that structural substrates of higher-order social cognition are reflected rather in interregional networks than in the the local anatomical markup of specific regions per se.

To date, however, the precise mechanism by which the early buildup of A beta peptides leads to cognitive dysfunction remains unknown. Here, we investigate the impact of the early A beta accumulation on temporal and frontal lobe dysfunction. We compared the performance of McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic AD rats with wild-type littermate controls on a visual discrimination task using a touchscreen operant platform. Subsequently, we conducted studies to establish the biochemical and molecular basis for the behavioral alterations. It was found that the presence of intraneuronal A beta caused a severe associative learning deficit in the AD rats. This coincided with reduced nuclear translocation and genomic occupancy of the CREB co-activator, CRTC1, and decreased production of synaptic plasticity-associated transcripts Arc, c-fos, Egr1, and Bdnf. Thus, blockade of CRTC1-dependent gene expression in the early, preplaque phase of AD-like pathology provides a molecular basis for the cognitive deficits that figure so prominently in early AD.

However, the dynamics of the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. In particular, whether AI is on the receiving or driving end of the error-monitoring network is unresolved. Here, we recorded intracerebral electroencephalography signals simultaneously from AI and dmPFC in epileptic patients while they performed a stop-signal task. We found that errors selectively modulated broadband neural activity in human AI. Granger causality estimates revealed that errors were immediately followed by a feedforward influence from AI onto anterior cingulate cortex and, subsequently, onto presupplementary motor area. The reverse pattern of information flow was observed on correct responses. Our findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence indicating that the anterior insula rapidly detects and conveys error signals to dmPFC, while the latter might use this input to adapt behavior following inappropriate actions.

We thus employed fMRI to investigate the neural substrates underlying motor sequence memory consolidation, and the modulatory influence of post-learning sleep, in healthy older adults. Participants were trained on a motor sequence and retested following an 8-h interval including wake or diurnal sleep as well as a 22-h interval including a night of sleep. Results demonstrated that a post-learning nap improved offline consolidation across same-and next-day retests. This enhanced consolidation was reflected by increased activity in the putamen and the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, regions that have previously been implicated in sleep-dependent neural plasticity in young adults. Moreover, for the first time in older adults, the neural substrates subserving initial motor learning, including the putamen, cerebellum, and parietal cortex, were shown to forecast subsequent consolidation depending on whether a post-learning nap was afforded. Specifically, sufficient activation in a motor-related network appears to be necessary to trigger sleep-facilitated consolidation in older adults. Our findings not only demonstrate that post-learning sleep can enhance motor memory consolidation in older adults, but also provide the system-level neural correlates of this beneficial effect.

MS plaque location (intracranial and/ or spinal) is a key feature in the pathophysiology of disease- related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The prevalence of these symptoms in MS patients is very high, with nearly 90% of them experiencing some degree of voiding dysfunction and/or incontinence. LUTS rarely present as primary MS manifestations and usually appear 6- 8 years after the initial diagnosis. Symptom severity usually correlates with the disability status of patients. Patient assessment comprises clinical and advanced investigations. Each patient should be evaluated uniquely, after taking into account his/ her symptoms, disease course and length, comorbidities, physical status, and medications. Basic investigation includes detailed history-taking, physical examination, and post- void residual volume measurement. Advanced evaluation consists of imaging and specific testing, with pivotal importance on urodynamic study.

J	Potvin, S; Aubin, G; Stip, E				Potvin, S.; Aubin, G.; Stip, E.			Subjective cognition in schizophrenia	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						Schizophrenia; Attention; Visual learning; Planning; Meta-cognition	SYNDROME SCALE PANSS; DEFICITS; INSIGHT; AWARENESS; REMEDIATION; METAANALYSIS; DYSFUNCTION; VALIDITY; CANTAB; IMPACT	Objectives. Given the extent, magnitude and functional significance of the neurocognitive deficits of schizophrenia, growing attention has been paid recently to patients' self-awareness of their own deficits. Thus far, the literature has shown either that patients fail to recognize their cognitive deficits or that the association between subjective and objective cognition is weak in schizophrenia. The reasons for this lack of consistency remain unexplained but may have to do, among others, with the influence of potential confounding clinical variables and the choice of the scale used to measure self-awareness of cognitive deficits. In the current study, we sought to examine the relationships between subjective and objective cognitive performance in schizophrenia, while controlling for the influence of sociodemographic and psychiatric variables. Methods. Eighty-two patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (DSM-IV criteria) were recruited. Patients' subjective cognitive complaints were evaluated with the Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition in Schizophrenia (SSTICS), the most frequently used scale to measure self-awareness of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Neurocognition was evaluated with working memory, planning and visual learning tasks taken from Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery. The Stroop Color-Word test was also administered. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. The relationships between subjective and objective cognition were evaluated with multivariate hierarchic linear regression analyses, taking into consideration potential confounders such as sociodemographic and psychiatric variables. Finally, a factor analysis of the SSTICS was performed. Results. -For the SSTICS total score, the regression analysis produced a model including two predictors, namely visual learning and Stoop interference performance, explaining a moderate portion of the variance. Visual learning performance was the most consistent predictor of most SSTICS subscores (e.g. episodic memory, attention, executive functioning, language and praxis). Modest associations were found between the PANSS cognitive factor and objective cognition (e.g. Stroop interference, visual learning, and working memory). Finally, the factor analysis revealed a 6 -factor solution that echoes the classification of the items of the SSTICS based on the neuropsychological literature. Conclusions. -Using a scale having good internal validity, as shown by the factor analysis, the current study highlighted modest associations between subjective and objective cognitive performance, which suggests that schizophrenia patients are only partially aware of their own cognitive deficits. The results also showed a lack of correspondence between the impaired cognitive domain and the domain of cognitive awareness. It should be noted that clinicians were not better than patients at evaluating their cognitive deficits. Future research will need to determine if the observations reported here are schizophrenia -specific or not. (C) 2016 L'Encephale, Paris.

Green mussels (Perna viridis) were exposed to different concentrations of CBZ, BPA, and ATZ, either individually or as mixtures over a 7-d period, and a suite of molecular and cellular biomarkers were analyzed: biomarkers of immunotoxicity (total hemocyte count, phagocytosis, extracellular lysozyme), genotoxicity (Comet assay), neurotoxicity (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase [AChE]), endocrine disruption (vitellin-like proteins), and detoxification enzymes (cytochrome P4501A [CYP1A], 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase [EROD], and glutathione-S-transferase [GST]). Results of the single-chemical exposure tests highlighted the relatively low toxicity of CBZ because most biomarker responses observed were recorded at concentrations well above environmental levels. Bisphenol A exposure at environmentally realistic concentrations resulted in clear immunomodulatory, genotoxic, and endocrine-disruptive effects. Similarly, 3 of the 10 biomarkers tested on green mussels (genotoxicity, inhibition of AchE, and EROD) responded after exposure to ATZ at environmentally relevant doses or below, and confirmed the potency of this herbicide to marine bivalves. Exposure tests using mixtures of CBZ, BPA, and ATZ also revealed that these 3 substances were generally acting in an additive manner on the selected biomarkers, at environmental doses, with some exceptions (antagonism and/or synergy) at low and high concentrations. The present study also confirms that most of the biomarkers used are suitable for biomonitoring studies with green mussels. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:429-441.

Extracellular field recordings were obtained from the medial entorhinal cortex (EC) using glass pipettes or silicon probes; 4AP or BMI were applied through the basilar artery. Ripples (80-200 Hz) or fast ripples (250-500 Hz) occurred at higher rates shortly before ictal events induced by 4AP or BMI, respectively. In addition, during the ictal period, ripples were mostly associated with 4AP-induced ictal events whereas fast ripples predominated during ictal discharges induced by BMI. Finally, ripples occurred at higher rates during the clonic phase of 4AP-induced ictal events compared to the tonic phase, while higher rates of fast ripples characterized the clonic phase in both 4AP- and BMI-induced ictal discharges. These differences in HFO occurrence presumably reflect the diverse action of these two convulsants on GABA(A) receptor signaling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanism by which these systems affect parenting behaviours and the timing of these effects are not well understood. This article explores the role of mothers' executive function in mediating the relation between oxytocin and dopamine gene variants and maternal responsiveness at 48 months post-partum. Participants (n= 157) were mothers recruited in the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment Study, which assesses longitudinally two cohorts of mothers and children in Canada. We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the dopamine and oxytocin systems (DRD1 rs686, DRD1 rs265976, OXTR rs237885 and OXTR rs2254298), assessed mothers' decision-making at 48 months using the Cambridge Neurological Automated Testing Battery (CANTAB) and evaluated maternal responsiveness from videotaped interactions during the Etch-A-Sketch co-operation task. Mediation analyses showed that OXTR rs2254298 A-carriers had an indirect effect on positive parenting which was mediated by mothers' performance on decision-making task (estimate= 0.115, P < 0.005), while OXTR rs2254298 A-carriers had both direct and indirect effects on physically controlling parenting, also mediated through enhanced performance on decision-making (estimate=-0.059, P < 0.005). Dopamine SNPs were not associated with any measure of executive function or parenting (all P > 0.05). While oxytocin has previously been associated with only the early onset of maternal behaviour, we show that an OXTR polymorphism is involved in maternal behaviour at 48 months post-partum through mothers' executive function. This research highlights the importance of the oxytocin system to maternal parenting beyond infancy.	[Cost, K.

As a consequence, assays to assess inhibition of lectin binding should necessarily come as close as possible to the physiological situation, to characterize an impact of a synthetic compound on biorelevant binding with pharmaceutical perspective. We here introduce in a proof-of-principle manner work with sections of paraffin-embedded tissue (jejunum, epididymis) and labeled adhesion/growth-regulatory galectins, harboring one (galectin-1 and galectin-3) or two (galectin-8) types of lectin domain. Six pairs of synthetic lactosides from tailoring of the headgroup (3'-O-sulfation) and the aglycone (beta-methyl to aromatic S- and O-linked extensions) as well as three bi- to tetravalent glycoclusters were used as test compounds. Varying extents of reduction in staining intensity by synthetic compounds relative to unsubstituted/free lactose proved the applicability and sensitivity of the method. Flanking cytofluorimetric assays on lectin binding to native cells gave similar grading, excluding a major impact of tissue fixation. The experiments revealed cell/tissue binding of galectin-8 preferentially via one domain, depending on the cell type so that the effect of an inhibitor in a certain context cannot be extrapolated to other cells/tissues. Moreover, the work with the other galectins attests that this assay enables comprehensive analysis of the galectin network in serial tissue sections to determine overlaps and regional differences in inhibitory profiles.

Typical QoE assessment techniques, such as listening tests with self-report ratings, are useful but provide limited insight into these underlying processes. Recent advances in neuroimaging and physiological monitoring technologies, however, have opened new doors and allowed us to better understand and measure QoE perception. In this paper, we explore the use of two neuroimaging techniques, namely electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), to better understand neuronal and cerebral haemodynamic changes resultant from synthesized speech of varying quality. Neural correlates of several QoE dimensions were derived and validated on the publicly available PhySyQX database. Fusion of EEG, fNIRS, and fNIRS-derived physiological parameters, combined with conventional features extracted from the synthesized speech signal showed to accurately represent several QoE dimensions, including those related to listener affective states. It is hoped that these findings will help researchers build better instrumental QoE models that incorporate technological, contextual, and human influence factors.

This paper presents a damage detection approach that combines different techniques to improve detection and localization of small increments of damage using mode shapes derived from vibration tests on a structure. An experimental study is carried out on a beam with two joints that can simulate incremental damage with a system of plates and bolts. The initial condition is defined as the state when the plates are fully assembled. In this state, the beam comprises two weaker zones at the location of each joint assembly due to a 12% reduction in stiffness in comparison to an intact beam. The test setup is used to simulate incremental damage by modifying the mass and stiffness of the beam at each joint. The proposed method of detection is shown to outperform current alternative methods in detecting small increments of damage and to result in fewer false alarms. The detection procedure comprises four steps: ( 1) a continuous wavelet transform to detect local anomalies in the first mode shape; ( 2) a principal component analysis of wavelet coefficients to extract dominant patterns that are most highly correlated with incremental damage and to reduce noise; ( 3) statistical tests of hypothesis on the scores of principal components to detect statistically significant incremental damage, and ( 4) a likelihood ratio test to determine the most likely location of incremental damage along the beam.

Monitoring brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) has become an important tool for the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, we propose a method for EEG seizure detection by decomposing EEG signals for up to six wavelet scales without downsampling. Then, we perform the fast Fourier transform with wavelet scales 3, 4, 5, and 6, and take the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients as features for seizure detection. We use a nearest neighbour classifier to classify the input EEG signal into the seizure or no seizure class. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is comparable and sometimes better than our previous dual-tree complex wavelet-Fourier method for the University of Bonn EEG database. Furthermore, the proposed method is very competitive with a number of existing EEG seizure detection methods. We found that various types of wavelet filter all achieved perfect classification rates (100%) for EEG seizure detection.

Using cultured primary rat oligodendrocytes (OLGs), we have recently demonstrated that a cell surface protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, cell adhesion molecule-related, down-regulated by oncogenes (Cdon), is important in initiating OLG differentiation and axon myelination by promoting the formation of branched cellular processes; however, the molecular mechanism by which Cdon regulates OLG differentiation is not known. Here, using Cdon immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified serine/threonine kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a candidate novel target of Cdon. We confirmed this interaction using co-IP and immunofluorescence with TBK1 antibodies, showing that TBK1 partly co-localizes with Cdon along cellular processes in puncta-like structures. We show that TBK1 is expressed throughout OLG differentiation, and surprisingly, that levels of phosphorylated TBK1 (ser172) increase during OLG maturation, while total levels of TBK1 protein decrease. To investigate function, TBK1 expression was knocked down using siRNA in OLG primary cultures, reducing protein levels by 69%. Two myelin-specific proteins, myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein, were similarly reduced when examined at day 2 and day 4 of OLG differentiation. Reduced Cdon or TBK1 expression also decreased Akt phosphorylation at Threonine 308 in OLG. Our findings provide evidence that a Cdon-TBK1 complex is associated with Akt phosphorylation and early OLG differentiation.

It is also recognized as a non-cell autonomous disease where glial cells in the CNS are involved in its pathogenesis and progression. However, although denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) represents an early and major event in ALS, the importance of glial cells at this synapse receives little attention. An interesting possibility is that altered relationships between glial cells and MNs in the spinal cord in ALS may also take place at the NMJ. Perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), which are glial cells at the NMJ, show great morphological and functional adaptability to ensure NMJ stability, maintenance and repair. More specifically, PSCs change their properties according to the state of innervation. Hence, abnormal changes or lack of changes can have detrimental effects on NMJs in ALS. This review will provide an overview of known and hypothesized interactions between MN nerve terminals and PSCs at NMJs during development, aging and ALS-induced denervation. These neuron-PSC interactions may be crucial to the understanding of how degenerative changes begin and progress at NMJs in ALS, and represent a novel therapeutic target.

Transient cerebellar alterations during development prior to obvious motor phenotype in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							ACTIVATED POTASSIUM CHANNELS; PURKINJE-CELL SYNAPSES; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; IN-VIVO; MEMBRANE EXCITABILITY; SYNAPTIC COMPETITION; CA2+ CHANNEL; MICE; DYSFUNCTION; ELIMINATION	Although some neurodegenerative diseases are caused by mutations in genes that are known to regulate neuronal development, surprisingly, patients may not present disease symptoms until adulthood. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is one such midlife-onset disorder in which the mutated gene, CACNA1A, is implicated in cerebellar development. We wondered whether changes were observed in the developing cerebellum in SCA6 prior to the detection of motor deficits. To address this question, we used a transgenic mouse with a hyper-expanded triplet repeat (SCA6(84Q/84Q)) that displays late-onset motor deficits at 7 months, and measured cerebellar Purkinje cell synaptic and intrinsic properties during postnatal development. We found that firing rate and precision were enhanced during postnatal development in P10-13 SCA6(84Q/84Q) Purkinje cells, and observed surplus multiple climbing fibre innervation without changes in inhibitory input or dendritic structure during development. Although excess multiple climbing fibre innervation has been associated with ataxic symptoms in several adult transgenic mice, we observed no detectable changes in cerebellar-related motor behaviour indeveloping SCA6(84Q/84Q) mice. Interestingly, we found that developmental alterations were transient, as both Purkinje cell firing properties and climbing fibre innervation from weanling-aged (P21-24) SCA6(84Q/84Q) mice were indistinguishable from litter-matched control mice. Our results demonstrate that significant alterations in neuronal circuit development may be observed without any detectable behavioural read-out, and that early changes in brain development may not necessarily persist into adulthood in midlife-onset diseases.

Previous studies have revealed an overlapping function of Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 during specification of the rhombomeres from which neural crest cells emerge. A recent study on Hoxa1 mutant mice documented its function during cardiovascular development, however, the role of Hoxb1 is still unclear. Here we show using single and compound Hoxa1; Hoxb1 mutant embryos that reduction of Hoxa1 gene dosage in Hoxb1-null genetic background is sufficient to result in abnormal pharyngeal aortic arch (PAA) development and subsequently in great artery defects. Endothelial cells in the 4th PAAs of compound mutant differentiate normally whereas vascular smooth muscle cells of the vessels are absent in the defective PAAs. The importance of Hoxa1 and Hoxb1, and their interaction during specification of cardiac NCCs is demonstrated. Together, our data reveal a critical role for anterior Hox genes during PAA development, providing new mechanistic insights into the etiology of congenital heart defects.

Recent collaborative molecular analyses of these rare cancers have revealed previously unappreciated connections among chromatin regulation, developmental signaling, and tumorigenesis. As we begin to unravel the unique developmental origins and distinct biological drivers of this heterogeneous group of tumors, clinical trials need to keep pace. It is important to avoid therapeutic strategies developed purely using data obtained from studies on adult glioblastoma. This approach has resulted in repetitive trials and ineffective treatments being applied to these children, with limited improvement in clinical outcome. The authors of this perspective, comprising biology and clinical expertise in the disease, recently convened to discuss the most effective ways to translate the emerging molecular insights into patient benefit. This article reviews our current understanding of pediatric high-grade glioma and suggests approaches for innovative clinical management.

This cross-sectional study included 138 individuals between 40 to 86 years old who were physically healthy and cognitively intact. Eleven markers (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, insulin, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, total protein) and five derived indicators (estimated glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance rate, insulin-resistance, average glucose, and cholesterol/HDL ratio) were obtained from blood sampling of all participants. Ti-weighted 3T MRI scans were used to evaluate gray matter cortical thickness. The markers were clustered into five factors, and factor scores were related to cortical thickness by general linear model. Two factors, one linked to insulin/metabolic health and the other to kidney function (KFF) showed regionally selective associations with cortical thickness including lateral and medial temporal, temporoparietal, and superior parietal regions for both factors and frontoparietal regions for KFF. An association between the increasing cholesterol and greater thickness in frontoparietal and occipital areas was also noted. Associations persisted independently of age, presence of cardiovascular risk factors and ApoE gene status. These findings may provide information on distinct mechanisms of inter-individual cortical variation as well as factors contributing to trajectories of cortical thinning with advancing age.

Individual variation in intentionality in the mind-wandering state is reflected in the integration of the default-mode, fronto-parietal, and limbic networks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Mind-wandering; Intentionality; Cognitive control; Cortical thickness; functional connectivity	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; CORTICAL THICKNESS; EXECUTIVE-CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SALIENCE NETWORK; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; THOUGHT; TASK; FMRI	Mind-wandering has a controversial relationship with cognitive control. Existing psychological evidence supports the hypothesis that episodes of mind-wandering reflect a failure to constrain thinking to task-relevant material, as well the apparently alternative view that control can facilitate the expression of self-generated mental content. We assessed whether this apparent contradiction arises because of a failure to consider differences in the types of thoughts that occur during mind-wandering, and in particular, the associated level of intentionality. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, we examined the cortical organisation that underlies inter-individual differences in descriptions of the spontaneous or deliberate nature of mind-wandering. Cortical thickness, as well as functional connectivity analyses, implicated regions relevant to cognitive control and regions of the default-mode network for individuals who reported high rates of deliberate mind-wandering. In contrast, higher reports of spontaneous mind-wandering were associated with cortical thinning in parietal and posterior temporal regions in the left hemisphere (which are important in the control of cognition and attention) as well as heightened connectivity between the intraparietal sulcus and a region that spanned limbic and default-mode regions in the ventral inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, we observed a dissociation in the thickness of the retrosplenial cortex/lingual gyrus, with higher reports of spontaneous mind-wandering being associated with thickening in the left hemisphere, and higher repots of deliberate mind-wandering with thinning in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that the intentionality of the mind-wandering state depends on integration between the control and default-mode networks, with more deliberation being associated with greater integration between these systems. We conclude that one reason why mind-wandering has a controversial relationship with control is because it depends on whether the thoughts emerge in a deliberate or spontaneous fashion.

Methods This Report combines the input of members and elected nominees of the Standardization and Terminology Committees of two International Organizations, the International Urogynecological Association ( IUGA) and the International Continence Society ( ICS), assisted at intervals by many external referees. An extensive process of nine rounds of internal and external review was developed to exhaustively examine each definition, with decision-making by collective opinion ( consensus). Before opening up for comments on the webpages of ICS and IUGA, five experts from physiotherapy, neurology, urology, urogynecology, and nursing were invited to comment on the paper. Results A Terminology Report on the conservative management of female pelvic floor dysfunction, encompassing over 200 separate definitions, has been developed. It is clinically based, with the most common symptoms, signs, assessments, diagnoses, and treatments defined. Clarity and ease of use have been key aims to make it interpretable by practitioners and trainees in all the different specialty groups involved in female pelvic floor dysfunction. Ongoing review is not only anticipated, but will be required to keep the document updated and as widely acceptable as possible. Conclusion A consensus-based terminology report for the conservative management of female pelvic floor dysfunction has been produced, aimed at being a significant aid to clinical practice and a stimulus for research.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate a recently published algorithm for the management of category II fetal heart rate tracings, to examine reasons for the birth of infants with significant metabolic acidemia despite the use of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, and to examine critically the limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring in the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia. STUDY DESIGN: The potential performance of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring under ideal circumstances was evaluated in an outcomes-blinded examination fetal heart rate tracing of infants with metabolic acidemia at birth (base deficit, >12) and matched control infants (base deficit, <8) under the following conditions: (1) expert primary interpretation, (2) use of a published algorithm that was developed and endorsed by a large group of national experts, (3) assumption of a 30-minute period of evaluation for noncritical category II fetal heart rate tracings, followed by delivery within 30 minutes, (4) evaluation without the need to provide patient care simultaneously, and (5) comparison of results under these circumstances with those achieved in actual clinical practice. RESULTS: During the study period, 120 infants were identified with an arterial cord blood base deficit of >12 mM/L. Matched control infants were not demographically different from subjects. In actual practice, operative intervention on the basis of an abnormal fetal heart rate tracings occurred in 36 of 120 fetuses (30.0%) with metabolic acidemia. Based on expert, algorithm-assisted reviews, 55 of 120 patients with acidemia (45.8%) were judged to need operative intervention for abnormal fetal heart rate tracings. This difference was significant (P=.016). In infants who were born with a base deficit of >12 mM/L in which blinded, algorithm-assisted expert review indicated the need for operative delivery, the decision for delivery would have been made an average of 131 minutes before the actual delivery. The rate of expert intervention for fetal heart rate concerns in the nonacidemic control group (22/120; 18.3%) was similar to the actual intervention rate (23/120; 19.2%; P= 1.0) Expert review did not mandate earlier delivery in 65 of 120 patients with metabolic acidemia. The primary features of these 65 cases included the occurrence of sentinel events with prolonged deceleration just before delivery, the rapid deterioration of nonemergent category II fetal heart rate tracings before realistic time frames for recognition and intervention, and the failure of recognized fetal heart rate patterns such as variability to identify metabolic acidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Expert, algorithm-assisted fetal heart rate interpretation has the potential to improve standard clinical performance by facilitating significantly earlier recognition of some tracings that are associated with metabolic acidemia without increasing the rate of operative intervention. However, this improvement is modest. Of infants who are born with metabolic acidemia, only approximately one-half potentially could be identified and have delivery expedited even under ideal circumstances, which are probably not realistic in current US practice. This represents the limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring performance. Additional technologies will be necessary if the goal of the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia is to be realized.

At the same time, an increased hemorrhagic risk during perioperative bridging anticoagulation without thrombotic risk reduction has been demonstrated. This has led the GIHP to update their guidelines published in 2011. For scheduled procedures at low bleeding risk, it is suggested that patients interrupt DOAs the night before irrespective of type of drug and to resume therapy six hours or more after the end of the invasive procedure. For invasive procedures at high bleeding risk, it is suggested to interrupt rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban three days before. Dabigatran should be interrupted according to the renal function, four days and five days if creatinine clearance is higher than 50 mL/min and between 30 and 50 mL/min, respectively. For invasive procedures at very high bleeding risk such as intracranial neurosurgery or neuraxial anesthesia, longer interruption times are suggested. Finally, bridging with parenteral anticoagulation and measurement of DOA concentrations can no longer routinely be used. (C) 2016 Societe francaise d'anesthesie et de reanimation (Sfar).

Afatinib versus gefitinib in patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: overall survival data from the phase IIb LUX-Lung 7 trial	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						afatinib; gefitinib; NSCLC; overall survival	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; OPEN-LABEL; 1ST-LINE TREATMENT; CARBOPLATIN-PACLITAXEL; ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE; CHEMOTHERAPY; ERLOTINIB; ADENOCARCINOMA; MULTICENTER; CTONG-0802	Background: In LUX-Lung 7, the irreversible ErbB family blocker, afatinib, significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and objective response rate (ORR) versus gefitinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we present primary analysis of mature overall survival (OS) data. Patients and methods: LUX-Lung 7 assessed afatinib 40 mg/day versus gefitinib 250 mg/day in treatment-nai " ve patients with stage IIIb/IV NSCLC and a common EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion/L858R). Primary OS analysis was planned after 213 OS events and 32-month follow-up. OS was analysed by a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by EGFR mutation type and baseline brain metastases. Results: Two-hundred and twenty-six OS events had occurred at the data cut-off (8 April 2016). After a median follow-up of 42.6 months, median OS (afatinib versus gefitinib) was 27.9 versus 24.5 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-1.12, P 0.2580]. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed similar OS trends (afatinib versus gefitinib) in patients with exon 19 deletion (30.7 versus 26.4 months; HR, 0.83, 95% CI 0.58-1.17, P 0.2841) and L858R (25.0 versus 21.2 months; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62-1.36, P 0.6585) mutations. Most patients (afatinib, 72.6%; gefitinib, 76.8%) had at least one subsequent systemic anti-cancer treatment following discontinuation of afatinib/gefitinib; 20 (13.7%) and 23 (15.2%) patients received a thirdgeneration EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Updated PFS (independent review), TTF and ORR data were significantly improved with afatinib. Conclusion: In LUX-Lung 7, there was no significant difference in OS with afatinib versus gefitinib. Updated PFS (independent review), TTF and ORR data were significantly improved with afatinib.

Sunitinib in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: updated progression-free survival and final overall survival from a phase III randomized study	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						VEGFR inhibitor; antiangiogenics; crossover; rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT); blinded independent central review	TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR; ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY; TRIALS; CANCER; FAILURE; SU11248	Background: In a phase III trial in patients with advanced, well-differentiated, progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, sunitinib 37.5mg/day improved investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo (11.4 versus 5.5 months; HR, 0.42; P< 0.001). Here, we present PFS using retrospective blinded independent central review (BICR) and final median overall survival (OS), including an assessment highlighting the impact of patient crossover from placebo to sunitinib. Patients and methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, cross-sectional imaging from patients was evaluated retrospectively by blinded third-party radiologists using a two-reader, two-time-point lock, followed by a sequential locked-read, batch-mode paradigm. OS was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. Crossover-adjusted OS effect was derived using rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) analyses. Results: Of 171 randomized patients (sunitinib, n 86; placebo, n 85), 160 (94%) had complete scan sets/time points. By BICR, median (95% confidence interval [CI]) PFS was 12.6 (11.1-20.6) months for sunitinib and 5.8 (3.8-7.2) months for placebo (HR, 0.32; 95% CI 0.18-0.55; P 0.000015). Five years after study closure, median (95% CI) OS was 38.6 (25.6-56.4) months for sunitinib and 29.1 (16.4-36.8) months for placebo (HR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.50-1.06; P 0.094), with 69% of placebo patients having crossed over to sunitinib. RPSFT analysis confirmed an OS benefit for sunitinib. Conclusions: BICR confirmed the doubling of PFS with sunitinib compared with placebo. Although the observed median OS improved by nearly 10 months, the effect estimate did not reach statistical significance, potentially due to crossover from placebo to sunitinib.

However, the exact linguistic and extralinguistic conditions under which such language-induced activity in modality-specific cortex is triggered are not yet well understood. The purpose of this study is to introduce a simple experimental technique that allows for the online measure of language-induced activity in motor structures of the brain. This technique consists in the use of a grip force sensor that captures subtle grip force variations while participants listen to words and sentences. Since grip force reflects activity in motor brain structures, the continuous monitoring of force fluctuations provides a fine-grained estimation of motor activity across time. In other terms, this method allows for both localization of the source of language-induced activity to motor brain structures and high temporal resolution of the recorded data. To facilitate comparison of the data to be collected with this tool, we present two experiments that describe in detail the technical setup, the nature of the recorded data, and the analyses (including justification about the data filtering and artifact rejection) that we applied. We also discuss how the tool could be used in other domains of behavioral research.

Using a well-established mouse model of prenatal viral-like immune activation, we examined whether this pathological association involves genome-wide DNA methylation differences at single nucleotide resolution. METHODS: Prenatal immune activation was induced by maternal treatment with the viral mimetic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid in middle or late gestation. Following behavioral and cognitive characterization of the adult offspring (n = 12 per group), unbiased capture array bisulfite sequencing was combined with subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses to quantify DNA methylation changes and transcriptional abnormalities in the medial prefrontal cortex of immune-challenged and control offspring. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis was used to explore shared functional pathways of genes with differential DNA methylation. RESULTS: Adult offspring of immune-challenged mothers displayed hyper- and hypomethylated CpGs at numerous loci and at distinct genomic regions, including genes relevant for gamma-aminobutyric acidergic differentiation and signaling (e.g., Dlx1, Lhx5, Lhx8), Wnt signaling (Wnt3, Wnt8a, Wnt7b), and neural development (e.g., Efnb3, Mid1, Nlgn1, Nrxn2). Altered DNA methylation was associated with transcriptional changes of the corresponding genes. The epigenetic and transcriptional effects were dependent on the offspring's age and were markedly influenced by the precise timing of prenatal immune activation. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal viral-like immune activation is capable of inducing stable DNA methylation changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. These long-term epigenetic modifications are a plausible mechanism underlying the disruption of prefrontal gene transcription and behavioral functions in subjects with prenatal infectious histories.

Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Canadian Pediatric Cardiology Association Position Statement on the Approach to Syncope in the Pediatric Patient	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article							NEURALLY-MEDIATED SYNCOPE; UP TILT TEST; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE; CARDIAC SYNCOPE; NEUROCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; TACHYCARDIA SYNDROME; CLINICAL HISTORY; CHILDREN	Pediatric syncope is a common problem that peaks in adolescence, for which there are few data or evidence-based consensus on investigation and management. This document offers guidance for practical evaluation/management of pediatric patients (age < 19 years) with syncope encountered in the acute or primary care setting. The writing committee used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Most syncope is vasovagal, which is benign and does not require extensive investigation. This Position Statement presents recommendations to encourage an efficient and cost-effective disposition for the many patients with a benign cause of syncope, and highlights atypical or concerning clinical findings associated with other causes of transient loss of consciousness. The prodrome and the circumstances around which the event occurred are the most important aspects of the history. Syncope occurring midexertion suggests a cardiac etiology. A family history, which includes sudden death in the young or from unknown causes or causes that might be suspected to be other than natural can be a red flag. The electrocardiogram is the most frequently ordered test, but the yield is low and the test is not cost-effective when applied broadly to a population of patients with syncope. We recommend an electrocardiogram when the history is not suggestive of vasovagal syncope and there are features suggestive of a cardiac cause like absence of a prodrome, midexertional event, family history of early-life sudden death or heart disease, abnormal physical examination, or new medication with potential cardiotoxicity. For most patients with syncope, medical testing is not required and lifestyle modifications without medications suffice to prevent recurrences.

However, their use in first-episode psychosis (FEP) treatment is rare. The purpose of this study was to better understand the access and use of technology among individuals with FEP, including gaming activities, to inform future development of technology-enabled therapeutic applications. Methods: Self-administered survey on use of technological tools in 71 FEP individuals. Results: PCs/laptops were used by all participants; cellphones/smartphones by 92%, consoles by 83% (mainly male and younger participants). Women texted and used social networks more frequently; men played games (mainly action) more often. The younger individuals reported playing games frequently (32% daily) with less use of the Web and social networks (favourite: Facebook). Conclusions: These data will be useful for developing Web-based psychoeducation tools and cognitive remediation video games for youth with FEP.

The potential hepatotoxicity of pyre-throids remains unclear and could easily be assessed by measuring common clinical indicators of liver disease. To understand more about the potential risks for humans associated with LTC exposure, male adult rats were orally exposed to 6.2 and 31.1mg/kg bw of LTC for 7, 30, 45, and 60 days. Histopathological changes and alterations of main parameters related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the liver were evaluated. Further, lambda-cyhalothrin metabolites [3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop- 1-enyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropane carboxylic acid (CFMP), 4-hydroxyphenoxybenzoic acid (4-OH-3-PBA), and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA)] in the liver tissues were identified and quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadripole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-Q-ToF). Results revealed that LTC exposure significantly increased markers of hepatic oxidative stress in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner, and this was associated with an accumulation of CFMP and 3-PBA in the liver tissues. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TpNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL-6 and IL-1 beta) gene expressions were significantly increased in the liver of exposed rats compared to controls. Correlation analyses revealed that CFMP and 3-PBA metabolite levels in the liver tissues were significantly correlated with the indexes of oxidative stress, redox status, and inflammatory markers in rats exposed to lambda-cyhalothin. Overall, this study provided novel evidence that hepatic damage is likely due to increased oxidative stress and inflammation under the condition of acute and subchronic exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin and that LTC metabolites (CFMP and 3-PBA) could be used as potential biomarker in human biomonitoring studies.

Population Survey of Iodine Deficiency and Environmental Disruptors of Thyroid Function in Young Children in Haiti	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							SALT IODIZATION; PERCHLORATE; THIOCYANATE; EXPOSURE	Context: Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable neurodevelopmental delay in children worldwide and a possible public health concern in Haiti. Objective: To determine the prevalence of iodine deficiency in Haitian young children and its influence by environmental factors. Design: Cross-sectional study, March through June 2015. Setting: Community churches in 3 geographical regions in Haiti. Participants: 299 healthy Haitian children aged 9 months to 6 years; one-third each enrolled in a coastal, mountainous, and urban region. Main Outcome Measures: Urinary iodide, serum thyrotropin (TSH), goiter assessment, and urinary perchlorate and thiocyanate. Results: Mean age was 3.3 +/- 1.6 years, with 51% female, median family income USD 30/week, and 16% malnutrition. Median urinary iodide levels were normal in coastal (145 mu g/L, interquartile range [IQR] 97 to 241) and urban regions (187 mg/L, IQR 92 to 316), but revealed mild iodine deficiency in a mountainous region (89 mu g/L, IQR 56 to 129), P < 0.0001. Grade 1 goiters were palpated in 2 children, but TSH values were normal. Urinary thiocyanate and perchlorate concentrations were not elevated. Predictors of higher urinary iodide included higher urinary thiocyanate and perchlorate, breastfeeding, and not living in a mountainous region. Conclusions: Areas of mild iodine deficiency persist in Haiti's mountainous regions. Exposure to two well-understood environmental thyroid function disruptors is limited.

J	Forghani, A; Preuss, R; Milner, T				Forghani, Ali; Preuss, Richard; Milner, Theodore			Postural response characterization of standing humans to multi-directional, predictable and unpredictable perturbations to the arm	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article							QUIET STANCE; REFLEXES; MUSCLES; PLACEMENT; MOVEMENTS; BALANCE	When the arm of a standing human is perturbed in an unpredictable direction, postural muscles are activated at latencies as short as 50-110 ms. While the motion of the body clearly progresses in hand-to-leg sequence, there is no systematic muscle activation sequence from the arm to the leg muscles, suggesting that the activation of the muscles is not likely the result of local stretch reflexes. In fact, the lower limb muscles are activated before the upright posture is significantly disturbed. The short-latency activation amplitude and the activation probability are clearly tuned to the direction of the arm perturbation for both rostral and caudal muscles. The effect of central set on the short-latency response has been investigated by manipulating the predictability of the perturbations. Possible underlying neural mechanisms have been discussed.

PAIN			English	Article						Adolescents; Functional imaging; Reward; Pain; Opioids	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSES; RELIEF; ANALGESIA; OPRM1; FMRI; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; REINFORCEMENT; POLYMORPHISM	The processing of reward and reinforcement learning seems to be important determinants of pain chronicity. However, reward processing is already altered early in life and if this is related to the development of pain symptoms later on is not known. The aim of this study was first to examine whether behavioural and brain-related indicators of reward processing at the age of 14 to 15 years are significant predictors of pain complaints 2 years later, at 16 to 17 years. Second, we investigated the contribution of genetic variations in the opioidergic system, which is linked to the processing of both, reward and pain, to this prediction. We used the monetary incentive delay task to assess reward processing, the Children's Somatization Inventory as measure of pain complaints and tested the effects of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1799971/rs563649) of the human mu-opioid receptor gene. We found a significant prediction of pain complaints by responses in the dorsal striatum during reward feedback, independent of genetic predisposition. The relationship of pain complaints and activation in the periaqueductal gray and ventral striatum depended on the T-allele of rs563649. Carriers of this allele also showed more pain complaints than CC-allele carriers. Therefore, brain responses to reward outcomes and higher sensitivity to pain might be related already early in life and may thus set the course for pain complaints later in life, partly depending on a specific opioidergic genetic predisposition.

Genetic variant rs3750625 in the 3 ' UTR of ADRA2A affects stress-dependent acute pain severity after trauma and alters a microRNA-34a regulatory site	PAIN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting of the American-Pain-Society	2014	Tampa, FL	Amer Pain Soc		Motor vehicle collision; Sexual assault; Stress; Trauma; Musculoskeletal pain; Polymorphism; Single nucleotide; microRNA; miR-34a; Adrenergic receptor	ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR IMMUNOREACTIVITY; PERITRAUMATIC DISTRESS INVENTORY; MOTOR-VEHICLE COLLISION; EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; RAT SPINAL-CORD; TARGET RECOGNITION; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; SEXUAL ASSAULT; EXPRESSION; DISORDER	alpha 2A adrenergic receptor (alpha 2A-AR) activation has been shown in animal models to play an important role in regulating the balance of acute pain inhibition vs facilitation after both physical and psychological stress. To our knowledge, the influence of genetic variants in the gene encoding alpha 2A-AR, ADRA2A, on acute pain outcomes in humans experiencing traumatic stress has not been assessed. In this study, we tested whether a genetic variant in the 3 ' UTR of ADRA2A, rs3750625, is associated with acute musculoskeletal pain (MSP) severity following motor vehicle collision (MVC, n = 948) and sexual assault (n 5 84), and whether this influence was affected by stress severity. We evaluated rs3750625 because it is located in the seed binding region of miR-34a, a microRNA (miRNA) known to regulate pain and stress responses. In both cohorts, the minor allele at rs3750625 was associated with increased musculoskeletal pain in distressed individuals (stress rs3750625 P = 0.043 for MVC cohort and P = 0.007 for sexual assault cohort). We further found that (1) miR-34a binds the 3 ' UTR of ADRA2A, (2) the amount of repression is greater when the minor (risk) allele is present, (3) miR-34a in the IMR-32 adrenergic neuroblastoma cell line affects ADRA2A expression, (4) miR-34a and ADRA2A are expressed in tissues known to play a role in pain and stress, (5) following forced swim stress exposure, rat peripheral nerve tissue expression changes are consistent with miR-34a regulation of ADRA2A. Together, these results suggest that ADRA2A rs3750625 contributes to poststress musculoskeletal pain severity by modulating miR-34a regulation.

Recruitment in Clinical Trials: The Use of Zelen's Prerandomization in Recent Neurovascular Studies	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Consent; Randomized controlled trial; Research ethics; Vascular diseases	SUBARACHNOID ANEURYSM TRIAL; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BREAST-CANCER; INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; TOTAL MASTECTOMY; CONSENT DESIGNS; CARE TRIALS; MULTICENTER; RADIATION; PROTOCOL	OBJECTIVE: Randomized allocation of treatment options is not well accepted within the clinical community. Some methods of implementation may be received more favorably than others. Prerandomization may be an acceptable means to facilitate recruitment in some clinical trials. METHODS: We first compare randomization and pre-randomization using illustrative neurovascular trials. We review some problems with conventional trials, Zelen's prerandomization as an alternative method, and the ethical issues that have surrounded prerandomization since its inception in a historic trial. Conventional and Zelen's randomization are then compared with other means to provide and verify care in the context of clinical uncertainty. RESULTS: The major problem with conventional randomization is that consent is requested for 2 management options, one of which the patient will not receive. The problem with prerandomization is that treatment is allocated before the patient has consented to trial participation. Prerandomization may trade recruitment difficulties for excessive crossovers. However, other ways to practice under uncertainty and verify patient outcomes, such as case series and registries, are more ethically and scientifically problematic. CONCLUSIONS: Until the ethical functions of randomized allocation of selected treatment options in the care of patients are recognized by the neurovascular community, Zelen's prerandomization may help recruitment into difficult trials and contribute a means to provide best possible care in the presence of uncertainty.

This Report combines the input of members and elected nominees of the Standardization and Terminology Committees of two International Organizations, the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) and the International Continence Society (ICS), assisted at intervals by many external referees. An extensive process of nine rounds of internal and external review was developed to exhaustively examine each definition, with decision-making by collective opinion (consensus). Before opening up for comments on the webpages of ICS and IUGA, five experts from physiotherapy, neurology, urology, urogynecology, and nursing were invited to comment on the paper. A Terminology Report on the conservative management of female pelvic floor dysfunction, encompassing over 200 separate definitions, has been developed. It is clinically based, with the most common symptoms, signs, assessments, diagnoses, and treatments defined. Clarity and ease of use have been key aims to make it interpretable by practitioners and trainees in all the different specialty groups involved in female pelvic floor dysfunction. Ongoing review is not only anticipated, but will be required to keep the document updated and as widely acceptable as possible. A consensus-based terminology report for the conservative management of female pelvic floor dysfunction has been produced, aimed at being a significant aid to clinical practice and a stimulus for research.

J	Blain, MJ; Fortin, S; Alvarez, F				Blain, Marie-Jeanne; Fortin, Sylvie; Alvarez, Fernando			Professional Journeys of International Medical Graduates in Quebec: Recognition, Uphill Battles, or Career Change	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION AND INTEGRATION			English	Article						International medical graduates; Highly qualified migrants; Occupational integration; Recognition; Quebec-Canada; Employment resources	INTEGRATION	In Quebec and Canada, immigration policies are designed to attract "the best and the brightest." Once migration occurs, however, the "brain waste" is challenging. This research focuses on the professional trajectories of international medical graduates (IMG) who migrate to Quebec. The main goal is to understand why certain individuals of a similar occupational group can easily access the doctoral profession while others cannot. Following a qualitative approach, and stemming from IMGs' perspectives, this article explores the interplay of economic, social, and symbolic resources in a context of highly fragmented institutional resources and protectionism. We are critical of the individual-centered approaches that ignore social norms and constraints. If migrants are free to choose their paths and manner of integration, the "human capital" approach is limited in explaining the heterogeneous pathways within the same professional group. The current structure for professional recognition places unusual constraints on IMGs, whereby some encounter more obstacles than others. The "battle" for professional recognition takes shape in a highly competitive context, one which-although presented as a neutral process-is underlain with ideological, relational, and subjective currents.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau synergy drives metabolic decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID BIOMARKERS; A-BETA; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; NORMAL INDIVIDUALS; PHOSPHO-TAU; BRAIN; PET; NEURODEGENERATION; HYPOMETABOLISM	This study was designed to test the interaction between amyloid-beta and tau proteins as a determinant of metabolic decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed 120 cognitively normal individuals with [F-18] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements at baseline, as well as [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose ([F-18]FDG) PET at baseline and at 24 months. A voxel-based interaction model was built to test the associations between continuous measurements of CSF biomarkers, [F-18] florbetapir and [F-18] FDG standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). We found that the synergistic interaction between [F-18] florbetapir SUVR and CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements, rather than the sum of their independent effects, was associated with a 24-month metabolic decline in basal and mesial temporal, orbitofrontal, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices (P < 0.001). In contrast, interactions using CSF amyloid-beta(1-42) and total tau biomarkers did not associate with metabolic decline over a time frame of 24 months. The interaction found in this study further support the framework that amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates synergistically interact to cause downstream AD neurodegeneration. In fact, the regions displaying the metabolic decline reported here were confined to brain networks affected early by amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Preventive clinical trials may benefit from using a combination of amyloid-beta PET and p-tau biomarkers to enrich study populations of cognitively normal subjects with a high probability of disease progression in studies, using [F-18] FDG as a biomarker of efficacy.

Analysis of the T Cell Response to Zika Virus and Identification of a Novel CD8(+) T Cell Epitope in Immunocompetent Mice	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							VIRAL-INFECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DENGUE VIRUS; SPECIFICITY; VACCINATION; PREGNANCY; EXPANSION; IMMUNITY; MODELS	Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family. Although ZIKV infection is typically mild and self-limiting in healthy adults, infection has been associated with neurological symptoms such as Guillain-Barre A syndrome, and a causal link has been established between fetal microcephaly and ZIKV infection during pregnancy. These risks, and the magnitude of the ongoing ZIKV pandemic, have created an urgent need for the development of animal models to study the immune response to ZIKV infection. Previous animal models have primarily focused on pathogenesis in immunocompromised mice. In this study, we provide a model of ZIKV infection in wild-type immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, and have provided an analysis of the immune response to infection. We evaluated the activation of several innate immune cell types, and studied the kinetics, phenotype, and functionality of T cell responses to ZIKV infection. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV infection is mild in wildtype immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, resulting in minimal morbidity. Our data establish that at the peak of the adaptive response, antigen-experienced CD4(+) T cells polarize to a Th1 phenotype, and antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells exhibit an activated effector phenotype, producing both effector cytokines and cytolytic molecules. Furthermore, we have identified a novel ZIKV CD8(+) T cell epitope in the envelope protein that is recognized by the majority of responding cells. Our model provides an important reference point that will help dissect the impact of polymorphisms in the circulating ZIKV strains on the immune response and ZIKV pathogenesis. In addition, the identification of a ZIKV epitope will allow for the design of tetramers to study epitope-specific T cell responses, and will have important implications for the design and development of ZIKV vaccine strategies.

Discovery of Novel, Orally Bioavailable beta-Amino Acid Azaindole Inhibitors of Influenza PB2	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						PB2 inhibitor; azaindole; influenza	CAP-BINDING; NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS; POLYMERASE; VIRUS; SUBUNIT; 1ST-IN-CLASS; VX-787	In our efforts to develop novel small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of influenza, we utilized molecular modeling and the X-ray crystal structure of the PB2 subunit of the influenza polymerase to optimize a series of acyclic beta-amino acid inhibitors, highlighted by compound 4. Compound 4 showed good oral exposure in both rat and mouse. More importantly, it showed strong potency versus multiple influenza-A strains, including pandemic 2009 H1N1 and avian H5N1 strains and showed a strong efficacy profile in a mouse influenza model even when treatment was initiated 48 h after infection. Compound 4 offers good oral bioavailability with great potential for the treatment of both pandemic and seasonal influenza.

Frequency of Penile-Vaginal Intercourse is Associated with Verbal Recognition Performance in Adult Women	ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Penile-vaginal intercourse; Memory; Hippocampus; Dentate gyrus	INCREASES DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; DENTATE GYRUS; SEXUAL-ACTIVITY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; HUMAN BRAIN; CELL-PROLIFERATION; PATTERN SEPARATION; CHRONIC STRESS; FEMALE RAT	Previous studies have identified a number of factors that contribute to improved cognitive function, and to memory function specifically, in cognitively normal individuals. One such factor, frequency of penile vaginal intercourse (PVI), has been reported in a number of animal studies to be advantageous to memory for previously presented objects by increasing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. However, studies investigating the potential benefits of frequent PVI on memory function in young women are to the best of our knowledge absent from the literature. The current study thus investigated whether the self-reported frequency of sexual intercourse was related to memory function in healthy female college students. To determine whether variation in PVI would be associated with memory performance, we asked 78 heterosexual women aged 18-29 years to complete a computerized memory paradigm consisting of abstract words and neutral faces. Results showed that frequency of PVI was positively associated with memory scores for abstract words, but not faces. Because memory for words depends to a large extent on the hippocampus, whereas memory for faces may rely to a greater extent on surrounding extra-hippocampal structures, our results appear to be specific for memory believed to rely on hippocampal function. This may suggest that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is higher in those women with a higher frequency of PVI, in line with previous animal research. Taken together, these results suggest that PVI may indeed have beneficial effects on memory function in healthy young women.

Preliminary support for this hypothesis has been provided by recent neuroimaging studies. While most effects remain to be replicated, there is now evidence that, compared to healthy controls, people at familial risk for substance use disorders exhibit both increases and decreases in striatal dopamine function. The following review assesses the strength of this evidence, considers explanations for discrepant results, and discusses potential implications for understanding pathways to addiction.

Similarly, men and women differ in the prevalence and frequency of drug use, pattern and reasons of use, and vulnerability to develop drug addiction. An understanding of the role of sex in modulating brain processes and behavior in patients with substance use disorder and/or schizophrenia-like symptoms has broad implications for gender-tailored treatment approaches. Cognizant of the considerable recent evidence for sex and gender differences in drug addiction and schizophrenia, we focused this review on the sex-dependent differences in drug-induced psychosis and on factors that may contribute to such male-female differences.

Next, the implementation of a miniature microsystem for low-latency automatic sleep stage classification in rodents is presented. The classification algorithm uses one EMG (electromyogram) and two EEG (electroencephalogram) signals as inputs in order to detect REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, and is optimized for low complexity and low power consumption. It is implemented in an on-board low-power FPGA connected to a multi-channel neural recording IC, to achieve low-latency (order of 1 ms or less) classification. Off-line experimental results using pre-recorded signals from nine mice show REM detection sensitivity and specificity of 81.69% and 93.86%, respectively, with the maximum latency of 39 mu s. The device is designed to be used in a non-disruptive closed-loop REM sleep suppression microsystem, for future studies of the effects of REM sleep deprivation on memory consolidation.

Vision compressive sensing, brain-machine reference commands, and adaptive fuzzy controllers in joint-space have been effectively integrated to enable the robot performing manipulation tasks guided by human operator's mind. First, a visual-feedback link is implemented by a video captured by a camera, allowing him/her to visualize the manipulator's workspace and movements being executed. Then, the compressed images are used as feedback errors in a nonvector space for producing steady-state visual evoked potentials electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and it requires no prior information on features in contrast to the traditional visual servoing. The proposed EEG decoding algorithm generates control signals for the exoskeleton robot using features extracted from neural activity. Considering coupled dynamics and actuator input constraints during the robot manipulation, a local adaptive fuzzy controller has been designed to drive the exoskeleton tracking the intended trajectories in human operator's mind and to provide a convenient way of dynamics compensation with minimal knowledge of the dynamics parameters of the exoskeleton robot. Extensive experiment studies employing three subjects have been performed to verify the validity of the proposed method.

First, we develop a reference musculoskeletal model of the human upper limb and experimentally calibrate the model to match the operator's motion behavior. Then, the proposed novel impedance algorithm transfers stiffness from human operator through the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, being utilized to design the optimal reference impedance model. Considering the unknown deadzone effects in the robot joints and the absence of the precise knowledge of the robot's dynamics, an adaptive neural network control incorporating with a high-gain observer is developed to approximate the deadzone effect and robot's dynamics and drive the robot tracking desired trajectories without velocity measurements. In order to verify the robustness of the proposed approach, the actual implementation has been performed using a real robotic exoskeleton and a human operator.

In order to obtain an accurate and faithful model, a new identification scheme for singularly perturbed nonlinear system using multitime-scale recurrent high order neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this paper. Inspired by the optimal bounded ellipsoid algorithm, which is originally designed for discrete-time systems, a novel weight updating law is developed for continuous-time NNs identification process. Compared with other widely used gradient-descent updating algorithms, this new method can achieve faster convergence, due to its adaptively adjusted learning rate. Based on the identification results, a control scheme using singular perturbation theories is developed. By using singular perturbation methods, the system order is reduced, and the controller structure is simplified. The closed-loop stability is analyzed and the convergence of system states is guaranteed. The effectiveness of the identification and the control scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.

Insulin-like growth factor signaling also impacts on neurogenesis, neuronal survival and structural plasticity. Recent reports demonstrated that diminished insulin-like growth factor signaling confers increased stress resistance in brain and other tissues. To better understand the role of neuronal insulin-like growth factor signaling in neuroprotection, we inactivated insulin-like growth factor type-1-receptor in forebrain neurons using conditional Cre-LoxP-mediated gene targeting. We found that brain structure and function, including memory performance, were preserved in insulin-like growth factor receptor mutants, and that certain characteristics improved, notably synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. To reveal stress-related roles of insulin-like growth factor signaling, we challenged the brain using a stroke-like insult. Importantly, when charged with hypoxia-ischemia, mutant brains were broadly protected from cell damage, neuroinflammation and cerebral edema. We also found that in mice with insulin-like growth factor receptor knockout specifically in forebrain neurons, a substantial systemic upregulation of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I occurred, which was associated with significant somatic overgrowth. Collectively, we found strong evidence that blocking neuronal insulin-like growth factor signaling increases peripheral somatotropic tone and simultaneously protects the brain against hypoxic-ischemic injury, findings that may contribute to developing new therapeutic concepts preventing the disabling consequences of stroke.

Lesion remyelinating activity of GSK239512 versus placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a randomised, single-blind, phase II study	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; Remyelination; GSK239512; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetisation transfer ratio	MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER RATIO; H-3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; MODERATE ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS; BRAIN; IMPAIRMENT; RESONANCE; TRIALS; DIFFERENTIATION	Histamine H-3 receptor blockade may enhance lesion remyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). The efficacy (using a magnetic resonance imaging marker of myelination, magnetisation transfer ratio [MTR]), safety and pharmacokinetics of GSK239512, a potent and brain penetrant H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist on lesion remyelination in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) were assessed. This was a phase II, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), international, multicentre study (NCT01772199). Patients aged 18-50 with RRMS, receiving intramuscular interferon-beta 1a or glatiramer acetate, were randomised 1:1 to once-daily oral GSK239512 or placebo, up-titrated over 4-5 weeks to a maximum tolerable dose up to 80 lg and maintained until Week 48. The co-primary endpoints were mean changes in post-lesion MTR in gadoliniumenhanced (GdE) or Delta-MTR defined lesions from prelesion values. Adverse events (AE) and withdrawals were monitored. Of the 131 patients randomised, 114 patients completed the study (GSK239512, n = 51; placebo, n = 63) and 27 (GSK239512) and 28 (placebo) patients contributed lesions to the primary analysis. GSK239512 was associated with positive effect sizes of 0.344 [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.018, 0.671] and 0.243 (90% CI - 0.112, 0.598) for adjusted mean changes in the normalised MTR for GdE and Delta-MTR lesions, respectively. The overall incidence of AEs was similar between GSK239512 and placebo during the treatment phase although some AEs including insomnia were more common with GSK239512, particularly during the titration period. A small but positive effect of GSK239512 on remyelination was observed. MTR assessment represents a promising method for detecting lesion remyelination in RRMS.

Here we tested the hypothesis that the same areas also reflect a more local adjustment of SAT established between individual trials, based on the outcome of the previous decision. Two monkeys performed a reaching decision task in which sensory evidence continuously evolves during the time course of a trial. In two SAT contexts, we compared neural activity in trials following a correct choice vs. those following an error. In dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), we found that 23% of cells exhibited significantly weaker baseline activity after error trials, and for similar to 30% of these this effect persisted into the deliberation epoch. These cells also contributed to the process of combining sensory evidence with the growing urgency to commit to a choice. We also found that the activity of 22% of PMd cells was increased after error trials. These neurons appeared to carry less information about sensory evidence and time-dependent urgency. For most of these modulated cells, the effect was independent of whether the previous error was expected or unexpected. We found similar phenomena in primary motor cortex (M1), with 25% of cells decreasing and 34% increasing activity after error trials, but unlike PMd, these neurons showed less clear differences in their response properties. These findings suggest that PMd and M1 belong to a network of brain areas involved in SAT adjustments established using the recent history of reinforcement.

Neuronal pattern separation of motion-relevant input in LIP activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						pattern separation; decision making; computational model; lateral intraparietal cortex	LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; DECISION-MAKING; WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PRIMATE CORTEX; DENTATE GYRUS; PERCEPTUAL DECISION; PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; NEURAL INTEGRATORS; SPIKING NEURONS	In various regions of the brain, neurons discriminate sensory stimuli by decreasing the similarity between ambiguous input patterns. Here, we examine whether this process of pattern separation may drive the rapid discrimination of visual motion stimuli in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Starting with a simple mean-rate population model that captures neuronal activity in LIP, we show that overlapping input patterns can be reformatted dynamically to give rise to separated patterns of neuronal activity. The population model predicts that a key ingredient of pattern separation is the presence of heterogeneity in the response of individual units. Furthermore, the model proposes that pattern separation relies on heterogeneity in the temporal dynamics of neural activity and not merely in the mean firing rates of individual neurons over time. We confirm these predictions in recordings of macaque LIP neurons and show that the accuracy of pattern separation is a strong predictor of behavioral performance. Overall, results propose that LIP relies on neuronal pattern separation to facilitate decision-relevant discrimination of sensory stimuli. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A new hypothesis is proposed on the role of the lateral intraparietal (LIP) region of cortex during rapid decision making. This hypothesis suggests that LIP alters the representation of ambiguous inputs to reduce their overlap, thus improving sensory discrimination. A combination of computational modeling, theoretical analysis, and electrophysiological data shows that the pattern separation hypothesis links neural activity to behavior and offers novel predictions on the role of LIP during sensory discrimination.

The present research assessed whether monetary reward influences cognitive and affective empathy. In Study 1, cognitive empathy was assessed for 42 participants who decoded briefly (33 ms) presented expressions of sadness and anger. For half the participants, correctly decoded expressions on male faces were rewarded, for the other half correctly decoded expressions on female faces were rewarded. The results showed that rewards increase empathic accuracy for both emotions equally. In Study 2, facial EMG was measured as well to assess emotional mimicry as an index of affective empathy. Study 2 replicated the findings from Study 1 and found a moderation of affective empathy as indexed through facial mimicry for sadness. Thus, simple monetary rewards affect both cognitive and affective empathy.

Molecular genetic analyses of the tumors confirmed a BRAF V600E mutation in all. They also all harbored a T202M mutation in ERK1, a kinase downstream of BRAF that is implicated in glial versus neuronal differentiation. The GG sample contained several variants that were not present in the PA samples; in particular, it had a truncating mutation in MAP2. These findings not only underscore the role of BRAF as oncogenic driver but also suggest that other genes may influence tumor morphology.

Correlation-based model of artificially induced plasticity in motor cortex by a bidirectional brain-computer interface	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							TIMING-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CORTICAL CIRCUITS; BEHAVING PRIMATES; NEURONS; CONNECTIONS; NETWORKS; ORGANIZATION; DEPRESSION; MUSCLES	Experiments show that spike-triggered stimulation performed with Bidirectional Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BBCI) can artificially strengthen connections between separate neural sites in motor cortex (MC). When spikes from a neuron recorded at one MC site trigger stimuli at a second target site after a fixed delay, the connections between sites eventually strengthen. It was also found that effective spike-stimulus delays are consistent with experimentally derived spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, suggesting that STDP is key to drive these changes. However, the impact of STDP at the level of circuits, and the mechanisms governing its modification with neural implants remain poorly understood. The present work describes a recurrent neural network model with probabilistic spiking mechanisms and plastic synapses capable of capturing both neural and synaptic activity statistics relevant to BBCI conditioning protocols. Our model successfully reproduces key experimental results, both established and new, and offers mechanistic insights into spike-triggered conditioning. Using analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we derive optimal operational regimes for BBCIs, and formulate predictions concerning the efficacy of spike-triggered conditioning in different regimes of cortical activity.

Interplay of hippocampal volume and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function as markers of stress vulnerability in men at ultra-high risk for psychosis	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Cortisol; hippocampus; hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis; sex differences; stress; ultra-high risk for psychosis	CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; CORTISOL AWAKENING RESPONSE; PSYCHIATRIC RATING-SCALE; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; GENDER DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; AMYGDALA	Background. Altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and reduced hippocampal volume (HV) are established correlates of stress vulnerability. We have previously shown an attenuated cortisol awakening response (CAR) and associations with HV specifically in male first-episode psychosis patients. Findings in individuals at ultrahigh risk (UHR) for psychosis regarding these neurobiological markers are inconsistent, and assessment of their interplay, accounting for sex differences, could explain incongruent results. Method. Study participants were 42 antipsychotic-naive UHR subjects (24 men) and 46 healthy community controls (23 men). Saliva samples for the assessment of CAR were collected at 0, 30 and 60 min after awakening. HV was determined from high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans using a semi-automatic segmentation protocol. Results. Cortisol measures and HV were not significantly different between UHR subjects and controls in total, but repeated-measures multivariate regression analyses revealed reduced cortisol levels 60 min after awakening and smaller left HV in male UHR individuals. In UHR participants only, smaller left and right HV was significantly correlated with a smaller total CAR (p = 0.42, p = 0.036 and. = 0.44, p = 0.029, respectively), corresponding to 18% and 19% of shared variance (medium effect size). Conclusions. Our findings suggest that HV reduction in individuals at UHR for psychosis is specific to men and linked to reduced post-awakening cortisol concentrations. Abnormalities in the neuroendocrine circuitry modulating stress vulnerability specifically in male UHR subjects might explain increased psychosis risk and disadvantageous illness outcomes in men compared to women.

Young infants show imitative behaviours compatible with the direct route, but little is known about the development of the semantic route, studied here for the first time. The present study examined preschool children (3-5 years of age) imitating gestures that could be transitive or intransitive, and meaningful or meaningless. Both routes for imitation were already present by three years of age, and children were more accurate at imitating meaningful-intransitive gestures than meaningless -intransitive ones; the reverse pattern was found for transitive gestures. Children preferred to use their dominant hand even if they had to anatomically imitate the model to do this, showing that a preference for specular imitation is not exclusive at these ages.

Electrophysiological correlates of emotional face processing after mild traumatic brain injury in preschool children	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury; Emotional facial expression; Social skills; Childhood; Event-related potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FEARFUL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; WEIGHTED IMAGING SWI; MINOR HEAD TRAUMA; YOUNG-CHILDREN; TIME-COURSE; EXPERIENCED MALTREATMENT; 3-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; 1ST YEAR	Evidence suggests that social skills are affected by childhood mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but the neural and affective substrates of these difficulties are still underexplored. In particular, nothing is known about consequences on the perception of emotional facial expressions, despite its critical role in social interactions and the importance of the preschool period in the development of this ability. This study thus aimed to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of emotional facial expressions processing after early mTBI. To this end, 18 preschool children (mean age 53 +/- 8 months) who sustained mTBI and 15 matched healthy controls (mean age 55 +/- 11 months) were presented with pictures of faces expressing anger, happiness, or no emotion (neutral) while event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded. The main results revealed that P1 amplitude was higher for happy faces than for angry faces, and that N170 latency was shorter for emotional faces than for neutral faces in the control group only. These findings suggest that preschool children who sustain mTBI do not present the early emotional effects that are observed in healthy preschool children at visuospatial and visual expertise stages. This study provides new evidence regarding the consequences of childhood mTBI on socioemotional processing, by showing alterations of emotional facial expressions processing, an ability known to underlie social competence and appropriate social interactions.

As of yet, there has been little evidence on the effects of musical training on audiotactile interactions at a behavioural level. Here, we tested audiotactile interaction in musicians using the audiotactile illusory flash and the parchment-skin illusion. Significant differences were only found between musicians and non-musicians for the audiotactile illusory flash. Both groups had similar task-relevant unisensory abilities, but unlike non-musicians, the number of auditory stimulations did not have a statistically important influence on the number of perceived tactile stimulations for musicians. Musicians and non-musicians similarly perceived the parchment-skin illusion. Spectral alterations of self-generated palmar sounds similarly altered the perception of wetness and dryness for both groups. These results suggest that musical training does not seem to alter multisensory interactions at large. The specificity of the sensory enhancement suggests that musical training specifically alters processes underlying the interaction of temporal audiotactile stimuli and not the global interaction between these modalities. These results are consistent with previous unisensory and multisensory investigations on sensory abilities related to audiotactile processing in musicians.

Reduced regional gray matter volumes are often interpreted to reflect neurodegeneration, but studies investigating the cellular origin of gray matter changes are lacking. We used multimodal imaging to compare 26 postmenopausal women with fibromyalgia with 25 healthy controls (age range: 50-75 years) to test whether regional gray matter volume decreases in chronic pain are associated with compromised neuronal integrity. Regional gray matter decreases were largely explained by T1 relaxation times in gray matter, a surrogate measure of water content, and notto any substantial degree by GABAA receptor concentration, an indirect marker of neuronal integrity measured with [F-18] flumazenil PET. In addition, the MR spectroscopy marker of neuronal viability, N-acetylaspartate, did not differ between patients and controls. These findings suggest that decreased gray matter volumes are not explained by compromised neuronal integrity. Alternatively, a decrease in neuronal matter could be compensated for by an upregulation of GABAA receptors. The relation between regional gray matter and T1 relaxation times suggests decreased tissue water content underlying regional gray matter decreases. In contrast, regional gray matter increases were explained by GABAA receptor concentration in addition to T1 relaxation times, indicating perhaps increased neuronal matter or GABAA receptor upregulation and inflammatory edema. By providing information on the histological origins of cerebral gray matter alterations in fibromyalgia, this study advances the understanding of the neurobiology of chronic widespread pain.

GABAB receptors were shown to associate with homo-oligomers of auxiliary KCTD8, KCTD12, KCTD12b, and KCTD16 subunits (named after their T1 K+-channel tetramerization domain) that regulate G-protein signaling of the receptor. Here we provide evidence that GABAB receptors also associate with hetero-oligomers of KCTD subunits. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that two-thirds of the KCTD16 proteins in the hippocampus of adult mice associate with KCTD12. We show that the KCTD proteins hetero-oligomerize through self-interacting T1 and H1 homology domains. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer measurements in live cells reveal that KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers associate with both the receptor and the G-protein. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers impart unique kinetic properties on G-protein-activated Kir3 currents. During prolonged receptor activation (one min) KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers produce moderately desensitizing fast deactivating K+ currents, whereas KCTD12 and KCTD16 homo-oligomers produce strongly desensitizing fast deactivating currents and nondesensitizing slowly deactivating currents, respectively. During short activation (2 s) KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers produce nondesensitizing slowly deactivating currents. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons of KCTD knock-out mice are consistent with these findings and indicate that KCTD12/KCTD16 hetero-oligomers increase the duration of slow IPSCs. In summary, our data demonstrate that simultaneous assembly of distinct KCTDs at the receptor increases the molecular and functional repertoire of native GABAB receptors and modulates physiologically induced K+ current responses in the hippocampus.

Due to the low incidence of this condition, our understanding of the clinical presentation as well as the management of IVL relies on a limited number of patients. We report the largest North American study to date on IVL with 29 cases from Quebec hospital diagnosed between 1990 and 2016. The aim of our study is to describe the clinical presentations, diagnostic and staging procedures, therapeutic management and clinical outcomes of IVL patients in our population and compare the disease phenotype to European and Asian series reported. In our cohort, all patients had stage IV IVL at diagnosis, with a median age of 66.7 years (range 47.2-90.8). Clinical presentation was characterized by constitutional symptoms (100%), poor ECOG-PS (100% >= 2), cytopenias (93% anemia), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (97%) and C-reactive protein (96%). Our cohort presented with mainly cutaneous and neurological symptoms. However, neurological involvement (75.9%) was predominant and no "cutaneous variant" was observed; this differs from European literature, where "classical" IVL is reported with mainly cutaneous involvement. Two of our Caucasian patients presented "Asian variant" IVL; this observation is not unusual, as cases of "classical" IVL have been reported in Asians and "Asian variant" IVL has been reported in Europeans. All patients were classified according to their immunophenotypic features in 3 different subgroups (CD5(+) or CD5(-)CD10(+), CD5(-)CD10(-), CD5(+)CD10(-)) with no difference in outcome. Finally, 62% of our cohort received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and 53% of them achieved a complete response. After a median follow-up of 328 days, OS at 3 years was 42.7% for the entire cohort and 47.4% for the cases with in vivo diagnosis. Conclusion: Unlike European studies on "classical" IVL, our study showed that the French Canadian presentation of this subtype of IVL is more frequently observed with neurological rather than cutaneous involvement. Finally, an early diagnosis is of primary importance since almost a quarter of patients receive a post-mortem diagnosis. A prompt diagnosis allows the introduction of an early treatment, associated with a CR in 53% of patients.

Long-term effects of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis: Interim analysis of ENDORSE, a randomized extension study	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL			English	Article						Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF); Expanded Disability Status Scale; ENDORSE; DEFINE	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; CONTROLLED PHASE-3; ORAL FINGOLIMOD; BRAIN VOLUME; INTERFERON; DISABILITY; THERAPIES; BURDEN; BG-12	Background: Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) demonstrated strong efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in phase 3 DEFINE/CONFIRM studies. ENDORSE is an ongoing long-term extension of DEFINE/CONFIRM. Objective: We report efficacy and safety results of a 5-year interim analysis of ENDORSE (2 years DEFINE/CONFIRM; minimum 3 years ENDORSE). Methods: In ENDORSE, patients randomized to DMF 240 mg twice (BID) or thrice daily (TID) in DEFINE/CONFIRM continued this dosage, and those initially randomized to placebo (PBO) or glatiramer acetate (GA) were re-randomized to DMF 240 mg BID or TID. Results: For patients continuing DMF BID (BID/BID), annualized relapse rates were 0.202, 0.163, 0.139, 0.143, and 0.138 (years 1-5, respectively) and 63%, 73%, and 88% were free of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, new T1 hypointense lesions, and gadolinium-enhanced lesions, respectively, at year 5. Adverse events (AEs; serious adverse events (SAEs)) were reported in 91% (22%; BID/BID), 95% (24%; PBO/BID), and 88% (16%; GA/BID) of the patients. One case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was reported in the setting of severe, prolonged lymphopenia. Conclusion: Treatment with DMF was associated with continuously low clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity in patients with RRMS. These interim data demonstrate a sustained treatment benefit and an acceptable safety profile with DMF.

Methods: Analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted in 19,504 patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis and minimum 1-year prospective follow-up from the MSBase cohort study. Multivariable linear regression models assessed associations between relapse incidence, phenotype and changes in disability (quantified with Expanded Disability Status Scale and its Functional System scores). Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: In 34,858 relapses recorded during 136,462 patient-years (median follow-up 5.9 years), higher relapse incidence was associated with greater disability accumulation (beta = 0.16, p < 0.001). Relapses of all phenotypes promoted disability accumulation, with the most pronounced increase associated with pyramidal (beta = 0.27 (0.25-0.29)), cerebellar (beta = 0.35 (0.30-0.39)) and bowel/bladder (beta = 0.42 (0.35-0.49)) phenotypes (mean (95% confidence interval)). Higher incidence of each relapse phenotype was associated with an increase in disability in the corresponding neurological domain, as well as anatomically related domains. Conclusion: Relapses are associated with accumulation of neurological disability. Relapses in pyramidal, cerebellar and bowel/bladder systems have the greatest association with disability change.

However, no direct in vivo and in situ measurement of mechanical properties within developing 3D tissues and organs has yet been performed. Here we introduce a technique that employs biocompatible, magnetically responsive ferrofluid microdroplets as local mechanical actuators and allows quantitative spatiotemporal measurements of mechanical properties in vivo. Using this technique, we show that vertebrate body elongation entails spatially varying tissue mechanics along the anteroposterior axis. Specifically, we find that the zebrafish tailbud is viscoelastic (elastic below a few seconds and fluid after just 1 min) and displays decreasing stiffness and increasing fluidity toward its posterior elongating region. This method opens new avenues to study mechanobiology in vivo, both in embryogenesis and in disease processes, including cancer.

METHODS: The 3D-Study (2010-2012) is a prospective cohort study, which sought to improve the understanding among perinatal events, obstetric outcomes, and child development. A total of 2,366 pregnant women were recruited, of whom 278 conceived with ART: ovarian stimulation, intrauterine sperm insemination, in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or in vitro maturation. Natural conception was defined as the unassisted establishment of pregnancy. Cognitive, motor, and language neurodevelopmental outcomes were compared between ART and natural conception groups at 24 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition, and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. Adjusted linear regression models evaluated the effect of ART on neurodevelopmental outcomes using natural conception as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 175 children in the ART group (62.9%) and 1,345 children in the natural conception group (64.4%) underwent neurodevelopmental assessment at 24 months postpartum. After adjusting for relevant confounders, children born after ART showed no difference in Bayley scales' cognitive scores (B1 [standard error] =-1.60 [0.9], 95% confidence interval [CI] 23.36 to 0.16), composite motor scores (B-1 [standard error] =-1.33 [1.0], 95% CI -3.29 to 0.63), or MacArthur-Bates language scores (B-1 [standard error] =-0.28 [2.1], 95% CI -4.39 to 3.83). No difference was observed when independent ART techniques were compared nor when comparing in vivo (ovarian stimulation or intrauterine insemination) or in vitro (in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or in vitro maturation) techniques (P>.05). CONCLUSION: Children born after ART had similar cognitive, motor, and language development as children born after natural conception at 2 years of age. These findings may be useful in the clinical counseling of patients undergoing ART.

J	Mathias, B; Gehring, WJ; Palmer, C				Mathias, Brian; Gehring, William J.; Palmer, Caroline			Auditory N1 reveals planning and monitoring processes during music performance	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						FRN; N1; Sequence planning; Feedback monitoring; Sensorimotor memory; Music cognition	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEQUENCE PRODUCTION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SPEECH PRODUCTION; ERROR-DETECTION; NEURAL SYSTEM; GAMBLING TASK; SERIAL ORDER	The current study investigated the relationship between planning processes and feedback monitoring during music performance, a complex task in which performers prepare upcoming events while monitoring their sensory outcomes. Theories of action planning in auditory-motor production tasks propose that the planning of future events co-occurs with the perception of auditory feedback. This study investigated the neural correlates of planning and feedback monitoring by manipulating the contents of auditory feedback during music performance. Pianists memorized and performed melodies at a cued tempo in a synchronization-continuation task while the EEG was recorded. During performance, auditory feedback associated with single melody tones was occasionally substituted with tones corresponding to future (next), present (current), or past (previous) melody tones. Only future-oriented altered feedback disrupted behavior: Future-oriented feedback caused pianists to slow down on the subsequent tone more than past-oriented feedback, and amplitudes of the auditory N1 potential elicited by the tone immediately following the altered feedback were larger for future-oriented than for past-oriented or noncontextual (unrelated) altered feedback; larger N1 amplitudes were associated with greater slowing following altered feedback in the future condition only. Feedback-related negativities were elicited in all altered feedback conditions. In sum, behavioral and neural evidence suggests that future-oriented feedback disrupts performance more than past-oriented feedback, consistent with planning theories that posit similarity-based interference between feedback and planning contents. Neural sensory processing of auditory feedback, reflected in the N1 ERP, may serve as a marker for temporal disruption caused by altered auditory feedback in auditory-motor production tasks.

For this purpose a parsimoniously parameterized model is used to describe the patient's response to a muscle relaxant. Due to clinical restrictions the controller action begins when the patient recovers after an initial drug bolus. The NMB control problem, typically consisting of tracking a constant NMB reference level, can be associated with an optimal control problem (OCP) with a positivity constraint in the input signal. Due to the complexity associated with the introduction of a positivity constraint in the input, approximate solutions to this OCP will be found in this paper using two methods. In the first method, the optimal control problem is relaxed into a Semi-Definite Program (SDP) using a change of variables, whereas in the second method the OCP is approximated by an infinite horizon constrained Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem. These two controllers are compared with a classical PI controller in simulation. The PI exhibits a slightly worse performance in terms of the control magnitude but it was not optimized taking this magnitude into account. The simulation results show that the SDP relaxation and the saturated LQR methods lead to the same controller gains and therefore the same trajectory tracking using parameters from a patient's database, thus encouraging its application and validation in clinical trials. Although the performance of the proposed controllers can be compared in terms of how they work when applied to the patient's database models, the two proposed methods cannot be compared from an optimal control theoretical point of view because they correspond to the solution of two different relaxations of the original control problem using two different functions of merit.

MethodsA nested case-control study was conducted using data from a prospective study of delirium in older long-term care residents from 7 long-term care facilities in Montreal and Quebec City, Canada. The Confusion Assessment Method was used to diagnose incident delirium. The use of medications that antagonize mediators of inflammatory responses was determined by examining facility pharmacy databases and coding medications received daily by each resident. Risk sets were built using incidence density sampling: each risk set consisted of a case with incident delirium and all controls without incident delirium at the same date and facility. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association of exposure to inflammation antagonist medications with the incidence of delirium. ResultsOf 254 residents, 95 developed incident delirium during 24weeks (cases); each case was matched with up to 35 controls. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of delirium for residents exposed to at least one inflammation antagonist medication were 0.53 (0.34, 0.81) and 0.60 (0.38, 0.92), respectively. Estimates of the risk of incident delirium associated with specific medications and medication classes were mostly protective but not statistically significant. ConclusionThe use of medications that antagonize mediators of inflammatory responses may reduce the risk of delirium in older adults. Despite study limitations, the findings merit further investigation using larger patient samples, more precise measures of exposure and better control of potential confounding variables.

J	Moore, RD; Lepine, J; Ellemberg, D				Moore, R. Davis; Lepine, Julien; Ellemberg, Dave			The independent influence of concussive and sub-concussive impacts on soccer players' neurophysiological and neuropsychological function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sub-concussion; Concussion; Neurophysiology; ERPs; Neuropsychology	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HIGH-SCHOOL FOOTBALL; HEAD IMPACTS; NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DEFAULT MODE; SPORT HELD; ABNORMALITIES	Accumulating research demonstrates that repetitive sub-concussive impacts can alter the structure, function and connectivity of the brain. However, the functional significance of these alterations as well as the independent contribution of concussive and sub-concussive impacts to neurophysiological and neuropsychological health are unclear. Accordingly, we compared the neurophysiological and neuropsychological function of contact athletes with (concussion group) and without (sub-concussion group) a history of concussion, to non-contact athletes. We evaluated event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited during an oddball task and performance on a targeted battery of neuropsychological tasks. Athletes in the sub-concussion and concussion groups exhibited similar amplitude reductions in the ERP indices of attentional resource allocation (P3b) and attentional orienting (P3a) relative to non-contact athletes. However, only athletes in the concussion group exhibited reduced amplitude in the ERP index of perceptual attention (N1). Athletes in the sub-concussion and concussion groups also exhibited deficits in memory recall relative to non-contact athletes, but athletes in the concussion group also exhibited significantly more recall errors than athletes in the sub-concussion group. Additionally, only athletes in the concussion group exhibited response delays during the oddball task. The current findings suggest that sub concussive impacts are associated with alterations in the neurophysiological and neuropsychological indices of essential cognitive functions, albeit to a lesser degree than the combination of sub-concussive and concussive impacts.

A separate line of study shows that the seven-repeat (7R) allele of the dopamine-4 receptor gene (DRD4) increases susceptibility to environmental factors including maternal sensitivity. The current study integrates these lines of work by examining whether preschoolers carrying the 7R allele are more vulnerable to low maternal sensitivity as it relates to overweight/obesity risk. MethodThe Maternal Adversity Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) project in Canada was used as the discovery cohort (N=203), while the Generation R study in the Netherlands was used as a replication sample (N=270). Regression models to predict both continuous BMI z-scores and membership in any higher BMI category based on established World Health Organization (WHO) cutoffs for 48months of age were completed. ResultsIn both cohorts, there was a significant maternal sensitivity by DRD4 by sex interaction predicting higher body mass indices and/or obesity risk. As hypothesized, post hoc testing revealed an inverse relationship between maternal sensitivity and body mass indices in 7R allele carriers relative to noncarriers. This finding was strongest in girls in the Canadian cohort and in boys in the Dutch cohort. ConclusionsMany children who carry the 7R allele of DRD4 appear to be more influenced by maternal sensitivity as it relates to overweight/obesity risk, consistent with a plasticity effect. Given the relatively small sample sizes available for these analyses, further replications will be needed to confirm and extend these results.

In the present study the authors aim to systematically review critiques, discuss design issues, and propose a framework for future trials. METHODS The authors performed a systematic review of the French and English literature on the ARUBA study published between January 2006 and February 2015. The electronic search, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid), CINAHL, and EMBASE databases, was complemented by hand searching and cross-referencing. The comments were categorized as items related to the design, the conduct, and the analysis and interpretation of the trial. RESULTS Thirty-one articles or letters were identified. The pragmatic design, with heterogeneity of patients and lack of standardization of the treatment arm, were frequently stated concerns. The choice of outcome measures was repeatedly criticized. During the trial, low enrollment rates, selection bias, and premature interruption of enrollment were frequent comments. The short follow-up period, the lack of subgroup analyses, the lack of details on the results of the various treatments, and a contentious interpretation of results were noted at the analysis stage. A fundamental problem was the primary hypothesis testing conservative management. The authors believe that other trials are needed. Future trials. could be pragmatic, test interventions stratified at the time of randomization, and look for long-term, hard clinical outcomes in a large number of patients. CONCLUSIONS In the authors' view, the ARUBA trial is a turning point in the history of brain AVM management; future trials should aim at integrating trial methodology and clinical care in the presence of uncertainty.

Methods: Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed on 50 patients with known or suspected NET of the small bowel (n = 19), pancreas (n = 14), lung (n = 4), or other location (n = 13). The images were reviewed by 7 observers, who used a standardized interpretation approach. The observers were classified as having a low level of experience (<500 scans or <5 y experience with Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT; n = 4) or a high level of experience (500 scans or y experience with Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT; n = 3). Interpretation by the primary nuclear medicine physician, who had access to all clinical and imaging data, served as the reference standard. Interobserver agreement was determined by the Cohen K statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%Cl). Results: Interobserver agreement was substantial, and the median number of false findings was low for the overall scan result: that is, positive versus negative scan result (K = 0.80; 95%Cl, 0.74-0.86; false findings, 3), organ involvement (K = 0.70; 95%Cl, 0.64-0.76; false findings, 5), and lymph node involvement (K = 0.71; 95%Cl, 0.65-0.78; false findings, 6). Interobserver agreement was substantial to almost perfect, and the average absolute difference (A) from the reference observer was low for number of organ and lymph node metastases (organ: ICC, 0.84; 95%Cl, 0.77-0.89; Delta = 0.45; lymph node: ICC, 0.77; 95%Cl, 0.69-0.84; Delta = 0.45), tumor SUVmax (ICC, 0.99; 95%Cl, 0.97-0.99; Delta = 0.44), and reference SUV (spleen: ICC, 0.81; Delta = 1.10; liver: ICC, 0.79; Delta = 0.62). Interpretations of appropriateness for peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy varied more significantly among observers (K = 0.64; 95%Cl, 0.57-0.70), and a higher frequency of false-positive recommendations for peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy occurred in observers with low experience than in those with high experience (range, 7-12 vs. 4-8). Conclusion: The interpretation of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT images for NET staging is consistent among observers with low and high levels of experience. However, image-based recommendations for or against peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy require experience and training.

In this paper, we revisit the neural diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia that was initially proposed in 1997 and updated in 2008. In light of cumulative research findings, we must now encompass evidence on the premorbid periods of psychosis, and our more nuanced understanding of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and its association with neurodevelopmental, epigenetic, neurotransmitter, and inflammatory processes, as well as brain structure and function. Giving consideration to the methodological complexities that have become more apparent as research in this area has burgeoned, the various indices of HPA axis function, and the different stages of illness, we review relevant research published since the 2008 update of the model. We conclude by proposing an extended neural diathesis-stress model that addresses the broader neurobiological context of stress psychobiology in psychosis progression. Implications of this model for best practice, with regards to both future research and treatment strategies, are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sex-specific associations of testosterone with prefrontal-hippocampal development and executive function	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Gonadarche; Androgen; Cognition; Puberty; Adolescents; Human brain	VERBAL-LEARNING-TEST; BEHAVIOR RATING INVENTORY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; ADULT MALE RATS; SALIVARY TESTOSTERONE; CORTICAL MATURATION; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; CHILDRENS-VERSION; HORMONE LEVELS	Testosterone is thought to play a crucial role in mediating sexual differentiation of brain structures. Examinations of the cognitive effects of testosterone have also shown beneficial and potentially sex-specific effects on executive function and mnemonic processes. Yet these findings remain limited by an incomplete understanding of the critical timing and brain regions most affected by testosterone, the lack of documented links between testosterone-related structural brain changes and cognition, and the difficulty in distinguishing the effects of testosterone from those of related sex steroids such as of estradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Here we examined associations between testosterone, corticohippocampal structural covariance, executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) and verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version), in a longitudinal sample of typically developing children and adolescents 6-22 yo, controlling for the effects of estradiol, DHEA, pubertal stage, collection time, age, handedness, and total brain volume. We found prefrontal-hippocampal covariance to vary as a function of testosterone levels, but only in boys. Boys also showed a specific association between positive prefrontal-hippocampal covariance (as seen at higher testosterone levels) and lower performance on specific components of executive function (monitoring the action process and flexibly shifting between actions). We also found the association between testosterone and a specific aspect of executive function (monitoring) to be significantly mediated by prefrontal-hippocampal structural covariance. There were no significant associations between testosterone-related cortico-hippocampal covariance and verbal memory. Taken together, these findings highlight the developmental importance of testosterone in supporting sexual differentiation of the brain and sex-specific executive function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

People may be exposed to OPs in several occasions, which can produce several distinct neurotoxic effects depending on the dose, frequency of exposure, type of OP, and the host factors that influence susceptibility and sensitivity. These neurotoxic effects are mainly due to the interaction with enzyme targets involved in toxicological or detoxication pathways. In this work, the toxicological relevance of known OPs targets is reviewed. The main enzyme targets of OPs have been identified among the serine hydrolase protein family, some of them decades ago (e.g. AChE, BuChE, NTE and carboxylesterases), others more recently (e.g. lysophospholipase, arylformidase and KIA1363) and others which are not molecularly identified yet (e.g. phenylvalerate esterases). Members of this family are characterized by displaying serine hydrolase activity, containing a conserved serine hydrolase motif and having an alpha-beta hydrolase fold. Improvement in Xray-crystallography and in silico methods have generated new data of the interactions between OPs and esterases and have established new methods to study new inhibitors and reactivators of cholinesterases. Mass spectrometry for AChE, BChE and APH have characterized the active site serine adducts with OPs being useful to detect biomarkers of OPs exposure and inhibitory and postinhibitory reactions of esterases and OPs. The purpose of this review is focus specifically on the interaction of OP with esterases, mainly with type B-esterases, which are able to hydrolyze carboxylesters but inhibited by OPs by covalent phosphorylation on the serine or tyrosine residue in the active sites. Other related esterases in some cases with no-irreversible effect are also discussed.

The proband harbored a maternally inherited balanced translocation (46,XY,t(11;14)(p12;p12)mat) that disrupted LRRC4C, a member of the highly specialized netrin G family of axon guidance molecules. The proband also inherited a paternally derived chromosomal inversion that disrupted DPP6, a potassium channel interacting protein. Copy Number (CN) analysis in 14,077 cases with neurodevelopmental disorders and 8,960 control subjects revealed that 60% of cases with exonic deletions in LRRC4C had a second clinically recognizable syndrome associated with variable clinical phenotypes, including 16p11.2, 1q44, and 2q33.1 CN syndromes, suggesting LRRC4C deletion variants may be modifiers of neurodevelopmental disorders. In vitro, functional assessments modeling patient deletions in LRRC4C suggest a negative regulatory role of these exons found in the untranslated region of LRRC4C, which has a single, terminal coding exon. These data suggest that the proband's autism may be due to the inheritance of disruptions in both DPP6 and LRRC4C, and may highlight the importance of the netrin G family and potassium channel interacting molecules in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Testing Stenting and Flow Diversion Using a Surgical Elastase-Induced Complex Fusiform Aneurysm Model	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							OCCLUDE EXPERIMENTAL BIFURCATION; SACCULAR ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; SIDEWALL ANEURYSMS; IN-VIVO; DISRUPTING DEVICE; CURVED SIDEWALL; RABBITS; DIVERTORS; CREATION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rabbit elastase-induced saccular aneurysms have been commonly used for preclinical testing of endovascular devices, including flow diverters. However, all tested devices have been shown to be capable of aneurysm occlusion with this model. We aimed to create a more challenging model to test and discriminate among neurovascular devices of varying efficacies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With a surgical approach that included elastase infusion and balloon dilation, we attempted the creation of complex fusiform aneurysms in 16 rabbits, with standard saccular carotid aneurysms created in 15 other animals. Aneurysms were randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: flow diversion (n = 8), high-porosity stent (n = 6), double high-porosity stent (n = 5), and control (n = 6). Angiographic assessment and pathologic analyses were performed at 3 months. RESULTS: Creation of complex fusiform and standard saccular aneurysms was successful in 12/16 and 13/15 attempts, respectively. All saccular (n = 4) or complex fusiform (n = 4) aneurysms treated with flow diverters were successfully occluded. Three of 3 saccular compared with 0/2 complex fusiform aneurysms were occluded by double high-porosity stents. One of 3 saccular and 0/3 complex fusiform aneurysms were occluded by a single high-porosity stent. Both aneurysm types shared the same pathologic findings when untreated: The aneurysm wall lacked an elastic layer and smooth muscle cells, while the lumen was lined with neointima of varying thickness. Neointimal coverage of the devices was complete when aneurysms were occluded, while leaks were always associated with aneurysm remnants. CONCLUSIONS: Challenging fusiform aneurysms can be created in rabbits by using a surgical modification of the elastase method.

MRI Atlas-Based Measurement of Spinal Cord Injury Predicts Outcome in Acute Flaccid Myelitis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; GRAY-MATTER; SEGMENTATION; OUTBREAK; BRAIN; WHITE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent advances in spinal cord imaging analysis have led to the development of a robust anatomic template and atlas incorporated into an open-source platform referred to as the Spinal Cord Toolbox. Using the Spinal Cord Toolbox, we sought to correlate measures of GM, WM, and cross-sectional area pathology on T2 MR imaging with motor disability in patients with acute flaccid myelitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spinal cord imaging for 9 patients with acute flaccid myelitis was analyzed by using the Spinal Cord Toolbox. A semiautomated pipeline using the Spinal Cord Toolbox measured lesion involvement in GM, WM, and total spinal cord cross-sectional area. Proportions of GM, WM, and cross-sectional area affected by T2 hyperintensity were calculated across 3 ROIs: 1) center axial section of lesion; 2) full lesion segment; and 3) full cord atlas volume. Spearman rank order correlation was calculated to compare MR metrics with clinical measures of disability. RESULTS: Proportion of GM metrics at the center axial section significantly correlated with measures of motor impairment upon admission (r [9] = -0.78; P = .014) and at 3-month follow-up (r [9] = -0.66; P = .05). Further, proportion of GM extracted across the full lesion segment significantly correlated with initial motor impairment (r [9] = -0.74, P = .024). No significant correlation was found for proportion of WM or proportion of cross-sectional area with clinical disability. CONCLUSIONS: Atlas-based measures of proportion of GM T2 signal abnormality measured on a single axial MR imaging section and across the full lesion segment correlate with motor impairment and outcome in patients with acute flaccid myelitis. This is the first atlas-based study to correlate clinical outcomes with segmented measures of T2 signal abnormality in the spinal cord.	[McCoy, D. B.; Talbott, J. F.; Mamlouk, M.

For this purpose, IdS-KO mice brain sections were coated with sublimated 1,5-diaminonaphtalene and analyzed by high spatial resolution IMS (5 mu m) and anti-GM3 IHC on the same tissue sections to characterize the ganglioside monosialated ganglioside (GM) deposits found in Hunter's disease. IMS analysis have found that two species of GM3 and GM2 that are only different due to the length of their fatty acid residue (stearic or arachidic residue) were overexpressed in the IdS-KO mice compared to a control mouse. GM3 and GM2 were characterized by on-tissue exact mass and MS/MS compared to a GM3 standard. Realignment of both IMS and IHC data sets further confirmed the observed regioselective signal previously detected by providing direct correlation of the IMS image for the two GM3 overly expressed MS signals with the anti-GM3 IHC image. Furthermore, these regioselective GM MS signals were also found to have highly heterogeneous distributions within the GM3-IHC staining. Some deposits showed high content in GM3 and GM2 stearic species (r = 0.74) and others had more abundant GM3 and GM2 arachidic species (r = 0.76). Same-section analysis of Hunter's disease mouse model by both high spatial resolution IMS and IHC provides a more in-depth analysis of the composition of the GM aggregates while providing spatial distribution of the observed molecular species.

We accessed data from Canada Health and Measures Survey. General linear models were used to estimate the association between blood lead concentrations (BPb) and both HbA1c and FGLs, while controlling for confounders. Multivariate logistic regression was used for assessing the relation between BPb and the likelihood for dysglycemia. FGLs in participants with moderate BPb (2.5-5.0 mu g/dL) were 1.03 (95 % CI 1.00-1.06) times higher compared with participants with BPb < 2.5 mu g/dL. Equivalent figures for those with BPb ae<yen> 5.0 mu g/dL were 1.10 (95 % CI 1.01-1.20) times, relative to the lowest stratum. This association was attenuated using HbA1c to define dysglycemia. Lead exposure was associated with the likelihood for neither FGLs ae<yen> 1.10 g/L nor HbA1c ae<yen> 5.7 %. The association between lead exposure and dysglycemia, if any, is likely to be very modest, at least at the population level.

The proposed system has two phases for mineral identification. In phase#1, which is the segmentation phase, 12 color components are extracted for each pixel, and using an incremental clustering algorithm, several mineral clusters including index mineral are produced. Afterwards, in phase#2 which is the identification phase, the produced mineral clusters are identified based on a cascade classification approach. The first level of the cascade includes a set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) corresponding to the number of input minerals which are trained based on color components. In the first level, those minerals exhibiting different colors in plane or cross polarized light are identified. The second level of the cascade includes one ANN which is trained based on texture features in plane and cross polarized light images. In the second level, those minerals which are indistinguishable based on color components in both plane and cross polarized light are identified (are rejected in the first level of the cascade). The final output of the system is the name and number of minerals, boundary and percentage of each mineral in thin section, and eventually the name of probable target rock. The proposed system is able to recognize 23 test igneous minerals with the overall accuracy of 93.81%. The proposed system can be applied in important applications which require a real time segmentation and identification map such as petrography, and NASA Mars Explorations.

It can aid parents in imagining the child's future, and guide timely and ongoing treatment decisions, including shifting treatment goals and focusing on comfort care. However, numerous challenges have been reported with respect to evidence-based practices for prognostication such as biases about prognosis among clinicians. Additionally, the evaluation or appreciation of living with disability can differ, including the well-known disability paradox where patients self-report a good quality of life in spite of severe disability. Herein, we put forward a set of five practice principles captured in the ouR-HOPE approach (Reflection, Humility, Open-mindedness, Partnership, and Engagement) and related questions to encourage clinicians to self-assess their practice and engage with others in responding to these challenges. We hope that this proposal paves the way to greater discussion and attention to ethical aspects of communicating prognosis in the context of neonatal brain injury.

Smoking status and its relationship to demographic and clinical characteristics in first episode psychosis	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						First episode psychosis; Smoking; Tobacco; Cannabis; Symptoms; Cognition	MORBID SUBSTANCE USE; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; TOBACCO SMOKING; SYSTEMATIC METAANALYSIS; ILLNESS SEVERITY; WORKING-MEMORY; CANNABIS USE; FOLLOW-UP; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS	Elevated rates of cigarette smoking are observed prior to the onset of psychosis and remain stable early in the illness. Cannabis use frequently co-occurs with cigarette smoking and is independently associated with distinct clinical outcomes. However, past research has not controlled for cannabis use in cigarette smokers with first episode psychosis (FEP), limiting conclusions on the unique relationship of cigarette smoking to the demographic and clinical profiles of these patients. The present study therefore aimed to: (1) Determine the prevalence and patterns of cigarette smoking and its co-use with cannabis in FEP, and (2) Examine the demographic, clinical, cognitive, and functional characteristics associated with cigarette smoking status, after adjusting for frequency of cannabis use. Patients entering specialized treatment for FEP (N = 140) were divided into groups according to their current smoking status: 66 non-smokers (0 cigarettes/day), 47 light/moderate smokers (1-19 cigarettes/day; M = 9.81, SD = 3.93), and 27 heavy smokers (>= 20 cigarettes/day; M = 26.39, SD = 6.31). The prevalence of cigarette smoking was 53% and smoking status was highly associated with frequency of cannabis use. After adjusting for cannabis use, significant between-group differences emerged. Heavy smokers were older at program entry and had a later age of onset of psychosis than light/moderate and non-smokers. Non-smokers had more education, better neurocognitive performance, and higher levels of functioning than light/moderate and heavy smokers. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the clinical significance of tobacco use and factors that contribute to the initiation and continuation of smoking behaviours in FEP.

Optimizing MRI Logistics: Focused Process Improvements Can Increase Throughput in an Academic Radiology Department	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY			English	Article						focused process improvement; MRI; throughput	PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; EFFICIENCY; DELIVERY; WORKFLOW; PATIENT; METRICS; IMPACT	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe and evaluate the effect of focused process improvements on protocol selection and scheduling in the MRI division of a busy academic medical center, as measured by examination and room times, magnet fill rate, and potential revenue increases and cost savings to the department. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Focused process improvements, led by a multidisciplinary team at a large academic medical center, were directed at streamlining MRI protocols and optimizing matching protocol ordering to scheduling while maintaining or improving image quality. Data were collected before (June 2013) and after (March 2015) implementation of focused process improvements and divided by subspecialty on type of examination, allotted examination time, actual examination time, and MRI parameters. Direct and indirect costs were compiled and analyzed in consultation with the business department. Data were compared with evaluated effects on selected outcome and efficiency measures, as well as revenue and cost considerations. Statistical analysis was performed using a t test. RESULTS. During the month of June 2013, 2145 MRI examinations were performed at our center; 2702 were performed in March 2015. Neuroradiology examinations were the most common (59% in June 2013, 56% in March 2015), followed by body examinations (25% and 27%). All protocols and parameters were analyzed and streamlined for each examination, with slice thickness, TR, and echo train length among the most adjusted parameters. Mean time per examination decreased from 43.4 minutes to 36.7 minutes, and mean room time per patient decreased from 46.3 to 43.6 minutes (p = 0.009). Potential revenue from increased throughput may yield up to $3 million yearly (at $ 800 net revenue per scan) or produce cost savings if the facility can reduce staffed scanner hours or the number of scanners in its fleet. Actual revenue and expense impacts depend on the facility's fixed and variable cost structure, payer contracts, MRI fleet composition, and unmet MRI demand. CONCLUSION. Focused process improvements in selecting MRI protocols and scheduling examinations significantly increased throughput in the MRI division, thereby increasing capacity and revenue. Shorter scan and department times may also improve patient experience.

Relationships among attention networks and physiological responding to threat	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Attention; Executive functioning; Cognition; Anxiety; Fear; Predictability; Startle	FEAR-POTENTIATED STARTLE; UNPREDICTABLE AVERSIVE EVENTS; COGNITIVE REMEDIATION THERAPY; ANXIETY DISORDERS; STRIA TERMINALIS; TRAIT ANXIETY; BED NUCLEUS; EMOTION REGULATION; BIAS MODIFICATION; HUMAN BRAIN	Although researchers have long hypothesized a relationship between attention and anxiety, theoretical and empirical accounts of this relationship have conflicted. We attempted to resolve these conflicts by examining relationships of attentional abilities with responding to predictable and unpredictable threat - related but distinct motivational process implicated in a number of anxiety disorders. Eighty-one individuals completed a behavioral task assessing efficiency of three components of attention - alerting, orienting, and executive control (Attention Network Test - Revised). We also assessed startle responding during anticipation of both predictable, imminent threat (of mild electric shock) and unpredictable contextual threat. Faster alerting and slower disengaging from non-emotional attention cues were related to heightened responding to unpredictable threat, whereas poorer executive control of attention was related to heightened responding to predictable threat. This double dissociation helps to integrate models of attention and anxiety and may be informative for treatment development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Landry, SP; Champoux, F				Landry, Simon P.; Champoux, Francois			Musicians react faster and are better multisensory integrators	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Reaction time; Audio-tactile; Musical training; Multisensory integration; Audio-somatosensory	CORPUS-CALLOSUM SIZE; AUDIOTACTILE INTERACTION; PROFESSIONAL PIANISTS; REACTION-TIMES; BRAIN; PLASTICITY; PLAYERS; NEUROPLASTICITY; NONMUSICIANS; PERFORMANCE	The results from numerous investigations suggest that musical training might enhance how senses interact. Despite repeated confirmation of anatomical and structural changes in visual, tactile, and auditory regions, significant changes have only been reported in the audiovisual domain and for the detection of audio-tactile incongruencies. In the present study, we aim at testing whether long-term musical training might also enhance other multisensory processes at a behavioural level. An audio-tactile reaction time task was administrated to a group of musicians and non-musicians. We found significantly faster reaction times with musicians for auditory, tactile, and audio-tactile stimulations. Statistical analyses between the combined uni- and multisensory reaction times revealed that musicians possess a statistical advantage when responding to multisensory stimuli compared to non-musicians. These results suggest for the first time that long-term musical training reduces simple non-musical auditory, tactile, and multisensory reaction times. Taken together with the previous results from other sensory modalities, these results strongly point towards musicians being better at integrating the inputs from various senses.

Under these conditions, EEG/MEG activity increments in the posterior parietal cortex scaling with the number of memoranda are often reported in the hemisphere contralateral to the objects' position in the memory array. This highly replicable finding clashes with several reported failures to observe compatible hemodynamic activity modulations using fMRI or fNIRS in comparable tasks. Here, we reconcile this apparent discrepancy by acquiring fMRI data on healthy participants and employing a cluster analysis to group voxels in the posterior parietal cortex based on their functional response. The analysis identified two distinct subpopulations of voxels in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing a consistent functional response among participants. One subpopulation, located in the superior IPS, showed a bilateral response to the number of objects coded in visual working memory. A different subpopulation, located in the inferior IPS, showed an increased unilateral response when the objects were displayed contralaterally. The results suggest that a cluster of neurons in the inferior IPS is a candidate source of electromagnetic contralateral responses to working memory load in cued change detection tasks.

However, pain inhibition correlated negatively with retrospective reports of mental stress during training and competition. The aim of the current study was to test pain inhibition capabilities of triathletes under acute, controlled psychological stress manipulation. Methods: Participants were 25 triathletes and ironman triathletes who underwent the measurement of pain threshold, pain intolerance, tonic suprathreshold pain, and conditioned pain modulation before and during exposure to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST). Perceived ratings of stress and anxiety, autonomic variables, and salivary cortisol levels were obtained as indices of stress. Results: The MIST induced a significant stress reaction manifested in the subjective and objective indices. Overall, a significant reduction in pain threshold and in conditioned pain modulation efficacy was observed after the MIST, which reached the baseline levels observed previously in nonathletes. Paradoxically, the magnitude of this stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH) correlated negatively with the magnitude of the stress response; low-stress responders exhibited greater SIH than high-stress responders. Conclusion: The results suggest that under acute psychological stress, triathletes not only react with SIH and a reduction in pain modulation but also lose their advantageous pain modulation over nonathletes. The stronger the stress response recorded, the weaker the SIH. It appears that triathletes are not resilient to stress, responding with an increase in the sensitivity to pain as well as a decrease in pain inhibition. The possible effects of athletes' baseline pain profile and stress reactivity on SIH are discussed.

Owing to their role in regulating the cell cycle and protein trafficking, 14-3-3 proteins are prevalent in human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. 14-3-3 proteins are expressed in all eukaryotic cells, suggesting that they mediate their biological functions through evolutionarily conserved protein interactions. To identify these core 14-3-3 client proteins, we used an affinity-based proteomics approach to characterize and compare the human and Drosophila 14-3-3 interactomes. Using this approach, we identified a group of Rab11 effector proteins, termed class I Rab11 family interacting proteins (Rab11-FIPs), or Rip11 in Drosophila. We found that 14-3-3 binds to Rip11 in a phospho-dependent manner to ensure its proper subcellular distribution during cell division. Our results indicate that Rip11 plays an essential role in the regulation of cytokinesis and that this function requires its association with 14-3-3 but not with Rab11. Together, our results suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for 14-3-3 in controlling Rip11-dependent protein transport during cytokinesis.

Here, we examine the possibility that PFC DA regulates the stress responsivity of callosal neurons indirectly by acting at D-1 and D-2 receptors located on GABA interneurons. Microdialysis combined with drug perfusion (reverse dialysis) or microinjections was used in adult male Long-Evans rats to characterize D-1, D-2, and GABA(B) receptor-mediated regulation of the PFC GABA response to tail-pinch (TP) stress. We report that TP stress reliably elicited comparable increases in extracellular GABA in the left and right PFCs. SCH23390 (D-1 antagonist; 100 mu M perfusate concentration) perfused by reverse microdialysis attenuated the local GABA stress responses equally in the left and right PFCs. Intra-PFC raclopride perfusion (D-2 antagonist; 100 mu M) had the opposite effect, not only potentiating the local GABA stress response but also causing a transient elevation in basal (pre-stress) GABA. Moreover, unilateral PFC raclopride microinjection (6 nmol) attenuated the GLU response to TP stress in the contralateral PFC. Finally, intra-PFC baclofen perfusion (GABA(B) agonist; 100 mu M) inhibited the local GLU and GABA stress responses. Taken together, these findings implicate PFC GABA interneurons in processing stressful stimuli, showing that local D-1, D-2, and GABA(B) receptor-mediated changes in PFC GABA transmission play a crucial role in the interhemispheric regulation of GLU stress responsivity.

Emerging evidence suggests a critical role for the lateral habenula (LHb) in the aversive response to various drugs, including ethanol. We previously showed that ethanol enhances glutamatergic transmission and stimulates LHb neurons. GABAergic transmission, a major target of ethanol in many brain regions, also tightly regulates LHb activity. This study assessed the action of ethanol on LHb GABAergic transmission in rat brain slices. Application of ethanol accelerated spontaneous action potential firing of LHb neurons, and LHb activity was increased by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine, and ethanol induced acceleration of LHb firing was further increased by gabazine. Additionally, ethanol potentiated GABAergic transmission (inhibitory postsynaptic currents, IPSCs) with an EC50 of 1.5 mM. Ethanol induced potentiation of IPSCs was increased by a GABA(B) receptor antagonist; it was mimicked by dopamine, dopamine receptor agonists, and dopamine reuptake blocker, and was completely prevented by reserpine, which depletes store of catecholamine. Moreover, ethanol-induced potentiation of IPSCs involved CAMP signaling. Finally, ethanol enhanced simultaneously glutamatergic and GABAergic transmissions to the majority of LHb neurons: the potentiation of the former being greater than that of the latter, the net effect was increased firing. Since LHb excitation may contribute to aversion, ethanol induced potentiation of GABAergic inhibition tends to reduce aversion. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mediterranean-type diet and brain structural change from 73 to 76 years in a Scottish cohort	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							FOOD-FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE; CORTICAL THICKNESS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; OLD-AGE; DISEASE; INTELLIGENCE; INFLAMMATION; METAANALYSIS; ADHERENCE; VALIDITY	Objective: To assess the association betweenMediterranean-type diet (MeDi) and change in brain MRI volumetric measures and mean cortical thickness across a 3-year period in older age (73-76 years). Methods: We focused on 2 longitudinal brain volumes (total and gray matter; n = 401 and 398, respectively) plus a longitudinal measurement of cortical thickness (n = 323), for which the previous cross-sectional evidence of an association with the MeDi was strongest. Adherence to the MeDi was calculated from data gathered from a food frequency questionnaire at age 70, 3 years prior to the baseline imaging data collection. Results: In regression models adjusting for relevant demographic and physical health indicators, we found that lower adherence to the MeDi was associated with greater 3-year reduction in total brain volume (explaining 0.5% of variance, p < 0.05). This effect was half the size of the largest covariate effect (i.e., age). Cross-sectional associations between MeDi and baseline MRI measures in 562 participants were not significant. Targeted analyses of meat and fish consumption did not replicate previous associations with total brain volume or total gray matter volume. Conclusions: Lower adherence to the MeDi in an older Scottish cohort is predictive of total brain atrophy over a 3-year interval. Fish and meat consumption does not drive this change, suggesting that other components of the MeDi or, possibly, all of its components in combination are responsible for the association.

Therefore, evaluating older adults ability to maintain balance and examining new approaches to counteract age-related decline in balance control is of great importance for fall prevention and healthy aging. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been shown to beneficially influence motor behavior and motor learning. In the present study, we investigated the influence of tDCS applied over the leg area of the primary motor cortex (M1) on balance task learning of healthy elderly in a dynamic balance task (DBT). In total, 30 older adults were enrolled in a cross-sectional, randomized design including two consecutive DBT training sessions. Only during the first DBT session, either 20 min of anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) or sham tDCS (s-tDCS) were applied and learning improvement was compared between the two groups. Our data showed that both groups successfully learned to perform the DBT on both training sessions. Interestingly, between-group analyses revealed no difference between the a-tDCS and the s-tDCS group regarding their level of task learning. These results indicate that the concurrent application of tDCS over M-1 leg area did not elicit DBT learning enhancement in our study cohort. However, a regression analysis revealed that DBT performance can be predicted by the kinematic profile of the movement, a finding that may provide new insights for individualized approaches of treating balance and gait disorders.

RNAseq profiling of primary microglia and astrocyte cultures in near-term ovine fetus: A glial in vivo-in vitro multi-hit paradigm in large mammalian brain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Fetus; Brain; Microglia; Astrocytes; LPS; in vitro; in vivo; Primary culture; RNAseq	WHITE-MATTER INJURY; ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS; FETAL; INFLAMMATION; ALIGNMENT; SYSTEMS; TOOL	Background: The chronically instrumented fetal sheep is a widely used animal model to study fetal brain development in health and disease, but no methods exist yet to interrogate dedicated brain cell populations to identify their molecular and genomic phenotype. For example, the molecular mechanisms whereby microglia or astrocytes contribute to inflammation in the brain remain incompletely understood. New method: Here we present a protocol to derive primary pure microglial or astrocyte cultures from near -term fetal sheep brain, after the animals have been chronically instrumented and studied in vivo. Next, we present the implementation of whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) pipeline to deeper elucidate the phenotype of such primary sheep brain glial cultures. Results: We validate the new primary cultures method for cell purity and test the function of the glial cells on protein (IL-1 beta) and transcriptome (RNAseq) levels in response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in vitro. Comparison with existing methods: This method represents the first implementation of pure microglial or astrocytes cultures in fetal sheep brain. Conclusions: The presented approach opens new possibilities for testing not only supernatant protein levels in response to an in vitro challenge, but also to evaluate changes in the transcriptome of glial cells derived from a large mammalian brain bearing high resemblance to the human brain. Moreover, the presented approach lends itself to modeling the complex multi-hit paradigms of antenatal and perinatal cerebral insults in vivo and in vitro. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Naming unique entities in the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia and Alzheimer's disease: Towards a better understanding of the semantic impairment	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Naming; Semantically unique entities; Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia; Alzheimer's disease; Semantics; Lexical access	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; FAMOUS FACES; PROPER-NAMES; DEMENTIA; ANOMIA; LANDMARKS; PEOPLE; AGE; PROSOPANOMIA	While the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) is characterized by a predominant semantic memory impairment, episodic memory impairments are the clinical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, AD patients also present with semantic deficits, which are more severe for semantically unique entities (e.g. a famous person) than for common concepts (e.g. a beaver). Previous studies in these patient populations have largely focused on famous-person naming. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate if these impairments also extend to other semantically unique entities such as famous places and famous logos. In this study, 13 AD patients, 9 svPPA patients, and 12 cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects (CTRL) were tested with a picture-naming test of non-unique entities (Boston Naming Test) and three experimental tests of semantically unique entities assessing naming of famous persons, places, and logos. Both clinical groups were overall more impaired at naming semantically unique entities than non-unique entities. Naming impairments in AD and svPPA extended to the other types of semantically unique entities, since a CTRL > AD > svPPA pattern was found on the performance of all naming tests. Naming famous places and famous persons appeared to be most impaired in svPPA, and both specific and general semantic knowledge for these entities were affected in these patients. Although AD patients were most significantly impaired on famous-person naming, only their specific semantic knowledge was impaired, while general knowledge was preserved. Post-hoc neuroimaging analyses also showed that famous-person naming impairments in AD correlated with atrophy in the temporoparietal junction, a region functionally associated with lexical access. In line with previous studies, svPPA patients' impairment in both naming and semantic knowledge suggest a more profound semantic impairment, while naming impairments in AD may arise to a greater extent from impaired lexical access, even though semantic impairment for specific knowledge is also present. These results highlight the critical importance of developing and using a variety of semantically-unique-entity naming tests in neuropsychological assessments of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, which may unveil different patterns of lexical-semantic deficits.

Our goals was to determine whether dopaminergic medication improves preplanned and unplanned walking turns in individuals with PD, compared to healthy controls. Nineteen older adults with mild-to-moderate PD and 17 healthy controls performed one of the following three tasks, presented randomly: walking straight, or walking and turning 180 to the right or left. The walking direction was visually cued before starting to walk (preplanned) or after (unplanned, i.e., 0.6 m before reaching the turning point). Subjects with PD were assessed off dopaminergic medication (OFF) and on dopaminergic medication (ON) medication. Turning strategy (step and spin turns), turning performance (turning distance and body rotation) and walking pattern were analyzed for three turning steps. Irrespective of medication state and turning condition, step and spin turns followed a nearly 50:50 distribution. After intake of dopaminergic medication, subjects with PD increased their turning distance but not the amount of body rotation or their walking pattern. Compared to controls, turning impairments in subjects with PD remained while ON medication and problems regulating step width were the most prominent features of their walking pattern. Specifically, subjects with PD turned with narrower cross-over steps, i.e. when the external foot crossed over the line of progression of the internal leg. We conclude that turning impairments remained even after dopaminergic medication and problems modulating step width appears to be a critical feature for turning in PD. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Methods This retrospective study, based on a previous quantitative analysis in the Griffon Bruxellois (GB), used 24 measurements taken on 130 T1-weighted MRI of hindbrain and cervical region. Associated brachycephaly was estimated using 26 measurements, including rostral forebrain flattening and olfactory lobe rotation, on 72 T2-weighted MRI of the whole brain. Both study cohorts were divided into three groups; Control, CM pain and SM and their morphometries compared with each other. Results Fourteen significant traits were identified in the hindbrain study and nine traits in the whole brain study, six of which were similar to the GB and suggest a common aetiology. The Control cohort had the most elliptical brain (p = 0.010), least olfactory bulb rotation (p = 0.003) and a protective angle (p = 0.004) compared to the other groups. The CM pain cohort had the greatest rostral forebrain flattening (p = 0.007), shortest basioccipital (p = 0.019), but a greater distance between the atlas and basioccipital (p = 0.002) which was protective for SM. The SM cohort had two conformation anomalies depending on the severity of craniocervical junction incongruities; i) the proximity of the dens (p < 0.001) ii) increased airorhynchy with a smaller, more ventrally rotated olfactory bulb (p < 0.001). Both generated 'concertina' flexures of the brain and craniocervical junction. Conclusion Morphometric mapping provides a diagnostic tool for quantifying symptomatic CM, secondary SM and their relationship with brachycephaly. It is hypothesized that CM pain is associated with increased brachycephaly and SM can result from different combinations of abnormalities of the forebrain, caudal fossa and craniocervical junction which compromise the neural parenchyma and impede cerebrospinal fluid flow.

Cortical Correlates of the Auditory Frequency-Following and Onset Responses: EEG and fMRI Evidence	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory cognition; EEG; fMRI; frequency-following response; onset response; spectrotemporal processing	BRAIN-STEM RESPONSE; PITCH PERCEPTION; HESCHLS GYRUS; COMPLEX TONES; CORTEX; SPEECH; MUSICIANS; HUMANS; REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION	The frequency-following response (FFR) is a measure of the brain's periodic sound encoding. It is of increasing importance for studying the human auditory nervous system due to numerous associations with auditory cognition and dysfunction. Although the FFR is widely interpreted as originating from brainstem nuclei, a recent study using MEG suggested that there is also a right-lateralized contribution from the auditory cortex at the fundamental frequency (Coffey et al., 2016b). Our objectives in the present work were to validate and better localize this result using a completely different neuroimaging modality and to document the relationships between the FFR, the onset response, and cortical activity. Using a combination of EEG, fMRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging, we show that activity in the right auditory cortex is related to individual differences in FFR-fundamental frequency (f(0)) strength, a finding that was replicated with two independent stimulus sets, with and without acoustic energy at the fundamental frequency. We demonstrate a dissociation between this FFR-f(0)-sensitive response in the right and an area in left auditory cortex that is sensitive to individual differences in the timing of initial response to sound onset. Relationships to timing and their lateralization are supported by parallels in the microstructure of the underlying white matter, implicating a mechanism involving neural conduction efficiency. These data confirm that the FFR has a cortical contribution and suggest ways in which auditory neuroscience may be advanced by connecting early sound representation to measures of higher-level sound processing and cognitive function.

The neural circuit mechanism underlying this selectivity is still unclear, but some studies have proposed that it emerges from spatial nonlinearities of subcortical Y cells. To understand how inputs from the Y-cell pathway might be pooled to generate cue-invariant receptive fields, we recorded visual responses from single neurons in cat Area 18 using linear multielectrode arrays. We measured responses to drifting and contrast-reversing luminance gratings as well as contrast modulation gratings. We found that a large fraction of these neurons have nonoriented responses to gratings, similar to those of subcortical Y cells: they respond at the second harmonic (F2) to high-spatial frequency contrast-reversing gratings and at the first harmonic (F1) to low-spatial frequency drifting gratings ("Y-cell signature"). For a given neuron, spatial frequency tuning for linear (F1) and nonlinear (F2) responses is quite distinct, similar to orientation-selective cue-invariant neurons. Also, these neurons respond to contrast modulation gratings with selectivity for the carrier (texture) spatial frequency and, in some cases, orientation. Their receptive field properties suggest that they could serve as building blocks for orientation-selective cue-invariant neurons. We propose a circuit model that combines ON- and OFF-center cortical Y-like cells in an unbalanced push-pull manner to generate orientation-selective, cue-invariant receptive fields.

In the present study, we found that ALCAM knockout (KO) mice developed a more severe myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The exacerbated disease was associated with a significant increase in the number of CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory leukocytes compared with WT controls. Passive EAE transfer experiments suggested that the pathophysiology observed in active EAE was linked to the absence of ALCAM on BBB-ECs. In addition, phenotypic characterization of unimmunized ALCAM KO mice revealed a reduced expression of BBB junctional proteins. Further in vivo, in vitro, and molecular analysis confirmed that ALCAM is associated with tight junction molecule assembly at the BBB, explaining the increased permeability of CNS blood vessels in ALCAM KO animals. Collectively, our data point to a biologically important function of ALCAM in maintaining BBB integrity.

In mammals, it is believed that the CMZ lacks neurogenic potential and that the retina develops from one pool of nnultipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Here we identify a population of Msx1-expressing progenitors in the mouse CMZ that is both molecularly and functionally distinct from RPCs. Using genetic lineage tracing, we report that Msx1 progenitors have unique developmental properties compared with RPCs. Msx1 lineages contain both neural retina and non-neural ciliary epithelial progenies and overall generate fewer photoreceptors than classical RPC lineages. Furthermore, we show that the endocytic adaptor protein Numb regulates the balance between neural and non-neural fates in Msx1 progenitors. These results uncover a population of CMZ progenitors, distinct from classical RPCs, that also contributes to mammalian retinogenesis.

Thus far, the endoproteases involved in CCK processing include cathepsin L and the prohormone convertases (PC) 1, 2, and 5. This study finds that PC7 is also critical for normal production of CCK in specific areas of the brain. Loss of PC7 results in decreased levels of CCK in more brain regions than any other endoprotease studied to date. Substantial decreases in brain levels of CCK are found in the prefrontal, frontal, parietal-insular-pyriform, and temporal cortex, caudate-putamen, basal forebrain, thalamus, hippocampus, septum, and medulla of PC7 knock-out (KO) mice. A tissue-specific sexual dimorphism of PC7 activity was also identified. This is the first report that loss of PC7 alters levels of a neuropeptide in the brain. This loss of PC7 and CCK may independently contribute to the decrease in Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor production and be partially responsible for the learning and memory defects observed in mice that lack PC7.

Given that network changes occur at early (presymptomatic) stages, we explored whether alterations of interneurons also occur before amyloid-beta (4) accumulation. Numbers of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive (IR) cells were decreased in the hippocampus of 1 month-old TgCRND8 mouse AD model in a sub-regionally specific manner. The most prominent change observed was a decrease in the number of PV-IR cells that selectively affected CA1/2 and subiculum, with the pyramidal layer (PY) of CA1/2 accounting almost entirely for the reduction in number of hippocampal PV-IR cells. As PV neurons were decreased selectively in CA1/2 and subiculum, and given that they are critically involved in the control of hippocampal theta oscillations, we then assessed intrinsic theta oscillations in these regions after a 4-aminopyridine (4AP) challenge. This revealed increased theta power and population bursts in TgCRND8 mice compared to non-transgenic (nTg) controls, suggesting a hyperexcitability network state. Taken together, our results identify for the first time AD related alterations in hippocampal interneuron function as early as at 1 month of age. These early functional alterations occurring before amyloid deposition may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in AD.

ORATORIO Clinical Investigators	Ocrelizumab versus Placebo in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							DOUBLE-BLIND; MULTICENTER TRIAL; CANCER-RISK; CD20; DEMYELINATION; PATHOLOGY; ANTIBODY; DAMAGE	BACKGROUND An evolving understanding of the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis suggests that depleting B cells could be useful for treatment. We studied ocrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively depletes CD20-expressing B cells, in the primary progressive form of the disease. METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 732 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis in a 2: 1 ratio to receive intravenous ocrelizumab (600 mg) or placebo every 24 weeks for at least 120 weeks and until a prespecified number of confirmed disability progression events had occurred. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks in a time-to-event analysis. RESULTS The percentage of patients with 12-week confirmed disability progression was 32.9% with ocrelizumab versus 39.3% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.98; P=0.03). The percentage of patients with 24-week confirmed disability progression was 29.6% with ocrelizumab versus 35.7% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.98; P=0.04). By week 120, performance on the timed 25-foot walk worsened by 38.9% with ocrelizumab versus 55.1% with placebo (P=0.04); the total volume of brain lesions on T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) decreased by 3.4% with ocrelizumab and increased by 7.4% with placebo (P<0.001); and the percentage of brain-volume loss was 0.90% with ocrelizumab versus 1.09% with placebo (P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the change in the Physical Component Summary score of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Infusion-related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and oral herpes infections were more frequent with ocrelizumab than with placebo. Neoplasms occurred in 2.3% of patients who received ocrelizumab and in 0.8% of patients who received placebo; there was no clinically significant difference between groups in the rates of serious adverse events and serious infections. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, ocrelizumab was associated with lower rates of clinical and MRI progression than placebo. Extended observation is required to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of ocrelizumab. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche; ORATORIO ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01194570.)	[Wolinsky, J.

Here, we present a cost-effective and versatile methodology for the analysis of DNA methylation in targeted genomic regions, which comprises multiplexed, PCR-based preparation of bisulfite DNA libraries followed by customized MiSeq sequencing. Results: Using bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite conversion of DNA, we have performed multiplexed targeted sequencing to analyse several kilobases of genomic DNA in up to 478 samples, and achieved high coverage data of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine at single-base resolution. Our results demonstrate the ability of this methodology to detect all levels of cytosine modifications at greater than 100x coverage in large sample sets at low cost compared to other targeted methods. Conclusions: This approach can be applied to multiple settings, from candidate gene to clinical studies, and is especially useful for validation of differentially methylated or hydroxymethylated regions following whole-genome analyses.

Association between work time loss and quality of life in patients with Herpes Zoster: a pooled analysis of the MASTER studies	HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES			English	Article						Herpes Zoster; Quality of life; Work; Observational study	HEALTH-CARE UTILIZATION; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; PAIN; BURDEN; PANEL; MEDICINE; IMPACT; INCOME; STATE	Background: Herpes zoster (HZ) has a significant negative effect on the productive work life of individuals, and has been shown to be responsible for cases of absenteeism, presenteeism and decreased work effectiveness. The aim of this study was to evaluate health utility scores and associated predictors in an actively employed population of Herpes Zoster (HZ) patients with and without work time loss (WTL). Methods: This was a pooled analysis of the prospective, observational MASTER cohort studies, conducted in 8 countries across North America, Latin America and Asia. A total of 428 HZ patients engaged in full or part time work were included. WTL, defined as missing >= 1 partial or full work day, and work effectiveness, reported on a scale of 0-100%, were evaluated with the Work and Productivity Questionnaire (WPQ). The Pearson product-moment correlation was used to assess the correlation between work effectiveness and HRQoL. Mixed models with repeated measures assessed the relationship between HZ-related WTL over a 6-month follow-up period, and HRQoL, as evaluated by the EQ-5D. Additional predictors of HRQoL were also identified. Results: Overall, 57.7% of respondents reported WTL. Mean (SD) percent work effectiveness of patients in the WTL group was significantly lower compared to non-WTL (NWTL) patients at baseline [50.3 (31.6) vs. 71.4 (27.8); p < 0.001]. Patients in the WTL group also reported lower health utility scores at baseline and overall than their NWTL counterparts, with WTL identified as an independent negative predictor of both the EQ-5D summary scores and the EQ-5D VAS (p < 0.001). Decrease in work effectiveness was negatively associated with HRQoL overall (p < 0.001). Predictors of lower HRQoL were worst Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) pain score, the presence of HZ complications and country income (predictor of EQ-5D VAS only). Conclusions: HZ adversely impacts the work and productive life of actively employed individuals. In turn, HZ-related reductions in work effectiveness and work time are associated with a negative effect on HRQoL.

Post-stroke dementia - a comprehensive review	BMC MEDICINE			English	Review						Cognitive impairment; Dementia; Definitions and classification; Diagnosis; Neuroimaging; Interventions; Biomarkers; Stroke	TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK; VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SMALL-VESSEL DISEASE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; LIFE-STYLE INTERVENTIONS; ACE-I/D POLYMORPHISM; OF-THE-LITERATURE; STROKE PATIENTS; ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; METHODOLOGICAL FACTORS	Post-stroke dementia (PSD) or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) may affect up to one third of stroke survivors. Various definitions of PSCI and PSD have been described. We propose PSD as a label for any dementia following stroke in temporal relation. Various tools are available to screen and assess cognition, with few PSD-specific instruments. Choice will depend on purpose of assessment, with differing instruments needed for brief screening (e.g., Montreal Cognitive Assessment) or diagnostic formulation (e.g., NINDS VCI battery). A comprehensive evaluation should include assessment of pre-stroke cognition (e.g., using Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly), mood (e.g., using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and functional consequences of cognitive impairments (e.g., using modified Rankin Scale). A large number of biomarkers for PSD, including indicators for genetic polymorphisms, biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the serum, inflammatory mediators, and peripheral microRNA profiles have been proposed. Currently, no specific biomarkers have been proven to robustly discriminate vulnerable patients ('at risk brains') from those with better prognosis or to discriminate Alzheimer's disease dementia from PSD. Further, neuroimaging is an important diagnostic tool in PSD. The role of computerized tomography is limited to demonstrating type and location of the underlying primary lesion and indicating atrophy and severe white matter changes. Magnetic resonance imaging is the key neuroimaging modality and has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting pathological changes, including small vessel disease. Advanced multi-modal imaging includes diffusion tensor imaging for fiber tracking, by which changes in networks can be detected. Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow and metabolism by positron emission tomography can differentiate between vascular dementia and degenerative dementia and show the interaction between vascular and metabolic changes. Additionally, inflammatory changes after ischemia in the brain can be detected, which may play a role together with amyloid deposition in the development of PSD. Prevention of PSD can be achieved by prevention of stroke. As treatment strategies to inhibit the development and mitigate the course of PSD, lowering of blood pressure, statins, neuroprotective drugs, and anti-inflammatory agents have all been studied without convincing evidence of efficacy. Lifestyle interventions, physical activity, and cognitive training have been recently tested, but large controlled trials are still missing.

Arfan			Novel genetic loci associated with hippocampal volume	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; COMMON VARIANTS; BRAIN-REGIONS; MEMORY; SUBFIELDS; METAANALYSIS	The hippocampal formation is a brain structure integrally involved in episodic memory, spatial navigation, cognition and stress responsiveness. Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200 kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (r(g) = -0.155). Our findings suggest novel biological pathways through which human genetic variation influences hippocampal volume and risk for neuropsychiatric illness.

Methods: This study comprised 30 hospitalized patients (age 29.1 +/- 6 13.5 years) in the acute phase of moderate or severe TBI. Testing started 21.0 +/- 6 13.7 days postinjury. Consciousness level and cognitive functioning were assessed daily with the Rancho Los Amigos scale of cognitive functioning (RLA). Sleep and wake cycle characteristics were estimated with continuous wrist actigraphy. Mixed model analyses were performed on 233 days with the RLA (fixed effect) and sleep-wake variables (random effects). Linear contrast analyses were performed in order to verify if consolidation of the sleep and wake states improved linearly with increasing RLA score. Results: Associations were found between scores on the consciousness/cognitive functioning scale and measures of sleep-wake cycle consolidation (p < 0.001), nighttime sleep duration (p = 0.018), and nighttime fragmentation index (p < 0.001). These associations showed strong linear relationships (p, 0.01 for all), revealing that consciousness and cognition improved in parallel with sleep-wake quality. Consolidated 24-hour sleep-wake cycle occurred when patients were able to give context-appropriate, goal-directed responses. Conclusions: Our results showed that when the brain has not sufficiently recovered a certain level of consciousness, it is also unable to generate a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle and consolidated nighttime sleep. This study contributes to elucidating the pathophysiology of severe sleepwake cycle alterations in the acute phase of moderate to severe TBI.

GeoSentinel Surveillance Network	Travel-Associated Zika Virus Disease Acquired in the Americas Through February 2016 A GeoSentinel Analysis	ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article							VECTOR-BORNE TRANSMISSION; MALE SEXUAL TRANSMISSION; UPDATE INTERIM GUIDANCE; GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; UNITED-STATES; INFECTION; SURVEILLANCE; REPELLENTS; EXPOSURE; BRAZIL	Background: Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas and has been imported into many nonendemic countries by travelers. Objective: To describe clinical manifestations and epidemiology of Zika virus disease in travelers exposed in the Americas. Design: Descriptive, using GeoSentinel records. Setting: 63 travel and tropical medicine clinics in 30 countries. Patients: Ill returned travelers with a confirmed, probable, or clinically suspected diagnosis of Zika virus disease seen between January 2013 and 29 February 2016. Measurements: Frequencies of demographic, trip, and clinical characteristics and complications. Results: Starting in May 2015, 93 cases of Zika virus disease were reported. Common symptoms included exanthema (88%), fever (76%), and arthralgia (72%). Fifty-nine percent of patients were exposed in South America; 71% were diagnosed in Europe. Case status was established most commonly by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of blood and less often by PCR testing of other body fluids or serology and plaque-reduction neutralization testing. Two patients developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, and 3 of 4 pregnancies had adverse outcomes (microcephaly, major fetal neurologic abnormalities, and intrauterine fetal death). Limitation: Surveillance data collected by specialized clinics may not be representative of all ill returned travelers, and denominator data are unavailable. Conclusion: These surveillance data help characterize the clinical manifestations and adverse outcomes of Zika virus disease among travelers infected in the Americas and show a need for global standardization of diagnostic testing. The serious fetal complications observed in this study highlight the importance of travel advisories and prevention measures for pregnant women and their partners. Travelers are sentinels for global Zika virus circulation and may facilitate further transmission.

Cascade-based short-term forecasting method of the electric demand of HVAC system	ENERGY			English	Article						Multistep forecasting; Demand response; Data mining; Measurements; HVAC system	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; SELECTION; FRAMEWORK; LOADS	This paper presents a multi-step-ahead forecasting method of the electric demand in a large institutional building to be used in the context of demand response control strategy. A cascade-based method is proposed for electric demand forecasting of the cooling system over the next six hours with a time-step of 15 min. Data mining techniques are used for pre-processing the measurements and improving the forecasting models. Data-driven models are developed by using Building Automation System (BAS) trend data of an existing building. First, the air flow rate supplied by the Air Handling Units (AHUs) is forecasted, followed by the cooling coils load, and the whole building cooling load. Finally, the electric demand of the supply fans, chillers and cooling towers, and the total electric demand of the cooling system of the building are forecasted over six hours. The comparison of the forecasted electric demand of the cooling system for the existing building over the six-hour test and the measurements show good agreement with CV(RMSE) of 14.2-22.5%.

This ratio provides a measure of the myelin thickness that complements axon morphology (diameter and density) for assessment of demyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Previous work has shown that an aggregate g-ratio map can be computed using a formula that combines axon and myelin density measured with quantitative MM. In this work, we computed g-ratio weighted maps in the cervical spinal cord of nine healthy subjects. We utilized the 300 mT/m gradients from the CONNECTOM scanner to estimate the fraction of restricted water (fr) with high accuracy, using the CHARMED model. Myelin density was estimated using the lipid and macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) method, derived from normalized proton density (PD) mapping. The variability across spinal level, laterality and subject were assessed using a three-way ANOVA. The average g-ratio value obtained in the white matter was 0.76+/-0.03, consistent with previous histology work. Coefficients of variation of fr and MTV were respectively 4.3% and 13.7%. fr and myelin density were significantly different across spinal tracts (p=3x10(-7) and 0.004 respectively) and were positively correlated in the white matter (r=0.42), suggesting shared microstructural information. The aggregate g-ratio did not show significant differences across tracts (p=0.6). This study suggests that fr and myelin density can be measured in vivo with high precision and that they can be combined to produce a g-ratio-weighted map robust to free water pool contamination from cerebrospinal fluid or veins. Potential applications include the study of early demyelination in multiple sclerosis, and the quantitative assessment of remyelination drugs.

These software packages are now routinely used by researchers and clinicians, and have contributed to important breakthroughs for the understanding of brain anatomy and function. However, no software package exists to process mpMRI data of the spinal cord. Despite the numerous clinical needs for such advanced mpMRI protocols (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, etc.), researchers have been developing specific tools that, while necessary, do not provide an integrative framework that is compatible with most usages and that is capable of reaching the community at large. This hinders cross-validation and the possibility to perform multi-center studies. In this study we introduce the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), a comprehensive software dedicated to the processing of spinal cord MRI data. SCT builds on previously-validated methods and includes state-of-the-art MM templates and atlases of the spinal cord, algorithms to segment and register new data to the templates, and motion correction methods for diffusion and functional time series. SCT is tailored towards standardization and automation of the processing pipeline, versatility, modularity, and it follows guidelines of software development and distribution. Preliminary applications of SCT cover a variety of studies, from cross-sectional area measures in large databases of patients, to the precise quantification of mpMRI metrics in specific spinal pathways.

The spatial resolution is often assumed to be poor, because of the ill-posed nature of MEG source modeling. However, the question of spatial resolution in MEG has seldom been studied in quantitative detail. Here we use the well-known retinotopic organization of the primary visual cortex (V1) as a benchmark for estimating the spatial resolution of MEG source imaging. Using a standard visual stimulation paradigm in human subjects, we find that individual MEG sources exhibit well-delineated visual receptive fields that collectively follow the known mapping of the retinal surface onto the cortex. Based on the size of these receptive fields and the variability of the signal, we are able to resolve MEG signals separated by approximately 7 mm in smooth regions of cortex and less than 1 mm for signals near curved gyri. The maximum resolution is thus comparable to that of the spacing of hypercolumns in human visual cortex. Overall, our results suggest that the spatial resolution of MEG can approach or in some cases exceed that of fMRI.

Kinematic gait parameters are highly sensitive measures of motor deficits and spinal cord injury in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Disease progressive; Demyelination; Functional recovery; Gait	EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS PATIENTS; ACTIVATED RECEPTOR-GAMMA; MOUSE MODEL; C57BL/6 MICE; NEUROLOGICAL DISABILITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; ANIMAL-MODEL; STEM-CELLS	The preclinical selection of therapeutic candidates for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) would be aided by the development of sensitive behavioural measures that accurately reflect the impact of auto-immunemediated spinal cord damage on locomotion. Neurological deficits in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are typically scored using a clinical scale with 5-10 levels of increased disease severity. This ordinal scale represents a general impression of paralysis and impaired gait. By contrast, kinematic gait analyses generate ratio level data that have frequently been used to characterize walking deficits for MS patients and test the efficacy of treatments designed to improve them. Despite these advantages, kinematic gait analyses have not been systematically applied to the study of walking deficits for EAE mice. We have therefore used high speed video recordings (250 frames/s) of EAE mice walking on a treadmill to measure 8 kinematic parameters in the sagittal plane: average hip height (1), average toe height during swing (2), and average angle and range of motion for the hip (3-4), knee (5-6) and ankle (7-8). Kinematic measures of hip, knee and ankle movements were found to be early detectors of impaired locomotion for mice with mild EAE (median clinical score = 1.0 at day post-immunization 26; DPI 26). These deficits occurred in the absence of reduced rotarod performance with impaired hip and knee movements observed 3 days before disease onset as determined by clinical scores. Gait deficits for mild EAE mice were minor and often recovered fully by DPI 30. By contrast, severe EAE mice (median clinical score = 2.5 at DPI 26) displayed much larger movement impairments for the knee and ankle that failed to completely recover by DPI 44. Moreover, impaired ankle movement was highly correlated with white matter loss in the spinal cords of EAE mice (r=0.96). Kinematic analyses therefore yield highly sensitive measures of motor deficits that predict spinal cord injury in EAE mice. These behavioural techniques should assist the selection of promising therapeutic candidates for clinical testing in progressive MS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Objectives: We aimed to describe structural and functional changes in PD. Methods: Sixty-six patients with PD (57.94 +/- 10.25 years) diagnosed according to the UK Brain Bank criteria were included. We performed a whole brain analysis using voxel-based morphometry (VBM-SPM 8 software), cortical thickness (CT) using CIVET, and resting-state fMRI using the Neuroimaging Analysis Kit software to compare patients and controls. For VBM and CT we classified subjects into three groups according to disease severity: mild PD [Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY) 1-1.5], moderate PD (HY 2-2.5), and severe PD (HY 3-5). Results: We observed gray matter atrophy in the insula and inferior frontal gyrus in the moderate PD and in the insula, frontal gyrus, putamen, cingulated, and paracingulate gyri in the severe groups. In the CT analysis, in mild PD, cortical thinning was restricted to the superior temporal gyrus, gyrus rectus, and olfactory cortex; in the moderate group, the postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, and inferior frontal gyrus were also affected; in the severe PD, areas such as the precentral and postentral gyrus, temporal pole, fusiform, and occipital gyrus had reduced cortical thinning. We observed altered connectivity at the default mode, visual, sensorimotor, and cerebellar networks. Conclusion: Subjects with mild symptoms already have cortical involvement; however, further cerebral involvement seems to follow Braak's proposed mechanism. Similar regions are affected both structurally and functionally. We believe the combination of different MRI techniques may be useful in evaluating progressive brain involvement and they may eventually be used as surrogate markers of disease progression.

On the basis of rational ligand design, a new class of selective antagonists, represented by (2S,4R)-4-(2-carbox-yphenoxy)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (lb), for cloned homomeric kainic acid receptors subtype 1 (GluK1) was attained (K-i = 4 mu M). In a functional assay, lb displayed full antagonist activity with IC50 = 6 +/- 2 mu M. A cryatal structure was obtained of lb when bound in the ligand binding domain of GluKI. A domain opening of 13-14 degrees was seen compared to the structure with glutamate, consistent with 113 being an antagonist. A structure-activity relationship study showed that the chemical nature of the tethering atom (C, O, or S) linking the pyrrolidine ring and the phenyl ring plays a key role in the receptor selectivity profile and that substituents on the phenyl ring are well accommodated by the GluK1 receptor.

People with Parkinsons disease (PD) often present gait disturbances, which can be reduced when PD patients engage in different types of physical exercise (PE), such as walking on a treadmill. Similarly, PE has also been found to improve executive functions in this population. Yet, no exercise intervention investigated simultaneously gait and non-motor symptoms (executive functions, motor learning) in PD patients. <bold>Objective:</bold> To assess the impact of aerobic exercise training (AET) using a stationary bicycle on a set of gait parameters (walking speed, cadence, step length, step width, single and double support time, as well as variability of step length, step width and double support time) and executive functions (cognitive inhibition and flexibility) in sedentary PD patients and healthy controls. <bold>Methods:</bold> Two groups, 19 PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr =2) and 20 healthy adults, matched on age and sedentary level, followed a 3-month stationary bicycle AET regimen. <bold>Results:</bold> Aerobic capacity, as well as performance of motor learning and on cognitive inhibition, increased significantly in both groups after the training regimen, but only PD patients improved their walking speed and cadence (all p < 0.05; with no change in the step length). Moreover, in PD patients, training-related improvements in aerobic capacity correlated positively with improvements in walking speed (r = 0.461, p < 0.05). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> AET using stationary bicycle can independently improve gait and cognitive inhibition in sedentary PD patients. Given that increases in walking speed were obtained through increases in cadence, with no change in step length, our findings suggest that gait improvements are specific to the type of motor activity practiced during exercise (i.e., pedaling). In contrast, the improvements seen in cognitive inhibition were, most likely, not specific to the type of training and they could be due to indirect action mechanisms (i.e., improvement of cardiovascular capacity). These results are also relevant for the development of targeted AET interventions to improve functional autonomy in PD patients	[Nadeau, Alexandra; Lungu, Ovidiu; Duchesne, Catherine; Robillard, Marie-Eve; Bore, Arnaud; Bobeuf, Florian; Lafontaine, Anne-Louise; Bherer, Louis; Doyon, Julien] Univ Inst Geriatr Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nadeau, Alexandra; Lungu, Ovidiu; Duchesne, Catherine; Robillard, Marie-Eve; Bore, Arnaud; Lafontaine, Anne-Louise; Doyon, Julien] Funct Neuroimaging Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nadeau, Alexandra; Duchesne, Catherine; Doyon, Julien] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lungu, Ovidiu] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lungu, Ovidiu] Donald Berman Maimonides Geriatr Ctr, Ctr Res Aging, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bobeuf, Florian; Bherer, Louis] Concordia Univ, PERFORM Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Plamondon, Rejean] Polytech Montreal, Dept Elect Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lafontaine, Anne-Louise] McGill Univ, McGill Movement Disorder Clin, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gheysen, Freja] Univ Ghent, Dept Movement & Sport Sci, Ghent, Belgium; [Bherer, Louis] Univ Montreal, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bherer, Louis] Montreal Heart Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Nadeau, A; Doyon, J (reprint author), Univ Inst Geriatr Montreal, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Nadeau, A; Doyon, J (reprint author), Funct Neuroimaging Unit, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Nadeau, A; Doyon, J (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.	alexandra.nadeau.3@umontreal.ca; julien.doyon@umontreal.ca			Parkinson Society Canada [2014-709]	The current study was supported by the Parkinson Society Canada (2014-709).		55	0	0	17	17	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1662-5161			FRONT HUM NEUROSCI	Front.

Growth hormone (GH) secretion from the pituitary regulates body growth and is controlled by Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. We observed that dietary restriction during the early postnatal period (i.e. lactation) in mice influences postnatal growth by permanently altering the development of the somatotropic axis in the pituitary gland. This alteration may be due to a lack of GHRH signaling during this critical developmental period. Indeed, underfed pups showed decreased insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) plasma levels, which are associated with lower innervation of the median eminence by GHRH axons at 10 days of age relative to normally fed pups. IGF-1 preferentially stimulated axon elongation of GHRH neurons in in vitro arcuate explant cultures from 7 day-old normally fed pups. This IGF-1 stimulating effect was selective since other arcuate neurons visualized concomitantly by neurofilament labeling, or AgRP immunochemistry, did not significantly respond to IGF-1 stimulation. Moreover, GHRH neurons in explants from age matched underfed pups lost the capacity to respond to IGF-1 stimulation. Molecular analyses indicated that nutritional restriction was associated with impaired activation of AKT. These results highlight a role for IGF-1 in axon elongation that appears to be cell selective and participates in the complex cellular mechanisms that link underfeeding during the early postnatal period with programming of the growth trajectory.

J	Voarino, N; Dubljevic, V; Racine, E				Voarino, Nathalie; Dubljevic, Veljko; Racine, Eric			tDCS for Memory Enhancement: Analysis of the Speculative Aspects of Ethical Issues	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						memory enhancement; cognitive enhancement; brain stimulation; tDCS; ethics	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT; HEALTHY-ADULTS; THINKING CAP; NEUROENHANCEMENT; DISEASE; SAFETY; PERSPECTIVES; COMMUNITY	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising technology to enhance cognitive and physical performance. One of the major areas of interest is the enhancement of memory function in healthy individuals. The early arrival of tDCS on the market for lifestyle uses and cognitive enhancement purposes lead to the voicing of some important ethical concerns, especially because, to date, there are no official guidelines or evaluation procedures to tackle these issues. The aim of this article is to review ethical issues related to uses of tDCS for memory enhancement found in the ethics and neuroscience literature and to evaluate how realistic and scientifically well-founded these concerns are? In order to evaluate how plausible or speculative each issue is, we applied the methodological framework described by Racine et al. (2014) for "informed and reflective" speculation in bioethics. This framework could be succinctly presented as requiring: (1) the explicit acknowledgment of factual assumptions and identification of the value attributed to them; (2) the validation of these assumptions with interdisciplinary literature; and (3) the adoption of a broad perspective to support more comprehensive reflection on normative issues. We identified four major considerations associated with the development of tDCS for memory enhancement: safety, autonomy, justice and authenticity. In order to assess the seriousness and likelihood of harm related to each of these concerns, we analyzed the assumptions underlying the ethical issues, and the level of evidence for each of them. We identified seven distinct assumptions: prevalence, social acceptance, efficacy, ideological stance (bioconservative vs. libertarian), potential for misuse, long term side effects, and the delivery of complete and clear information. We conclude that ethical discussion about memory enhancement via tDCS sometimes involves undue speculation, and closer attention to scientific and social facts would bring a more nuanced analysis. At this time, the most realistic concerns are related to safety and violation of users' autonomy by a breach of informed consent, as potential immediate and long-term health risks to private users remain unknown or not well defined. Clear and complete information about these risks must be provided to research participants and consumers of tDCS products or related services. Broader public education initiatives and warnings would also be worthwhile to reach those who are constructing their own tDCS devices.

The method introduces two approches to the identification of brain pathology related to amyloid accumulation, (1) a novel analysis of amyloid binding based of absolute cerebral blood flow indices (sCBF) from the early accumulation of the tracer in brain tissue. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that a change of cerebral blood flow is correlated with the degree of tracer [C-11]PiB retention, reflecting dendritic spine pathology and consequent inhibition of brain energy metabolism and reduction of blood flow by neurovascular coupling in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Previously reported images of [C-11]PiB retention in brain of 29 subject with cognitive impairment or dementia [16 Alzheimer's Disease (AD), eight subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), five patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), five patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 29 age-matched healthy control subjects (HC)], underwent analysis of PiB delivery and retention by means of WARM for quantitation of [C-11]PiB's binding potentials (BPND) and correlated surrogate cerebral blood flow (sCBF) estimates, based on the [C-11]PiB images, compared to estimates by conventional Standard Uptake Value Ration (SUVR) of [C-11]PiB retention with cerebellum gray matter as reference. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) revealed the power of discrimination among estimates. Results: For AD, the discriminatory power [C-11]PiB binding potential (BPND) by WARM exceeded the power of SUVR that in turn exceeded the power of sCBF estimates. Differences of [C-11]PiB binding and sCBF measures between AD and HC both were highly significant (p < 0.001). For all the dementia groups as a whole, sCBF estimates revealed the greatest discrimination between the patient and HC groups.WARM resolved a major issue of amyloid load quantification with [C-11]PiB in human brain by determining absolute sCBF and amyloid load measures from the same images. The two parameter approach provides key discriminary information in AD for which [C-11]PiC traditionally is used, as well as for the distinct flow deficits in FTLD, and the marked parietal and occipital lobe flow deficits in DLB. Conclusion: We conclude that WARM yields estimates of two important variables that together discriminate among patients with dementia, including AD, and healthy volunteers, with ROC that are superior to conventional methods of analysis. The distinction between estimates of flow and amyloid load from the same dynamic emission tomograms provides valuable pathogenetic information.

Experiments that produce abnormal activity or that systematically alter neural firing patterns during periods of circuit development strongly suggest that the specific patterns and the degree of correlation in firing may contribute in an instructive manner to circuit refinement. In fish and amphibians, unlike amniotic vertebrates, sensory input directly drives patterned activity during the period of initial projection outgrowth and innervation. Experiments combining sensory stimulation with live imaging, which can be performed non-invasively in these simple vertebrate models, have provided important insights into the mechanisms by which neurons read out and respond to activity patterns. This article reviews the classic and recent literature on spontaneous and evoked activity-dependent circuit refinement in sensory systems and formalizes a set of mechanistic rules for the transformation of patterned activity into accurate neuronal connectivity in the developing brain.

It is entrained by light but resistant to temperature shifts that entrain peripheral clocks [1-5]. The SCN expresses many functionally important neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which drives light entrainment, synchrony, and amplitude of SCN cellular clocks and organizes circadian behavior [5-16]. The transcription factor LHX1 drives SCN Vip expression, and cellular desynchrony in Lhx1-deficient SCN largely results from Vip loss [17, 18]. LHX1 regulates many genes other than Vip, yet activity rhythms in Lhx1-deficient mice are similar to Vip(-/-) mice under light-dark cycles and only somewhat worse in constant conditions. We suspected that LHX1 targets other than Vip have circadian functions overlooked in previous studies. In this study, we compared circadian sleep and temperature rhythms of Lhx1- and Vip-deficient mice and found loss of acute light control of sleep in Lhx1 but not Vip mutants. We also found loss of circadian resistance to fever in Lhx1 but not Vip mice, which was partially recapitulated by heat application to cultured Lhx1-deficient SCN. Having identified VIP-independent functions of LHX1, we mapped the VIP-independent transcriptional network downstream of LHX1 and a largely separable VIP-dependent transcriptional network. The VIP-independent network does not affect core clock amplitude and synchrony, unlike the VIP-dependent network. These studies identify Lhx1 as the first gene required for temperature resistance of the SCN clockworks and demonstrate that acute light control of sleep is routed through the SCN and its immediate output regions.

A behavioural and electrophysiological investigation of the effect of bilingualism on aging and cognitive control	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Aging; Bilingualism; Cognitive control; Event-related brain potentials (ERPs)	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; STROOP INTERFERENCE; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSES; MENTAL CHRONOMETRY; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; 2 LANGUAGES; SIMON TASK; ATTENTION; BRAIN	Given previous, but inconsistent, findings of language group differences on cognitive control tasks the current investigation examined whether such differences could be demonstrated in a sample of older bilingual adults. Monolingual and bilingual older adults performed three cognitive control tasks that have previously been used in the literature (i.e., Stroop, Simon and flanker tasks) while brain electrophysiological recordings took place. Both behavioural (response time and accuracy) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs; N2 and P3 amplitude and latency) were compared across the two language groups. Processing differences between monolinguals and bilinguals were identified for each task, although the locus differed across the tasks. Language group differences were most clear in the Stroop task, with bilinguals showing superior performance both behaviourally and electrophysiologically. In contrast, for the Simon and flanker tasks there were electrophysiological differences indicating language group processing differences at the level of conflict monitoring (Simon task only) and stimulus categorization (Simon and flanker tasks), but no behavioural differences. These findings support suggestions that these three tasks that are often used to examine executive control processes show little convergent validity; however, there are clear language group differences for each task that are suggestive of superior performance for bilinguals, with behavioural differences emerging only in the linguistic Stroop task. Furthermore, it is clear that behavioural measures alone do not capture the language group effects in their entirety, and perhaps processing differences between language groups are more marked in a sample of older adults who are experiencing age-related cognitive changes than in younger adults who are at the peak of their cognitive capacity.

Prevention has only been achieved with complex sophisticated electrical neuromodulation techniques. Purpose To assess the efficacy of early fesoterodine fumarate (FF) administration in preventing bladder overactivity in a spinal cord transected (SCT) rat model. Methods 33 Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to 6 groups Group 1: 3 normal controls; Group 2: 6 SCT controls; Group 3: 6 SCT rats + FF 0.18 mg/kg/d; Group 4: 6 SCT rats + FF 0.12 mg/kg/d; Group 5: 6 SCT rats + FF 0.18 mg/kg/d + 72-h wash-out period; Group 6: 6 SCT rats + FF 0.12 mg/kg/d + 72-h wash-out period. SCT was performed at T10. FF was continuously administered. Cystometry was undertaken 6 weeks after SCT in awake rats recording inter-micturition pressure (IMP), baseline pressure, threshold pressure (Pthres) and maximum pressure (Pmax). Normal controls and SCT controls were initially compared using the Mann-Whitney U tests in order to confirm the SCT effect on cystometric parameters. The comparisons in cystometric and metabolic cage parameters between SCT controls and treated rats were done using post-hoc Dunn's tests for Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Statistical testing was conducted at the two-tailed alpha-level of 0.05. Results Pressure parameters were significantly higher in SCT control group compared to normal controls. Six weeks after SCT, IMP was significantly lower in low dose treated group than in SCT controls. Pmax was significantly lower in 3 treated groups compared to SCT controls. Pthres was significantly lower in full time treated groups than in SCT controls. Conclusion Early administration of FF modulates bladder overactivity in a SCT rat model. Whereas short-term prevention has been demonstrated, the long-term should be further analyzed. Clinical application of these results should confirm this finding through randomized research protocols.

Cyberinfrastructure for Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						neuroimaging; big data; open science framework; cyberinfrastructure; neuroscience; data sharing; bids; workflow	SPECTRUM DISORDER; DATA CITATION; AUTISM; NEUROSCIENCE; DISCOVERY; SUPPORT; ARCHIVE; PROJECT; ACCESS	Data sharing is becoming more of a requirement as technologies mature and as global research and communications diversify. As a result, researchers are looking for practical solutions, not only to enhance scientific collaborations, but also to acquire larger amounts of data, and to access specialized datasets. In many cases, the realities of data acquisition present a significant burden, therefore gaining access to public datasets allows for more robust analyses and broadly enriched data exploration. To answer this demand, the Montreal Neurological Institute has announced its commitment to Open Science, harnessing the power of making both clinical and research data available to the world (Owens, 2016a,b). As such, the LORIS and CBRAIN (Das et al., 2016) platforms have been tasked with the technical challenges specific to the institutional-level implementation of open data sharing, including: (1) Comprehensive linking of multimodal data (phenotypic, clinical, neuroimaging, biobanking, and genomics, etc.) (2) Secure database encryption, specifically designed for institutional and multi-project data sharing, ensuring subject confidentiality (using multi-tiered identifiers). (3) Querying capabilities with multiple levels of single study and institutional permissions, allowing public data sharing for all consented and de-identified subject data.

Care4Rare Canada Consortium	XRCC1 mutation is associated with PARP1 hyperactivation and cerebellar ataxia	NATURE			English	Article							STRAND BREAK REPAIR; BASE EXCISION-REPAIR; POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE; SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA; DNA; CELLS; GENE; REPLICATION; DISEASE; RATES	XRCC1 is a molecular scaffold protein that assembles multiprotein complexes involved in DNA single-strand break repair(1,2). Here we show that biallelic mutations in the human XRCC1 gene are associated with ocular motor apraxia, axonal neuropathy, and progressive cerebellar ataxia. Cells from a patient with mutations in XRCC1 exhibited not only reduced rates of single-strand break repair but also elevated levels of protein ADP-ribosylation. This latter phenotype is recapitulated in a related syndrome caused by mutations in the XRCC1 partner protein PNKP3-5 and implicates hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase/s as a cause of cerebellar ataxia. Indeed, remarkably, genetic deletion of Parp1 rescued normal cerebellar ADP-ribose levels and reduced the loss of cerebellar neurons and ataxia in Xrcc1-defective mice, identifying a molecular mechanism by which endogenous single-strand breaks trigger neuropathology. Collectively, these data establish the importance of XRCC1 protein complexes for normal neurological function and identify PARP1 as a therapeutic target in DNA strand break repair-defective disease.

Bromodomain and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multivalent chromatin regulator possessing three histone-binding domains, one non-specific DNA-binding module, and several motifs for interacting with and activating three lysine acetyltransferases. Genetic analyses of fish brpf1 and mouse Brpf1 have uncovered an important role in skeletal, hematopoietic, and brain development, but it remains unclear how BRPF1 is linked to human development and disease. Here, we describe an intellectual disability disorder in ten individuals with inherited or de novo monoallelic BRPF1 mutations. Syrhptoms include infantile hypotonia, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, expressive language impairment, and facial dysmorphisms. Central nervous system and spinal abnormalities are also seen in some individuals. These clinical features overlap with but are not identical to those reported for persons with KAT6A or KAT6B mutations, suggesting that BRPF1 targets these two acetyltransferases and additional partners in humans. Functional assays showed that the resulting BRPF1 variants are pathogenic and impair acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 23, an abundant but poorly characterized epigenetic mark. We also found a similar deficiency in different lines of Brpf1-knockout mice. These data indicate that aberrations in the chromatin regulator gene BRPF1 cause histone H3 acetylation deficiency and a previously unrecognized intellectual disability syndrome.

The effects of this compound on neurodevelopment have not yet been addressed specifically in vertebrates. As a result, we aimed at addressing the effects, if any, of pyriproxyfen on neurodevelopment in the zebrafish embryo as a vertebrate model. Using zebrafish transgenic lines expressing GFP in different cell populations (elavl3 in newborn neurons, gfap and nestin in neural stem cells), we focused on the analysis of whole embryonic brain volume after confocal 3D-reconstruction and the quantification of purified neural stem cells during early neurodevelopment by FACS-cell sorting from whole in vivo embryos. Interestingly, though lethal at very high doses, pyriproxyfen did not cause brain malformation nor any significant changes in the number of observed stem cells in the developing central nervous system. Our data indicate that pyriproxyfen does not affect central nervous system development in zebrafish, suggesting that this larvicide on its own, may not be correlated with the increase in microcephaly cases reported recently.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by inhalation to 15 mg/m3 of anatase TiO2 NPs (similar to 20 nm) during 6 h. Rats were sacrificed at different time points over 14 days following the onset of inhalation. Ti levels were quantified by ICP-MS in blood, tissues, and excreta. Oxidative damages were also monitored (MDA). Highest tissue levels of Ti were found in lungs; peak values were reached only at 48 h followed by a progressive decrease over 14 days, suggesting a persistence of NPs at the site-of-entry. Levels reached in blood, lymph nodes and other internal organs (including liver, kidney, spleen) were circa one order of magnitude lower than in lungs, but the profiles were indicative of a certain translocation to the systemic circulation. Large amounts were recovered in feces compared to urine, suggesting that inhaled NPs were eliminated mainly by mucociliary clearance and ingested. TiO2 NPs also appeared to be partly transferred to olfactory bulbs and brain. MDA levels indicative of oxidative damage were significantly increased in lungs and blood at 24 h but this was not clearly reflected at later times. Translocation and clearance rates of inhaled NPs under different realistic exposure conditions should be further documented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

At the neural level, functional neuro-imaging studies have highlighted fronto-limbic alterations during emotion processing in schizophrenia, as well as impaired connectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. However, the direction of the impaired fronto-limbic connections remains largely unknown. To clarify this issue, we performed an effective connectivity study on emotion processing in schizophrenia. Methods: Forty-one healthy individuals and 39 schizophrenia patients (DSM-IV criteria) viewed negative, positive and neutral images during an fMRI session. Effective connectivity between significantly activated regions was examined using Granger causality and psychophysical interaction analyses. Results: Subjective ratings of emotionally neutral images were higher in schizophrenia patients than in controls. Across groups, significant activations were observed in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the bilateral amygdala. The Granger connectivity from the right amygdala to the dmPFC was significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients, relative to controls, during the negative and neutral conditions. The Granger connectivity from the left amygdala to the dmPFC was significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients, relative to controls, during the positive condition. Discussion: The finding of a reduced lagged connectivity from the bilateral amygdala to the dmPFC in schizophrenia suggests that the bottom-up mechanisms involved in the processing of highly arousing emotional stimuli are impaired in this disorder. The finding of an impaired lagged connectivity from the right amygdala to the dmPFC during the processing of emotionally neutral stimuli in schizophrenia is novel and may explain why these patients tend to confer emotional significance to irrelevant stimuli.

Methylomic profiling of cortex samples from completed suicide cases implicates a role for PSORS1C3 in major depression and suicide	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION; EPIGENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY; BRAIN; DISORDER; GENES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ASSOCIATIONS; 5-HYDROXYMETHYLCYTOSINE; IDENTIFICATION; CEREBELLUM	Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a major social and economic health issue and constitutes a major risk factor for suicide. The molecular pathology of suicidal depression remains poorly understood, although it has been hypothesised that regulatory genomic processes are involved in the pathology of both MDD and suicidality. In this study, genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation were assessed in depressed suicide completers (n = 20) and compared with non-psychiatric, sudden-death controls (n = 20) using tissue from two cortical brain regions (Brodmann Area 11 (BA11) and Brodmann Area 25 (BA25)).Analyses focused on identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with suicidal depression and epigenetic variation were explored in the context of polygenic risk scores for major depression and suicide. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis was used to identify modules of co- methylated loci associated with depressed suicide completers and polygenic burden for MDD and suicide attempt. We identified a DMR upstream of the PSORS1C3 gene, subsequently validated using bisulfite pyrosequencing and replicated in a second set of suicide samples, which is characterised by significant hypomethylation in both cortical brain regions in MDD suicide cases. We also identified discrete modules of co-methylated loci associated with polygenic risk burden for suicide attempt, but not major depression. Suicide-associated co-methylation modules were enriched among gene networks implicating biological processes relevant to depression and suicidality, including nervous system development and mitochondria function. Our data suggest that there are coordinated changes in DNA methylation associated with suicide that may offer novel insights into the molecular pathology associated with depressed suicide completers.

Case report: maternal mosaicism resulting in inheritance of a novel GATA6 mutation causing pancreatic agenesis and neonatal diabetes mellitus	DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY			English	Article						GATA6; Haploinsufficiency; Mosaicism; Pancreas abnormalities; Neonatal diabetes mellitus	AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE SYNDROME; CONGENITAL HEART-DEFECTS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; MANAGEMENT; GENE; RFX6; HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY; ORGANOGENESIS; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN	Background: Haploinsufficiency of the GATA6 transcription factor gene was recently found to be the most common cause of pancreatic agenesis, a rare cause of neonatal diabetes mellitus. Although most cases are de novo, we describe three siblings with inherited GATA6 haploinsufficiency and the rare finding of parental mosaicism. Case Presentation: The proband was born at term with severe intrauterine growth restriction, the first child of non-consanguineous parents. Diabetes occurred on day of life 1 with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency noted at several months of age. Pancreatic agenesis with absent gallbladder was confirmed when he underwent congenital diaphragmatic hernia and intestinal malrotation repair. A patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary stenosis were repaired in infancy. Neurocognitive development has been normal. A second pregnancy was terminated due to tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The fetus also demonstrated severe pancreatic hypoplasia, gallbladder agenesis and intestinal rotation abnormalities. Despite severe hypoplasia, the pancreas demonstrated normal islet histology. Another sibling was found to have multiple cardiac abnormalities, requiring procedural intervention. Given the proband's spectrum of congenital anomalies, Sanger sequencing of the GATA6 gene was performed, revealing a novel heterozygous c.635_660del frameshift mutation (p.Pro212fs). The mutation is predicted to be pathogenic, resulting in inclusion of a premature stop codon and likely degradation of the gene transcript by nonsense-mediated decay. The abortus and the sibling with the cardiac defect were both found to have the mutation, while the father and remaining sibling were negative. The mother, who is healthy with no evidence of diabetes or cardiac disease, is mosaic for the mutation at a level of 11% in her peripheral leukocytes by next-generation sequencing. Conclusion: We highlight a rare mechanism of pancreatic agenesis, this being only the second report of parental mosaicism for a GATA6 mutation and one of a handful of inherited cases. We also further define the phenotypic variability of GATA6 haploinsufficiency, even in individuals carrying the same mutation. Mutations in GATA6 should be strongly considered in cases of diabetes due to pancreatic hypoplasia or agenesis, and potentially affected family members should be tested regardless of phenotype.

J	Aljukhadar, M; Senecal, S				Aljukhadar, Muhammad; Senecal, Sylvain			Communicating online information via streaming video: the role of user goal	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						Consumer behaviour; Media richness theory; Computer mediated communications; Online information management; Online video	MEDIA-RICHNESS THEORY; E-COMMERCE; WEB SITE; CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES; PURCHASE INTENTIONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; TRUSTING BELIEFS; CLICKSTREAM DATA; BEHAVIOR; TECHNOLOGY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper, building on the media richness theory (MRT), is to propose that while communicating product information via streaming video should enhance outcome measures, such an enhancement will be evident mainly for users with equivocal, latent goals (i.e. recreational browsing) rather than for those with less equivocal, concrete goals (i.e. the search of a specific product). Design/methodology/approach - The experiment involved 337 potential online consumers in Canada, and had full factorial design with four conditions (two methods to communicate product information: textual vs streaming video, and two goals: product searching vs recreational browsing). Analysis of covariance was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The results lent support to the hypotheses. The perceived information quality, trusting competence, and arousal for participants with recreational browsing goals were significantly affected when product information where communicated using streaming video. For participants with concrete goals (product searchers), the traditional textual method was as effective as the streaming video method. Practical implications - The findings entice practitioners to use rich media such as the streaming video method to communicate online information predominantly for users with experiential browsing goals, and to use lean media for users with less equivocal, concrete goals. Originality/value - The results contribute to the sparse literature that underscores the key role of user goal in shaping the effectiveness of online information. The results provide empirical support to the prediction of MRT that the use of rich media to communicate information is advantageous for users with latent, equivocal goals.

However, long-term administration of antipsychotics can upregulate D-2 receptors and produce receptor supersensitivity manifested by behavioral supersensitivity to dopamine stimulation in animals, and movement disorders and supersensitivity psychosis (SP) in patients. Antipsychotic-induced SP was first described as the emergence of psychotic symptoms with tardive dyskinesia (TD) and a fall in prolactin levels following drug discontinuation. In the era of first-generation antipsychotics, 4 clinical features characterized drug-induced SP: rapid relapse after drug discontinuation/dosereduction/switch of antipsychotics, tolerance to previously observed therapeutic effects, co-occurring TD, and psychotic exacerbation by life stressors. We review 3 recent studies on the prevalence rates of SP, and the link to treatment resistance and psychotic relapse in the era of second-generation antipsychotics ( risperidone, paliperidone, perospirone, and long-acting injectable risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole). These studies show that the prevalence rates of SP remain high in schizophrenia (30%) and higher (70%) in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We then present neurobehavioral findings on antipsychotic-induced supersensitivity to dopamine from animal studies. Next, we propose criteria for SP, which describe psychotic symptoms and co-occurring movement disorders more precisely. Detection of mild/borderline drug-induced movement disorders permits early recognition of overblockade of D-2 receptors, responsible for SP and TD. Finally, we describe 3 antipsychotic withdrawal syndromes, similar to those seen with other CNS drugs, and we propose approaches to treat, potentially prevent, or temporarily manage SP. (C) 2017 S.

OBJECTIVE: In this study we explored how stigma may influence return-to-work processes, experiences of stigma and discrimination at the workplace for persons with (moderate to severe) brain injuries, and strategies that can be employed to manage disclosure. METHODS: Exploratory qualitative study; used in-depth interviews and an inductive thematic analytical approach in data analysis. Ten PWBI and five employment service providers participated. PWBI discussed their work experiences, relationships with supervisors and co-workers and experiences of stigma and/or discrimination at work. Employment service providers discussed their perceptions regarding PWBI's rights and abilities to work, reported incidents of workplace discrimination, and how issues related to stigma, discrimination and disclosure are managed. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: i) public, employer and provider knowledge about brain injury and beliefs about PWBI; ii) incidents of workplace discrimination; iii) disclosure. Misperceptions regarding PWBI persist amongst the public and employers. Incidents of workplace discrimination included social exclusion at the workplace, hiring discrimination, denial of promotion/demotion, harassment, and failure to provide reasonable accommodations. Disclosure decisions required careful consideration of PWBI needs, the type of information that should be shared, and the context in which that information is shared. CONCLUSIONS: Public understanding about PWBI remains limited. PWBI require further assistance to manage disclosure and incidents of workplace discrimination.

By producing an object signature based on such information, mishandling due to friction or slippage could be avoided. However, this would require acquisition and processing of tactile data in close to real time in order to function at task speed. This paper proposes a new texture-discriminating algorithm that requires very little exploratory movement. We compared the success rate of two types of exploratory movement for the recognition textures with directional properties such as grooves. Another goal of this study was to obtain an algorithm that is largely insensitive to the velocity and contact force of the sensor movement. We used a genetic algorithm to optimize the variables and the topology of our neural network. We improved the results with a new approach to majority voting that does not require numerous samples. Object classification was more than 90 % correct and most of the errors involved textures that humans are barely able to differentiate.

Variations on a theme: imaging cytokinetic and stable rings in situ using Caenorhabditis elegans	CYTOKINESIS	Methods in Cell Biology		English	Review; Book Chapter							DOUBLE-STRANDED-RNA; C-ELEGANS; CELL; SYSTEM; INTERFERENCE; EXPRESSION; ACTOMYOSIN; RESOLUTION; NEURONS; TISSUE	Cytokinesis is an essential event in canonical cell division. In multicellular organisms, cells must divide in the context of neighboring cells in intact tissues. Recent studies have shown that tissue architecture can regulate the dynamics of and molecular requirements for cytokinesis. On the other hand, regulated cytokinesis failure occurs in, and is required for the proper function of, certain cell types and tissues including cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and germ lines. One way to build our understanding of cytokinesis in diverse cell types is to visualize cytokinesis in intact tissues. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful system for such inquiries due to the well-characterized, invariant lineage of each of its cells, the ease of genomic modifications including tagging proteins, and many more advantages. The clear cuticle of C. elegans allows for live imaging of intact tissues; however, the worm's motility can confound imaging. Here we introduce two C. elegans tissues, an epithelial tissue and the germ line, both excellent systems for the study of cytokinesis in the context of an intact animal. Additionally, we present three protocols for overcoming the challenges of live imaging in C. elegans.	[Rehain, K.; Maddox, A.

The approach is demonstrated using simulated data from the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), as a challenging benchmark problem. The TEP is a plant-wide industrial process that is commonly used to study and evaluate a variety of topics, including the design of process monitoring and control techniques. The proposed approach is called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a machine learning approach that is used to discover the hidden knowledge in historical data. The discovered knowledge in the form of extracted patterns is employed to construct a classification rule that is capable of characterizing the physical phenomena in the TEP, wherein one can detect and identify a fault and relate it to the causes that contribute to its occurrence. To evaluate our approach, the LAD is trained on a set of observations collected from different faults, and tested against an independent set of observations. The results in this paper show that the LAD approach achieves the highest accuracy compared to two common machine learning classification techniques; Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.

Change in INSR, APBA2 and IDE Gene Expressions in Brains of Alzheimer's Disease Patients	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; brain; APBA2; INSR; IDE; gene expression	INSULIN-DEGRADING ENZYME; AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; BETA; BIOMARKERS; RECEPTOR; TAU	Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined as a progressive and irreversible neurode-generative disorder, the onset of which is mainly characterized by decreased cognition, memory loss, and mental confusion. Objective: This study sought to quantify mRNA expression of the APBA2, INSR and IDE genes in brain samples from patients with AD and controls. Methods: We investigated the mRNA expression of the APBA2, INSR and IDE genes in 150 RNA samples from entorhinal cortex, auditory cortex, and the hippocampus of individuals with AD and elderly controls using real time PCR. APOE genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP. Results: When the total brain samples were analyzed collectively, a decrease in IDE gene expression was found in AD patients relative to healthy elderly controls. However, when the samples were analyzed separately according to the region of the brain, there was a significant upregulation of INSR expression in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex in the AD patient group. We did not observe any statistical differences when gene expression was compared in the different regions of the brain of AD patients. When the E4 allele of apolipoprotein-E was considered in AD patients, the presence of this allele was found to be associated with decreased APBA2 gene expression. The same analysis using the INSR and IDE genes showed no significant statistical differences. Conclusion: These results support the hypothesis that APBA2, IDE, and particularly INSR gene expression in different areas of Alzheimer's patient's brains could represent new markers for use in clinical diagnoses in the near future.

Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series model, non-linear autoregressive exogenous input (NARX) neural network (NN) are investigated and a hybrid system is proposed. Using the proposed model instead of the ARIMA model results in a decrease in the average mean square error (MSE) by 23.23% in addition to a decrease of 9.68% in the number of the classifier's misclassification. The hybrid model yields a 29.25% improvement in the average MSE compared to the random NN, it also offers an advantage of 15.15% decrease in the number of misclassifications. Results show that using predictive models and previous instances of sensed data, the behavior of the primary user could be captured and the secondary user could decide about usable parts of the spectrum accordingly.

Findings from previous studies regarding clinical and structural trajectories of SNAP are inconsistent. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were categorized into four groups: amyloid positive with hypometabolism (A beta+ND+), amyloid only (A beta+ND-), neither amyloid nor hypometabolism (A beta-ND-), and SNAP (A beta-ND+). A beta+ND+(n = 33), A beta+ND- (n = 32), and A beta-ND- (n = 36) were matched to SNAP for age, gender, apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype, and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Elderly controls (n = 40) were also matched to SNAP for age, gender, and apoE4 genotype. Longitudinal changes were compared across groups in terms of hippocampal volume, clinical symptoms, daily functioning, and cognitive functioning over a 2-year period. At baseline, no difference in cognition and functioning was observed between SNAP and A beta+groups. SNAP showed worse clinical symptoms and impaired functioning at baseline compared to A beta-ND- and controls. Two years of follow-up showed no differences in hippocampal volume changes between SNAP and any of the comparison groups. SNAP showed worse functional deterioration in comparison to A beta-ND- and controls. However, A beta+ND+ showed more severe changes in clinical symptoms in comparison to SNAP. Thus, patients with MCI and SNAP showed 1) more severe functional deterioration compared to A beta-ND- and controls, 2) no differences with A beta+ND-, and 3) less cognitive deterioration than A beta+ND+. Future studies should investigate what causes SNAP, which is different from typical AD pathology and biomarker cascades.

Relationships between demographic, service-related variables and employment outcomes (2009-2014) were analysed using chi-squares and analyses of variance. In addition, 14 interviews were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis.Results: PWBIs accessed services on average of 16 years post injury; 64% secured at least one competitive-employment job, which was how employment success was defined in this study. Average job tenure was 368 days, and average job intensity was 3.8 hours/day. Employment success was significantly associated (p < 0.05) with use of job development, job coaching, case management and job retention services. Interviews revealed that PWBIs were provided five services: job goal(s) identification, assessment of work-related abilities/skills, job development, on-the-job supports and job retention assistance. Challenges to ES delivery included lack of suitable jobs and hiring incentives, and difficulties in establishing natural supports at the workplace.Conclusions: PWBIs' employment outcomes may be supported through provision of ES to assist with: the development of realistic job goals and job-finding skills, securing work, on-the-job coaching and advocacy with employers.

We aimed to prospectively follow-up a large cohort of RBD patients to identify cognitive markers for early detection of prodromal dementia. Methods: Seventy-six idiopathic RBD patients underwent polysomnography and a complete neuropsychological and neurological assessment and were then followed for a mean of 3.6 years. Cognitive characteristics at baseline were compared between patients who remained disease-free and those who developed a synucleinopathy, and between those who developed dementia first and those who developed parkinsonism first. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to assess the diagnostic value of cognitive tests for detecting prodromal dementia. Results: At follow-up, 34 patients developed a neurodegenerative disease: 19 parkinsonism-first and 15 dementia-first. RBD patients who first developed dementia were impaired at baseline in all cognitive domains (attention/executive functions, learning/memory, and visuospatial) compared to patients who developed parkinsonism. Moreover, 93% of patients who first developed dementia had mild cognitive impairment at baseline compared to 42% of patients who developed parkinsonism. RBD patients who developed parkinsonism first were similar at baseline to disease-free RBD patients on cognition. In dementia-first patients, two cognitive tests assessing attention and executive functions (Stroop Color Word Test and Trail Making Test) reliably predicted dementia (area under the curve >= 0.85) compared to parkinsonism-first patients or controls. Conclusions: This study shows that cognitive tests assessing attention and executive functions strongly predict conversion to dementia in RBD patients, and may be useful endpoints to determine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent cognitive deterioration in RBD patients.

No single measure is sufficient to distinguish between the PPA variants, but connected speech allows for the quantification of multiple measures. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the white matter correlates associated with connected speech features in PPA. We examined the relationship between white matter metrics and connected speech deficits using an auto-mated analysis of transcriptions of connected speech and diffusion tensor imaging in language-related tracts. Syntactic, lexical, and semantic features were automatically extracted from transcriptions of topic-directed interviews conducted with groups of individuals with nfvPPA or svPPA as well as with a group of healthy controls. A principal component analysis was performed in order to reduce the number of language measures and yielded a five-factor solution. The results indicated that nfvPPA patients differed from healthy controls on a syntactic factor, and svPPA patients differed from controls on two semantic factors. However, the patient groups did not differ on any factor. Moreover, a correlational analysis revealed that the lexical richness factor was significantly correlated with radial diffusivity in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, which suggests that semantic deficits in connected speech reflect a disruption of this ventral pathway, and which is largely consistent with the results of previous studies. Using an automated approach for the analysis of connected speech combined with probabilistic tractography, the present findings demonstrate that nfvPPA patients are impaired relative to healthy controls on syntactic measures and have increased radial diffusivity in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, whereas the svPPA group was impaired on lexico-semantic measures relative to controls and showed increased radial diffusivity in the uncinate and inferior longitudinal fasciculus bilaterally.

This comparison is done on the raw representation (images) of the digits and on their features extracted using two feature selection methods. Three learning algorithms with different inductive biases were used in the comparison performed using the raw representation; two of them were also used to compare the digits using their extracted features. All classifiers gave better results for Hindu digits in both cases; when raw representation was used and when the selected features where used. The experiments also show that Hindu digits can be classified with better accuracy, higher confidence and using fewer features than Arabic digits. These results indicate that hand-written Hindu digits are actually easier to recognize than hand-written Arabic digits. The machine learning methods used in this work are instance based learning (the kNN algorithm), Naive Bayesian and neural networks. The feature extraction methods we used were Fourier transformation and histograms.

Regional correlations between [C-11]PIB PET and post-mortem burden of amyloid-beta pathology in a diverse neuropathological cohort	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Imaging; Pathology; Amyloid; Alzheimer's disease	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; DISEASE; PLAQUES; BRAIN; PIB	Imaging-pathological correlation studies show that in vivo amyloid-beta (A beta) positron emission tomography (PET) strongly predicts the presence of significant A beta pathology at autopsy. We sought to determine whether regional PiB-PET uptake would improve sensitivity for amyloid detection in comparison with global measures (experiment 1), and to estimate the relative contributions of different A beta aggregates to in vivo PET signal (experiment 2). In experiment 1, 54 subjects with [C-11] PiB-PET during life and postmortem neuropathologic examination (85.2% with dementia, interval from PET to autopsy 3.1 +/- 1.9 years) were included. We assessed Thal amyloid phase (N = 36) and CERAD score (N = 54) versus both global and regional PiB SUVRs. In experiment 2 (N = 42), PiB SUVR and post-mortem amyloid beta burden was analyzed in five customized regions of interest matching regions sampled at autopsy. We assessed the relative contribution of neuritic plaques (NPs), diffuse plaques (DPs) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) to regional PIB SUVR using multi-linear regression. In experiment 1, there were no differences in Area Under the Curve for amyloid phase >= A2 and CERAD score >= C2 between global and highest regional PiB SUVR (p = 0.186 and 0.230). In experiment 2, when NPs, DPs, and/or CAA were included in the same model, moderate to severe NPs were independently correlated with PiB SUVR in all regions except for the inferior temporal and calcarine ROI (beta = 0.414-0.804, p < 0.05), whereas DPs were independently correlated with PiB SUVR in the angular gyrus ROI (beta = 0.446, p = 0.010). CAA was also associated with PiB SUVR in the inferior temporal and calcarine ROI (beta = 0.222-0.355, p < 0.05). In conclusion, global PiB-PET SUVR performed as well as regional values for amyloid detection in our cohort. The substrate-specific binding of PiB might differ among the brain specific regions.

Measuring the impact of EF impairments on the accomplishment of activities of daily living (ADL) requires specific assessment tools, but choosing the right tool may be difficult.Purpose: To conduct a scoping review on how assessments of ADL address EF and EF impairments in persons with ABI.Method: A scoping review of literature (peer-reviewed and grey literature) published until August 2014 was conducted. Using a systematic procedure, literature was selected, results were charted, and tools were analysed with respect to their goals, underlying models, psychometric properties and applicability. The analysis also included how tools considered components of EF according to Lezak's model.Results: 12 tools, developed either to assess EF in ADL, independence in ADL considering EF or ADL capacities, were identified and analysed according to multiple criteria.Conclusions: This review provides important information about existing tools to assist in tool selection and clinical decision-making related to ABI and EF.

The participants consisted of three individuals with symptomatic mTBI (3.9 +/- 3.6 months post-mTBI) and 12 healthy controls. The main measures used were the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Profile observation-based assessment; a visual externally ordered working memory task combined to event-related potentials (ERP) and fMRI recordings; neuropsychological tests; post-concussion symptoms questionnaires; and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Profile interview. Compared to normal controls, all three patients had difficulty with a real-world complex budgeting activity due to deficits in planning, ineffective strategy use and/or a prolonged time to detect and correct errors. Reduced activations in the right mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on fMRI as well as abnormal frontal or parietal components of the ERP occurred alongside these deficits. Results of this exploratory study suggest that reduced independence in complex everyday activities in symptomatic mTBI may be at least partly explained by a decrease in brain activation in the prefrontal cortex, abnormal ERP, or slower reaction times on working memory tasks. The study presents an initial attempt at combining research in neuroscience with ecological real-world evaluation research to further our understanding of the difficulties in complex everyday activities experienced by individuals with mTBI.

Sociologists and anthropologists have proposed different definitions to delimit this broad intellectual field and to demonstrate how the actors actively cope with uncertainty. The article focuses on a particular kind of ignorance, namely intentional concealing of data in the field of neuroscience. This contribution draws on first hand empirical evidence that researchers sometimes obscure technical problems as well as they have to deal with the difficulties to publish discordant or contradictory data. These practices illustrate that valorisation of spectacular discoveries and "positive" results clashes with the ideals of transparency and knowledge sharing conveyed in particular by infrastructures like databases.

Mechanistic studies of new oximes reactivators of human butyryl cholinesterase inhibited by cyclosarin and sarin	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS			English	Article						neurotoxic agents; oximes; butyrylcholinesterase; docking; mechanistic studies and chemometrics	ESCHERICHIA-COLI MUTASE; PROTEIN DATA-BANK; HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE; IN-VITRO; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE REACTIVATORS; PHOSPHYLATED CHOLINESTERASES; MOLECULAR DOCKING; CHORISMATE; CATALYSIS; TOXICITY	Butyryl cholinesterase (BChE) has been seen as a key enzyme in the search for new strategies in the treatment of poisoning by organophosphates (OPs), since human BChE (HssBChE), complexed with the appropriate oxime, can be a suitable scavenger and deactivator for OPs in the blood stream. However, the efficacy of HssBChE is limited by its strict stoichiometric scavenging, slow reactivation, and propensity for aging. The improvement of the reactivation rate by new and more efficient oximes could contribute to mitigate this problem and increase the HssBChE efficiency as scavenger. Several oximes have been synthesized and tested with this goal, some with promising results, but the mechanistic aspects of the reactivation reaction are not fully understood yet. In order to better investigate this mechanism, docking and mixed quantum and molecular mechanics combined with principal components analysis were performed here to evaluate the capacity of reactivation and determine the preferred route for the reactivation reaction of two new oximes on HssBChE inhibited by the neurotoxic agents cyclosarin and sarin. Plots of potential energies were calculated and all the transition states of the reactional mechanism were determined. Our results showed a good correlation with experimental data and pointed to the most efficient oxime with both OPs. The protocol used could be a suitable tool for a preliminary evaluation of the HssBChE reactivation rates by new oximes.	[Amaral de Lima, Willian E.; Francisco, Ander; da Cunha, Elaine F.

Its accuracy is related to different aspects of the technique, one of the most important being the experience and interaction of the endosonographer and pathologist. Certain studies over the past years have highlighted the importance of having rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of samples obtained at the time of EUS-FNA. We have reviewed the role of ROSE, performed by the same endosonographer, a cytotechnologist and an expert cytopathologist. The available data suggest that ROSE (either by the endosonographer, the cytotechnologist, or the cytopathologist) improves sample adequacy and diagnostic yield, with the best option to have ROSE performed by an expert cytopathologist. However, if non-ROSE accuracy is already very high, any improvement is harder to achieve.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) models, in addition to a traditional model (Multiple linear regression, MLR) were developed to forecast urban water demand at lead times of 1 and 3 days. The use of models based on ELM in water demand forecasting has not previously been explored in much detail. Models were based on different combinations of the main input variables (e.g., daily maximum temperature, daily total precipitation and daily water demand), for which data were available for Montreal, Canada between 1999 and 2010. Based on the squared coefficient of determination, the root mean square error and an examination of the residuals, ELM models provided greater accuracy than MLR, ANN or SVR models in forecasting Montreal urban water demand for 1 day and 3 days ahead, and can be considered a promising method for short-term urban water demand forecasting.

Therefore, we used the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) to determine if automatic detection of changes can be followed by an attentional switch without visual awareness. Random moving dots changing in direction were presented in the periphery, while participants carried out an effortful Stroop test in the central visual field to fully engage their attention on this primary task. The results revealed a posterior vMMN at 200 ms that was maximal in the parietal regions, revealing an automatic detection of change in the absence of visual awareness related to a dorsal/magnocellular pathway. Moreover, a frontal and central positivity, with a more pronounced activity in the left frontal areas was found at 300 ms possibly reflecting (1) unconscious attentional switch, (2) inhibition of explicit attentional switch by the left frontal areas acting on the right frontal areas via interhemispheric connections (3) inhibition of explicit attentional switch by the frontal areas acting on the central area via top-down connections. In conclusion, our results showed that vMMN could be a useful tool to study detection of changes and attentional mechanisms in the absence of visual consciousness.

Methods and Results: A 35-week newborn with a complex CHD and a normal MRI presented with early motor developmental delay at 2 months. She began an intervention program, which included biweekly motor developmental therapy with a physiotherapist, parental education, and daily home exercises. At 4 months, she underwent cardiac surgery. Following surgery, she was diagnosed with a stroke involving the right sylvian artery territory. She continued her intensive intervention program. The 12-month assessment revealed an evident gain of motor function. Despite MRI evidence of a chronic infarct involving the primary motor cortex, the child had normal motor functions. Conclusion: This case report supports the positive impact of early intervention in infants with CHD and its potential effect on enhancing neuroplasticity, even in children with cerebro-vascular accidents involving areas of motor function.

Four speakers were charged with presenting their methods of applying virtual reality (VR) technology to obtain meaningful rehabilitation outcomes. The symposium aims to explore characteristics of VR that modify mechanisms supporting motor relearning. Common impairments in posture and gait that can be modulated within virtual environments by employing motor learning concepts, including sensory augmentation and repetition, were examined. Critical overviews of VR applications that address different therapeutic objectives for improving posture and gait in individuals with neurological insult or injury were presented. A further goal was to identify approaches and efforts to bridge the gap between knowledge generation from research and knowledge uptake in clinical practice. Specific objectives of this symposium were that participants be able to: 1) identify benefits and limitations of selecting VR as an intervention tool; 2) discuss how VR relates to principles for motor relearning following neurological insult or injury; and 3) identify areas and methods for future translation of VR technology in clinical and home-based settings. Our symposium concluded that the application of VR technology in assessment, treatment, and research has yielded promising results in transferring learned cognitive and motor skills to more natural environments. VR permits the user to interact with a multidimensional and multisensory environment in real time, and offers the opportunity to provide both standardized and individualized interventions while monitoring behavior.

Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying how presentation format affects gist processing is essential in determining the factors that influence these encoding processes. The current study utilised multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis to identify encoding networks directly associated with retrieval performance in a blocked and intermixed presentation condition. Subsequent memory analysis for successfully encoded items indicated no significant differences between reaction time and retrieval performance and presentation format. Despite no significant behavioural differences, behaviour PLS revealed differences in brain-behaviour correlations and mean condition activity in brain regions associated with gist-based vs. distinctive encoding. Specifically, the intermixed format encouraged more distinctive encoding, showing increased activation of regions associated with strategy use and visual processing (e.g., frontal and visual cortices, respectively). Alternatively, the blocked format exhibited increased gist-based processes, accompanied by increased activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Together, results suggest that the sequence that information is presented during encoding affects the degree to which distinctive encoding is engaged. These findings extend our understanding of the Fuzzy Trace Theory and the role of presentation format on encoding processes.

There is a recent study showing that exercise enhances this plasticity effect when assessed with binocular rivalry. We address one question, is this enhancement from exercise a general effect such that it is seen for measures of binocular processing other than that revealed using binocular rivalry? Using a binocular phase combination task in which we directly measure each eye's contribution to the binocularly fused percept, we show no additional effect of exercise after short-term monocular occlusion and argue that the enhancement of ocular dominance plasticity from exercise could not be demonstrated with our approach.

However, in developing countries patients with MNS disorders are often poorly managed and treated, particularly in marginalized, impoverished areas where the mental health gap and the treatment gap can reach 90%. Efforts should be made in promoting help by making mental health care more accessible. In this article, we address the challenges that psychological and psychiatric services have to face in a low-resource context, taking our experience at a Moroccan rehabilitation center as a case study. A sample of 60 patients were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire during the period of 2014-2015. The questionnaire investigated the reactions and feelings of the patients to the rehabilitation program, and their perceived psychological status and mental improvement, if any. Interviews were then transcribed and processed using ATLAS. ti V. 7.0 qualitative analysis software. Frequencies and co-occurrence analyses were carried out. Despite approximately 30 million inhabitants within the working age group, Morocco suffers from a shortage of specialized health workers. Our ethnographic observations show that psychiatric treatment can be ensured, notwithstanding these hurdles, if a public health perspective is assumed. In resource-limited settings, working in the field of mental health means putting oneself on the line, exposing oneself to new experiences, and reorganizing one's own skills and expertise. In the present article, we have used our clinical experience at a rehabilitation center in Fes as a case study and we have shown how to use peer therapy to overcome the drawbacks that we are encountered daily in a setting of limited resources.

Neurosurgical aspects and focus on the single-burr hole technique performed under assisted local anaesthesia	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Burr-hole craniostomy; elderly; local anaesthesia; outcomes; subdural haematoma	CLOSED-SYSTEM DRAINAGE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; TWIST-DRILL CRANIOSTOMY; SURGICAL TREATMENTS; RISK-FACTORS; MANAGEMENT	Objective: Chronic subdural haematomas (CSDH) is a common pathology that usually affects the elderly population. The incidence of CSDH has recently been increasing with the expansion of the aging population. The objective of our study was to evaluate the outcome following surgical drainage of CSDH in elderly patients. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 455 consecutive patients with CSDHs over a 5-year period. Among them, all 121 patients older than 80-year old were included in the study. Clinical status, comorbidities, type of surgical technique and outcome were analyzed. Outcome at last follow-up was measured using the Markwalder grading score and the Glasgow outcome scale. Results: Patients ranged from 80- to 94-year old with a median age of 84 years (range 80-94). Ninety-eight percent of patients were surgically treated by a small burr hole under assisted local anaesthesia. About 69.2% of patients improved post-operatively. The mortality rate was 6.8%. Conclusion: CSDH is a common pathology in the elderly population. Patients with CSDHs often have comorbodities that need to be considered in deciding whether surgical treatment is indicated. When surgery is elected, small craniostomy techniques performed under assisted local anesthesia is safe and should be favored in this frail population.

J	Lussier, M; Bugaiska, A; Bherer, L				Lussier, Maxime; Bugaiska, Aurelia; Bherer, Louis			Specific transfer effects following variable priority dual-task training in older adults	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Cognitive training; transfer; divided attention; variable priority training; older adults	WORKING-MEMORY; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; COGNITIVE PLASTICITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PERFORMANCE; YOUNGER; GAINS; BRAIN; WOMEN; AGE	Purpose: Past divided attention training studies in older adults have suggested that variable priority training (VPT) tends to show larger improvement than fixed priority training (FPT). However, it remains unclear whether VPT leads to larger transfer effects. Methods: In this study, eighty-three older adults aged between 55 and 65 received five 1-hour sessions of VPT, FPT or of an active placebo. VPT and FPT subjects trained on a complex dual-task condition with variable stimulus timings in order to promote more flexible and self-guided strategies with regard to attentional priority devoted to the concurrent tasks. Real-time individualized feedback was provided to encourage improvement. The active placebo group attended computer classes. Near and far modality transfer tasks were used to assess the generalization of transfer effects. Results: Results showed that VPT induced significantly larger transfer effects than FPT on a near modality transfer task. Evidence for larger transfer effects in VPT than FPT on a far modality transfer task was also observed. Furthermore, the superiority of VPT on FPT in transfer effects was specific to the ability to coordinate two concurrent tasks. Conclusions: Results of this study help better understand the benefits of VPT attentional training on transfer effects, which is an essential outcome for cognitive training effectiveness and relevancy.

They provide therapeutic benefit for positive symptoms, but no marked or consistent improvement in neurocognitive, social cognitive or negative symptoms. Since blockade of D-3 and 5-HT6 (5-HT6R) receptors enhances neurocognition and social cognition, and potentially improves negative symptoms, a promising approach for improved treatment for schizophrenia would be to develop drugs that preferentially act at D3R versus D2R and likewise recognize 5-HT6R. Starting from the high affinity 5-HT6R ligands I and II, we identified compounds 11a and 14b that behave as 5-HT6R ligands with significant selectivity for D3R over D2R. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates of functional cerebral hemispheric differences in monolingual and bilingual people who stutter: Visual hemifield paradigm	CLINICAL LINGUISTICS & PHONETICS			English	Article						Bilingualism; developmental stuttering; executive functions; hemispheric asymmetry; visual hemifield paradigm	VOCAL REACTION-TIMES; LANGUAGE LATERALITY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PRESENTED CONCRETE; ABSTRACT WORDS; HUMAN BRAIN; FIELD; ASYMMETRY; DOMINANCE; SPEECH	The relationship between stuttering and bilingualism to functional cerebral hemispheric processing was examined using a visual hemifield paradigm. Eighty native German speakers, half of whom were also proficient speakers of English as a second language (L2), were recruited. The participants were organised into four different groups according to speech status and language ability: 20 monolinguals who stutter, 20 bilinguals who stutter, 20 monolinguals who do not stutter, and 20 bilinguals who do not stutter. All participants completed a task involving selective identification of common objects simultaneously presented to both visual fields. Overall, an LVF advantage was observed across all groups with no significant group differences in regard to hemispheric asymmetry. However, both bilingual groups showed faster reaction times and fewer identification errors than the two monolingual groups. A prevailing finding was that bilingualism seems to offset deficits in executive functioning associated with stuttering. Hence, the results lend support to previous findings implicating the benefits of bilingualism.

Previous studies more concentrate on sales forecasting rather than demand forecasting, and the variables affecting demand remained to be optimized. In this study, a two-stage intelligent retail forecasting system is designed for new clothing products. In the first stage, demand is estimated with original sales data considering stock-out. The adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is introduced into the second stage to forecast demand. Meanwhile a data selection process is presented due to the limited data of new products. The empirical data are from a Canadian fast-fashion company. The results reveal the relationship between demand and sales, demonstrate the necessity of integrating the demand estimation process into a forecasting system, and show that the ANFIS-based forecasting system outperforms the traditional ANN technique.

Safety Outcomes and Near-Adult Height Gain of Growth Hormone-Treated Children with SHOX Deficiency: Data from an Observational Study and a Clinical Trial	HORMONE RESEARCH IN PAEDIATRICS			English	Article						SHOX deficiency; Growth hormone treatment; Short stature; Growth; Safety; Near-adult height	LERI-WEILL DYSCHONDROSTEOSIS; IDIOPATHIC SHORT STATURE; TURNER-SYNDROME; MULTICENTER TRIAL; GENE DEFICIENCY; FINAL HEIGHT; GH TREATMENT; HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY; HOMEOBOX; THERAPY	Background/Aims: To assess auxological and safety data for growth hormone (GH)-treated children with SHOX deficiency. Methods: Data were examined for GH-treated SHOX-deficient children (n = 521) from the observational Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS). For patients with near-adult height information, GeNeSIS results (n = 90) were compared with a clinical trial (n = 28) of SHOX-deficient patients. Near-adult height was expressed as standard deviation score (SDS) for chronological age, potentially increasing the observed effect of treatment. Results: Most SHOX-deficient patients in GeNeSIS had diagnoses of Leri-Weill syndrome (n = 292) or non-syndromic short stature (n = 228). For GeNeSIS patients with near-adult height data, mean age at GH treatment start was 11.0 years, treatment duration 4.4 years, and height SDS gain 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.49-1.17). Respective ages, GH treatment durations and height SDS gains for GeNeSIS patients prepubertal at baseline (n = 42) were 9.2 years, 6.0 years and 1.19 (0.76-1.62), and for the clinical trial cohort they were 9.2 years, 6.0 years and 1.25 (0.92-1.58). No new GH-related safety concerns were identified. Conclusion: Patients with SHOX deficiency who had started GH treatment before puberty in routine clinical practice had a similar height gain to that of patients in the clinical trial on which approval for the indication was based, with no new safety concerns.

MBI describes NPS of any severity, which are not captured by traditional psychiatric nosology, persist for at least 6 months, and occur in advance of or in concert with mild cognitive impairment. While the detection and description of MBI has been operationalized in the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment -Alzheimer's Association (ISTAART-AA) research diagnostic criteria, there is no instrument that accurately reflects MBI as described. Objective: To develop an instrument based on ISTAART-AA MBI criteria. Methods: Eighteen subject matter experts participated in development using a modified Delphi process. An iterative process ensured items reflected the five MBI domains of 1) decreased motivation; 2) emotional dysregulation; 3) impulse dyscontrol; 4) social inappropriateness; and 5) abnormal perception or thought content. Instrument language was developed a priori to pertain to non-demented functionally independent older adults. Results: We present the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), a 34-item instrument, which can easily be completed by a patient, close informant, or clinician. Conclusion: The MBI-C provides the first measure specifically developed to assess the MBI construct as explicitly described in the criteria. Its utility lies in MBI case detection, and monitoring the emergence of MBI symptoms and domains over time. Studies are required to determine the prognostic value of MBI for dementia development, and for predicting different dementia subtypes.

Here, using an AD and normal aging dataset primarily consisting of three AD multi-center studies (n = 1,781), we compared the effect of APOE and amyloid-beta (A beta) on baseline hippocampal volumes in AD patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and healthy controls. A large sample of healthy adolescents (n = 1,387) was also used to compare hippocampal volumes between APOE groups. Subjects had undergone a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and APOE genotyping. Hippocampal volumes were processed using FreeSurfer. In the AD and normal aging dataset, hippocampal comparisons were performed in each APOE group and in epsilon 4 carriers with positron emission tomography (PET) A beta who were dichotomized (A beta+/A beta-) using previous cut-offs. We found a linear reduction in hippocampal volumes with epsilon 4 carriers possessing the smallest volumes, epsilon 3 carriers possessing intermediate volumes, and epsilon 2 carriers possessing the largest volumes. Moreover, AD and MCI epsilon 4 carriers possessed the smallest hippocampal volumes and control epsilon 2 carriers possessed the largest hippocampal volumes. Subjects with both APOE epsilon 4 and A beta positivity had the lowest hippocampal volumes when compared to A beta-epsilon 4 carriers, suggesting a synergistic relationship between APOE epsilon 4 and A beta. However, we found no hippocampal volume differences between APOE groups in healthy 14-year-old adolescents. Our findings suggest that the strongest neuroanatomic effect of APOE epsilon 4 on the hippocampus is observed in AD and groups most at risk of developing the disease, whereas hippocampi of old and young healthy individuals remain unaffected.

Chronic Osteoporotic Pain in Mice: Cutaneous and Deep Musculoskeletal Pain Are Partially Independent of Bone Resorption and Differentially Sensitive to Pharmacological Interventions	JOURNAL OF OSTEOPOROSIS			English	Article							INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DEGENERATION; OVARIECTOMY-INDUCED HYPERALGESIA; LOW-BACK-PAIN; NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOUSE MODEL; VITAMIN-D; 5-HT1A-LIKE RECEPTOR; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; TACTILE ALLODYNIA	Although the pathological changes in osteoporotic bones are well established, the characterization of the osteoporotic pain and its appropriate treatment are not fully elucidated. We investigated the behavioral signs of cutaneous and deep musculoskeletal pain and physical function; time-dependent changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and the emergence of the behavioral phenotype; and the effects of pharmacological interventions having different mechanisms of action (chronic intraperitoneal administration of pamidronate [0.25mg/kg, 5x/week for 5 weeks] versus acute treatment with intraperitoneal morphine [10mg/kg] and pregabalin [100mg/kg]) in a mouse model of ovariectomized or sham-operated mice 6 months following surgery. We observed reduced BMD associated with weight gain, referred cutaneous hypersensitivity, and deep musculoskeletal pain that persisted for 6 months. Chronic bisphosphonate treatment, 6 months after ovariectomy, reversed bone loss and hypersensitivity to cold, but other behavioral indices of osteoporotic pain were unchanged. While the efficacy of acute morphine on cutaneous pain was weak, pregabalin was highly effective; deep musculoskeletal pain was intractable. In conclusion, the reversal of bone loss alone is insufficient to manage pain in chronic osteoporosis. Additional treatments, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological, should be implemented to improve quality of life for osteoporosis patients.

Measuring Pain for Patients Seeking Physical Therapy: Can Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Help?	PHYSICAL THERAPY			English	Editorial Material							LOW-BACK-PAIN; HUMAN SPINAL-CORD; HUMAN BRAIN; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; BLOOD OXYGENATION; MOTOR CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; MRI; FIBROMYALGIA; ACTIVATION	In the multidisciplinary fields of pain medicine and rehabilitation, advancing techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are used to enhance our understanding of the pain experience. Given that such measures, in some circles, are expected to help us understand the brain in pain, future research in pain measurement is undeniably rich with possibility. However, pain remains intensely personal and represents a multifaceted experience, unique to each individual; no single measure in isolation, fMRI included, can prove or quantify its magnitude beyond the patient self-report. Physical therapists should be aware of cutting-edge advances in measuring the patient's pain experience, and they should work closely with professionals in other disciplines (eg, magnetic resonance physicists, biomedical engineers, radiologists, psychologists) to guide the exploration and development of multimodal pain measurement and management on a patient-by-patient basis. The primary purpose of this perspective article is to provide a brief overview of fMRI and inform physical therapist clinicians of the pros and cons when utilized as a measure of the patient's perception of pain. A secondary purpose is to describe current known factors that influence the quality of fMRI data and its analyses, as well as the potential for future clinical applications relevant to physical therapist practice. Lastly, the interested reader is introduced and referred to existing guidelines and recommendations for reporting fMRI research. (C) 2016 American Physical Therapy Association.

Neuroimaging studies have linked the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) to cognitive insight in people with psychosis. However, the relationship between cognitive insight and structural connectivity between the VLPFC and other brain areas is unknown. Here, we investigated the modulation of cognitive insight on structural covariance networks involving the VLPFC in a first-episode psychosis sample. Fifteen patients with a first-episode psychosis provided magnetic resonance (MR) scans and completed the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS). MR scans were also available for 15 historical controls. Seed-based analysis of structural covariance was conducted using the Mapping Anatomical Correlations Across the Cerebral Cortex (MACACC) methodology, whereby Pearson correlation coefficients were extracted between seed regions in left and right VLPFC and cortical thickness across the brain. Structural covariance maps between groups were compared at each vertex. In first-episode subjects, we evaluated the modulation of BCIS scores on cortical covariance between VLPFC and every other vertex. Findings showed no significant group difference between first-episode psychosis subjects and controls in thickness covariance seeded from left or right VLPFC. However, in first-episode psychosis subjects, a positive association with self-certainty was found in networks seeded from both left and right VLPFC with thickness in medial frontal cortex and right pars triangularis. No significant associations were found for self-reflectiveness. These results suggest that self-certainty, but not self-reflectiveness, positively modulated cortical covariance in a frontal network in patients with a first-episode psychosis.

Decision-making impairments following insular and medial temporal lobe resection for drug-resistant epilepsy	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amygdala; decision-making; epilepsy; gambling; insula; neuropsychology; temporal lobe	VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FINANCIAL RISK-TAKING; IOWA GAMBLING TASK; HUMAN AMYGDALA; LOSS AVERSION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL SYSTEMS; INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS; HUMAN BRAIN; CHOICE	Besides the prefrontal cortex, the insula and medial structures of the temporal lobe are thought to be involved in risky decision-making. However, their respective contributions to decision processes remain unclear due to the lack of studies involving patients with isolated insular damage. We assessed adult patients who underwent resection of the insula (n = 13) or of the anterior temporal lobe (including medial structures) (n = 13) as part of their epilepsy surgery, and a group of healthy volunteers (n = 20), on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and on the Cups Task. Groups were matched on sociodemographic, estimated-IQ and surgery-related factors. On the IGT, patients with temporal lobe resection performed significantly worse than both the insular and healthy control groups, as they failed to learn which decks were advantageous on the long-term. On the Cups Task, the insular and temporal groups both showed impaired sensitivity to expected value in the loss domain, when compared with healthy controls. These findings provide clinical evidence that the insula and mesiotemporal structures are specifically involved in risky decision-making when facing a potential loss, and that temporal structures are also involved in learning the association between behavior and consequences in the long-term.

Since the 1990s, EPO has been used for the treatment of anemia associated with end-stage renal failure and chemotherapy. The erythropoietin receptors were found on other organs such as the brain, spinal cord, heart and skin. In addition, it has been shown that many tissues produce and locally release EPO in response to hypoxic, biochemical and physical stress. In cellular, animal and clinical studies, EPO protects tissues from ischemia and reperfusion injury, has antiapoptotic effects and improves regeneration after injury. In this article, we mainly review the nonhematopoietic effects and new possible clinical indications for EPO.

Building on recent studies supporting a role for developmentally regulated epigenetic variation in the molecular aetiology of schizophrenia, this study aimed to identify epigenetic variation associated with both a diagnosis of schizophrenia and elevated polygenic risk burden for the disease across multiple brain regions. Genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified in 262 post-mortem brain samples, representing tissue from four brain regions (prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum) from 41 schizophrenia patients and 47 controls. We identified multiple disease-associated and polygenic risk score-associated differentially methylated positions and regions, which are not enriched in genomic regions identified in genetic studies of schizophrenia and do not reflect direct genetic effects on DNA methylation. Our study represents the first analysis of epigenetic variation associated with schizophrenia across multiple brain regions and highlights the utility of polygenic risk scores for identifying molecular pathways associated with aetiological variation in complex disease.

Participants were 39 juvenile males, including 10 healthy, nonoffending control subjects and 29 juveniles who sexually offend, comprising 12 juveniles who sexually offend with history of child sexual abuse. Participants completed a clinical assessment and a reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale results showed significantly less difficulties in emotion regulation among controls compared to juveniles who sexually offend, but when self-rating reappraisal abilities during the functional magnetic resonance imaging, all groups obtained comparable results. The imaging results showed no significant differences in fronto-temporal regions between controls and juveniles who sexually offend. Differences were found in other regions indicated in cognitive control, working memory, and emotional processing between controls and juveniles who sexually offend as well as between juveniles who sexually offend and those without history of child sexual abuse. Findings suggest that juveniles who sexually offend are capable of emotion regulation.

Variations of traditional VFT, involving unconstrained word production and increased retrieval times, may provide further data regarding the executive, attentional, mnemonic, and linguistic abilities involved in VFT. As such, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of age and school type on the performance of 6- to 12-year-old children in unconstrained, phonemic, and semantic VFT. The VFT were administered to 460 participants. The effects of age and school type on verbal fluency (VF) performance were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests (p.05). A repeated-measures analysis was also used to evaluate VF performance over time (p.05). Main effects of age and school type were identified on all measures (effect sizes ranged from .05 to .32, p.05). VF scores increased with age and were higher among private school students. The influence of age on VFT may be associated with the development of executive functions. The impact of type of school on VF performance may be explained by the greater availability of cognitive stimulation (semantic knowledge) provided by private schools and families with better socioeconomic levels.

The objective of this study was to develop a chicken intestinal ligated loop model in order to compare the virulence of various C. perfringens strains recovered from consecutive ABF flocks with and without NE. Intestinal loops were surgically prepared in 10 anaesthetized specific-pathogen-free chickens and alternately inoculated with C. perfringens isolates or brain heart infusion (BHI) media. Histological lesion scoring was performed for each loop. All strains from NE-affected flocks induced histological lesions compatible with NE whereas inoculation of loops with a commensal C. perfringens strain or BHI did not. Among inoculated strains, CP0994 (netB-positive and cpb2-positive) and CP-2003-1256 (netB-positive) demonstrated mean histological lesion scores significantly higher (P<0.01) than those obtained with a commensal strain or BHI whereas strain CP1073 (netB-negative and cpb2-positive) induced intestinal lesions without significantly higher scores. In loops where villi were colonized by Gram-positive rods, significantly higher (P<0.01) mean histological lesion scores were observed. This result supports the hypothesis that colonization of the intestinal mucosa by C. perfringens is a critical step in the pathogenesis of NE. Finally, we demonstrated the importance of controlling virulent C. perfringens strains in ABF chicken flocks as a highly virulent strain can be present in consecutive flocks with NE and possibly affect multiple flocks.

Effect sizes were medium-large. Participants with lower GCS scores performed more poorly when recognizing fearful dynamic facial expressions. Emotion recognition from auditory domains was preserved following TBI, irrespective of severity. All groups performed equally on control tasks, indicating no perceptual disorders. Although emotional recognition from vocal and musical expressions was preserved, no correlation was found across auditory domains.Conclusions: This preliminary study may contribute to improving comprehension of emotional recognition following TBI. Future studies of larger samples could usefully include measures of functional impacts of recognition deficits for fearful facial expressions. These could help refine interventions for emotional recognition following a brain injury.

Visual Loss from Choroidal Melanoma Mimicking Neurological Syndromes	CASE REPORTS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Melanoma; Choroid; Masquerade	COLLABORATIVE OCULAR MELANOMA	Melanoma of the eye is rare, but can mimic a range of disorders. This report highlights 2 cases of choroidal melanoma with vision loss mimicking neurological diagnoses. The first patient is a 41-year-old white male with a known history of multiple sclerosis and a previous episode of optic neuritis in the right eye, who presented with a 6-month history of decreased vision in the same eye, and occasional photopsiae. He was treated with 2 courses of oral steroids for presumed recurrent optic neuritis. After a temporary improvement in his symptoms, his vision worsened, following which he had a head MRI, which revealed a solid intraocular mass. He was subsequently diagnosed with a choroidal melanoma for which he was treated successfully with ruthenium-106 plaque brachytherapy. The second patient is a 57year-old female, who presented with a progressive cerebellar syndrome under investigation by the neurology service, as well as decreased vision in the right eye. Her visual acuity gradually deteriorated and her neurological assessment, which included a PET-CT, revealed uptake in the right eye. The diagnosis of a choroidal melanoma was made, and following conservative treatment with proton beam radiotherapy, she had an enucleation of the eye. Intraocular tumours can masquerade as many different entities. Unexplained unilateral visual loss, especially if it is atypical for a neurological syndrome, should prompt dilated fundoscopy and referral to an ophthalmologist.

Assessing social cognition: age-related changes in moral reasoning in childhood and adolescence	CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST			English	Review						Moral reasoning; developmental sensitivity; age-related changes; social cognition; neuropsychological assessment	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; EARLY ADULTHOOD; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; NEURAL BASIS; JUDGMENT; CHILDREN	Objective: There is increasing recognition that socio-cognitive skills, such as moral reasoning (MR), are affected in a wide range of developmental and neuropsychological conditions. However, the lack of appropriate measures available to neuropsychologists poses a challenge for the direct assessment of these skills. This study sought to explore age-related changes in MR using an innovative visual tool and examine the developmental sensitivity of the task. Method: To address some of the methodological limitations of traditional measures of MR, a novel, visual task, the Socio-Moral Reasoning Aptitude Level (So-Moral), was used to evaluate MR in 216 healthy participants aged 6-20years. Results: The findings show a linear increase in MR from childhood to late adolescence with significant group differences between childhood (6-8years) and preadolescence (9-11years), and between early adolescence (12-14years) and middle adolescence (15-17years). Conclusions: Interpreted in light of current brain development research, the results highlight age-related changes in MR that offer insight into typical MR development and opportunities for comparisons with clinical populations. The findings also provide evidence of the potential of the So-Moral as a developmentally appropriate measure of MR throughout childhood and adolescence.

The pathophysiology of respiratory failure and the potential risks of iNO differ substantially in preterm infants, necessitating specific study in this population. Objectives To determine effects of treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) on death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) or other serious brain injury and on adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm newborn infants with hypoxic respiratory failure. Owing to substantial variation in study eligibility criteria, which decreases the utility of an overall analysis, we divided participants post hoc into three groups: (1) infants treated over the first three days of life because of defects in oxygenation, (2) preterm infants with evidence of pulmonary disease treated routinely with iNO and (3) infants treated later (after three days of age) because of elevated risk of BPD. Search methods We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Healthstar and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library through January 2016. We also searched the abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies. Selection criteria Eligible for inclusion were randomised and quasi-randomised studies in preterm infants with respiratory disease that compared effects of iNO gas versus control, with or without placebo. Data collection and analysis We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of evidence. Main results We found 17 randomised controlled trials of iNO therapy in preterm infants. We grouped these trials post hoc into three categories on the basis of entry criteria: treatment during the first three days of life for impaired oxygenation, routine use in preterm babies along with respiratory support and later treatment for infants at increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We performed no overall analyses. Eight trials providing early rescue treatment for infants on the basis of oxygenation criteria demonstrated no significant effect of iNO on mortality or BPD (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.01; 958 infants). Four studies examining routine use of iNOin infants with pulmonary disease reported no significant reduction in death or BPD (typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.02; 1924 infants), although this small effect approached significance. Later treatment with iNO based on risk of BPD (three trials) revealed no significant benefit for this outcome in analyses of summary data (typical RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 1075 infants). Investigators found no clear effect of iNO on the frequency of all grades of IVH nor severe IVH. Early rescue treatment was associated with a non-significant 20% increase in severe IVH. We found no effect on the incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment. Authors' conclusions iNO does not appear to be effective as rescue therapy for the very ill preterm infant. Early routine use of iNO in preterm infants with respiratory disease does not prevent serious brain injury or improve survival without BPD. Later use of iNO to prevent BPD could be effective, but current 95% confidence intervals include no effect; the effect size is likely small (RR 0.92) and requires further study.

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) gas has been investigated as treatment for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Objectives To determine whether treatment of hypoxaemic term and near-term newborn infants with iNO improves oxygenation and reduces rate of death and use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or affects long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to January 2016), Embase (1980 to January 2016) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to January 2016). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. We contacted the principal investigators of studies published as abstracts to ascertain the necessary information. Selection criteria Randomised studies of iNO in term and near-term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure, with clinically relevant outcomes, including death, use of ECMO and oxygenation. Data collection and analysis We analysed trial reports to assess methodological quality using the criteria of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We tabulated mortality, oxygenation, short-term clinical outcomes (particularly use of ECMO) and long-term developmental outcomes. Statistics: For categorical outcomes, we calculated typical estimates for risk ratios and risk differences. For continuous variables, we calculated typical estimates for weighted mean differences. We used 95% confidence intervals and assumed a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. Main results We found 17 eligible randomised controlled studies that included term and near-term infants with hypoxia. Ten trials compared iNO versus control (placebo or standard care without iNO) in infants with moderate or severe severity of illness scores (Ninos 1996; Roberts 1996; Wessel 1996; Davidson 1997; Ninos 1997; Mercier 1998; Christou 2000; Clark 2000; INNOVO 2007; Liu 2008). Mercier 1998 compared iNO versus control but allowed back-up treatment with iNO for infants who continued to satisfy the same criteria for severity of illness after two hours. This trial enrolled both preterm and term infants but reported most results separately for the two groups. Ninos 1997 studied only infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. One trial compared iNO versus high-frequency ventilation (Kinsella 1997). Six trials enrolled infants with moderate severity of illness scores (oxygenation index (OI) or alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO(2))) and randomised them to immediate iNO treatment or iNO treatment only after deterioration to more severe criteria (Barefield 1996; Day 1996; Sadiq 1998; Cornfield 1999; Konduri 2004; Gonzalez 2010). Inhaled nitric oxide appears to have improved outcomes in hypoxaemic term and near-term infants by reducing the incidence of the combined endpoint of death or use of ECMO (high-quality evidence). This reduction was due to a reduction in use of ECMO (with number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 5.3); mortality was not affected. Oxygenation was improved in approximately 50% of infants receiving iNO. The OI was decreased by a (weighted) mean of 15.1 within 30 to 60 minutes after the start of therapy, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) was increased by a mean of 53 mmHg. Whether infants had clear echocardiographic evidence of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) did not appear to affect response to iNO. Outcomes of infants with diaphragmatic hernia were not improved; outcomes were slightly, but not significantly, worse with iNO (moderate-quality evidence). Infants who received iNO at less severe criteria did not have better clinical outcomes than those who were enrolled but received treatment only if their condition deteriorated. Fewer of the babies who received iNO early satisfied late treatment criteria, showing that earlier iNO reduced progression of the disease but did not further decrease mortality nor the need for ECMO (moderate-quality evidence).

Training of fluid and crystallized intelligence: A game-based approach in adolescents presenting with below average IQ	COGENT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						cognition; intervention; intelligence; fluid reasoning; borderline intelligence	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; WORKING-MEMORY; PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES; DRUG-USE; CHILDREN; KINDERGARTEN; INTERVENTION; SKILLS; GAINS	Purpose: This study aimed to determine whether two aspects of global intelligence, fluid (Gf) and crystallized (Gc) intelligence, could be improved in adolescents with below-average IQ by using a game-based cognitive intervention. Method: Thirty-four adolescents participated in cognitive interventions targeting either Gf (GAMEf, n = 12) or Gc (GAMEc, n = 12) or were assigned to a control group (n = 10). Interventions took place two days a week for one hour, over 8 weeks. Standard neuropsychological assessments were conducted prior to and after the intervention to measure possible improvements in Gc (using the Wechsler Scales, WISC-IV), and Gf (using the Test Of Non verbal Intelligence, TONI-4). Results: Adolescents in the GAMEf program improved on measures of Gf, while adolescents in the GAMEc program improved on both measures of Gc and Gf. Conclusions: The results indicate that individuals with below average IQ can improve their fluid and crystallized intellectual functioning through direct cognitive training using commercially available games, suggesting that intellectual functioning at this level may be more susceptible to remediation than previously thought. These findings could have direct implications for cognitive intervention and learning potential in clinical populations with below average IQ.

Not surprisingly, A beta and tau proteins are currently the major therapeutic research targets for AD treatment. Unfortunately, nothing but moderate success has emerged from such therapeutic approaches. With this in mind, we will discuss deep brain stimulation as a promising therapeutic strategy that aims to restore brain activity. Lastly, in the scope of cognitive deficit restoration, we will discuss the relevance of the limbic formation as a promising neuroanatomical target for deep brain stimulation. Methods: Immunohistochemistry for modified tau (phosphorylated at Ser199-202-Thr205 labelled by the antibody AT8) was performed on paraffin-embedded human brain sections providing a detailed characterization of NFT pathology. Results: Abnormally phosphorylated tau protein is the key common marker in several brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Pick Disease, Down syndrome and frontotemporal dementia and is capable of affecting synaptic events that are critical for memory formation. With this in mind, therapeutic strategies aiming to restore synaptic events could offer better outcomes. Conclusion: The humble success of current therapeutic strategies along with the lack of basic knowledge of the brain disease mechanisms calls for alternatives that benefit patients in the present moment. One of particular interest is the neurostimulation strategy that is already a well-established treatment for several movement disorders and when compared to current Alzheimer's therapeutic strategies, deep brain stimulation does not directly interfere with the normal protein function, therefore increasing the probability of success.

Perioperative outcome comparison with mechanical aortic valve replacement in a propensity-matched cohort	INTERACTIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND THORACIC SURGERY			English	Article						Ross procedure; Aortic valve replacement; Mechanical aortic prosthesis; Propensity score	ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; UNITED-STATES; YOUNG-ADULTS; SURGERY; MORTALITY; ANEURYSMS; AUTOGRAFT	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare perioperative outcomes in young adults following isolated Ross procedure versus mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) in a high-volume centre. METHODS: From 2007 to 2015, 337 elective isolated mechanical AVRs and 137 Ross procedures were performed in young adults (< 65 years) at our centre. Using a 1: 1 propensity score match analysis, 140 patients were included in the study (n = 70 in each group). Perioperative outcomes were defined using STS guidelines. The primary outcome was operative mortality. RESULTS: Median age was 52 [14] years and EuroSCORE II was 1.0 [0.4]%. There were no mortalities in the two groups. There were no differences in the incidence of myocardial injury (0% overall) and neurological complications (0.7% overall). Three (4%) reinterventions for bleeding were required in the Ross cohort versus six (9%) in the mechanical AVR cohort (P = 0.49). A significant increase in serum creatinine (> 2-fold increase) was more commonly observed after the Ross procedure (11 vs 1%; P = 0.03), but there was no significant difference in the rate of temporary dialysis. Twenty-seven patients (39%) required >= 1 blood product transfusion in the Ross group, whereas 21 patients (31%) did so in the mechanical AVR group (P = 0.47). Median hospital length of stay was similar in both the groups (6 days). CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences in mortality or major perioperative outcomes in adults undergoing an isolated Ross procedure or mechanical AVR.

The underlying causes, extent, and consequences of such dysfunctions remain to be characterized. Astrocyte-astrocyte communication occurs principally through gap junction channels primarily formed by connexin 30 and 43 (CX30 and CX43). We previously reported decreased connexin expression in the prefrontal cortex of depressed suicides. In the present study, we investigated whether these changes are mediated by epigenetic regulation, and expanded gene expression quantifications to other cortical and subcortical regions to assess the regional distribution of connexion disruptions in depressed suicides. Methods: The expression of CX30 and CX43 was measured by real-time PCR in samples of neocortex (Brodmann areas 4 and 17), cerebellar cortex, mediodorsal thalamus, and caudate nucleus of 22 depressed suicides and 22 matched sudden-death controls. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to measure enrichment levels of the repressive chromatin mark H3K9me3 in the prefrontal cortex. Results: We found a consistent downregulation of connexin genes in all regions examined, except in the cerebellum where an increase in the expression of CX30 was measured and using chromatin immunoprecipitation we observed an enrichment of H3K9me3 for both Cx30 and Cx43 in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: Our study shows widespread astrocytic CX gene repression in depressed suicides that is mediated, at least in part, through epigenetic mechanisms. Taken together, these findings support the notion of widespread cerebral astrocytic dysfunction in major depressive disorder.

Clinical Complexity and Use of Antipsychotics and Restraints in Long-Term Care Residents with Parkinson's Disease	JOURNAL OF PARKINSONS DISEASE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Resident Assessment Instrument; minimum data set; nursing home; restraints; antipsychotics	MINIMUM DATA SET; NURSING-HOME RESIDENTS; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE SCALE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HEALTH-CARE; NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; PHYSICAL RESTRAINT; HEART-FAILURE; UNITED-STATES	Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and/or Parkinsonism are affected by a complex burden of comorbidity. Many ultimately require institutional care, where they may be subject to the application of physical restraints or the prescription of antipsychotic medications, making them more vulnerable to adverse outcomes. Objectives: The objectives of this paper are to: 1) describe the clinical complexity of older institutionalized persons with PD; and 2) examine patterns and predictors of restraint use and prescription of antipsychotics in this population. Methods: Population-based cross-sectional cohort study. Residents with PD and/or Parkinsonism living in long-term care (LTC) facilities in 6 Canadian provinces and 1 Northern Territory and Complex Continuing Care (CCC) facilities in Manitoba and Ontario, Canada. The RAI MDS 2.0 instrument was used to assess all LTC residents and CCC residents. Clinical characteristics and the prevalence of major comorbidities were examined. Multivariate modeling was used to identify the characteristics of PD residents most associated with the prescription of antipsychotics and the use of restraints in LTC and CCC facilities. Results: Residents with PD in LTC and CCC exhibit a high prevalence of dementia, major psychiatric disorders, stroke, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus. More than 90% of LTC and CCC residents with PD had cognitive impairment; with more than half having moderate to severe impairment. Residents with PD were more likely to receive antipsychotics than those without PD. Antipsychotic use was associated with psychosis and aggressive behaviours, but also with unsteady gait and higher comorbidity and medication count. Similarly, although more common in CCC than LTC facilities, both psychosis and aggressive behaviours were associated with restraint use, as was greater cognitive and functional impairment, and urinary incontinence. Younger age, male gender, and lower physician access were all associated with greater antipsychotic and restraint use. Conclusions: LTC and CCC residents with PD are very complex medically. Use of antipsychotics and restraints is common, and their use is often associated with factors other than psychosis or aggression.

Although the cumulative and long-term effects of multiple concussions are now well documented on cognitive and motor function, little is known about their effects on emotion recognition. Recent studies have suggested that concussion can result in emotional sequelae, particularly in females and multi-concussed athletes. The objective of this study was to investigate sex-related differences in emotion recognition in asymptomatic male and female multi-concussed athletes. Methods: We tested 28 control athletes (15 males) and 22 multi-concussed athletes (10 males) more than a year since the last concussion. Participants completed the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, a neuropsychological test battery and a morphed emotion recognition task. Pictures of a male face expressing basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) morphed with another emotion were randomly presented. After each face presentation, participants were asked to indicate the emotion expressed by the face. Results: Results revealed significant sex by group interactions in accuracy and intensity threshold for negative emotions, together with significant main effects of emotion and group. Conclusions: Male concussed athletes were significantly impaired in recognizing negative emotions and needed more emotional intensity to correctly identify these emotions, compared to same-sex controls. In contrast, female concussed athletes performed similarly to same-sex controls. These findings suggest that sex significantly modulates concussion effects on emotional facial expression recognition.

J	Vezina-Audette, R; Tremblay, M; Carbonetto, S				Vezina-Audette, Raphael; Tremblay, Mathieu; Carbonetto, Salvatore			Laminin is instructive and calmodulin dependent kinase II is non-permissive for the formation of complex aggregates of acetylcholine receptors on myotubes in culture	MATRIX BIOLOGY			English	Article						Synapse formation; Laminin; MuSK; Electrical activity; Dystroglycan; Integrin; CaMKII	DYSTROPHIN-ASSOCIATED GLYCOPROTEIN; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION FORMATION; MOTOR-NERVE TERMINALS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; IN-VIVO; POSTSYNAPTIC APPARATUS; ALPHA-DYSTROGLYCAN; SYNAPSE FORMATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; MUTANT MICE	Previous work has shown that myotubes cultured on laminin-coated substrates form complex aggregates of synaptic proteins that are similar in shape and composition to neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Here we show that laminin instructs the location of complex aggregates which form, only on the lower surface when laminin is coated onto culture dishes but over the entire cell when laminin is added in solution. Silencing of myotubes by agents that block electrical activity (tetrodotoxin, verapamil) or by inhibitors of calmodulin dependent kinase (CaMKII) render the myotube permissive for the formation of complex aggregates. Treatment with laminin alone will facilitate the formation of complex aggregates hours later when myotubes are made permissive by inhibiting CaMKII. The AChR agonist carbachol disperses pre formed aggregates suggesting that non-permissiveness may involve active dispersal of AChRs. The permissive period requires ongoing protein synthesis. The latter may reflect a requirement for rapsyn, which turns over rapidly, and is necessary for aggregation. Consistent with this geldanamycin, an agent that increases rapsyn turnover disrupts complex aggregates. Agrin is well known to induce small clusters of AChRs but does not induce complex aggregates even though aggregate formation requires MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by agrin. Dystroglycan (DG) is the major laminin receptor mediating complex aggregate formation with some contribution from beta 1 integrins. In addition, there is a pool of CaMKII associated with DG. We discuss how these permissive and instructive mechanisms bear on NMJ formation in vivo. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present study addressed the question whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied after motor training improves consolidation of explicit motor sequence learning in healthy older humans. In the first experiment, anodal or cathodal tDCS to the left primary motor cortex, anodal tDCS to premotor cortex, or sham tDCS was applied immediately after completion of a finger sequence learning task. Performance was retested at 8 and 22 hours after the initial training session. Whereas all groups achieved similar performance at the end of training, off-line improvements differed between groups at later retesting, depending on the type of intervention. Relative to the other 3 interventions, anodal tDCS to primary motor cortex (M1) led to performance improvements already at retesting 8 hours after initial learning and were maintained on the next day. In the second experiment, effects of the timing of post-training anodal tDCS to M1 with respect to the end of training were studied. Participants received anodal tDCS of M1 immediately or 60 or 120 minutes after training and were retested on sequence performance 8 hours post training. Only application of tDCS immediately after the end of training, but not after 1 or 2 hours, enhanced off-line consolidation.

Motor sequence learning remains intact with age, but sleep-dependent consolidation is impaired, suggesting that memory deficits for procedural skills are specifically impacted by age-related changes in sleep. Age-related changes in spindles may be responsible for impaired motor sequence learning consolidation, but the morphological basis for this deficit is unknown. Here, we found that gray matter in the hippocampus and cerebellum was positively correlated with both sleep spindles and offline improvements in performance in young participants but not in older participants. These results suggest that age-related changes in gray matter in the hippocampus relate to spindles and may underlie agerelated deficits in sleep-related motor sequence memory consolidation. In this way, spindles can serve as a biological marker for structural brain changes and the related memory deficits in older adults. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, using a custom-built two-photon microscopy system, we present microscopic measurements of oxygen partial pressure (PO2) in cortical microvessels and tissue of anesthetizedmice during 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced epileptic seizures. Investigating epileptic events, we characterized the distribution of the "initial dip" in PO2 in arterioles, venules, and tissue near the 4-AP injection site. Our results reveal a correlation between the percent change in PO2 during the "initial dip" and the diameter of nearest arterioles and venules.

We present 6 cases of chemo-naive patients diagnosed with PD pNECs who refused systemic chemotherapy and received targeted therapies with sunitinib (37.5 mg/day, 5 patients) or the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus (10 mg/day, 1 patient) as the first-line treatment. We evaluated the drugs' toxicities and survival. The median age of the patients was 55 years (4 males, 2 females, functioning tumor in 1 of 6 patients). The median of the Ki67 index was 45% (range 20-80). Targeted therapies were combined with somatostatin analogues in 4 of 6 patients (30 mg Sandostatine LAR monthly). Toxicities (acute and late) were manageable and no toxicities necessitated cessation of treatment. All patients had progression-free survival during the 15-month treatment and an overall survival of more than 2 years after diagnosis. Even though this is a small cohort of selected patients, we conclude that sunitinib or everolimus are both feasible and safe and have encouraging results of efficacy as first-line therapies for PD pNEC.

Rationale and study design of RESPITE: An open-label, phase 3b study of riociguat in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who demonstrate an insufficient response to treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors	RESPIRATORY MEDICINE			English	Article						Pulmonary arterial hypertension; sGC stimulator; Soluble guanylate cyclase; Riociguat	SOLUBLE GUANYLATE-CYCLASE; LONG-TERM EXTENSION; NITRIC-OXIDE; THERAPY; AMBRISENTAN; EXPRESSION; PATENT-2; REGISTRY; DISEASE; REVEAL	Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who do not have an adequate response to therapy with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i) may have insufficient synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). These patients may respond to a direct soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator such as riociguat. RESPITE (NCT02007629) was an open-label, multicenter, uncontrolled, single arm phase 3b study of riociguat in patients with PAH who demonstrated an insufficient response to treatment with PDE-5i. Insufficient response was defined as World Health Organization functional class (WHO FC) III despite PDE-5i therapy for at least 90 days; 6-min walk distance (6MWD) of 165-440 m, and right-heart catheterization showing mean pulmonary artery pressure >30 mmHg, cardiac index <3.0 L/min/m(2), and pulmonary vascular resistance >400 dyn s cm(-5). PAH patients with an insufficient response to stable doses of sildenafil or tadalafil-either as monotherapy or in combination with an endothelin receptor antagonist for at least 90 days were switched to riociguat for 24 weeks. Starting at 1.0 mg TID, the dose of riociguat was increased during the 8-week titration phase in 0.5-mg increments in 2-week intervals if the patient had no signs or symptoms of hypotension. In the ensuing 16-week maintenance phase, riociguat was continued at the optimal individual dose. All efficacy outcomes were exploratory and include change from baseline to 24 weeks in 6MWD, cardiac index, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, WHO FC, and quality of life and the proportion of patients with clinical worsening. The following biomarkers were to be measured: cGMP, asymmetric dimethyl arginine, growth-differentiation factor-15, and ST2. Results from RESPITE will help to determine if PAH patients who do not respond to PDE-5i are likely to benefit from treatment with an sGC stimulator. The study may also identify biomarkers that are able to suggest which patients are more likely to respond to sGC stimulators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Signature Consortium	The DSM5/RDoC debate on the future of mental health research: implication for studies on human stress and presentation of the signature bank	STRESS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON THE BIOLOGY OF STRESS			English	Article						Mental health; DSM5; RDoC; biological signature; dimensions; developmental psychopathology; development; environment	RESEARCH DOMAIN CRITERIA; INFORMATION-SYSTEM PROMIS; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; DSM-5 FIELD TRIALS; UNITED-STATES; DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; NIMH RESEARCH; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; PSYCHIATRIC-DIAGNOSIS	In 2008, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) announced that in the next few decades, it will be essential to study the various biological, psychological and social signatures of mental disorders. Along with this new signature approach to mental health disorders, modifications of DSM were introduced. One major modification consisted of incorporating a dimensional approach to mental disorders, which involved analyzing, using a transnosological approach, various factors that are commonly observed across different types of mental disorders. Although this new methodology led to interesting discussions of the DSM5 working groups, it has not been incorporated in the last version of the DSM5. Consequently, the NIMH launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework in order to provide new ways of classifying mental illnesses based on dimensions of observable behavioral and neurobiological measures. The NIMH emphasizes that it is important to consider the benefits of dimensional measures from the perspective of psychopathology and environmental influences, and it is also important to build these dimensions on neurobiological data. The goal of this paper is to present the perspectives of DSM5 and RDoC to the science of mental health disorders and the impact of this debate on the future of human stress research. The second goal is to present the Signature Bank developed by the Institut Universitaire en Sante Mentale de Montreal (IUSMM) that has been developed in line with a dimensional and transnosological approach to mental illness.

Methods: 13 Typically Developing (TD) and 13 children with unilateral spastic CP performed elbow extension/flexion at different speeds. Elbow angle and velocity were recorded using a 3D motion analysis system. The acceleration and deceleration phases of extension were analyzed. Co-activation of the brachioradialis/triceps and biceps/triceps pairs was computed for each phase from surface electromyographic signals. Statistical analysis involved linear mixed effects models and Spearman rank correlations. Results: During the acceleration phase, there was strong co-activation in both muscle pairs in the children with CP, which increased with speed. Co-activation was weak in the TD children and it was not speed-dependent. During the deceleration phase, co-activation was strong and increased with speed in both groups; co-activation of brachioradialis/triceps was stronger in children with CP, and was negatively correlated with extension range and positively correlated with flexor spasticity. Conclusions: Abnormal patterns of co-activation in children with CP were found throughout the entire movement. Co-activation was specific to the movement phase and to each flexor muscle. Significance: Co-activation in children with CP is both physiological and pathological. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Treatments for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP): an overview of systematic reviews	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN TREATMENT; TECHNOLOGY-ASSESSMENT SUBCOMMITTEE; IMMUNE-MEDIATED POLYNEUROPATHIES; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DOUBLE-BLIND; PLASMA-EXCHANGE; NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS; INTEROBSERVER AGREEMENT	Background Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic progressive or relapsing and remitting disease that usually causes weakness and sensory loss. The symptoms are due to autoimmune inflammation of peripheral nerves. CIPD affects about 2 to 3 per 100,000 of the population. More than half of affected people cannot walk unaided when symptoms are at their worst. CIDP usually responds to treatments that reduce inflammation, but there is disagreement about which treatment is most effective. Objectives To summarise the evidence fromCochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of any treatment for CIDP and to compare the effects of treatments. Methods We considered all systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment for any form of CIDP. We reported their primary outcomes, giving priority to change in disability after 12 months. Two overview authors independently identified published systematic reviews for inclusion and collected data. We reported the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. Two other review authors independently checked review selection, data extraction and quality assessments. On 31 October 2016, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (in theCochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus for systematic reviews of CIDP. We supplemented the RCTs in the existing CSRs by searching on the same date for RCTs of any treatment of CIDP (including treatment of fatigue or pain in CIDP), in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus. Main results Five CSRs met our inclusion criteria. We identified 23 randomised trials, of which 15 had been included in these CSRs. We were unable to compare treatments as originally planned, because outcomes and outcome intervals differed. Corticosteroids It is uncertain whether daily oral prednisone improved impairment compared to no treatment because the quality of the evidence was very low (1 trial, 28 participants). According to moderate-quality evidence (1 trial, 41 participants), six months' treatment with high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone did not improve disability more than daily oral prednisolone. Observational studies tell us that prolonged use of corticosteroids sometimes causes serious side-effects. Plasma exchange According to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 59 participants), twice-weekly plasma exchange produced more short-term improvement in disability than sham exchange. In the largest observational study, 3.9% of plasma exchange procedures had complications. Intravenous immunoglobulin According to high-quality evidence (5 trials, 269 participants), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) produced more short-term improvement than placebo. Adverse events were more common with IVIg than placebo (high-quality evidence), but serious adverse events were not (moderate-quality evidence, 3 trials, 315 participants). One trial with 19 participants provided moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in short-term improvement of impairment with plasma exchange in comparison to IVIg. There was little or no difference in short-termimprovement of disability with IVIg in comparison to oral prednisolone (moderate-quality evidence; 1 trial, 29 participants) or intravenous methylprednisolone (high-quality evidence; 1 trial, 45 participants). One unpublished randomised open trial with 35 participants found little or no difference in disability after three months of IVIg compared to oral prednisone; this trial has not yet been included in a CSR. We know from observational studies that serious adverse events related to IVIg do occur. Other immunomodulatory treatments It is uncertain whether the addition of azathioprine (2 mg/kg) to prednisone improved impairment in comparison to prednisone alone, as the quality of the evidence is very low (1 trial, 27 participants). Observational studies show that adverse effects truncate treatment in 10% of people. According to low-quality evidence (1 trial, 60 participants), compared to placebo, methotrexate 15mg/kg did not allowmore participants to reduce corticosteroid or IVIg doses by 20%. Serious adverse events were no more common with methotrexate than with placebo, but observational studies show that methotrexate can cause teratogenicity, abnormal liver function, and pulmonary fibrosis. According to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 77 participants), interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) in comparison to placebo, did not allow more people to withdraw from IVIg. According to moderate-quality evidence, serious adverse events were no more common with IFN beta-1a than with placebo. We know of no other completed trials of immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory agents for CIDP. Other treatments We identified no trials of treatments for fatigue or pain in CIDP. Adverse effects Not all trials routinely collected adverse event data; when they did, the quality of evidence was variable. Adverse effects in the short, medium, and long term occur with all interventions. We are not able to make reliable comparisons of adverse events between the interventions included in CSRs. Authors' conclusions We cannot be certain based on available evidence whether daily oral prednisone improves impairment compared to no treatment. However, corticosteroids are commonly used, based on widespread availability, low cost, very low-quality evidence from observational studies, and clinical experience. The weakness of the evidence does not necessarily mean that corticosteroids are ineffective. High-dose monthly oral dexamethasone for six months is probably no more or less effective than daily oral prednisolone. Plasma exchange produces short-termimprovement in impairment as determined by neurological examination, and probably produces short-termimprovement in disability. IVIg produces more short-term improvement in disability than placebo and more adverse events, although serious side effects are probably no more common than with placebo. There is no clear difference in short-term improvement in impairment with IVIg when compared with intravenous methylprednisolone and probably no improvement when compared with either oral prednisolone or plasma exchange. According to observational studies, adverse events related to difficult venous access, use of citrate, and haemodynamic changes occur in 3% to 17% of plasma exchange procedures. It is uncertain whether azathioprine is of benefit as the quality of evidence is very low. Methotrexate may not be of benefit and IFN beta-1a is probably not of benefit. We need further research to identify predictors of response to different treatments and to compare their long-term benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness. There is a need for more randomised trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, routes of administration, and treatments for symptoms of CIDP.

The Antidiabetic Potential of Quercetin: Underlying Mechanisms	CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review						Flavonoids; insulin resistance; glucose uptake; gluconeogenesis; glucose absorption; insulin secretion; AMPK; glucolipotoxicity	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; ALPHA-AMYLASE INHIBITORS; HIGH-FAT DIET; GLUCOSE-UPTAKE; BETA-CELLS; FLAVONOID QUERCETIN; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MEDICINAL-PLANT; GRAPE JUICE; RAT-LIVER	The dramatic increase in modern lifestyle diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diabetes has renewed researchers' interest to explore nature as a source of novel therapeutic agents. Flavonoids are a large group of polyphenols that are widely present in the human diet. They have shown promising therapeutic activities against a wide variety of ailments. One of the most widely distributed and most extensively studied flavonoid is the flavonol quercetin. Its powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are well documented and are thought to play a role in treating and protecting against diseases including diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this review is to shed light on quercetin therapeutic potential as an antidiabetic agent. Quercetin was reported to interact with many molecular targets in small intestine, pancreas, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver to control whole-body glucose homeostasis. Mechanisms of action of quercetin are pleiotropic and involve the inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption, insulin secretory and insulin-sensitizing activities as well as improved glucose utilization in peripheral tissues. Initial studies suggested poor bioavailability of quercetin. However, recent reports have shown that quercetin was detected in the plasma after food or supplements consumption and has a long half-life in human body. Despite the wealth of in vitro and in vivo results supporting the antidiabetic potential of quercetin, its efficacy in diabetic human subjects is yet to be explored.

A wide range of ocular findings has been described including uveitis from every anatomical location. Most commonly, MS-associated uveitis presents as a chronic bilateral intermediate type of uveitis. Although the underlying mechanism remains unknown, a relationship between MS and uveitis suggests autoimmune and genetic predispositions. This manuscript aims to update the clinician on the multiple clinical portraits as well as the latest therapeutic advances in the field. Areas covered: The authors systematically describe the epidemiology, the pathophysiological hypotheses, the clinicalmanifestations, and the treatment options of MS-associated uveitis. A thorough literature review of the last 10 years was conducted using PubMed. Expert commentary: Limited literature is currently available on MS-associated uveitis. To date, the presence of MS-associated uveitis is not considered a sign of MS disease activity nor severity. While the actual treatment of MS-associated uveitis is similar to other noninfectious uveitic entities, future research avenues could lead to potential combined treatment of both neurologic and ophthalmologic disease.

Analysis of the spinal nerve roots in relation to the adjacent vertebral bodies with respect to a posterolateral vertebral body replacement procedure	JOURNAL OF CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION AND SPINE			English	Article						Expandable cage; magnetic resonance imaging; posterior approach expansion ratio; thoracolumbar spine; vertebral body replacement; vertebroplasty	POSTERIOR APPROACH; EXPANDABLE CAGE; LUMBAR SPINE; THORACOLUMBAR SPINE; RECONSTRUCTION; ANTERIOR; VERTEBRECTOMY; MRI; INSTRUMENTATION; MYELOGRAPHY	Objective: This study aims to improve the understanding of the anatomic variations along the thoracic and lumbar spine encountered during an all-posterior vertebrectomy, and reconstruction procedure. This information will help improve our understanding of human spine anatomy and will allow better planning for a vertebral body replacement (VBR) through either a transpedicular or costotransversectomy approach. Summary of Background Data: The major challenge to a total posterior approach vertebrectomy and VBR in the thoracolumbar spine lies in the preservation of important neural structures. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis. Hundred normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spinal studies (T1uL5) on sagittal T2-weighted MRI images were studied to quantify: (1) mid-sagittal vertebral body (VB) dimensions (anterior, midline, and posterior VB height), (2) midline VB and associated intervertebral discs height, (3) mean distance between adjacent spinal nerve roots (DNN) and mean distance between the inferior endplate of the superior vertebrae to its respective spinal nerve root (DNE), and (4) posterior approach expansion ratio (PAER). Results: (1) The mean anterior VB height gradually increased craniocaudally from T1 to L5. The mean midline and posterior VB height showed a similar pattern up to L2. Mean posterior VB height was larger than the mean anterior VB height from T1 to L2, consistent with anterior wedging, and then measured less than the mean anterior VB height, indicating posterior wedging. (2) Midline VB and intervertebral disc height gradually increased from T1 to L4. (3) DNN and DNE were similar, whereby they gradually increased from T1 to L3. (5) Mean PAER varied between 1.69 (T12) and 2.27 (L5) depending on anatomic level. Conclusions: The dimensions of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and discs vary greatly. Thus, any attempt at carrying out a VBR from a posterior approach should take into account the specifications at each spinal level.

We sought to describe red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practices in trauma patients who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a post-hoc analysis of a prospective, 6-month observational study in 30 PICUs. We studied a total of 580 patients aged less than 18 years who had been admitted to a PICU for more than 48 hours, including 95 who were trauma patients. RESULTS: Trauma patients more frequently received transfusion before PICU admission (p<0.001), were older (p<0.0001), and more frequently were mechanically ventilated (p<0.05). In the PICU, trauma patients received more transfusions (55% vs. 37%; p<0.001), although admission hemoglobin levels were similar in both groups (p<0.86). The mean (+/- standard deviation) pretransfusion hemoglobin level in the PICU was 9.062.4 g/dL for trauma patients compared with 8.362.4 g/dL for nontrauma patients (p=0.09). Among the trauma patients, transfusion was associated with younger age, higher Pediatric Logistic Organ Regression scores, mechanical ventilation, bleeding, and transfusion before PICU admission. Multivariate regression demonstrated that receiving an RBC transfusion before admission was strongly associated with receiving a blood transfusion in the PICU (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: Trauma patients are at high risk for receiving an RBC transfusion both before and during their PICU stay, despite a similar transfusion threshold compared with nontrauma patients. Transfusion before PICU admission is a strong determinant, suggesting ongoing bleeding that will require re-transfusion. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether a restrictive transfusion strategy can safely be considered in these patients.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 41 patients who had received tumor-bed FSRS (5 fractions) or SRT (10 fractions) after resection of brain metastasis between 2005 and 2015 was performed. All resection cavities were treated with a frameless linear accelerator-based system. Patients who underwent subtotal resection, single-dose SRS to the resection cavity, or were treated with a fractionation schedule other than 5 or 10 fractions, were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were treated with 5 fractions and 15 patients with 10 fractions. The median planning target volume was 19.78 cm(3) (12.3-28 cm(3)) to the 5-fraction group and 29.79 cm(3) (26.3-47.6 cm(3)) to the 10-fraction group (P=0.020). The 1-year and 2-year local control rates for all patients were 89.4% and 77.1%, respectively, and 89.6% and 78.6% were free from distant intracranial progression, respectively. No difference was observed in local control or freedom from distant intracranial progression between the 5-fraction or 10-fraction groups. The median overall survival was 28.27 months (95% confidence interval, 19.42-37.12) for all patients. No patient developed necrosis at the resection cavity. CONCLUSIONS: Fractionation offers the potential to exploit the different biological responses between neoplastic and normal tissues to ionizing radiation. The use of 5 daily doses of 5-6 Gy or 10 daily doses of 3 Gy is a good strategy to have a reasonable local control and avoid neurotoxicity.

Interestingly, ethanol can be rewarding as well as aversive; we therefore investigated whether ethanol exposure alters pacemaker firing or glutamate receptor signaling in LHb neurons in vitro and also whether LHb activity in vivo might contribute to the acquisition of conditioned place aversion to ethanol. Surprisingly, in epithalamic slices, low doses of ethanol (1.4 mM) strongly accelerated LHb neuron firing (by similar to 60%), and ethanol's effects were much reduced by blocking glutamate receptors. Ethanol increased presynaptic glutamate release, and about half of this effect was mediated by dopamine subtype 1 receptors (D1Rs) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways. In agreement with these findings, c-Fos immunoreactivity in LHb regions was enhanced after a single administration of a low dose of ethanol (0.25 g/kg i.p.). Importantly, the same dose of ethanol in vivo also produced strong conditioned place aversion, and this was prevented by inhibiting D1Rs or neuronal activity within the LHb. By contrast, a higher dose (2 g/kg) led to ethanol conditioned place preference, which was enhanced by inhibiting neuronal activity or D1Rs within the LHb and suppressed by infusing aminomethylphosphonic acid or the D1R agonist SKF38393 within the LHb. Our in vitro and in vivo observations show, for the first time, that ethanol increases LHb excitation, mediated by D1R and glutamate receptors, and may underlie a LHb aversive signal that contributes to ethanol-related aversion.

First, is the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus internus (GPi) the ideal target? In summary, both targets are equally effective in improving the motor symptoms of PD. STN allows a greater medications reduction, while GPi exerts a direct antidyskinetic effect. Second, are there further potential targets? Ventral intermediate nucleus DBS has significant long-term benefit for tremor control but insufficiently addresses other motor features of PD. DBS in the posterior subthalamic area also reduces tremor. The pedunculopontine nucleus remains an investigational target. Third, should DBS for PD be performed unilaterally, bilaterally or staged? Unilateral STN DBS can be proposed to asymmetric patients. There is no evidence that a staged bilateral approach reduces the incidence of DBS-related adverse events.

In the aging population, PM is essential for maintaining independent daily living. Introduced as a simple and quick way to assess PM in clinical settings, the envelope task has to date received very limited empirical and practical interest. Methods: The present study investigated the task's clinical utility in detecting PM impairment in a sample composed of 49 healthy older adults (OA), 41 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 64 individuals with amnestic and nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) of heterogeneous etiology: 17 of idiopathic nature, 20 presenting an idiopathic rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, and 27 patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Results: The envelope task was highly sensitive and specific in discriminating Alzheimer's disease patients from OA. Although it was specific in distinguishing MCI individuals from OA, its sensitivity was modest, especially in patients presenting a nonamnestic MCI subtype. Conclusions: Given its high specificity and simple low-cost administration procedure, the envelope task is a promising instrument for clinicians who seek to rapidly assess PM impairment in their daily practice.

We performed a retrospective review of deaths following a non-traumatic DBI between 2008 and 2012. 160 patients were reviewed; 26 were treated with DC and 134 received standard care. There was no relationship between DC and mechanism of death, (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.44-3.17). Prospective studies are required to confirm these preliminary finding.

We used fMRI to compare activations induced in the visual cortex by musical notation, written words and other classes of objects, in professional musicians and in musically naive controls. First, irrespective of expertise, selective activations for music were posterior and lateral to activations for words in the left occipito-temporal cortex. This indicates that symbols characterized by different visual features engage distinct cortical areas. Second, musical expertise increased the volume of activations for music and led to an anterolateral displacement of word-related activations. In musicians, there was also a dramatic increase of the brain-scale networks connected to the music-selective visual areas. Those findings reveal that acquiring a double visual expertise involves an expansion of category-selective areas, the development of novel long-distance functional connectivity, and possibly some competition between categories for the colonization of cortical space.

Thus far, little is known about the factors that contribute to a lower Cw but it was shown that lower body strength training could reduce the Cw. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between lower body strength and the Cw in a cohort of healthy older adults. A total of 48 participants were included in this study (70.7 +/- 5.4 years). After a geriatric and a neuropsychological assessment, participants underwent a fitness testing protocol which included a maximal oxygen uptake test, assessment of the Cw at 4 km h(-1) on a treadmill, an isokinetic maximal strength test for the ankle, knee and hip joints and a body composition assessment. Relationships between strength variables and the Cw were assessed with partial correlations and linear regression analyses. Hip extensors and hip flexors peak torque was significantly correlated with the Cw (r = -0.36 and -0.32, respectively; p < 0.05). A tendency towards significance was identified for the ankle plantar flexors (r = -0.25, p = 0.09). Hip extensors peak torque was the only significant neuromuscular parameter included in the linear regression analysis (p < 0.05). These results show that hip extensors are an important muscle group with regards to the Cw measured on a treadmill in this cohort of healthy older adults.

PARADIGM HF Investigators Comm	Dementia-related adverse events in PARADIGM-HF and other trials in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE			English	Article						Heart failure; ARNI; Dementia; Neprilysin inhibition	BASE-LINE CHARACTERISTICS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEPRILYSIN INHIBITION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; RANDOMIZED TRIAL; ENALAPRIL; RISK; ALISKIREN	Aims Inhibition of neprilysin, an enzyme degrading natriuretic and other vasoactive peptides, is beneficial in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), as shown in PARADIGM-HF which compared the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan with enalapril. As neprilysin is also one of many enzymes clearing amyloid-beta. peptides from the brain, there is a theoretical concern about the long-term effects of sacubitril/valsartan on cognition. Therefore, we have examined dementia-related adverse effects (AEs) in PARADIGM-HF and placed these findings in the context of other recently conducted HFrEF trials. Methods and results In PARADIGM-HF, patients with symptomatic HFrEF were randomized to sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg b.i.d. or enalapril 10 mg b.i.d. in a 1:1 ratio. We systematically searched AE reports, coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), using Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) with 'broad' and 'narrow' preferred terms related to dementia. In PARADIGM-HF, 8399 patients aged 18-96 years were randomized and followed for a median of 2.25 years (up to 4.3 years). The narrow SMQ search identified 27 dementia-related AEs: 15 (0.36%) on enalapril and 12 (0.29%) on sacubitril/valsartan [hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-1.59]. The broad search identified 97 (2.30%) and 104 (2.48%) AEs (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75-1.37), respectively. The rates of dementia-related AEs in both treatment groups in PARADIGM-HF were similar to those in three other recent trials in HFrEF. Conclusion We found no evidence that sacubitril/valsartan, compared with enalapril, increased dementia-related AEs, although longer follow-up may be necessary to detect such a signal and more sensitive tools are needed to detect lesser degrees of cognitive impairment. Further studies to address this question are warranted.	[Cannon, Jane A.; Shen, Li; Jhund, Pardeep S.; McMurray, John J.

Referent control and motor equivalence of reaching from standing	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motor control; arm movement; redundancy; adaptation; compensation; interjoint coordination; synergy	ARM-TRUNK COORDINATION; THRESHOLD CONTROL; DECEREBRATE CAT; STRETCH REFLEX; MOVEMENTS; ADAPTATION; POSTURE; CONFIGURATION; HYPOTHESIS; POINT	Motor actions may result from central changes in the referent body configuration, defined as the body posture at which muscles begin to be activated or deactivated. The actual body configuration deviates from the referent configuration, particularly because of body inertia and environmental forces. Within these constraints, the system tends to minimize the difference between these configurations. For pointing movement, this strategy can be expressed as the tendency to minimize the difference between the referent trajectory (R-T) and actual trajectory (Q(T)) of the effector (hand). This process may underlie motor equivalent behavior that maintains the pointing trajectory regardless of the number of body segments involved. We tested the hypothesis that the minimization process is used to produce pointing in standing subjects. With eyes closed, 10 subjects reached from a standing position to a remembered target located beyond arm length. In randomly chosen trials, hip flexion was unexpectedly prevented, forcing subjects to take a step during pointing to prevent falling. The task was repeated when subjects were instructed to intentionally take a step during pointing. In most cases, reaching accuracy and trajectory curvature were preserved due to adaptive condition-specific changes in interjoint coordination. Results suggest that referent control and the minimization process associated with it may underlie motor equivalence in pointing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor actions may result from minimization of the deflection of the actual body configuration from the centrally specified referent body configuration, in the limits of neuromuscular and environmental constraints. The minimization process may maintain reaching trajectory and accuracy regardless of the number of body segments involved (motor equivalence), as confirmed in this study of reaching from standing in young healthy individuals. Results suggest that the referent control process may underlie motor equivalence in reaching.

It innervates the skin over the external ear, the angle of the mandible and the parotid gland. It communicates with the ansa cervicalis. Great auricular neuralgia is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice and can be refractory. We present a new approach using ultrasound-guided nerve blocks. Case: We present a case of a 41-year-old female with paroxysmal ear pain accompanied by dysautonomia, tingling in the tongue, dysphagia, dysarthria and abdominal symptoms. No significant findings were found on cervical and brain imaging. The patient responded partially to a great auricular nerve block. A combined approach using this block with facet block of C2 and C3 induced a more pronounced and prolonged benefit. Conclusion: Great auricular neuralgia is not often encountered in practice and can be accompanied by symptoms originating from the ansa cervicalis network. A combined approach of nerve blocks can be considered in refractory cases.

The primary objective of this study was to identify predictors of DOAC choice compared with warfarin for patients who are starting a new oral anticoagulant (OAC) for atrial fibrillation (AF). The secondary objective was to describe the proportion of DOAC prescriptions in new users of OAC for AF. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Canada. Medical records of adult patients hospitalized in any medical units between October 1st, 2011 and October 1st, 2014, who were newly prescribed an OAC for non valvular AF were systematically reviewed. Baseline characteristics of warfarin and DOAC users were compared and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was completed to identify predictors of DOAC use. Variables included in the multiple regression analysis were: age, hypertension, diabetes, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, CHADS2 score of 2 or more, creatinine clearance 30mL/min or more, polypharmacy, concomitant use of ASA or clopidogrel, and prescription by a neurologist. RESULTS: Among OAC users (144 patients on DOAC and 295 patients on warfarin), older age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97; 95%CI 0.95-0.98), peripheral arterial disease (OR: O.41; 95%CI: 0.21-0.82), polypharmacy (OR: 0.30;95%CI:0.10-0.89), and concomitant use of clopidogrel (OR: 0.19;95%CI:0.070.56) decreased the probability of DOAC use. Prescription by a neurologist (OR: 2.77;95%CI:1.34-5.76) and an estimated creatinine clearance of at least 30mL/min (OR: 3.53;95%CI:1.18-10.57) increased the likelihood of DOAC prescription. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observational study finding that concomitant use of clopidogrel reduced the likelihood of DOAC utilization while prescription by a neurologist increased the probability of receiving a DOAC over warfarin in patients with AF.

Etiologic factors include conditions or drugs that decrease brain dopamine, melanocortin, oxytocin, and norepinephrine levels and augment brain serotonin, endocannabinoid, prolactin, and opioid levels. Symptoms include lack or loss of motivation to participate in sexual activity due to absent or decreased spontaneous desire, sexual desire in response to erotic cues or stimulation, or ability to maintain desire or interest through sexual activity for at least 6 months, with accompanying distress. Treatment follows a biopsychosocial model and is guided by history and assessment of symptoms. Sex therapy has been the standard treatment, although there is a paucity of studies assessing efficacy, except for mindfulness-based cognitive behavior therapy. Bupropion and buspirone may be considered off-label treatments for HSDD, despite limited safety and efficacy data. Menopausal women with HSDD may benefit from off-label testosterone treatment, as evidenced by multiple clinical trials reporting some efficacy and short-term safety. Currently, flibanserin is the only Food and Drug Administrationeapproved medication to treat premenopausal women with generalized acquired HSDD. Based on existing data, we hypothesize that all these therapies alter central inhibitory and excitatory pathways. In conclusion, HSDD significantly affects quality of life in women and can effectively be managed by health care providers with appropriate assessments and individualized treatments.

Here, we report that excessive alcohol consumption increases the translation of downstream targets of mTORC1, including collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rodents. We show that alcohol-mediated induction of CRMP-2 translation is mTORC1 dependent, leading to increased CRMP-2 protein levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alcohol intake also blocks glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta)-phosphorylation of CRMP-2, which results in elevated binding of CRMP-2 to microtubules and a concomitant increase in microtubule content. Finally, we show that systemic administration of the CRMP-2 inhibitor lacosamide, or knockdown of CRMP-2 in the NAc decreases excessive alcohol intake. These results suggest that CRMP-2 in the NAc is a convergent point that receives inputs from two signaling pathways, mTORC1 and GSK-3 beta, that in turn drives excessive alcohol-drinking behaviors.

Functional Requirements for Heparan Sulfate Biosynthesis in Morphogenesis and Nervous System Development in C-elegans	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							HEREDITARY MULTIPLE EXOSTOSES; PIONEER AXON MIGRATIONS; SUPPRESSOR EXT GENES; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; TUMOR SUPPRESSORS; CELL-MIGRATION; TOUT-VELU; VULVAL MORPHOGENESIS; SKIN FIBROBLASTS; GLYPICAN LON-2	The regulation of cell migration is essential to animal development and physiology. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans shape the interactions of morphogens and guidance cues with their respective receptors to elicit appropriate cellular responses. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans consist of a protein core with attached heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, which are synthesized by glycosyltransferases of the exostosin (EXT) family. Abnormal HS chain synthesis results in pleiotropic consequences, including abnormal development and tumor formation. In humans, mutations in either of the exostosin genes EXT1 and EXT2 lead to osteosarcomas or multiple exostoses. Complete loss of any of the exostosin glycosyltransferases in mouse, fish, flies and worms leads to drastic morphogenetic defects and embryonic lethality. Here we identify and study previously unavailable viable hypomorphic mutations in the two C. elegans exostosin glycosyltransferases genes, rib-1 and rib-2. These partial loss-of-function mutations lead to a severe reduction of HS levels and result in profound but specific developmental defects, including abnormal cell and axonal migrations. We find that the expression pattern of the HS copolymerase is dynamic during embryonic and larval morphogenesis, and is sustained throughout life in specific cell types, consistent with HSPGs playing both developmental and post-developmental roles. Cell-type specific expression of the HS copolymerase shows that HS elongation is required in both the migrating neuron and neighboring cells to coordinate migration guidance. Our findings provide insights into general principles underlying HSPG function in development.

However, the potential risk of tumorigenicity and low survival rate of the implanted cells limit the clinical use of ADSC. Cell-free extracts from ADSC (ADSC-E) may be a feasible approach that could overcome these limitations. Here, we aim to explore the potential usage of ADSC-E in treating rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We demonstrated that intravenous (IV) injection of ADSC-E remarkably reduces the ischemic lesion and number of apoptotic neurons as compared to other control groups. Although ADSC and ADSC-E treatment results in a similar degree of a long-term clinical beneficial outcome, the dynamics between two ADSC-based therapies are different. While the injection of ADSC leads to a relatively mild but prolonged therapeutic effect, the administration of ADSC-E results in a fast and pronounced clinical improvement which was associated with a unique change in the molecular signature suggesting that potential mechanisms underlying different therapeutic approach may be different. Together these data provide translational evidence for using protein extracts from ADSC for treating stroke.

This paper presents a new method for prediction of the depth, length, and width of the scour hole downstream ski-jump buckets based on granular computing (GrC) technique. This method employs various independent hydraulic, morphologic, and geotechnical factors to predict dependent scour parameters. Evaluation of the results indicated that the dependent scour parameters are affected more by the discharge, falling height, and mean sediment size and less by the lip angle of the bucket. Analyses of the obtained results demonstrated the high accuracy of the GrC, as the predicted values were in good agreement with the observations. Furthermore, statistical equations were derived based on the multiple linear regressions (MLR) to model the relationship between the scour parameters. Despite our expectations, the results of MLR, as a simple model, were excellent as compared to GrC. MLR results were also superior to those of well-known empirical equations presented to date. The GrC gives the best performance for the prediction of scour parameters; however, MLR model is also suggested for any real cases because it can be more applicable by practical engineers than GrC as a black box model.

Clinicians have long been aware that patients with COPD have problems with cognition and are susceptible to mood (depression) and anxiety disorders. With the increasing awareness of COPD as a multisystem disorder, many studies have evaluated the prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions in patients with COPD. This review presents evidence regarding the prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions (cognitive disorders/impairment, depression/anxiety) in COPD, their risk factors, and their impact on relevant outcomes. It also discusses both assessment and treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions and makes recommendations for improved screening and treatment. The findings suggest that clinicians caring for patients with COPD must become familiar with diagnosing these comorbid conditions and that future treatment has the potential to impact these patients and thereby improve COPD outcomes.

Aldosterone Does Not Predict Cardiovascular Events Following Acute Coronary Syndrome in Patients Initially Without Heart Failure	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						acute coronary syndrome; aldosterone; morbidity/mortality	ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; CELL MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTORS; NEUROHUMORAL ACTIVATION; ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; SURVIVAL; TRIAL; HOSPITALIZATION; TORCETRAPIB; DALCETRAPIB; INHIBITION	Background- Aldosterone may have adverse effects in the myocardium and vasculature. Treatment with an aldosterone antagonist reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure (HF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, most patients with acute coronary syndrome do not have advanced HF. Among such patients, it is unknown whether aldosterone predicts cardiovascular risk. Methods and Results- To address this question, we examined data from the dal-OUTCOMES trial that compared the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor dalcetrapib with placebo, beginning 4 to 12 weeks after an index acute coronary syndrome. Patients with New York Heart Association class II (with LVEF < 40%), III, or IV HF were excluded. Aldosterone was measured at randomization in 4073 patients. The primary outcome was a composite of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. Hospitalization for HF was a secondary endpoint. Over a median follow-up of 37 months, the primary outcome occurred in 366 patients (9.0%), and hospitalization for HF occurred in 72 patients (1.8%). There was no association between aldosterone and either the time to first occurrence of a primary outcome (hazard ratio for doubling of aldosterone 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.09, P=0.34) or hospitalization for HF (hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI 0.96-1.99, P=0.08) in Cox regression models adjusted for covariates. Conclusions- In patients with recent acute coronary syndrome but without advanced HF, aldosterone does not predict major cardiovascular events.

Furthermore, an accurate assessment of tumour volume aids in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment response. Currently, segmentation is performed manually by an expert, and because of the time required, a rough estimate of tumour volume is often done instead. We propose a semi-automatic segmentation method that makes use of machine learning within a deformable surface model. Specifically, we propose a deformable model that uses a voxel classifier based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to interpret the CT image. The new deformable model considers vertex displacement towards apparent tumour boundaries and regularization that promotes surface smoothness. During operation, a user identifies the target tumour and the mesh then automatically delineates the tumour from the MLP processed image. The method was tested on a dataset of 40 abdominal CT scans with a total of 95 colorectal metastases collected from a variety of scanners with variable spatial resolution. The segmentation results are encouraging with a Dice similarity metric of and demonstrates that the proposed method can deal with highly variable data. This work motivates further research into tumour segmentation using machine learning with more data and deeper neural networks.

We report the immunological and pathological characterization of a case of central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory demyelination after NTZ discontinuation. Objective: To understand the pathophysiology of this neuroinflammatory condition. Methods: Antemortem blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was compared with postmortem pathological studies, as well as with novel flow cytometry characterization of immune cells isolated from the CNS parenchyma. Results: Pathological analysis of the brain revealed the presence of innumerable active inflammatory demyelinating lesions typical of immunopathological pattern II. Monocytes/macrophages and B cells were enriched in the CNS parenchyma compared to the CSF. Numerous plasma cells were present in the lesions, but CD8 T lymphocytes were predominant in the parenchyma, as opposed to CD4 in the CSF. CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed high levels of adhesion molecules, granzyme B (GzB), interferon-gamma (IFN-.), and interleukin (IL)-17. Conclusions: Our results underline the differences in immune cell populations between the CSF and the CNS parenchyma, and suggest that aggressive immunosuppressive therapy targeting both T and B lymphocytes is warranted to control the overwhelming CNS inflammation.

Very few performance-based measures used in occupational therapy have established test-retest reliability coefficients. Objectives of Study. This study presents the test-retest reliability of the task and operation scores of a performance-based measure of independence in everyday activities called the ADL Profile. Methods. 20 adults with severe traumatic brain injury (mean age 28.4 years; SD 9.9) were tested on two occasions with the 17 tasks (personal care, home, and community) of the ADL Profile. Kappa coefficients were calculated on both task and operation scores (formulating goal, planning, executing, and goal attainment). Findings. Test-retest reliability was moderate to almost perfect on task and operation scores of all 17 tasks. The three tasks with only moderate agreement were more novel and complex (e.g., making a budget) for the participants. Relevance to Clinical Practice. Use of measures that are stable over time is essential for treatment planning and research. Repeat testing is crucial with clients that require long periods of treatment (acute care, rehabilitation, and community integration) and multiple measurements of ADL independence. Limitations. The small sample size is a limit of the study. Recommendations for Further Research. Alternate versions of the three tasks with only moderate agreement would need to be developed and other psychometric properties established.

With the DWT, we examined how the ERG ON and OFF components are modulated by the stimulus intensity and/or duration. Methods: Discrete wavelet transform descriptors (20, 40 Hz and 40: 20-Hz ratio) were extracted from ERGs evoked to 25 combinations of flash durations (150-5 ms) and strengths (0.8-2.8 log cd. m(-2)). Results: In ERGs evoked to the 150-ms stimulus (to separate the ON and OFF ERGs), the 40: 20-Hz ratio of ON ERGs (mean +/- SD: 0.49 +/- 0.04) was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) than that of OFF ERGs (1.71 +/- 0.18) owing to a significantly (P < 0.05) higher contribution of the 20 and 40 Hz components to the ON and OFF ERGs, respectively. With brighter stimuli, the ON and OFF components increased similarly (P < 0.05). While progressively shorter flashes had no impact (P < 0.05) on the ON component, it exponentially enhanced (P < 0.05) the OFF component. Conclusions: Discrete wavelet transform allows for an accurate determination of ON and OFF retinal pathways even in ERGs evoked to a short flash. To our knowledge, the significant OFF facilitatory effect evidenced with shorter stimuli has not previously been reported. Translational Relevance: The DWT approach should offer a rapid, easy, and reproducible approach to retrospectively and prospectively evaluate the function of the retinal ON and OFF pathways using the standard (short-flash duration) clinical ERG stimulus.

Better understanding of sexual dimorphism in neurologic diseases such as PD has been announced as a research priority. The aim of our study was to determine independent sex differences in clinical manifestations and subtypes, psychosocial functioning, quality of life (QoL) and its domains between male and female individuals with PD. Patients and methods: A comprehensive list of demographics, motor symptoms and subtypes, nonmotor features, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychosocial functioning and general aspects of daily life was assessed in 157 individuals (108 males and 49 females) with idiopathic PD. In order to control for potential confounding variables, we applied Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) to explore the strength of each feature to discriminate male and female patients with PD. Results: While no sex difference was found in the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score and cumulative daily dose of levodopa, females had significantly more severe anxiety (mean difference = 2.2 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.5-4.0], P= 0.011), worse nutritional status (23.8 [standard deviation, SD = 4.2] vs 25.8 [SD = 2.6], P= 0.003) and poorer QoL (28.3 [SD = 15.7] vs 17.9 [SD = 14.2], P<0.001). Based on multivariate discriminant analysis, emotional well-being, bodily discomfort, social support, mobility and communication domains of HRQoL, together with anxiety, depression and psychosocial functioning, were the strongest features with more severe/worse status in females after adjustment for potential statistical confounders. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of sexual dimorphism in PD. Anxiety, depression, specific domains of HRQoL (mobility, emotional well-being, social support and bodily discomfort) and psychosocial functioning were significantly worse in female individuals with PD. Sexual dimorphism in PD highlights the features that are more likely to be affected in each sex and should be specifically targeted when managing male and female individuals with PD.

Programmatic efforts to institute and integrate OHCA best care practices from the bystander response through to the in hospital phase have been associated with improved patient outcomes. This Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement was developed to provide comprehensive yet practical recommendations to guide the in-hospital care of OHCA patients. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system recommendations have been generated. Recommendations on initial care delivery on the basis of presenting rhythm, appropriate use of targeted temperature management, postarrest angiography, and revascularization in the initial phase of care of the OHCA patient are detailed within this statement. In addition, further description of best practices on sedation, use of neuromuscular blockade, oxygenation targets, hemodynamic monitoring, and blood product transfusion triggers in the critical care environment are contained in this document. Last, discussion of optimal care systems for the OHCA patient is provided. These guidelines aim to serve as a practical guide to optimize the in-hospital care of survivors of cardiac arrest and encourage the adoption of "best practice" protocols and treatment pathways. Emphasis is placed on integrating these aspects of in-hospital care as part of a postarrest "care bundle." It is hoped that this position statement can assist all medical professionals who treat survivors of cardiac arrest.

Strong recommendations included: 1) measuring brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal fragment of proBNP (NT-proBNP) before surgery to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation in patients who are 65 years of age or older, are 45-64 years of age with significant cardiovascular disease, or have a Revised Cardiac Risk Index score >= 1; 2) against performing preoperative resting echocardiography, coronary computed tomography angiography, exercise or cardiopulmonary exercise testing, or pharmacological stress echocardiography or radionuclide imaging to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation; 3) against the initiation or continuation of acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of perioperative cardiac events, except in patients with a recent coronary artery stent or who will undergo carotid endarterectomy; 4) against alpha(2) agonist or beta-blocker initiation within 24 hours before surgery; 5) withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker starting 24 hours before surgery; 6) facilitating smoking cessation before surgery; 7) measuring daily troponin for 48 to 72 hours after surgery in patients with an elevated NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before surgery or if there is no NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before surgery, in those who have a Revised Cardiac Risk Index score >= 1, age 45-64 years with significant cardiovascular disease, or age 65 years or older; and 8) initiating of long-term acetylsalicylic acid and statin therapy in patients who suffer myocardial injury/infarction after surgery.

Dave			Current and Future Status of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Review							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MEMBRANE-OXYGENATION; CARDIOGENIC-SHOCK; PROPENSITY ANALYSIS; SUPPORT; SURVIVAL; ADULTS; METAANALYSIS; EXPERIENCE; RESCUE	Numerous series, propensity-matched trials, and meta-analyses suggest that appropriate use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) for in-hospital cardiac arrest (INCA) can be lifesaving. Even with an antecedent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) duration in excess of 45 minutes, 30-day survival with favourable neurologic outcome using E-CPR is approximately 35%-45%. Survival may be related to age, duration of CPR, or etiolcigy. Associated complications include sepsis, renal failure, limb and neurologic complications, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. However, methodological biases including small sample size, selection bias, publication bias, and inability to control for confounders-in these series prevent definitive conclusions. As such, the 2015 American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines update recommended E-CPR as a Level of Evidence IIb recommendation in appropriate cases. The absence of high-quality evidence presents an opportunity for clinician/scientists to generate practice-defining data through collaborative investigation and prospective trials. A multidisciplinary dialogue is required to standardize the field and promote multicentre investigation of E-CPR with data sharing and the development of a foundation for high-quality trials. The objectives of this review are to (1) provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of currently available studies investigating the use of E-CPR in patients with IHCA and highlight knowledge gaps; (2) create a framework for the standardization of terminology, clinical practice, data collection, and investigation of E-CPR for patients with IHCA that will help ensure congruence in future work in this area; and (3) propose suggestions to guide future research by the cardiovascular community to advance this important field.

We herein review the literature concerning preoperative optimization of these patients. Salient findings are that end-organ dysfunction and medication should be optimized before surgery. Specifically: (1) reversible causes of anemia should be treated and a preoperative hemoglobin level of 100 g/L obtained; (2) renal function and volume status should be optimized; (3) liver function must be carefully evaluated; (4) nutritional status should be assessed and cachexia treated to achieve a preoperative albumin level of at least 30 g/L and a body mass index > 20; and (5) medication adjustments performed, such as withholding inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system before surgery and continuing, but not starting, beta-blockers. Levels of natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and N-terminal proBNP) provide additional prognostic value and therefore should be measured. In addition, individual patient's risk should be objectively assessed using standard formulas such as the EuroSCORE-II or Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk scores, which are simple and validated for various cardiac surgeries, including left ventricular assist device implantation. When patients are identified as high risk, preoperative hemodynamic optimization might be achieved with the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter and hemodynamic-based tailored therapy. Finally, a prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pump might be considered in certain circumstances to decrease morbidity and even mortality, like in some high risk heart failure patients who undergo cardiac surgery, whereas routine preoperative inotropes are not recommended and should be reserved for patients in shock, except maybe for levosimendan.

Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest has evolved significantly since the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia. It now relies on a multimodal approach and a minimal observation period of 72 hours is usually advocated. However, when brain injury is severe and the prognosis considered dismal, patients become eligible for organ donation. Patients with severe anoxic encephalopathy might evolve toward brain death and be candidates for donation after brain death. In the presence of severe brain injury without brain death criteria, when withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy is considered, patients might be eligible for donation after cardiocirculatory death. The diagnosis of brain death, the differences between donation after brain death and donation after cardiocirculatory death, family approach, and donor management in the intensive care unit are discussed. Because these are increasingly encountered situations in the cardiac intensive care unit, it is essential that physicians involved in cardiac critical care be familiar with these concepts.

A cross-sectional study was used to evaluate the reaction time for 204 children. Normal values for each age group were obtained. The results of multiple linear regressions showed a decrease in the reaction time values with age, and a significant change occurring between six and eight years of age. No difference in reaction time was obtained between boys and girls. Ruler drop method is an easy to use test and the results of this study provide a normative data for age groups 6-12 years ranging from 214.2 ms to 248.8 ms. These values can serve as a reference to screen children with delayed reaction time. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Aranha, V. P.; Moitra, M.; Narkeesh, K.; Samuel, A.

We report the case of a 20-year-old woman having lost her driver's license after sustaining a moderate TBI. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an in-simulator training program with automated feedback on driving performance in a TBI individual. Methods: The participant underwent an initial and a final in-simulator driving assessment and 11 in-simulator training sessions with driving-specific automated feedbacks. Driving performance (simulation duration, speed regulation and lateral positioning) was measured in the driving simulator. Results: Speeding duration decreased during training sessions from 1.50 +/- 0.80 min (4.16 +/- 2.22%) to 0.45 +/- 0.15 min (0.44 +/- 0.42%) but returned to initial duration after removal of feedbacks for the final assessment. Proper lateral positioning improved with training and was maintained at the final assessment. Time spent in an incorrect lateral position decreased from 18.85 min (53.61%) in the initial assessment to 1.51 min (4.64%) on the final assessment. Conclusion: Driving simulators represent an interesting therapeutic avenue. Considerable research efforts are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this method for driving rehabilitation of individuals who have sustained a TBI.

Development and Implementation of a Registry of Patients Attending Multidisciplinary Pain Treatment Clinics: The Quebec Pain Registry	PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT; IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; CATASTROPHIZING SCALE; PHYSICAL FUNCTION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; VALIDATION; QUALITY; TRIALS; INTERFERENCE; FIBROMYALGIA	The Quebec Pain Registry (QPR) is a large research database of patients suffering from various chronic pain (CP) syndromes who were referred to one of five tertiary care centres in the province of Quebec (Canada). Patients were monitored using common demographics, identical clinical descriptors, and uniform validated outcomes. This paper describes the development, implementation, and research potential of the QPR. Between 2008 and 2013, 6902 patients were enrolled in the QPR, and data were collected prior to their first visit at the pain clinic and six months later. More than 90% of them (mean age +/- SD: 52.76 +/- 4.60, females: 59.1%) consented that their QPR data be used for research purposes. The results suggest that, compared to patients with serious chronic medical disorders, CP patients referred to tertiary care clinics are more severely impaired in multiple domains including emotional and physical functioning. The QPR is also a powerful and comprehensive tool for conducting research in a "real-world" context with 27 observational studies and satellite research projects which have been completed or are underway. It contains data on the clinical evolution of thousands of patients and provides the opportunity of answering important research questions on various aspects of CP (or specific pain syndromes) and its management.

J	Drisdelle, BL; Aubin, S; Jolicoeur, P				Drisdelle, Brandi Lee; Aubin, Sebrina; Jolicoeur, Pierre			Dealing with ocular artifacts on lateralized ERPs in studies of visual-spatial attention and memory: ICA correction versus epoch rejection	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Analysis/statistical methods; EEG; ERPs; Eye movements	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENT ARTIFACT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS; HUMAN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; EXPRESS SACCADES; BLIND SEPARATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; EEG; REMOVAL	The objective of the present study was to assess the robustness and reliability of independent component analysis (ICA) as a method for ocular artifact correction in electrophysiological studies of visual-spatial attention and memory. The N2pc and sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), electrophysiological markers of visual-spatial attention and memory, respectively, are lateralized posterior ERPs typically observed following the presentation of lateral stimuli (targets and distractors) along with instructions to maintain fixation on the center of the visual search for the entire trial. Traditionally, trials in which subjects may have displaced their gaze are rejected based on a cutoff threshold, minimizing electrophysiological contamination by saccades. Given the loss of data resulting from rejection, we examined ocular correction by comparing results using standard fixation instructions against a condition where subjects were instructed to shift their gaze toward possible targets. Both conditions were analyzed using a rejection threshold and ICA correction for saccade activity management. Results demonstrate that ICA conserves data that would have otherwise been removed and leaves the underlying neural activity intact, as demonstrated by experimental manipulations previously shown to modulate the N2pc and the SPCN. Not only does ICA salvage and not distort data, but also large eye movements had only subtle effects. Overall, the findings provide convincing evidence for ICA correction for not only special cases (e.g., subjects did not follow fixation instruction) but also as a candidate for standard ocular artifact management in electrophysiological studies interested in visual-spatial attention and memory.

The genetic cause is still unknown in many patients, precluding genetic counselling and better understanding of the physiopathology. To identify novel genetic causes of congenital myopathies, exome sequencing was performed in three consanguineous families. We identified two homozygous frameshift mutations and a homozygous nonsense mutation in the mitogen-activated protein triple kinase ZAK. In total, six affected patients carry these mutations. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and transcriptome analyses suggested nonsense mRNA decay as a main impact of mutations. The patients demonstrated a generalized slowly progressive muscle weakness accompanied by decreased vital capacities. A combination of proximal contractures with distal joint hyperlaxity is a distinct feature in one family. The low endurance and compound muscle action potential amplitude were strongly ameliorated on treatment with anticholinesterase inhibitor in another patient. Common histopathological features encompassed fibre size variation, predominance of type 1 fibre and centralized nuclei. A peculiar subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria pointing towards the centre of the fibre was a novel histological hallmark in one family. These findings will improve the molecular diagnosis of congenital myopathies and implicate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling as a novel pathway altered in these rare myopathies.

Spatially focalized alterations in excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory neurochemical ratios within specific functional subdivisions of the basal ganglia, may lead to the expression of diverse motor and non-motor features as manifested in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Current treatment strategies are often unsatisfactory thus provoking the need for further elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology. In view of (i) the close spatio-temporal synergy exhibited between excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory neurotransmitter systems; (ii) the crucial role played by glutamate (Glu) in tonic/phasic dopaminergic signalling; and (iii) the interdependent metabolic relationship exhibited between Glu and GABA via glutamine (Gln); we postulated that glutamatergic signalling is related to the pathophysiology of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. As such, we examined the neurochemical profile of three cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical regions in 37 well-characterized, drug-free adult patients and 36 age/gender-matched healthy control subjects via magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3T. To interrogate the influence of treatment on metabolite concentrations, spectral data were acquired from 15 patients undergoing a 4-week treatment with aripiprazole. Test-retest reliability measurements in 23 controls indicated high repeatability of voxel localization and metabolite quantitation. We report significant reductions in striatal concentrations of Gln, Glu + Gln (Glx) and the Gln: Glu ratio, and thalamic concentrations of Glx in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome in comparison to controls. ON-treatment patients exhibited no significant metabolite differences when compared to controls but significant increases in striatal Glu and Glx, and trends for increases in striatal Gln and thalamic Glx compared to baseline measurements. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between (i) striatal Gln and actual tic severity; and (ii) thalamic Glu and premonitory urges. Our results indicate that patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome exhibit an abnormality in the flux of metabolites in the GABA-Glu-Gln cycle, thus implying perturbations in astrocytic-neuronal coupling systems that maintain the subtle balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission within subcortical nuclei.

Sustained Subconjunctival Delivery of Infliximab Protects the Cornea and Retina Following Alkali Burn to the Eye	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						polydimethylsiloxane; tumor necrosis factor alpha; drug delivery system; antibody therapy; corneal wound healing; retinal protection; burn	PERIPHERAL ULCERATIVE KERATITIS; TOPICAL INFLIXIMAB; IN-VIVO; TRANSPLANTATION; GLAUCOMA; DISEASE; KERATOPROSTHESIS; SYSTEM	PURPOSE. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is upregulated in eyes following corneal alkali injury and contributes to corneal and also retinal damage. Prompt TNF-alpha inhibition by systemic infliximab ameliorates retinal damage and improves corneal wound healing. However, systemic administration of TNF-alpha inhibitors carries risk of significant complications, whereas topical eye-drop delivery is hindered by poor ocular bioavailability and the need for patient adherence. This study investigates the efficacy of subconjunctival delivery of TNF-alpha antibodies using a polymer-based drug delivery system (DDS). METHODS. The drug delivery system was prepared using porous polydimethylsiloxane/polyvinyl alcohol composite fabrication and loaded with 85 lg of infliximab. Six Dutch-belted pigmented rabbits received ocular alkali burn with NaOH. Immediately after the burn, subconjunctival implantation of anti-TNF-alpha DDS was performed in three rabbits while another three received sham DDS (without antibody). Rabbits were followed with photography for 3 months. RESULTS. After 3 months, the device was found to be well tolerated by the host and the eyes exhibited less corneal damage as compared to eyes implanted with a sham DDS without drug. The low dose treatment suppressed CD45 and TNF-alpha expression in the burned cornea and inhibited retinal ganglion cell apoptosis and optic nerve degeneration, as compared to the sham DDS treated eyes. Immunolocalization revealed drug penetration in the conjunctiva, cornea, iris, and choroid, with residual infliximab in the DDS 3 months after implantation. CONCLUSIONS. This reduced-risk biologic DDS improves corneal wound healing and provides retinal neuroprotection, and may be applicable not only to alkali burns but also to other inflammatory surgical procedures such as penetrating keratoplasty and keratoprosthesis implantation.

This phase 2, randomized, global study evaluated the efficacy and safety of veliparib in combination with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Three-hundred and seven patients with brain metastases from NSCLC were randomized 1:1:1 to WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) plus 50 mg veliparib twice daily (BID; n = 103), 200 mg veliparib BID (n = 102), or placebo BID (n = 102). Treatment began within 28 days of diagnosis. Tumor response and safety were assessed; the primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Patients who received 1 dose of treatment were included in the safety analysis. All randomized patients were included in the efficacy endpoint analyses. Patient characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. Median OS was 185 days for patients treated with WBRT plus placebo and 209 days for WBRT plus veliparib (50 or 200 mg). No statistically significant differences in OS, intracranial response rate, and time to clinical or radiographic progression between any of the treatment arms were noted. No differences were observed in adverse events (all grades) across treatment arms; nausea, fatigue, alopecia, and headache were the most commonly reported. No new safety signals were identified for veliparib. A significant unmet need for therapies that improve the outcomes of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC remains.

To make good use of this genomic data in a biomedical setting (whether for research or diagnosis), it is vital that we understand the mechanisms through which mutations affect biochemical pathways and physiological systems. This lies at the centre of what genetics is all about, and it is the reason why genetics and genomics should go hand in hand whenever possible. In this Annual Review Issue of The Journal of Pathology, we have assembled a collection of 16 expert reviews covering a wide range of topics. Through these, we illustrate the power of genetic analysis to improve our understanding of normal physiology and disease pathology, and thereby to think in rational ways about clinical management.

Are neurocognitive factors associated with repetition of self-harm? A systematic review	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Self-harm; Suicide; Neurocognition; Decision-making; Cognitive control; Executive functioning; Memory; Problem solving; Repetition; Neuroimaging	SUICIDE ATTEMPT HISTORY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS; DECISION-MAKING; RISK-FACTORS; FOLLOW-UP; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DEPRESSIVE-DISORDERS; MULTICENTER COHORT	Background: Prediction of self-harm is limited clinically. Early identification of individuals likely to repeat self-harm could improve outcomes and reduce suicide risk. Various neurocognitive deficits have been found in people who self-harm, but the ability of these to predict repetition has yet to 'be established Aims: Identify neurocognitive factors that may predict repetition of self-harm. Methods: Systematic narrative review of English language publications assessing neurocognitive functioning and self-harm repetition, searching multiple databases from inception to March 2015. Quality of studies was appraised. A narrative synthesis was performed. Results: 7026 unique records were identified, and 169 full-texts assessed. 15 unique studies provided data. No imaging studies could be included. Most studies assessed cognitive control or problem solving, but neither factor was consistently associated with repetition. However, specific tasks may show promise. Two studies in adolescents suggest that value-based decision-making impairments could be predictive of repetition. There were too few results for memory to draw specific conclusions. Conclusions: Selected studies suggest promise for particular neurocognitive factors and specific cognitive tasks in terms of repetition of self-harm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detection and measurement of clinically meaningful visual field progression in clinical trials for glaucoma	PROGRESS IN RETINAL AND EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						Glaucoma; Intraocular pressure; Neuroprotection; Perimetry; Progression; Clinical trials	OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; OCULAR-HYPERTENSION-TREATMENT; STANDARD AUTOMATED PERIMETRY; TEST-RETEST VARIABILITY; DOUBLING TECHNOLOGY PERIMETRY; NORMAL-TENSION GLAUCOMA; RISK-FACTORS; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS	Glaucomatous visual field progression has both personal and societal costs and therefore has a serious impact on quality of life. At the present time, intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be the most important modifiable risk factor for glaucoma onset and progression. Reduction of IOP has been repeatedly demonstrated to be an effective intervention across the spectrum of glaucoma, regardless of subtype or disease stage. In the setting of approval of IOP-lowering therapies, it is expected that effects on IOP will translate into benefits in long-term patient-reported outcomes. Nonetheless, the effect of these medications on IOP and their associated risks can be consistently and objectively measured. This helps to explain why regulatory approval of new therapies in glaucoma has historically used KW as the outcome variable. Although all approved treatments for glaucoma involve IOP reduction, patients frequently continue to progress despite treatment. It would therefore be beneficial to develop treatments that preserve visual function through mechanisms other than lowering IOP. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that they will accept a clinically meaningful definition of visual field progression using Glaucoma Change Probability criteria. Nonetheless, these criteria do not take into account the time (and hence, the speed) needed to reach significant change. In this paper we provide an analysis based on the existing literature to support the hypothesis that decreasing the rate of visual field progression by 30% in a trial lasting 12-18 months is clinically meaningful. We demonstrate that a 30% decrease in rate of visual field progression can be reliably projected to have a significant effect on health-related quality of life, as defined by validated instruments designed to measure that endpoint.

Mutations in numerous ARSs have been linked to a growing number of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive human diseases. The tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS) links the amino acid tyrosine to its cognate tRNA. We report two siblings who presented with failure to thrive (FTT), hypertriglyceridemia, developmental delay, liver dysfunction, lung cysts, and abnormal subcortical white matter. Using exome sequencing the siblings were found to harbor bi-allelic pathogenic-appearing variants within the YARS gene (NM_003680.3): c.638C>T p.(Pro213Leu) and c.1573G>A p.(Gly525Arg). These YARS variants occur in the catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain, respectively. Mutations in YARS have been previously associated with an autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT); our findings suggest the disease spectrum associated with YARS dysregulation is broader than peripheral neuropathy.

DD and ADHD co-occur in the same individuals much more often than would be expected by chance. Several studies have found significant bivariate heritability, and specific genes associated with either DD or ADHD have been investigated for association in the other disorder. Moreover, there are likely to be gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interaction effects (GxG and GxE, respectively) underlying the comorbidity between DD and ADHD. We investigated the pleiotropic effects of 19 SNPs spanning five DD genes (DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319, ROBO1, and GRIN2B) and seven DD environmental factors (smoke, miscarriage, birth weight, breastfeeding, parental age, socioeconomic status, and parental education) for main, either (a) genetic or (b) environmental, (c) GxG, and (d) GxE upon inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. We then attempted replication of these findings in an independent twin cohort. MethodsMarker-trait association was analyzed by implementing the Quantitative Transmission Disequilibrium Test (QTDT). Environmental associations were tested by partial correlations. GxG were investigated by a general linear model equationand a family-based association test. GxE were analyzed through a general test for GxE in sib pair-based association analysis of quantitative traits. ResultsDCDC2-rs793862 was associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity via GxG (KIAA0319) and GxE (miscarriage). Smoke was significantly correlated with hyperactivity/impulsivity. We replicated the DCDC2xKIAA0319 interaction upon hyperactivity/impulsivity in the twin cohort. ConclusionsDD genetic (DCDC2) and environmental factors (smoke and miscarriage) underlie ADHD traits supporting a potential pleiotropic effect.

Among these, wearable devices have substantial biomedical applications, primarily since they can be implemented both in indoor and outdoor applications. In this study, a Trunk Motion System (TMS) using printed Body-Worn Sensors (BWS) is designed and developed. TMS can measure three-dimensional (3D) trunk motions, is lightweight, and is a portable and non-invasive system. After the recognition of sensor locations, twelve BWSs were printed on stretchable clothing with the purpose of measuring the 3D trunk movements. To integrate BWSs data, a neural network data fusion algorithm was used. The outcome of this algorithm along with the actual 3D anatomical movements (obtained by Qualisys system) were used to calibrate the TMS. Three healthy participants with different physical characteristics participated in the calibration tests. Seven different tasks (each repeated three times) were performed, involving five planar, and two multiplanar movements. Results showed that the accuracy of TMS system was less than 1.0 degrees, 0.8 degrees, 0.6 degrees, 0.8 degrees, 0.9 degrees, and 1.3 degrees for flexion/extension, left/right lateral bending, left/right axial rotation, and multi-planar motions, respectively. In addition, the accuracy of TMS for the identified movement was less than 2.7 degrees. TMS, developed to monitor and measure the trunk orientations, can have diverse applications in clinical, biomechanical, and ergonomic studies to prevent musculoskeletal injuries, and to determine the impact of interventions.

Although a number of histological classification systems for CNS lesions have been used by different groups in recent years, no uniform classification exists. In this paper, we propose a simple and unifying classification of MS lesions incorporating many elements of earlier histological systems that aims to provide guidelines for neuropathologists and researchers studying MS lesions to allow for better comparison of different studies performed with MS tissue, and to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. Based on the presence/absence and distribution of macrophages/microglia (inflammatory activity) and the presence/absence of ongoing demyelination (demyelinating activity), we suggest differentiating between active, mixed active/inactive, and inactive lesions with or without ongoing demyelination. Active lesions are characterized by macrophages/microglia throughout the lesion area, whereas mixed active/inactive lesions have a hypocellular lesion center with macrophages/microglia limited to the lesion border. Inactive lesions are almost completely lacking macrophages/microglia. Active and mixed active/inactive lesions can be further subdivided into lesions with ongoing myelin destruction (demyelinating lesions) and lesions in which the destruction of myelin has ceased, but macrophages are still present (post-demyelinating lesions). This distinction is based on the presence or absence of myelin degradation products within the cytoplasm of macrophages/microglia. For this classification of MS lesions, identification of myelin with histological stains [such as luxol fast blue-PAS] or by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against myelin basic-protein (MBP) or proteolipid-protein (PLP), as well as, detection of macrophages/microglia by, e.g., anti-CD68 is sufficient. Active and demyelinating lesions may be further subdivided into the early and late demyelinating lesions. The former is defined by the presence in macrophages of major and small molecular weight myelin proteins, such as cyclic nucleotide diphosphoesterase (CNP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), or myelin-associated protein (MAG), whereas macrophages in the latter demonstrate merely the presence of the major myelin proteins MBP or PLP. We discuss the histological features and staining techniques required to classify MS lesions, and, in addition, describe the histological hallmarks of cortical pathology and diffuse white matter changes, as well as of remyelination.

Unlike, colchicine and podophyllotoxin, noscapine did not depolymerize microtubules even at stoichiometric concentrations but rather only mitigated their dynamics. Other microtubule-interacting chemotherapeutics, although quite effective, have therapy-limiting toxicities including immunosuppression and peripheral neuropathies. Recurrent cancers often become resistant. Noscapine however remains effective in some such instances, e.g., taxane-resistant ovarian cancer. Noscapine and analogs also do not show signs of neurotoxicity or immunosuppression. In addition, 9-bromo noscapine, Red-9-Br-Nos and other analogs were characterized for their structure and further studied in detail. On the other hand, noscapine was shown to be neuroprotective in mouse model of neurodegenerative disease and in stroke patients. Like low doses of colchicine, noscapine and its analog 9-Br-Noscapine also show anti-inflammatory activities. There are indications of a preventive use of noscapine in ischemia-reperfusion injury and fibrosis. The entire biosynthetic pathway of noscapine is encoded as gene cluster within 401 kilo bases of genomic DNA, opening up opportunities for the large-scale biotechnological production of noscapine for medicinal needs. Thus, noscapine and its derivatives (noscapinoids) might be cost-effective and safe components for cancer chemotherapy. Owing to its low toxicity, it also might be useful for preventive use in high-risk situations. This brief review is an update of current research activity and patents on noscapine and its analogs.

This open-label, non-randomized, phase 1/2 study evaluated the safety and therapeutic benefit of momelotinib with twice-daily dosing. A total of 61 subjects with primary myelofibrosis or post-polycythemia vera/post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis with intermediate-or high-risk disease received momelotinib. A phase 1 dose escalation identified 200 mg twice daily as the optimal dose to be expanded in phase 2. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea (45.9%), peripheral neuropathy (44.3%), thrombocytopenia (39.3%), and dizziness (36.1%), the latter primarily due to a first-dose effect. The response assessment according to the 2006 International Working Group criteria (>= 8 weeks duration at any time point) demonstrated spleen response by palpation of 72% (36/50) and anemia response of 45% (18/40). Spleen response by magnetic resonance imaging obtained at 24 weeks was 45.8% (27/59) for all subjects and 54.0% (27/50) for those with palpable splenomegaly at baseline. The symptoms of myelofibrosis were improved in most subjects. Cytokine analysis showed a rapid decline in interleukin-6 with momelotinib treatment, and a slower reduction in other inflammatory cytokines. In the subgroup of subjects with the JAK2V617F mutation at baseline (n=41), momelotinib significantly reduced the allele burden by 21.1% (median) at 24 weeks. These results provide evidence of tolerability and a potential therapeutic activity of momelotinib for subjects that support further evaluation in ongoing, phase 3 randomized trials.

Cognitive Functioning in Adolescents with Self-Reported ADHD and Depression: Results from a Population-Based Study	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ADHD; Depression; Cognition; Adolescents	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; INDIVIDUAL-LIVES SURVEY; SUPPLEMENT NCS-A; WORKING-MEMORY; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION	This study aims to assess cognitive functioning differences among adolescents with retrospectively self-reported: ADHD and an onset of depression, only ADHD, only depression, and neither ADHD nor depression. Data from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) cohort was used in this study. Neuropsychological functioning was assessed in 1549 adolescents, at baseline and follow-up (mean ages 11 and 19 years). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to classify adolescents into 4 groups: ADHD with onset of depression, only ADHD, only depression, and neither ADHD nor depression. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyse group differences in cognitive functioning at baseline and follow-up, and the change in cognitive functioning between these 2 time-points. Results showed a significant main effect of group on response time variability at baseline, working memory maintenance at follow up, and change in response time variability scores between baseline and follow-up. As compared to the healthy and depressed-only groups, adolescents with only ADHD showed longer response time variability at baseline and, which declined between baseline and follow-up. Adolescents with ADHD plus depression showed higher reaction time for working memory maintenance than the depressed only and healthy groups at follow-up. In conclusion, adolescents with self-reported ADHD show poorer cognitive functioning than healthy adolescents and those with only depression. Amongst adolescents with ADHD, specific cognitive domains show poor functioning depending on the presence or absence of comorbid depression. While adolescents with only ADHD have lower reaction time variability, those with comorbid depression have poorer working memory maintenance.

Microfluidic devices have demonstrated their potential for a broad range of applications in life sciences, including point-of-care diagnostics and personalized medicine, based on the routine diagnosis of levels of hormones, cancer markers, and various metabolic products in blood, serum, etc. Microfluidics offers an adaptable platform that can facilitate cell culture as well as monitor their activity and control the cellular environment. Signaling molecules released from cells such as neurotransmitters and hormones are important in assessing the health of cells and the effect of drugs on their functions. In this review, we provide an insight into the state-of-art applications of microfluidics for monitoring of hormones released by cells. In our works, we have demonstrated efficient detection methods for bovine growth hormones using nano and microphotonics integrated microfluidics devices. The bovine growth hormone can be used as a growth promoter in dairy farming to enhance the milk and meat production. In the recent years, a few attempts have been reported on developing very sensitive, fast and low-cost methods of detection of bovine growth hormone using micro devices. This paper reviews the current state-of-art of detection and analysis of hormone using integrated optical micro and nanofluidics systems. In addition, the paper also focuses on various lab-on-a-chip technologies reported recently, and their benefits for screening growth hormones in milk.

Using task-based fMRI, we assessed to what extent the nature of the cognitive context may further modulate abnormal functional brain connectivity. Methods: We analyzed data matched for motion in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls who performed 3 different tasks. Tasks 1 and 2 both involved emotional processing and only slighlty differed (incidental encoding v. memory recognition), whereas task 3 was a much different mental rotation task. We conducted a connectome-wide general linear model analysis aimed at identifying context-dependent and independent functional brain connectivity alterations in patients with schizophrenia. Results: After matching for motion, we included 30 patients with schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls in our study. Abnormal connectivity in patients with schizophrenia followed similar patterns regardless of the degree of similarity between cognitive tasks. Decreased connectivity was most notable in the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior and posterior cingulate, the temporal lobe, the lobule IX of the cerebellum and the premotor cortex. Limitations: A more circumscribed yet significant context-dependent effect might be detected with larger sample sizes or cognitive domains other than emotional and visuomotor processing. Conclusion: The context-independence of functional brain dysconnectivity in patients with schizophrenia provides a good justification for pooling data from multiple experiments in order to identify connectivity biomarkers of this mental illness.

Recently, longitudinal and postmortem studies have shown that the ECS might be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. However, despite the large amount of research, our knowledge of the ECS and its implication in this debilitating disorder is still largely limited. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge of the ECS in schizophrenia and presenting some potential antipsychotic compounds that modulate this system. Findings from animal and human studies, and their implications for pharmacotherapy, will be integrated and discussed in this paper. A closer look will be given at the roles of the cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2), as well as the endogenous ligand N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), in the development of psychotic and schizophrenia-like symptoms.

In view of the fact that congenital cytomegalovirus is difficult to confirm outside the neonatal period, excluding a Mendelian disorder is extremely relevant, changing family planning and medical management in affected families. We performed diagnostic testing in individuals with leukoencephalopathy with temporal lobe cysts without a definitive diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection. METHODS: We reviewed a large-scale biorepository of patients with unsolved leukodystrophies and identified two individuals with required for meiotic nuclear division 1 (RMND1) mutations and similar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, including temporal lobe cysts. Ten additional subjects with confirmed RMND1 mutations were identified as part of a separate disease specific cohort. Brain MRis from all 12 individuals were reviewed for common neuroradielogical features. RESULTS: MRI features in RMND1 mutations included temporal lobe swelling, with rarefaction and cystic evolution, enlarged tips of the temporal lobes, and multifocal subcortical white matter changes with confluent periatrial T2 signal hyperintensity. A combination of these features was present in ten of the 12 individuals reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small number of reported individuals with RMND1 mutations, a clinically recognizable phenotype of leukoencephalopathy with temporal lobe swelling, rarefaction, and cystic changes has emerged in a subset of individuals. Careful clinical phenotyping, including for lactic acidosis, deafness, and severe muscle involvement seen in RMND1 mutation positive individuals, and MRI pattern recognition will be important in differentiating these patients from children with congenital infections like cytomegalovirus.

Short-and mid-term benefits of KMC on survival, neurodevelopment, breastfeeding, and the quality of mother-infant bonding were documented in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Colombia from 1993 to 1996. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the persistence of these results in young adulthood. METHODS: From 2012 to 2014, a total of 494 (69%) of the 716 participants of the original RCT known to be alive were identified; 441 (62% of the participants in the original RCT) were re-enrolled, and results for the 264 participants weighing <= 1800 g at birth were analyzed. The KMC and control groups were compared for health status and neurologic, cognitive, and social functioning with the use of neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and behavioral tests. RESULTS: The effects of KMC at 1 year on IQ and home environment were still present 20 years later in the most fragile individuals, and KMC parents were more protective and nurturing, reflected by reduced school absenteeism and reduced hyperactivity, aggressiveness, externalization, and socio-deviant conduct of young adults. Neuroimaging showed larger volume of the left caudate nucleus in the KMC group. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that KMC had significant, long-lasting social and behavioral protective effects 20 years after the intervention. Coverage with this efficient and scientifically based health care intervention should be extended to the 18 million infants born each year who are candidates for the method.

Since upright faces are supposedly recognized through holistic processing and inverted faces, using features, it is easy to take the leap to suggest a qualitatively different SF tuning for the identification of upright and vs. inverted faces. However, two independent studies (e.g. Gaspar et al. in Vision Res 48(28):2817-2826, 2008; Willenbockel et al. in J Exp Psychol Human 36(1):122-135, 2010a) found the same SF tuning for both stimulus presentations. Since these authors used relatively small faces hiding the natural facial contour, it is possible that differences in the SF tuning for identifying upright and inverted faces were missed. The present study thus revisits the SF tuning for upright and inverted faces face identification using the SF Bubbles technique. Our results still indicate that the same SFs are involved in both upright and inverted face recognition regardless of these additional parameters (contour and size), thus contrasting with previous data obtained using different methods (e.g. Oruc and Barton in J Vis 10(12):20, 1-12, 2010). The possible reasons subtending this divergence are discussed.

However, little is known about the association between SEP and morphologic brain changes in older age. This study examines the relationships between indicators of life-course SEP with both hippocampal volume (HcV) and HcV loss in a population-based cohort of 1328 older adults aged 65 to 80 years. Methods: Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of SEP with baseline HcV and the annual rate of HcV atrophy according to three life-course conceptual models: the sensitive/critical periods model (which explored SEP in specific periods: in childhood [using parental education], early adulthood [based on participants' education], and midlife [based on participants' socioprofessional group]); the accumulation-of-risk model (life-course cumulative SEP), and the social mobility model (life-course SEP trajectories). Results: Participants with lower midlife SEP had smaller HcV (-0.08 cm(3); 95% confidence interval, -0.15 to -0.01) and 0.17% (95% confidence interval, 0.04%-0.30%) faster hippocampal atrophy than participants with higher midlife SEP. Childhood and early adulthood SEPs were not related to hippocampal measures. The accumulation-of-risk and the social mobility models revealed that the accumulation of socioeconomic disadvantage and declining socioeconomic trajectories were related to faster hippocampal atrophy. Conclusions: In this cohort of older adults, lower socioprofessional attainment in midlife and disadvantageous life-course socioeconomic position were associated with faster hippocampal atrophy, a cerebral change linked to cognitive disorders. Results support the hypothesized links between socioenvironmental exposures related to stress and/or cognitive enrichment and brain/cognitive reserve capacities.

It has many applications in aerospace and automotive fields. The little information available about the machining process of this material, specifically when routing process is considered, makes the process control quite difficult. In this paper, we propose a new process control technique and we apply it to the routing process for that important material. The measured machining conditions are used to evaluate the quality and the geometric profile of the machined part. The machining conditions, whether controllable or uncontrollable are used to control part accuracy and its quality. We present a pattern-based machine learning approach in order to detect the characteristic patterns, and use them to control the quality of a machined part at specific range. The approach is called logical analysis of data (LAD). LAD finds the characteristic patterns which lead to conforming products and those that lead to nonconforming products. As an example, LAD is used for online control of a simulated routing process of CFRP. We introduce the LAD technique, we apply it to the high speed routing of woven carbon fiber reinforced epoxy, and we compare the accuracy of LAD to that of an artificial neural network, since the latter is the most known machine learning technique. By using experimental results, we show how LAD is used to control the routing process by tuning autonomously the routing conditions. We conclude with a discussion of the potential use of LAD in manufacturing.

H.			Ultrasound-Guided Cervical Medial Branch Radiofrequency Neurotomy Can Multitined Deployment Cannulae Be the Solution?	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							LESION SIZE; INJECTION; ABLATION; NERVES; BLOCK	Background and Objectives: Novel multitined cannulae constitute an attractive option for ultrasound-guided radiofrequency neurotomy of cervical medial branches. The deployment tines increase the cannula's active area, thus altering its lesion size. Despite their theoretical benefits, multitined cannulae have not been assessed. In this bench study, we sought to investigate the lesions produced by a standard 18-gauge and 2 commercially available multitined deployment cannulae. We created ex vivo models to evaluate lesion morphology at a periosteal interface using approach angles likely to be encountered during an ultrasound-guided technique. Methods: Two ex vivo models were assembled using chicken breast tissue and bovine tibia. Monopolar lesions were carried out with 3 commercially available cannulae (18-gauge curved [S], 17-gauge with laterally deploying tines [N], and 18-gauge with distally deploying tines [T]). All cannulae were positioned at 0, 25, 45, and 90 degrees to the periosteal plane. For each angulation and cannula, 2 series of measurements were recorded to document lesion morphology in the axial and sagittal planes. Data collected included the lesion's surface area, shape, and dimensions relative to the needle tip. Results: A total of 240 lesions were analyzed. The performances of S and N cannulae were significantly affected by approach angle, with lesion size decreasing as the angle increased. In contrast, T cannulae displayed similar lesion surface areas at 0 and 90 degrees. The multitined N and T cannulae produced the largest lesions at 0/25 and 90 degrees, respectively. Lesion height varied inversely according to approach angle for S and N cannulae, whereas T cannulae displayed stable characteristics. Conclusions: Unlike their S and N counterparts, T cannulae demonstrated stable lesion characteristics at varying approach angles.	[Finlayson, Roderick J.; Perez, Jordi; Tran, De Q.

ET and CR improve body weight and glycemic control, and experimental studies indicate that these paradigms afford cardioprotection. In this study, the effects of combined ET and CR on the cardioprotective oxytocin (OT)-natriuretic peptide (NP) system were determined in the db/db mouse, a model of type 2 diabetes associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and obesity. Methods: Five-week-old male db/db mice were assigned to the following groups: sedentary, ET, and ET + CR. Nonobese heterozygote littermates served as controls. ET was performed on a treadmill at moderate intensity, and CR was induced by reducing food intake by 30% of that consumed by sedentary db/db mice for a period of 8 weeks. Results: After 8 weeks, only ET + CR, but not ET, slightly improved body weight compared to sedentary db/db mice. Regardless of the treatment, db/db mice remained hyperglycemic. Hearts from db/db mice demonstrated reduced expression of genes linked to the cardiac OT-NP system. In fact, compared to control mice, mRNA expression of GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), OT receptor, OT, brain NP, NP receptor type C, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was decreased in hearts from sedentary db/db mice. Both ET alone and ET + CR increased the mRNA expression of GATA4 compared to sedentary db/db mice. Only ET combined with CR produced increased eNOS mRNA and protein expression. Conclusion: Our data indicate that enhancement of eNOS by combined ET and CR may improve coronary endothelial vasodilator dysfunction in type 2 diabetes but did not prevent the downregulation of cardiac expression in the OT-NP system, possibly resulting from the sustained hyperglycemia and obesity in diabetic mice.

A PKM generated by calpain cleavage of a classical PKC is required for activity-dependent intermediate-term facilitation in the presynaptic sensory neuron of Aplysia	LEARNING & MEMORY			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE-C; SITE-SPECIFIC SENSITIZATION; RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; M-ZETA; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; MOLECULAR-MECHANISM; MEMORY STORAGE; MESSENGER-RNA; TRANSLOCATION	Atypical PKM, a persistently active form of atypical PKC, is proposed to be a molecular memory trace, but there have been few examinations of the role of PKMs generated from other PKCs. We demonstrate that inhibitors used to inhibit PKMs generated from atypical PKCs are also effective inhibitors of other PKMs. In contrast, we demonstrate that dominant-negative PKMs show isoform-specificity. A dominant-negative PKM from the classical PKC Apl I blocks activity-dependent intermediate-term facilitation (a-ITF) when expressed in the sensory neuron, while a dominant-negative PKM from the atypical PKC Apl III does not. Consistent with a specific role forPKMApl I in activity-dependent facilitation, live imaging FRET-based cleavage assays reveal that activity leads to cleavage of the classical PKC Apl I, but not the atypical PKC Apl III in the sensory neuron varicosities of Aplysia. In contrast, massed intermediate facilitation (m-ITF) induced by 10 min of 5HT is sufficient for cleavage of the atypical PKC Apl III in the motor neuron. Interestingly, both cleavage of PKC Apl I in the sensory neuron during a-ITF and cleavage of PKC Apl III in the motor neuron during m-ITF are inhibited by a dominant-negative form of a penta-EF hand containing classical calpain cloned from Aplysia. Consistent with a role for PKMs in plasticity, this dominant-negative calpain also blocks both a-ITF when expressed in the sensory neuron and m-ITF when expressed in the motor neuron. This study broadens the role of PKMs in synaptic plasticity in two significant ways: (i) PKMs generated from multiple isoforms of PKC, including classical isoforms, maintain memory traces; (ii) PKMs play roles in the presynaptic neuron.

MethodsThe FID appliance (FID-A) is an open-source, MATLAB-based software toolkit for simulation and processing of MRS data. The software is designed specifically for processing data with multiple dimensions (eg, multiple radiofrequency channels, averages, spectral editing dimensions). It is equipped with functions for importing data in the formats of most major MRI vendors (eg, Siemens, Philips, GE, Agilent) and for exporting data into the formats of several common processing software packages (eg, LCModel, jMRUI, Tarquin). This paper introduces the FID-A software toolkit and uses examples to demonstrate its novel features, namely 1) the use of a spectral registration algorithm to carry out useful processing routines automatically, 2) automatic detection and removal of motion-corrupted scans, and 3) the ability to perform several major aspects of the MRS computational workflow from a single piece of software. This latter feature is illustrated through both high-level processing of in vivo GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS data, as well as detailed quantum mechanical simulations to generate an accurate LCModel basis set for analysis of the same data. ResultsAll of the described processing steps resulted in a marked improvement in spectral quality compared with unprocessed data. Fitting of MEGA-PRESS data using a customized basis set resulted in improved fitting accuracy compared with a generic MEGA-PRESS basis set. ConclusionsThe FID-A software toolkit enables high-level processing of MRS data and accurate simulation of in vivo MRS experiments. Magn Reson Med 77:23-33, 2017. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, these approaches require large samples and suffer from the challenges associated with multi-site, multi-protocol data. We propose a novel approach to address these challenges, and demonstrate its usefulness with the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. We predict symptom severity based on cortical thickness measurements from 156 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from four different sites. The proposed approach consists of two main stages: a domain adaptation stage using partial least squares regression to maximize the consistency of imaging data across sites; and a learning stage combining support vector regression for regional prediction of severity with elastic-net penalized linear regression for integrating regional predictions into a whole-brain severity prediction. The proposed method performed markedly better than simpler alternatives, better with multi-site than single-site data, and resulted in a considerably higher cross-validated correlation score than has previously been reported in the literature for multi-site data. This demonstration of the utility of the proposed approach for detecting structural brain abnormalities in ASD from the multi-site, multi-protocol ABIDE dataset indicates the potential of designing machine learning methods to meet the challenges of agglomerative data.

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that verbal and non-verbal intelligence can be dissociated and focal cortical regions corresponding to each have been demonstrated. However, the pattern of structural covariance corresponding to verbal and non-verbal intelligence remains unexplored. In this study, we used 586 longitudinal anatomical MRI scans of subjects aged 6-18 years, who had concurrent intelligence quotient (IQ) testing on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Structural covariance networks (SCNs) were constructed using interregional correlations in cortical thickness for low-IQ (Performance IQ=100 +/- 8, Verbal IQ=100 +/- 7) and high-IQ (PM= 121 +/- 8, VIQ=120 +/- 9) groups. From low-to high-VIQ group, we observed constrained patterns of anatomical coupling among cortical regions, complemented by observations of higher global efficiency and modularity, and lower local efficiency in high-VIQ group, suggesting a shift towards a more optimal topological organization. Analysis of nodal topological properties (regional efficiency and participation coefficient) revealed greater involvement of left-hemispheric language related regions including inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri for high-VIQ group. From low-to high-PIQ group, we did not observe significant differences in anatomical coupling patterns, global and nodal topological properties. Our findings indicate that people with higher verbal intelligence have structural brain differences from people with lower verbal intelligence - not only in localized cortical regions, but also in the patterns of anatomical coupling among widely distributed cortical regions, possibly resulting to a system-level reorganization that might lead to a more efficient organization in high-VIQ group.

Statisticians and computer scientists were potentially the most qualified for the machine learning aspect of the competition, but generally lacked the specialized skills to implement the necessary steps of data preparation for rs-IMRI. Realizing this barrier to entry, the Neuro Bureau prospectively collaborated with all competitors by preprocessing the data and sharing these results at the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) (http:// www.nitrc.org/frspgroup_id=383). This "ADHD-200 Preprocessed" release included multiple analytical pipelines to cater to different philosophies of data analysis. The processed derivatives included denoised and registered 4D fMRI volumes, regional time series extracted from brain parcellations, maps of 10 intrinsic connectivity networks, fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, and regional homogeneity, along with grey matter density maps. The data was used by several teams who competed in the ADHD-200 Global Competition, including the winning entry by a group of biostaticians. To the best of our knowledge, the ADHD-200 Preprocessed release was the first large public resource of preprocessed resting-state fMRI and structural MRI data, and remains to this day the only resource featuring a battery of alternative processing paths.

Here, we review the preclinical and clinical studies indicating that this neurobiological phenotype is likely to be both a consequence of chronic drug consumption and a vulnerability factor in the development of addiction. We propose that, behaviorally, blunted striatal dopamine transmission could reflect the increased impulsivity and altered cost/benefit computations that are associated with addiction. The factors that influence blunted striatal dopamine transmission in addiction are unknown. Herein, we give an overview of various factors, genetic, environmental, and social, that are known to affect dopamine transmission and that have been associated with the vulnerability to develop addiction. Altogether, these data suggest that blunted dopamine transmission and decreased D2 receptor availability are biomarkers both for the development of addiction and resistance to treatment. These findings support the view that blunted dopamine reflects impulsive behavior and deficits in motivation, which lead to the escalation of drug use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Depending on the context and environmental stimuli, microglia adopt a broad spectrum of activation status from pro-inflammatory, associated with neurotoxicity, to anti-inflammatory linked to neuroprotection. Pro-inflammatory microglial activation is a key hallmark of white matter injury in preterm infants and is involved in developmental origin of adult neurological diseases. Characterization of neonatal microglia function in brain development and inflammation has allowed the investigation of promising therapeutic targets with potential long-lasting neuroprotective effects. True prevention of neuro-degenerative diseases might eventually occur as early as the perinatal period. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hospital length of stay following admission for traumatic brain injury in a Canadian integrated trauma system: A retrospective multicenter cohort study	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Acute care; Determinants; Intensive care; Length of stay; Traumatic brain injury	POPULATION-BASED COHORT; INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; LEVEL I; MISSING DATA; OUTCOMES; COSTS; MORTALITY; IMPROVES; IMPACT	Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability in children and young adults and costs CAD$3 billion annually in Canada. Stakeholders have expressed the urgent need to obtain information on resource use for TBI to improve the quality and efficiency of acute care in this patient population. We aimed to assess the components and determinants of hospital and ICU LOS for TBI admissions. Methods: We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study on 11,199 adults admitted for TBI between 2007 and 2012 in an inclusive Canadian trauma system. Our primary outcome measure was index hospital LOS (admission to the hospital with the highest designation level). Index LOS was compared to total LOS (all consecutive admissions related to the injury). Expected LOS was calculated by matching TBI admissions to all-diagnosis hospital admissions by age, gender, and year of admission. LOS determinants were identified using multilevel linear regression. Results: Geometric mean total LOS was 1 day longer than geometric mean index LOS (12.6 versus 11.7 days). Observed index and ICU LOS were respectively 4.2 days and 2.5 days longer than that expected according to all-diagnosis admissions. The six most important determinants of LOS were discharge destination, severity of concomitant injuries, extracranial complications, GCS, TBI severity, and mechanical ventilation, accounting for 80% of explained variation. Conclusions: Results of this multicenter retrospective cohort study suggest that hospital and ICU LOS for TBI admissions are 56% and 119% longer than expected according to all-diagnosis admissions, respectively. In addition, hospital LOS is underestimated when only the index visit is considered and is largely influenced by discharge destination and extracranial complications, suggesting that improvements could be achieved with better discharge planning and interventions targeting prevention of in-hospital complications. This study highlights the importance of considering TBI patients as a distinct population when allocating resources or planning quality improvement interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is considered the earliest clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between increased stride time variability and SMI has not been reported. Objective: This study aims to examine the association of stride time variability while performing single and dual tasking with SMI in cognitively healthy individuals (CHI). Methods: Atotal of 126 CHI (15 without SMI, 69 with SMI expressed by participants, 10 with SMI expressed by participant's relative, and 32 with SMI expressed by both participants and their relatives) were included in this cross-sectional study. The coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride time and walking speed were recorded under usual condition and while counting backwards. Age, gender, body mass index, number of drugs taken daily, use of psychoactive drugs, fear of falling, history of previous falls, and walking speed were used as covariates. Results: The multiple linear regression models showed that greater CoV of stride time while counting backwards, but not while single tasking, was associated with a participant's relative SMI (p = 0.038). Conclusion: This study found a specific association between SMI expressed by a participant's relative and a greater CoV of stride time (i.e., worse performance) while dual tasking, suggesting that the association between gait variability and memory may be present in the earliest stages of memory impairment. Thus, gait variability under dual-task in individuals with SMI expressed by their relatives can be a potential biomarker of AD.

Impact of acute stress on psychomotor bimanual performance during a simulated tumor resection task	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						acute stress; uncontrolled bleeding; brain tumor; NeuroTouch; virtual reality simulator; performance metrics; psychomotor performance; surgical technique	VIRTUAL-REALITY SIMULATOR; ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY; MCGILL SIMULATOR; OPERATING-ROOM; SAFETY	OBJECTIVE Severe bleeding during neurosurgical operations can result in acute stress affecting the bimanual psychomotor performance of the operator, leading to surgical error and an adverse patient outcome. Objective methods to assess the influence of acute stress on neurosurgical bimanual psychomotor performance have not been developed. Virtual reality simulators, such as NeuroTouch, allow the testing of acute stress on psychomotor performance in risk-free environments. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the impact of a simulated stressful virtual reality tumor resection scenario by utilizing NeuroTouch to answer 2 questions: 1) What is the impact of acute stress on bimanual psychomotor performance during the resection of simulated tumors? 2) Does acute stress influence bimanual psychomotor performance immediately following the stressful episode? METHODS Study participants included 6 neurosurgeons, 6 senior and 6 junior neurosurgical residents, and 6 medical students. Participants resected a total of 6 simulated tumors, 1 of which (Tumor 4) involved uncontrollable "intraoperative" bleeding resulting in simulated cardiac arrest and thus providing the acute stress scenario. Tier 1 metrics included extent of blood loss, percentage of tumor resected, and "normal" brain tissue volume removed. Tier 2 metrics included simulated suction device (sucker) and ultrasonic aspirator total tip path length, as well as the sum and maximum forces applied in using these instruments. Advanced Tier 2 metrics included efficiency index, coordination index, ultrasonic aspirator path length index, and ultrasonic aspirator bimanual forces ratio. All metrics were assessed before, during, and after the stressful scenario. RESULTS The stress scenario caused expected significant increases in blood loss in all participant groups. Extent of tumor resected and brain volume removed decreased in the junior resident and medical student groups. Sucker total tip path length increased in the neurosurgeon group, whereas sucker forces increased in the senior resident group. Psychomotor performance on advanced Tier 2 metrics was altered during the stress scenario in all participant groups. Performance on all advanced Tier 2 metrics returned to pre-stress levels in the post stress scenario tumor resections. CONCLUSIONS Results demonstrated that acute stress initiated by simulated severe intraoperative bleeding significantly decreases bimanual psychomotor performance during the acute stressful episode. The simulated intraoperative bleeding event had no significant influence on the advanced Tier 2 metrics monitored during the immediate post-stress operative performance.

While they manifest in many forms, there are commonalities that link them together. In this review, we will focus on neurotrophins - a family of related factors involved in neuronal development and maintenance. Neurodegenerative diseases often present with a neurotrophin imbalance, in which there may be decreases in trophic signaling through Trk receptors for example, and/or increases in pro-apoptotic activity through p75. Clinical trials with neurotrophins have continuously failed due to their poor pharmacological properties as well as the unavoidable activation of p75. Thus, there is a need for drugs without such setbacks. Small molecule neurotrophin mimetics are favorable options since they can selectively activate Trks or inactivate p75. In this review, we will initially present a brief outline of how these molecules are synthesized and their mechanisms of action; followed by an update in the current state of neurotrophins and small molecules in major neurodegenerative diseases. Although there has been significant progress in the development of potential therapeutics, more studies are needed to establish clear mechanisms of action and target specificity in order to transition from animal models to the assessment of safety and use in humans.

In Experiment 1, native and non-native (L2 only) phonological contrasts were presented as syllables during a task that directed attention to phonological form. Phonological categorization was assessed with MMN, N2b and P3b effects. In Experiment 2, the same contrasts were presented as words/ pseudowords during a task that directed attention to semantics. Phonological discrimination was assessed with N400 pseudoword effects. High proficiency L2 learners displayed similar ERPs as native speakers in both experiments; low proficiency L2 learners showed discrimination of non-native contrasts in Experiment 1 (directed attention task) only. Thus, L2 phonological discrimination by late learners may depend on stimulus/task factors and occurs in a wider range of contexts as L2 proficiency improves.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Allometric scaling of brain regions to intra-cranial volume: An epidemiological MRI study	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						MRI; allometry; intra-cranial volume; brain; cortex; striatum; white matter; thalamus; AGES-Reykjavik; ADNI; CARDIA	CORTICAL SURFACE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SIZE; IMAGES; SHAPE; SEGMENTATION; ADJUSTMENT; REYKJAVIK; MAMMALS; AGE	There is growing evidence that sub-structures of the brain scale allometrically to total brain size, that is, in a non-proportional and non-linear way. Here, scaling of different volumes of interest (VOI) to intra-cranial volume (ICV) was examined. It was assessed whether scaling was allometric or isometric and whether scaling coefficients significantly differed from each other. We also tested to what extent allometric scaling of VOI was introduced by the automated segmentation technique. Furthermore, reproducibility of allometric scaling was studied different age groups and study populations. Study samples included samples of cognitively healthy adults from the community-based Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik Study) (N=3,883), the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA) (N =709), and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N=180). Data encompassed participants with different age, ethnicity, risk factor profile, and ICV and VOI obtained with different automated MRI segmentation techniques. Our analysis showed that (1) allometric scaling is a trait of all parts of the brain, (2) scaling of neo-cortical white matter, neo-cortical gray matter, and deep gray matter structures including the cerebellum are significantly different from each other, and (3) allometric scaling of brain structures cannot solely be explained by age-associated atrophy, sex, ethnicity, or a systematic bias from study-specific segmentation algorithm, but appears to be a true feature of brain geometry.

Traditional methods for delineating the peri-infarct gray matter (GM) have used a volumetric Euclidean distance metric to define its extent around the infarct. This metric has limitations in the case of cortical stroke, i.e., those where ischemia leads to infarction in the cortical GM, because the vascularization of the cerebral cortex follows the complex, folded topology of the cortical surface. Instead, we used a geodesic distance metric along the cortical surface to subdivide the PIC into equidistant rings emanating from the infarct border and compared this new approach to a Euclidean distance metric definition. This was done in 11 patients with [F-18]-Flumazenil ([18-F]-FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) scans at 2 weeks post-stroke and at 6 month follow-up. FMZ is a PET radiotracer with specific binding to the alpha subunits of the type A -aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor. Additionally, we used partial-volume correction (PVC) of the PET images to compensate for potential cortical thinning and long-term neuronal loss in follow-up images. The difference in non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) between the stroke unaffected and affected hemispheres was 35% larger in the geodesic versus the Euclidean peri-infarct models in initial PET images and 48% larger in follow-up PET images. The inter-hemispheric BPND difference was approximately 17-20% larger after PVC when compared to uncorrected PET images. PET studies of peri-infarct GM in cortical strokes should use a geodesic model and include PVC as a preprocessing step. Hum Brain Mapp 38:326-338, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We identified a mutation in the gene encoding the deubiquitination enzyme USP15 (Usp15(L749R)) that protected mice against both experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) induced by Plasmodium berghei and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Combining immunophenotyping and RNA sequencing in brain (ECM) and spinal cord (EAE) revealed that Usp15(L749)R-associated resistance to neuroinflammation was linked to dampened type I interferon responses in situ. In hematopoietic cells and in resident brain cells, USP15 was coexpressed with, and functionally acted together with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to positively regulate type I interferon responses and to promote pathogenesis during neuroinflammation. The USP15-TRIM25 dyad might be a potential target for intervention in acute or chronic states of neuroinflammation.

To explore this concept, we assessed pre-synaptic mitochondrial function in hemizygous (+/-) TgMcGill-R-Thy1-APP rats. The low burden of A beta and the wide array of behavioral and cognitive impairments described in 6-month-old hemizygous TgMcGill-R-Thy1-APP rats (Tg(+/-)) support their use to investigate synaptic bioenergetics deficiencies described in subjects with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this report, we show that pre-synaptic mitochondria from Tg(+/-) rats evidence a decreased respiratory control ratio and spare respiratory capacity associated with deficits in complex I enzymatic activity. Cognitive impairments were prevented and bioenergetic deficits partially reversed when Tg(+/-) rats were fed a nutritionally complete diet from weaning to 6-month-old supplemented with pyrroloquinoline quinone, a mitochondrial biogenesis stimulator with antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. These results provide evidence that, as described in AD brain and not proven in Tg mice models with AD-like phenotype, the mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity of synaptosomes is not conserved in the Tg(+/-) rats. This animal model may be suitable for understanding the basic biochemical mechanisms involved in early AD.

Decades of functional neuroimaging experiments have used this distinction to isolate the neural basis of lexical (word level) semantics, associated with areas such as the middle temporal, angular, and posterior cingulate gyri that overlap the default mode network. In two fMRI experiments, a different set of findings emerged when word stimuli were used that were less familiar (measured by word frequency) than those typically used. Instead of activating default mode network areas often associated with semantic processing, words activated task-positive areas such as the inferior pFC and SMA, along with multifunctional ventral occipitotemporal cortices related to reading, whereas nonwords activated default mode areas previously associated with semantics. Effective connectivity analyses of fMRI data on less familiar words showed activation driven by task-positive and multifunctional reading-related areas, whereas highly familiar words showed bottom-up activation flow from occipitotemporal cortex. These findings suggest that functional neuroimaging correlates of semantic processing are less stable than previously assumed, with factors such as word frequency influencing the balance between task-positive, reading-related, and default mode networks. More generally, this suggests that results of contrasts typically interpreted in terms of semantic content may be more influenced by factors related to task difficulty than is widely appreciated.

Low antioxidant cell activity has also been linked to decline in memory due to aging. However, it has not yet been established whether the heavy metal-memory relationship is mediated by differences in antioxidant activity. Methods: We examined Cd and Pb levels, as well as oxidative stress parameters, in blood samples from 125 older adults (age range 50-82 years). The Counting Span Test (CST) was used to evaluate working memory capacity (WMC). The Monte Carlo Method for Assessing Mediation (MCMAM) was used to analyze the mediation role of antioxidant activity in the heavy metals-memory association. Results: High blood Cd (BCd) concentration alone, and in combination with elevated blood Pb (BPb) concentration, was associated with poor WMC (p = 0.001) and low enzymatic antioxidant defenses (p = 0.006). The variance in WMC accounted for by BCd or by BCd combine with BPb was 20.6% and 18.6%, respectively. The MCMAM revealed that the influence of BCd and BPb concentrations on WMC was mediated by low antioxidant capacity (confidence interval -CI: 0.072 to -0.064 for BCd; CI: -0.062 to -0.045 for BPb). Conclusion: These findings showed Pb and Cd blood concentration in older adults, even at levels below the current recommended threshold, was negatively associated with WMC and that this relationship may be partly mediated by low antioxidant defenses. Knowledge on the environmental factors that negatively influence brain and cognition during aging can help inform public policy strategies to prevent and control the adverse effects of environmental contaminant exposure during aging.

A pilot study of hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate in youth with treatment resistant major depression	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Adolescent; Depression; Glutamate; Hippocampus; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; N-Acetyl-Aspartate	ACETYLASPARTATE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISORDER; CORTEX; VOLUME; BRAIN; AGE	Background: Smaller hippocampal volumes, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) indexed alterations in brain metabolites have been identified in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Our group has found similar effects in MDD youth. However, this has not been studied in youth with treatment resistant MDD (TRD), nor has the interaction between regional N-acetyl-aspartate and volume deficits. N-acetyl-aspartate is an amino acid in the synthesis pathway of glutamate and serves a marker of neuronal viability/number. Methods: Fifteen typically developing youth (16-22 years of age; 7 males, 8 females) and eighteen youth with TRD (14-22 years of age; 8 males, 10 females) underwent H-1-MRS and MRI on a 3 T scanner. A short echo PRESS protocol was used with voxels in the right and left hippocampi (6 mL each). Hippocampal volume war evaluated using FreeSurfer. Results: Compared with the typically developing group, youth with TRD had lower concentrations of N-acetylaspartate in the left hippocampus (p=0.004), and a trend for smaller left hippocampal volume (p=0.067). In TRD subjects, hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate was inversely correlated with left (r=-0.68, p=0.003) but not right hippocampal volume. Right hippocampal glutamate+glutamine was greater in TRD youth compared to typically developing controls (p=0.007). Conclusions: These results suggest a neurochemical and structural deficit in the hippocampi of youth with TRD These findings fit with the role of N-acetyl-aspartate in glutamate neurotransmission and the effect of glutamate on brain morphology.

Method Participants received 16h of either CO-OP or COMPUTER training. We assessed feasibility and acceptability of each intervention, and change in intervention outcomes at baseline, post-intervention and one-month follow-up. Performance and satisfaction with performance in self-selected everyday life goals were measured by the participant and the significant other-rated Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). Other intervention outcomes included changes in EF impairment, participation in daily life and self-efficacy. Results Six participants received CO-OP and five received COMPUTER training: one in each group discontinued the intervention for medical reasons unrelated to the intervention. The remaining nine participants completed all 16 sessions. Participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with both interventions. Both treatment groups showed large improvements in self and significant other-rated performance and satisfaction with performance on their goals immediately post-intervention and at follow-up (CO-OP: effect sizes (ES)=1.6-3.5; COMPUTER: ES=0.9-4.0), with statistically significant within-group differences in CO-OP (p<0.05). The COMPUTER group also showed large improvements in some areas of EF impairment targeted by the computerised tasks (ES=0.9-1.6); the CO-OP group demonstrated large improvements in self-efficacy for performing everyday activities (ES=1.5). Conclusions Our findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of using both CO-OP and COMPUTER training with patients with executive dysfunction post-stroke.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Seventeen facilities providing acute care and intensive inpatient and outpatient TBI adult rehabilitation. Participants Five-hundred thirty adults (GCS=3-15; mean age =41.5 +/- 16.9 years) who received rehabilitation were administered the questionnaire during an interview near time of discharge. Subjects responded to the 61 PQRS-Montreal items (five-point scale of agreement) and to the Client Satisfaction Question (CSQ8). Results Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified three potential subscales (one- and two-factor solutions) explaining 26.1-41% of the variance (ecological approach, quality of team, service organization). The subscales' internal structures were interpretable and their internal consistency varied from 0.51 to 0.90 (Cronbach's alpha). Rehabilitation phase significantly and positively impacted factor scores and all factor scores were significantly and moderately correlated with CSQ8 scores. Conclusions The PQRS-Montreal possesses adequate psychometric properties supporting its use as a valid tool to measure patients' perception of the quality of TBI rehabilitation services. This tool could help guide the development and monitoring of TBI rehabilitation service delivery.

Attention has thus shifted to investigating mechanisms underlying such differences. Recent evidence suggests that neuroimmune modulation of pain may represent an important cause of sex differences. The current Review examines the evidence for gonadal hormone modulation of the immune system, immune system modulation of pain, and interactions that might help to explain sex differences in pain.

The proposed networks are tailored to glioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their very nature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kind of shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of a machine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN while being extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different model choices that we've found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance. We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data. We present a novel CNN architecture which differs from those traditionally used in computer vision. Our CNN exploits both local features as well as more global contextual features simultaneously. Also, different from most traditional uses of CNNs, our networks use a final layer that is a convolutional implementation of a fully connected layer which allows a 40 fold speed up. We also describe a 2-phase training procedure that allows us to tackle difficulties related to the imbalance of tumor labels. Finally, we explore a cascade architecture in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as an additional source of information for a subsequent CNN. Results reported on the 2013 BRATS test data-set reveal that our architecture improves over the currently published state-of-the-art while being over 30 times faster. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Algorithms for stroke lesion segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes are intensely researched, but the reported results are largely incomparable due to different datasets and evaluation schemes. We approached this urgent problem of comparability with the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2015 conference. In this paper we propose a common evaluation framework, describe the publicly available datasets, and present the results of the two sub-challenges: Sub-Acute Stroke Lesion Segmentation (SISS) and Stroke Perfusion Estimation (SPES). A total of 16 research groups participated with a wide range of state-of-the-art automatic segmentation algorithms. A thorough analysis of the obtained data enables a critical evaluation of the current state-of-the-art, recommendations for further developments, and the identification of remaining challenges. The segmentation of acute perfusion lesions addressed in SPES was found to be feasible. However, algorithms applied to sub-acute lesion segmentation in SISS still lack accuracy. Overall, no algorithmic characteristic of any method was found to perform superior to the others. Instead, the characteristics of stroke lesion appearances, their evolution, and the observed challenges should be studied in detail. The annotated ISLES image datasets continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system to serve as an ongoing benchmarking resource (www.isles-challenge.org). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is rendered unreliable when brain shift invalidates the patient-to-image registration. Many investigators have tried to explain, quantify, and compensate for this phenomenon to allow extended use of neuronavigation systems for the duration of surgery. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the work that has been done investigating brain shift. Methods: A review of the literature dealing with the explanation, quantification and compensation of brain shift is presented. The review is based on a systematic search using relevant keywords and phrases in PubMed. The review is organized based on a developed taxonomy that classifies brain shift as occurring due to physical, surgical or biological factors. Results: This paper gives an overview of the work investigating, quantifying, and compensating for brain shift in neuronavigation while describing the successes, setbacks, and additional needs in the field. An analysis of the literature demonstrates a high variability in the methods used to quantify brain shift as well as a wide range in the measured magnitude of the brain shift, depending on the specifics of the intervention. The analysis indicates the need for additional research to be done in quantifying independent effects of brain shift in order for some of the state of the art compensation methods to become useful. Conclusion: This review allows for a thorough understanding of the work investigating brain shift and introduces the needs for future avenues of investigation of the phenomenon.

J	Voyer, D; Levesque, D; Rompre, PP				Voyer, David; Levesque, Daniel; Rompre, Pierre-Paul			Repeated ventral midbrain neurotensin injections sensitize to amphetamine-induced locomotion and ERK activation: A role for NMDA receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Accumbens; Amphetamine; ERK; Glutamate; Neurotensin; Prefrontal cortex; Ventral midbrain	RAT SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; FIBROBLAST-GROWTH-FACTOR; TEGMENTAL AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; DOPAMINE NEURONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; SYSTEMIC AMPHETAMINE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY	Previous studies have shown that activation of ventral midbrain NMDA receptors is required to initiate sensitization by amphetamine. In view of the recent evidence that neurotensin modulates ventral midbrain glutamate neurotransmission, we tested the hypothesis that neurotensin is acting upstream to glutamate to initiate sensitization to the behavioral and neurochemical effects of amphetamine. During a first testing phase, adult male rats implanted with bilateral ventral midbrain cannulae were injected every second day for three days with D-[Tyr(11)]neurotensin (1.5 nmol/side), the preferred NMDA GluN2A/B antagonist, CPP (40 or 120 pmol/side), the selective GluN2B antagonist, Ro04-5595 (200 or 1200 pmol/side), CPP (40 or 120 pmol/side) + D-[Tyr(11)]neurotensin (1.5 nmol/side) or Ro04-5595 (200 or 1200 pmol/side) + D-[Tyre] neurotensin (1.5 nmol/side) and locomotor activity was measured immediately after the injection. Five days after the last central injection, the locomotor response or the expression of phosphorylated extra cellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (pERK1/2) in neurons of different limbic nuclei was measured following a systemic injection of amphetamine sulfate (0.75 mg/kg, i.p.). Results show that amphetamine induced significantly stronger locomotor activity and pERK1/2 expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and infralimbic cortex in neurotensin pre-exposed animals than in controls (vehicle pre-exposed). These sensitization effects initiated by neurotensin were prevented by CPP, but not Ro04-5595. These results support the hypothesis that neurotensin is stimulating glutamate neurotransmission to initiate neural changes that sub-serve amphetamine sensitization and that glutamate is acting on NMDA receptors that are mostly likely composed of GluN2A, but not GluN2B, subunits.

J	Lahmiri, S				Lahmiri, Salim			Glioma detection based on multi-fractal features of segmented brain MRI by particle swarm optimization techniques	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain magnetic resonance image; Glioma; Particle swarm optimization; Segmentation; Spectral distribution; Generalized hurst exponents; Support vector machines; Classification	CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES; PERFORMANCE; DISEASE; SERIES; TUMORS	We seek to compare three automated diagnosis systems to detect glioma in brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Each glioma diagnosis system is composed of four steps. First, a given particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to segment brain magnetic resonance image (MRI). For instance, brain MRI segmentation is performed either by classical PSO, Darwinian particle swarm optimization (DPSO), or fractional-order DPSO (FODPSO). Second, the directional spectral distribution (DSD) signature of the segmented image is computed. Third, multi-fractals of the computed DSD are estimated by generalized Hurst exponents. Fourth, classification of the obtained multi-fractal features is performed by support vector machine (SVM). The leave-one-out cross-validation method (LOOM) is adopted to assess the classification accuracy of all three glioma detection systems. The experimental results indicate that (1) PSO-DSD-MSA system achieved 98.01% +/- 0.07 classification accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 94.78% +/- 0.02 specificity, (2) DPSO-DSD-MSA achieved 98.38% +/- 0.01 classification accuracy, 99.5% +/- 0.02 sensitivity, and 96.70% +/- 0.02 specificity, and (3) the FODPSO-DSD-MSA system reached 99.18% +/- 0.01 classification accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 97.95% +/- 0.036 specificity. The overall processing time is less than 5 s. All presented systems achieved higher performances in comparison with previous works. As FODPSO-DSD-MSA accuracy is high and processing time is low, it may be a promising automated glioma diagnosis system in clinical milieu. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, we believe that the long-and-well investigated domain-specific knowledge should still help to boost the performance of HCCR. By integrating the traditional normalization-cooperated direction-decomposed feature map (directMap) with the deep convolutional neural network (convNet), we are able to obtain new highest accuracies for both online and offline HCCR on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. With this new framework, we can eliminate the needs for data augmentation and model ensemble, which are widely used in other systems to achieve their best results. This makes our framework to be efficient and effective for both training and testing. Furthermore, although directMap+ convNet can achieve the best results and surpass human-level performance, we show that writer adaptation in this case is still effective. A new adaptation layer is proposed to reduce the mismatch between training and test data on a particular source layer. The adaptation process can be efficiently and effectively implemented in an unsupervised manner. By adding the adaptation layer into the pre-trained convNet, it can adapt to the new handwriting styles of particular writers, and the recognition accuracy can be further improved consistently and significantly. This paper gives an overview and comparison of recent deep learning based approaches for HCCR, and also sets new benchmarks for both online and offline HCCR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Alterations in the neuropeptide galanin system in major depressive disorder involve levels of transcripts, methylation, and peptide	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						epigenetics; human postmortem brain; neuropeptides; stress; transmitter coexistence	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LOCUS-COERULEUS NEURONS; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL POLYPEPTIDE; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; BINDING-SITES; RAT-BRAIN; RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; DNA METHYLATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial burden to patients, families, and society, but many patients cannot be treated adequately. Rodent experiments suggest that the neuropeptide galanin (GAL) and its three G protein-coupled receptors, GAL(1-3), are involved in mood regulation. To explore the translational potential of these results, we assessed the transcript levels (by quantitative PCR), DNA methylation status (by bisulfite pyrosequencing), and GAL peptide by RIA of the GAL system in postmortem brains from depressed persons who had committed suicide and controls. Transcripts for all four members were detected and showed marked regional variations, GAL and galanin receptor 1 (GALR1) being most abundant. Striking increases in GAL and GALR3 mRNA levels, especially in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, in parallel with decreased DNA methylation, were found in both male and female suicide subjects as compared with controls. In contrast, GAL and GALR3 transcript levels were decreased, GALR1 was increased, and DNA methylation was increased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of male suicide subjects, however, there were no changes in the anterior cingulate cortex. Thus, GAL and its receptor GALR3 are differentially methylated and expressed in brains of MDD subjects in a region- and sex-specific manner. Such an epigenetic modification in GALR3, a hyperpolarizing receptor, might contribute to the dysregulation of noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD. Thus, one may speculate that a GAL(3) antagonist could have antidepressant properties by disinhibiting the firing of these neurons, resulting in increased release of noradrenaline and serotonin in forebrain areas involved in mood regulation.

Action Video Game Playing Is Reflected In Enhanced Visuomotor Performance and Increased Corticospinal Excitability	PLoS One			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; WHITE-MATTER; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; FINGER MOVEMENTS; THRESHOLD; PLASTICITY; PLAYERS; SKILL; BRAIN	Action video game playing is associated with improved visuomotor performance; however, the underlying neural mechanisms associated with this increased performance are not well understood. Using the Serial Reaction Time Task in conjunction with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, we investigated if improved visuomotor performance displayed in action video game players (actionVGPs) was associated with increased corticospinal plasticity in primary motor cortex (M1) compared to non-video game players (nonVGPs). Further, we assessed if actionVGPs and nonVGPs displayed differences in procedural motor learning as measured by the SRTT. We found that at the behavioral level, both the actionVGPs and nonVGPs showed evidence of procedural learning with no significant difference between groups. However, the actionVGPs displayed higher visuomotor performance as evidenced by faster reaction times in the SRTT. This observed enhancement in visuomotor performance amongst actionVGPs was associated with increased corticospinal plasticity in M1, as measured by corticospinal excitability changes pre- and post-SRTT and corticospinal excitability at rest before motor practice. Our results show that aVGPs, who are known to have better performance on visual and motor tasks, also display increased corticospinal excitability after completing a novel visuomotor task.

Our genetic and electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that acute fasting blocks retrograde synaptic enhancement that is normally triggered as a result of reduction in postsynaptic receptor function at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This negative regulation critically depends on transcriptional enhancement of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP) under the control of the transcription factor Forkhead box O (Foxo). Furthermore, our findings indicate that postsynaptic 4E-BP exerts a constitutive negative input, which is counteracted by a positive regulatory input from the Target of Rapamycin (TOR). This combinatorial retrograde signaling plays a key role in regulating synaptic strength. Our results provide a mechanistic insight into how cellular stress and nutritional scarcity could acutely influence synaptic homeostasis and functional stability in neural circuits.

Investigating the Potential Signaling Pathways That Regulate Activation of the Novel PKC Downstream of Serotonin in Aplysia	PLoS One			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE-C; LONG-TERM FACILITATION; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; SENSORY NEURONS; APL-II; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; PRESYNAPTIC FACILITATION; SYNAPTIC FACILITATION; NONDEPRESSED SYNAPSES; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY	Activation of the novel PKC Apl ll in sensory neurons by serotonin (5HT) underlies the ability of 5HT to reverse synaptic depression, but the pathway from 5HT to PKC Apl ll activation remains unclear. Here we find no evidence for the Ap/ysia-specific B receptors, or for adenylate cyclase activation, to translocate fluorescently-tagged PKC Apl II. Using an anti-PKC Apl ll antibody, we monitor translocation of endogenous PKC Apl ll and determine the dose response for PKC Apl I I translocation, both in isolated sensory neurons and sensory neurons coupled with motor neurons. Using this assay, we confirm an important role for tyrosine kinase activation in 5HT mediated PKC Apl II translocation, but rule out roles for intracellular tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and Trk kinases in this response. A partial inhibition of translocation by a fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-receptor inhibitor led us to clone the Aplysia FGF receptor. Since a number of related receptors have been recently characterized, we use bioinformatics to define the relationship between these receptors and find a single FGF receptor orthologue in Aplysia. However, expression of the FGF receptor did not affect translocation or allow it in motor neurons where 5HT does not normally cause PKC Apl II translocation. These results suggest that additional receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or other molecules must also be involved in translocation of PKC Apl II.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between participation in physical activity within 7 days postinjury and incidence of persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multicenter cohort study (August 2013-June 2015) of 3063 children and adolescents aged 5.00-17.99 years with acute concussion from 9 Pediatric Emergency Research Canada network emergency departments (EDs). EXPOSURES Early physical activity participation within 7 days postinjury. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Physical activity participation and postconcussive symptom severity were rated using standardized questionnaires in the ED and at days 7 and 28 postinjury. PPCS (>= 3 new orworsening symptoms on the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory) was assessed at 28 days postenrollment. Early physical activity and PPCS relationships were examined by unadjusted analysis, 1: 1 propensity score matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Sensitivity analyses examined patients (>= 3 symptoms) at day 7. RESULTS Among 2413 participants who completed the primary outcome and exposure, (mean [SD] age, 11.77 [3.35] years; 1205 [39.3%] females), PPCS at 28 days occurred in 733 (30.4%); 1677 (69.5%) participated in early physical activity including light aerobic exercise (n = 795 [32.9%]), sport-specific exercise (n = 214 [8.9%]), noncontact drills (n = 143 [5.9%]), full-contact practice (n = 106 [4.4%]), or full competition (n = 419 [17.4%]), whereas 736 (30.5%) had no physical activity. On unadjusted analysis, early physical activity participants had lower risk of PPCS than those with no physical activity (24.6% vs 43.5%; Absolute risk difference [ARD], 18.9%[95% CI, 14.7%-23.0%]). Early physical activity was associated with lower PPCS risk on propensity score matching (n = 1108 [28.7% for early physical activity vs 40.1% for no physical activity]; ARD, 11.4%[95% CI, 5.8%-16.9%]) and on inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis (n = 2099; relative risk [RR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.65-0.84]; ARD, 9.7%[95% CI, 5.7%-13.7%]). Among only patients symptomatic at day 7 (n = 803) compared with those who reported no physical activity (n = 584; PPCS, 52.9%), PPCS rates were lower for participants of light aerobic activity (n = 494 [46.4%]; ARD, 6.5% [95% CI, 5.7%-12.5%]), moderate activity (n = 176 [38.6%]; ARD, 14.3%[95% CI, 5.9%-22.2%]), and full-contact activity (n = 133 [36.1%]; ARD, 16.8%[95% CI, 7.5%-25.5%]). No significant group difference was observed on propensity-matched analysis of this subgroup (n = 776 [47.2% vs 51.5%]; ARD, 4.4%[95% CI, -2.6% to 11.3%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among participants aged 5 to 18 years with acute concussion, physical activity within 7 days of acute injury compared with no physical activity was associated with reduced risk of PPCS at 28 days. A well-designed randomized clinical trial is needed to determine the benefits of early physical activity following concussion.

In vivo, these cues are often presented within a soft extracellular matrix with elastic moduli E < 10 kPa, but in vitro haptotaxis experiments have been conducted primarily on hard substrates with elastic moduli in the MPa to GPa range. Here, a technique is presented for patterning haptotactic proteins with nanometer resolution on soft substrates with physiological elasticity. A new nanocontact printing process was developed that circumvented the use of plasma activation that was found to alter the mechanical properties of the substrate. A dissolvable poly(vinyl alcohol) film was first patterned by lift-off nanocontact printing, and in turn printed onto the soft substrate, followed by dissolution of the film in water. An array of 100 unique digital nanodot gradients (DNGs), consisting of millions of 200 X 200 nm(2) protein nanodots, was patterned in less than 5 min with with <5% average deviation from the original gradient design. DNGs of netrin-1, a known protein guidance cue, were patterned, and the unpatterned surface was backfilled with a reference surface consisting of 75% polyethylene glycol grafted with polylysine and 25% poly-D-lysine. Haptotaxis of C2C12 myoblasts demonstrated the functionality of the DNGs patterned on soft substrates. In addition, high densities of netrin-1 were observed to induce cell spreading, while live imaging of sinusoidal control gradients highlighted cell migration and navigation by "inching". The nanopatterning technique developed here paves the way for studying haptotactic responses to diverse digital nanodot patterns on surfaces covering the full range of physiological elasticity, and is expected to be applicable to the study of both culture and primary cells, such as neutrophils and neurons.

In principle, indeterminate sentences allow for an infinite number of interpretations. One theory, however, assumes that these sentences are resolved by semantic coercion, a linguistic process that forces the noun book to be interpreted as an activity (e.g., writing the book) or by a process that interpolates this activity information in the resulting enriched semantic composition. An alternative theory, pragmatic, assumes classical semantic composition, whereby meaning arises from the denotation of words and how they are combined syntactically, with enrichment obtained via pragmatic inferences beyond linguistic-semantic processes. Cognitive neuroscience studies investigating the neuroanatomical and functional correlates of indeterminate sentences have shown activations either at the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vmPFC) or at the left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG). These studies have supported the semantic coercion theory assuming that one of these regions is where enriched semantic composition takes place. Employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that indeterminate sentences activate bilaterally the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the right inferior frontal gyrus (R-IFG), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), more so than control sentences (The author wrote the book). Activation of indeterminate sentences exceeded that of anomalous sentences (...drank the book) and engaged more left-and right-hemisphere areas than other sentence types. We suggest that the widespread activations for indeterminate sentences represent the deployment of pragmatic-inferential processes, which seek to enrich sentence content without necessarily resorting to semantic coercion.

Their unusual chemical and topological properties arise from branch-point nucleotides harboring vicinal 2', 5'- and 3', 5'-phosphodiester linkages. The 2', 5'-bonds must be hydrolyzed by the RNA debranching enzyme Dbr1 before spliced introns can be degraded or processed into small nucleolar RNA and microRNA derived from intronic RNA. Here, we measure the activity of Dbr1 from Entamoeba histolytica by using a synthetic, dark-quenched bRNA substrate that fluoresces upon hydrolysis. Purified enzyme contains nearly stoichiometric equivalents of Fe and Zn per polypeptide and demonstrates turnover rates of similar to 3 s(-1). Similar rates are observed when apo-Dbr1 is reconstituted with Fe(II)+Zn(II) under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, a rate of similar to 4.0 s(-1) is observed when apoenzyme is reconstituted with Fe(II). In contrast, apo-Dbr1 reconstituted with Mn(II) or Fe(II) under aerobic conditions is inactive. Diffraction data from crystals of purified enzyme using X-rays tuned to the Fe absorption edge show Fe partitions primarily to the beta-pocket and Zn to the alpha-pocket. Structures of the catalytic mutant H91A in complex with 7-mer and 16-mer synthetic bRNAs reveal bona fide RNA branchpoints in the Dbr1 active site. A bridging hydroxide is in optimal position for nucleophilic attack of the scissile phosphate. The results clarify uncertainties regarding structure/function relationships in Dbr1 enzymes, and the fluorogenic probe permits high-throughput screening for inhibitors that may hold promise as treatments for retroviral infections and neurodegenerative disease.

How and when this coordination is achieved during development is not known. We used embryos and newborns of a precocial bird species (chickens) to assess developmental activation in different neurochemical systems using cFos expression, which has been extensively employed to examine cellular activation during S and W in adult mammals. Similarly to adult mammals, newborn awake chicks showed significantly higher cFos expression in W-active hypocretin/orexin (H/O), serotonergic Dorsal Raphe, noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus and cholinergic Laterodorsal and Pedunculopontine Tegmental (Ch-LDT/PT) neurons when compared to sleeping chicks. cFos expression was significantly correlated both between these systems, and with the amount of W. S-active melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons showed very low cFos expression with no difference between sleeping and awake chicks, possibly due to the very short duration of S episodes. In embryonic chicks, cFos expression was low or absent across all five systems at embryonic day (E) 12. Unexpectedly, a strong activation was seen at E16 in H/O neurons. The highest activation of Ch-LDT/PT (also S-active) and MCH neurons was seen at E20. These data suggest that maturation of arousal systems is achieved soon after hatching, while S-control networks are active in late chick embryos. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Evaluation of Magnesium Chloride within a Polyethylene Glycol Formulation in a Porcine Model of Acute Spinal Cord Injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						AC105; magnesium; polyethylene glycol; porcine; spinal cord injury	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; FAST-MAG; STROKE THERAPY; NEUROPROTECTIVE THERAPY; IMPACT TRAUMA; SULFATE; TRIAL; RAT; METHODOLOGY; PARAMETERS	A porcine model of spinal cord injury (SCI) was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) within a polyethylene glycol (PEG) formulation, called AC105 (Acorda Therapeutics Inc., Ardsley, NY). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that AC105 would lead to greater tissue sparing at the injury site and improved behavioral outcome when delivered in a clinically realistic time window post-injury. Four hours after contusion/compression injury, Yucatan minipigs were randomized to receive a 30-min intravenous infusion of AC105, magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), or saline. Animals received 4 additional infusions of the same dose at 6-h intervals. Behavioral recovery was tested for 12 weeks using two-dimensional (2D) kinematics during weight-supported treadmill walking and the Porcine Injury Behavior Scale (PTIBS), a 10-point locomotion scale. Spinal cords were evaluated ex vivo by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subjected to histological analysis. Treatment with AC105 or MgSO4 did not result in improvements in locomotor recovery on the PTIBS or in 2D kinematics on weight-supported treadmill walking. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) showed severe loss of tissue integrity at the impact site, with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity; this was not improved with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Histological analysis revealed no significant increase in gray or white matter sparing with AC105 or MgSO4 treatment. Finally, AC105 did not result in higher Mg2+ levels in CSF than with the use of standard MgSO4. In summary, when testing AC105 in a porcine model of SCI, we were unable to reproduce the promising therapeutic benefits observed previously in less-severe rodent models of SCI.

Denervation drives mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of octogenarians	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						aging; denervation; mitochondria; muscle atrophy; neuromuscular junction; sarcopenia	NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; PERMEABILITY TRANSITION; PROTEOLYTIC CLEAVAGE; OLDER WOMEN; AGE; ATROPHY; SARCOPENIA; MICE; ACCUMULATION; CONTRIBUTES	Mitochondria are frequently implicated in the ageing of skeletal muscle, although the role of denervation in modulating mitochondrial function in ageing muscle is unknown. We show that increased sensitivity to apoptosis initiation occurs prior to evidence of persistent denervation and is thus a primary mitochondrial defect in ageing muscle worthy of therapeutic targeting. However, at more advanced age, mitochondrial function changes are markedly impacted by persistent sporadic myofibre denervation, suggesting the mitochondrion may be a less viable therapeutic target. AbstractExperimental denervation modulates mitochondrial function, where changes in both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and sensitivity to permeability transition are implicated in the resultant muscle atrophy. Notably, although denervation occurs sporadically in ageing muscle, its impact on ageing muscle mitochondria is unknown. Because this information has important therapeutic implications concerning targeting the mitochondrion in ageing muscle, we examined mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle from four groups of humans, comprising two active (meanSD age: 23.72.7years and 71.24.9years) and two inactive groups (64.83.1years and 82.5 +/- 4.8years), and compared this with a murine model of sporadic denervation. We tested the hypothesis that, although some alterations of mitochondrial function in aged muscle are attributable to a primary organelle defect, mitochondrial dysfunction would be impacted by persistent denervation in advanced age. Both ageing in humans and sporadic denervation in mice increased mitochondrial sensitivity to permeability transition (humans, P=0.004; mice, P=0.01). To determine the contribution of sporadic denervation to mitochondrial function, we pharmacologically inhibited the denervation-induced ROS response. This reduced ROS emission by 60% (P=0.02) in sporadically denervated mouse muscle, which is similar to that seen in humans older than 75 years (-66%, P=0.02) but not those younger than 75 years. We conclude that an increased sensitivity to permeability transition is a primary mitochondrial defect in ageing muscle. However, at more advanced age, when muscle atrophy becomes more clinically severe, mitochondrial function changes are markedly impacted by persistent sporadic denervation, making the mitochondrion a less viable therapeutic target. Mitochondria are frequently implicated in the ageing of skeletal muscle, although the role of denervation in modulating mitochondrial function in ageing muscle is unknown. We show that increased sensitivity to apoptosis initiation occurs prior to evidence of persistent denervation and is thus a primary mitochondrial defect in ageing muscle worthy of therapeutic targeting. However, at more advanced age, mitochondrial function changes are markedly impacted by persistent sporadic myofibre denervation, suggesting the mitochondrion may be a less viable therapeutic target.

Efforts to translate novel therapies in acute clinical trials are impeded by the SCI community's singular dependence upon functional outcome measures. Therefore, a compelling rationale exists to establish neurochemical biomarkers for the objective classification of injury severity. In this study, CSF and serum samples were obtained at 3 time points (similar to 24, 48, and 72 hours post-injury) from 30 acute SCI patients (10 AIS A, 12 AIS B, and 8 AIS C). A differential chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (CIL LC-MS) with a universal metabolome standard (UMS) was applied to the metabolomic profiling of these samples. This method provided enhanced detection of the amine-and phenol-containing submetabolome. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed dysregulations in arginine-proline metabolism following SCI. Six CSF metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of baseline injury severity, and good classification performance (AUC > 0.869) was achieved by using combinations of these metabolites in pair-wise comparisons of AIS A, B and C patients. Using the UMS strategy, the current data set can be expanded to a larger cohort for biomarker validation, as well as discovering biomarkers for predicting neurologic outcome.

Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However, little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously, we identified that translational control by elF2 alpha phosphorylation (p-elF2 alpha) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al., 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-elF2 alpha-mediated translation, cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover, selectively inhibiting elF2 alpha-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB, or knocking down oligophrenin-1 an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-elF2 alpha in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GIuR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively, our findings suggest that elF2 alpha-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP.

The poor prognosis associated with this condition reflects the unmet medical need for effective ammonia-lowering treatments. Here, the translational potential of liposome-supported peritoneal dialysis (LSPD), a recently-developed detoxification strategy for the removal of small ionizable molecules like ammonia, is described. Dialysis fluids supplemented with micrometer-sized, transmembrane pH-gradient liposomes are prepared via an innovative, osmotic shock-based method overcoming sterilization and long-term stability issues. LSPD is able to sequester ammonia in healthy rats in relation to the injected dose, buffering capacity of the liposomal core, and membrane composition. In a rat model of cirrhosis, LSPD outperforms conventional peritoneal dialysis in lowering plasmatic ammonia levels and attenuating brain edema. LSPD does not trigger any hypersensitive reaction in pigs, a side effect commonly observed upon the injection of colloids in this animal model and in humans. These findings support the development of LSPD for the treatment of hyperammonemia-induced encephalopathy.

Effects of delaying binge drinking on adolescent brain development: a longitudinal neuroimaging study	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Neurodevelopment; Alcohol use; Adolescence; Preventative intervention program; Functional imaging; Structural imaging	TARGETED INTERVENTIONS DELAY; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDERS; DUAL SYSTEMS-MODEL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SENSATION SEEKING; SUBSTANCE USE; RISK-TAKING; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Background: Onset of alcohol use by 14 relative to 21 years of age strongly predicts elevated risk for severe alcohol use problems, with 27% versus 4% of individuals exhibiting alcohol dependence within 10 years of onset. What remains unclear is whether this early alcohol use (i) is a marker for later problems, reflected as a pre-existing developmental predisposition, (ii) causes global neural atrophy or (iii) specifically disturbs neuro-maturational processes implicated in addiction, such as executive functions or reward processing. Since our group has demonstrated that a novel intervention program targeting personality traits associated with adolescent alcohol use can prevent the uptake of drinking and binge drinking by 40 to 60%, a crucial question is whether prevention of early onset alcohol misuse will protect adolescent neurodevelopment and which domains of neurodevelopment can be protected. Methods: A subsample of 120 youth at high risk for substance misuse and 30 low-risk youth will be recruited from the Co-Venture trial (Montreal, Canada) to take part in this 5-year follow-up neuroimaging study. The Co-Venture trial is a community-based cluster-randomised trial evaluating the effectiveness of school-based personality-targeted interventions on substance use and cognitive outcomes involving approximately 3800 Grade 7 youths. Half of the 120 high-risk participants will have received the preventative intervention program. Cognitive tasks and structural and functional neuroimaging scans will be conducted at baseline, and at 24- and 48-month follow-up. Two functional paradigms will be used: the Stop-Signal Task to measure motor inhibitory control and a modified version of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task to evaluate reward processing. Discussion: The expected results should help identify biological vulnerability factors, and quantify the consequences of early alcohol abuse as well as the benefits of early intervention using brain metrics.

Efficacy and safety of tau-aggregation inhibitor therapy in patients with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease: a randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm, phase 3 trial	LANCET			English	Article							PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENT; AMYLOID-BETA; METHYLENE-BLUE; MOUSE MODEL; BRAIN; PATHOLOGY; METHYLTHIONINIUM; METABOLISM; VALIDITY; ADULTS	Background Leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate; LMTM), a stable reduced form of the methylthioninium moiety, acts as a selective inhibitor of tau protein aggregation both in vitro and in transgenic mouse models. Methylthioninium chloride has previously shown potential effi cacy as monotherapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to determine whether LMTM was safe and effective in modifying disease progression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Methods We did a 15-month, randomised, controlled double-blind, parallel-group trial at 115 academic centres and private research clinics in 16 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and Russia with patients younger than 90 years with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Patients concomitantly using other medicines for Alzheimer's disease were permitted to be included because we considered it infeasible not to allow their inclusion; however, patients using medicines carrying warnings of methaemoglobinaemia were excluded because the oxidised form of methylthioninium in high doses has been shown to induce this condition. We randomly assigned participants (3: 3: 4) to 75 mg LMTM twice a day, 125 mg LMTM twice a day, or control (4 mg LMTM twice a day to maintain blinding with respect to urine or faecal discolouration) administered as oral tablets. We did the randomisation with an interactive web response system using 600 blocks of length ten, and stratifi ed patients by severity of disease, global region, whether they were concomitantly using Alzheimer's disease-labelled medications, and site PET capability. Participants, their study partners (generally carers), and all assessors were masked to treatment assignment throughout the study. The coprimary outcomes were progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) scales from baseline assessed at week 65 in the modifi ed intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials. gov (NCT01689246) and the European Union Clinical Trials Registry (2012-002866-11). Findings Between Jan 29, 2013, and June 26, 2014, we recruited and randomly assigned 891 participants to treatment (357 to control, 268 to 75 mg LMTM twice a day, and 266 to 125 mg LMTM twice a day). The prespecifi ed primary analyses did not show any treatment benefi t at either of the doses tested for the coprimary outcomes (change in ADAS-Cog score compared with control [ n= 354, 6.32, 95% CI 5.31-7.34]: 75 mg LMTM twice a day [n= 257] -0.02, -1.60 to 1.56, p= 0.9834, 125 mg LMTM twice a day [n= 250] -0.43, -2 .06 to 1.20, p= 0.9323; change in ADCS-ADL score compared with control [-8 . 22, 95% CI -9 . 63 to -6 . 82]: 75 mg LMTM twice a day -0.93, -3.12 to 1.26, p= 0 . 8659; 125 mg LMTM twice a day -0.34, -2.61 to 1 . 93, p= 0.9479). Gastrointestinal and urinary eff ects were the most common adverse events with both high doses of LMTM, and the most common causes for discontinuation. Non-clinically signifi cant dose-dependent reductions in haemoglobin concentrations were the most common laboratory abnormality. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities were noted in less than 1% (8/885) of participants. Interpretation The primary analysis for this study was negative, and the results do not suggest benefi t of LMTM as an add-on treatment for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Findings from a recently completed 18-month trial of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease will be reported soon.

Accelerated craniofacial bone regeneration through dense collagen gel scaffolds seeded with dental pulp stem cells	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HUMAN AMNIOTIC-FLUID; NEURAL CREST; RAT MODEL; IN-VIVO; TISSUE; DEFECTS; DIFFERENTIATION; REPAIR; COMPRESSION; MARROW	Therapies using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) seeded scaffolds may be applicable to various fields of regenerative medicine, including craniomaxillofacial surgery. Plastic compression of collagen scaffolds seeded with MSC has been shown to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of MSC as it increases the collagen fibrillary density. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the osteogenic effects of dense collagen gel scaffolds seeded with mesenchymal dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) on bone regeneration in a rat critical-size calvarial defect model. Two symmetrical full-thickness defects were created (5 mm diameter) and filled with either a rat DPSC-containing dense collagen gel scaffold (n = 15), or an acellular scaffold (n = 15). Animals were imaged in vivo by microcomputer tomography (Micro-CT) once a week during 5 weeks, whereas some animals were sacrificed each week for histology and histomorphometry analysis. Bone mineral density and bone micro-architectural parameters were significantly increased when DPSC-seeded scaffolds were used. Histological and histomorphometrical data also revealed significant increases in fibrous connective and mineralized tissue volume when DPSC-seeded scaffolds were used, associated with expression of type I collagen, osteoblast-associated alkaline phosphatase and osteoclastic-related tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Results demonstrate the potential of DPSC-loaded-dense collagen gel scaffolds to benefit of bone healing process.

Increased Caspase-6 activity in the human anterior olfactory nuclei of the olfactory bulb is associated with cognitive impairment	ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Alzheimer Disease; Caspase-6; Olfactory bulb; Entorhinal cortex; Hippocampus; CA1; Memory scores; Cognitive scores; Neurofibrillary tangles; Amyloid beta peptide; Mild cognitive impairment; Non-cognitively impaired	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AXON DEGENERATION; CELL-DEATH; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; TAU PATHOLOGY; IN-VITRO; OLD-AGE; ACTIVATION; INVOLVEMENT	Abnormally elevated hippocampal Caspase-6 (Casp6) activity is intimately associated with age-related cognitive impairment in humans and in mice. In humans, these high levels of Casp6 activity are initially localized in the entorhinal cortex, the area of the brain first affected by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, according to Braak staging. The reason for the high vulnerability of entorhinal cortex neurons to neurofibrillary tangle pathology and Casp6 activity is unknown. Casp6 activity is involved in axonal degeneration, therefore, one possibility to explain increased vulnerability of the entorhinal cortex neurons would be that the afferent neurons of the olfactory bulb, some of which project their axons to the entorhinal cortex, are equally degenerating. To examine this possibility, we examined the presence of Casp6 activity, neurofibrillary tangle formation and amyloid deposition by immunohistochemistry with neoepitope antisera against the p20 subunit of active Casp6 and Tau cleaved by Casp6 (Tau Delta Casp6), phosphorylated Tau paired helical filament (PHF-1) antibodies and anti-beta-amyloid antiserum, respectively, in brains from individuals with no or mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. Co-localization of Casp6 activity, PHF-1 and beta-amyloid was detected mostly in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) of the olfactory bulb. The levels of active Casp6 in the AON, which were the highest in the AD brains, correlated with PHF-1 levels, but not with beta-amyloid levels. AON Tau Delta Casp6 levels correlated with entorhinal cortex Casp6 activity and PHF-1 levels. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that AON Casp6 activity was associated with lower global cognitive function, mini mental state exam, episodic memory and semantic memory scores. These results suggest that AON Casp6 activity could lead to Casp6-mediated degeneration in the entorhinal cortex, but cannot exclude the possibilities that entorhinal cortex degeneration signals degeneration in the AON or that the pathologies occur in both regions independently. Nevertheless, AON Casp6 activity reflects that of the entorhinal cortex.

J	Hutchinson, CV; Ledgeway, T; Baker, CL				Hutchinson, Claire V.; Ledgeway, Timothy; Baker, Curtis L., Jr.			Phase-Dependent Interactions in Visual Cortex to Combinations of First- and Second-Order Stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						contrast modulation; first-order; form-cue invariance; second-order; spatial phase; visual cortex	NEURONAL RESPONSES; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; CONTRAST MODULATION; MOTION PERCEPTION; AREA V2; LUMINANCE; TEXTURE; NONLINEARITY; 1ST-ORDER; PATTERNS	A fundamental task of the visual system is to extract figure-ground boundaries between objects, which are often defined, not only by differences in luminance, but also by "second-order" contrast or texture differences. Responses of cortical neurons to both first-and second-order patterns have been studied extensively, but only for responses to either type of stimulus in isolation. Here, we examined responses of visual cortex neurons to the spatial relationship between superimposed periodic luminance modulation (LM) and contrast modulation (CM) stimuli, the contrasts of which were adjusted to give equated responses when presented alone. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made in area 18 of the cat, the neurons of which show responses to CM and LM stimuli very similar to those in primate area V2 (Li et al., 2014). Most neurons showed a significant dependence on the relative phase of the combined LM and CM patterns, with a clear overall optimal response when they were approximately phase aligned. The degree of this phase preference, and the contributions of suppressive and/or facilitatory interactions, varied considerably from one neuron to another. Such phase-dependent and phase-invariant responses were evident in both simple-and complex-type cells. These results place important constraints on any future model of the underlying neural circuitry for second-order responses. The diversity in the degree of phase dependence between LM and CM stimuli that we observed could help to disambiguate different kinds of boundaries in natural scenes.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Asymptomatic Alzheimer disease Defining resilience	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NEUROIMAGING INITIATIVE ADNI; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; COGNITIVE RESERVE; CORTICAL SURFACE; OLDER-ADULTS; AMYLOID DEPOSITION; COORDINATE SYSTEM; COMPOSITE SCORE; HIPPOCAMPAL; MEMORY	Objective: To define robust resilience metrics by leveraging CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology within a latent variable framework and to demonstrate the ability of such metrics to predict slower rates of cognitive decline and protection against diagnostic conversion. Methods: Participants with normal cognition (n = 297) and mild cognitive impairment (n = 432) were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Resilience metrics were defined at baseline by examining the residuals when regressing brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume and cognition) on CSF biomarkers. A positive residual reflected better outcomes than expected for a given level of pathology (high resilience). Residuals were integrated into a latent variable model of resilience and validated by testing their ability to independently predict diagnostic conversion, cognitive decline, and the rate of ventricular dilation. Results: Latent variables of resilience predicted a decreased risk of conversion (hazard ratio < 0.54, p < 0.0001), slower cognitive decline (beta > 0.02, p < 0.001), and slower rates of ventricular dilation (beta < -4.7, p < 2 x 10(-15)). These results were significant even when analyses were restricted to clinically normal individuals. Furthermore, resilience metrics interacted with biomarker status such that biomarker-positive individuals with low resilience showed the greatest risk of subsequent decline. Conclusions: Robust phenotypes of resilience calculated by leveraging AD biomarkers and baseline brain aging outcomes provide insight into which individuals are at greatest risk of short-term decline. Such comprehensive definitions of resilience are needed to further our understanding of the mechanisms that protect individuals from the clinical manifestation of AD dementia, especially among biomarker-positive individuals.

Sharing brain mapping statistical results with the neuroimaging data model	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article							FMRI; REPRODUCIBILITY; METAANALYSIS; TRANSPARENCY; NEUROSCIENCE; EVOLUTION; ONTOLOGY	Only a tiny fraction of the data and metadata produced by an fMRI study is finally conveyed to the community. This lack of transparency not only hinders the reproducibility of neuroimaging results but also impairs future meta-analyses. In this work we introduce NIDM-Results, a format specification providing a machine-readable description of neuroimaging statistical results along with key image data summarising the experiment. NIDM-Results provides a unified representation of mass univariate analyses including a level of detail consistent with available best practices. This standardized representation allows authors to relay methods and results in a platform-independent regularized format that is not tied to a particular neuroimaging software package. Tools are available to export NIDM-Result graphs and associated files from the widely used SPM and FSL software packages, and the NeuroVault repository can import NIDM-Results archives. The specification is publically available at: http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/nidm-results.html.
