We investigated the capacity of the neurohormone serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) to regulate intracellular cAMP and Ca(2+) in mouse oocytes and surrounding cumulus cells. On the basis of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction study, 5-HT 7 receptor mRNA is expressed in cumulus cells, oocytes, and embryos up to the four-cell stage, and 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B) receptor mRNAs are expressed in cumulus cells only, whereas 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(4), and 5-HT(6) receptors are expressed in neither oocytes nor cumulus cells. The addition of 5-HT (10 nM to 10 mu M) to isolated metaphase II oocytes had no effect on their internal cAMP or Ca(2+) levels, whereas it caused dose-dependent cAMP and Ca(2+) increases in cumulus cells. This cAMP increase in cumulus cells could be mimicked by 5-HT agonists with the following order of potency: 5-HT > 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin = alpha-methyl-5-HT = 5-carboxamidotryptamine maleate > 2-[1-(4-piperonyl)piperazinyl] benzo-triazole, thereby supporting a preferential involvement of 5- HT 7 receptors. As measured with cumulus cells preloaded with fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester ( AM), the addition of 5- HT also caused dose-dependent Ca(2+) increases, which were probably linked to detected 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT2B receptors. Adding the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin to cumulus cells resulted in both Ca(2+) and cAMP elevations, whereas preincubation of cells with the Ca(2+) chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-AM abolished the 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) increase and reduced the cAMP increase, indicating cross-talk between the 5-HT-sensitive Ca(2+) and cAMP pathways. Our results show that 5-HT may be a local regulator in mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes through its actions on cAMP and Ca(2+) signaling, as mediated by 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), and 5- HT(7) receptors.

We confirmed the prior observation that TRAIL is enhanced on anti-CD3 activated T cells by the in vitro addition of IFN beta. T cells from IFN beta-treated patients stimulated with anti-CD3 only, had higher levels of TRAIL than untreated patients, suggesting that in vivo IFN beta exposure has an effect on TRAIL expression in association with T cell activation. In vitro IFN beta-induced TRAIL upregulation on anti-CD3 or phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells was comparable for IFN beta-treated and non-treated MS patients and controls, indicating that IFN receptors were neither saturated nor down-regulated by current IFN,6 therapy. Although GA in vivo or in vitro did not induce TRAIL, the IFN beta +GA combination in vitro enhanced TRAIL expression to higher levels than IFN,6 alone on CD4(+) T cells obtained from MS patients, regardless of GA treatment status, and healthy donors, and on GA reactive T cell lines derived from GA-treated patients or controls. Whether any observed therapeutic effects of GA/IFN beta combination therapy will correlate with TRAIL expression and function remains to be determined.

To better understand regulation of Ncam1 transcript and protein levels by p75, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The combined results suggest that p75 receptor is required for both resting and NGF-induced Ncam1 expression. Activation of TrkA receptors alone does not upregulate Ncam1. The normal Ncam1 expression depends on the relative ratio of TrkA and p75 receptors, and p75 extracellular domain is necessary for baseline Ncam1 expression. NGF-induced Ncam1 expression is dependent on the presence of an intact palmitoylation site within p75 receptor. Finally, we show that the expression of Ncam1 is altered in brains of two transgenic mouse lines that express familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-linked PSI variants, suggesting that expression of dominantly inherited mutant PSI genes interferes with the normal Ncam1 expression via the p75 signaling pathway.

The study involved six healthy participants (three male and three female), who breathed a 15% or 60% oxygen mixture starting 15 min before the injection of tracer and continuing during the entire acquisition period. Participants were injected with up to 12 mCi of alpha-MTrp. Two sets of PET images were acquired while the participants were breathing each of the oxygen mixtures and, after reconstruction, all images were converted into brain functional images illustrating the brain trapping constant K-* (mu L/g/min). The K-* values were obtained for 12 regions of interest outlined on the magnetic resonance images. The K* values obtained at high and low blood oxygen content were compared by paired statistics using Tukey's post hoc correction. As there were no difference in plasma tryptophan concentrations, these K-* values are directly related to regional 5-HT synthesis. The results showed highly significant increases (50% on average) in brain serotonin synthesis (K-* values) at high (mean value of 223 +/- 41 mmHg) relative to low (mean value 77.1 +/- 7.7 mmHg) blood oxygen levels. This suggests that tryptophan hydroxylase is not saturated with oxygen in the living human brain and that increases in blood oxygen can elevate brain serotonin synthesis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Correlated with self-esteem is internal locus of control, the individual's perception of being in control of his or her outcomes. Recently, variations in self-esteem and internal locus of control have been shown to predict the neuroendocrine cortisol response to stress. Cumulative exposure to high levels of cortisol over the lifetime is known to be related to hippocampal atrophy. We therefore examined hippocampal volume and cortisol regulation, to investigate potential biological mechanisms related to self-esteem. We investigated 16 healthy young (age range 2026 years of age) and 23 healthy elderly subjects (age range 60-84 years). The young subjects were exposed to a psychosocial stress task, while the elderly subjects were assessed for their basal cortisol regulation. Structural Magnetic Resonance Images were acquired from all subjects, and volumetric analyses were performed on medial temporal lobe structures, and whole brain gray matter. Standardized neuropsychological assessments in the elderly were performed to assess levels of cognitive performance, and to exclude the possibility of neurodegenerative disease. Self-esteem and internal locus of control were significantly correlated with hippocampal volume in both young and elderly subjects. In the young, the cortisol response to the psychosocial stress task was significantly correlated with both hippocampal volume and levels of self-esteem and locus of control, while in the elderly, these personality traits moderated age-related patterns of cognitive decline, cortisol regulation, and global brain volume decline.

To isolate the effects of dual-task processing while minimizing effects related to task-preparatory processes, we employed a blocked event-related design in which single trials and dual trials were randomly and unpredictably intermixed for one block (mixed block) and presented in isolation of one another during other blocks (pure blocks). Any differences between dual-task and single-task trials within the mixed block would be related to dual-task performance while minimizing any effects related to preparatory differences between the conditions. For this comparison, we found dual-task-related activation throughout inferior prefrontal, temporal, extrastriate, and parietal cortices and the basal ganglia. In addition, when comparing the single task within the mixed block with the single task presented in the pure block of trials, the regions involved in processes important in the mixed block yet unrelated to dual-task operations could be specified. In this comparison, we report a pattern of activation in right inferior prefrontal and superior parietal cortices. Our results argue that a variety of neural regions remain active during dual-task performance even after minimizing task-preparatory processes, but some regions implicated in dual-task performance in previous studies may have been due to task-preparation processes. Furthermore, our results suggest that dual-task operations activate the same brain areas as the single tasks, but to a greater magnitude than the single tasks. These results are discussed in relation to current conceptions of the neural correlates of dual-task performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The new method, based on discrete local maxima, is always an upper bound (like the Bonferroni), but lower and hence more accurate for large FWHM, without increasing false positives. It resulted in P values that were similar to 43% lower than the best of Bonferroni or random field theory methods when applied to a typical fMRI data set. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CRF-like immunoreactivity (CRFir) was elevated in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of adult HMS180 and HMS0 rats relative to the other groups. In the paraventricular nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and locus coeruleus, CRFir and CRF mRNA levels were significantly elevated in HMS0 and HMS180 rats. Neonatal maternal separation was associated with regionally specific alterations in CRF receptor type 1 (CRF1) mRNA density in HMS180 rats. No rearing-associated differences in CRF2 alpha binding were apparent in either the lateral septum or the ventromedial hypothalamus. These findings indicate that early rearing conditions can permanently alter the developmental set-point of central CRF systems, and potentially influence the expression of behavioral and endocrine responses to stress throughout life, thereby providing a possible neurobiological substrate for the relationship between early life events and increased vulnerability for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and coping skill alterations and the frequency of mood disorders in patients with a history of such experiences.

Because memory performance can be influenced by circadian changes in corticosteroid levels, subjects were tested either in the morning or in the afternoon. Nineteen healthy men (9 in the morning group and 10 in the afternoon group) were submitted to a psychological stress task before viewing a story composed of emotionally negative and neutral segments, while another 20 healthy males (10 in the morning group and 10 in the afternoon group) viewed the story without being exposed to the psychological stressor. Salivary cortisol levels were measured before and after the stressor. Memory performance was assessed by a one week post learning delayed recall. Results show that stress-induced increases in salivary cortisol levels impaired delayed free recall of emotionally arousing material in the morning group, but not in the afternoon group. There was no effect of stress on memory for neutral material. Altogether, these findings suggest that stressing participants in the morning, at a time of high circulating levels of corticosteroids, over stimulated the corticosteroid receptors in the brain, impairing declarative memory for emotionally arousing material unrelated to the stressor. These findings suggest that the experimental context, i.e., time of day at which the experiment occurs, the nature of the to-be-remembered material (remembering the stressful event itself or material unrelated to the stressor) and the valence of the to-be-remembered material (emotionally arousing vs. neutral), modulates the effects of stress on human declarative memory.

J	Sorge, RE; Stewart, J				Sorge, RE; Stewart, J			The contribution of drug history and time since termination of drug taking to footshock stress-induced cocaine seeking in rats	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						stress; relapse; reinstatement; incubation; cocaine; exposure; self-administration; vulnerability; time course; escalation	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE LEVELS; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; INDUCED RELAPSE; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; DEPENDENT CHANGES; STRIA TERMINALIS; HEROIN-SEEKING	Rationale: There is reason to think that footshock stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine may be affected by the history of drug use and time since termination of drug taking. Objectives: Here, we assessed the contribution of daily access (hours per day) and duration (number of days) of cocaine self-administration to propensity to reinstate drug seeking following footshock stress at three time points following cocaine self-administration. Methods: Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5 mg kg(-1) infusion(-1)) on a fixed ratio 1 schedule in one of four training combinations of hours per day and number of days [2/7, 2/21, 12/7, and 12/21 (h/day)]. Rats were then tested for the first time under extinction conditions at either day 1, 10, or 60 after termination of cocaine availability. Once extinction criterion was met (<15 lever presses in 1 h), rats were then tested for stress-induced reinstatement after 15 min of intermittent, inescapable footshock (0.8 mA, 0.5 s/shock, mean off period of 40 s). Results: Rats that were given 12-h access to cocaine during training responded less in tests of extinction than those rats given 2-h access. Rats in all groups tested in extinction at days 10 and 60 showed higher responding than at day 1, suggesting an incubation of responding. In footshock stress-induced reinstatement tests, rats with greater exposure to cocaine showed a similar suppression of responding at day 1 and enhanced responding at day 60. As expected, rats that were given 12-h/21-day access to cocaine had the greatest intake of cocaine across the training phase with a slow escalation of hourly intake. Conclusion: Greater access to cocaine results in suppression of cocaine seeking following footshock stress at early time points and a progressive increase over time.

Executive dysfunction is a major obstacle to functional outcome, community functioning and rehabilitation success and it is crucial to assess the effects of so-called neuroleptic (NLP) medications in this domain of cognitive functioning. Risperidone, an atypical NLP, has been reported to improve executive function in schizophrenia (SZ), but there is controversy regarding these findings. The aim of the current study was to assess the differential effects of risperidone (2-6 mg) and conventional (2-40 mg haloperidol) NLPs on executive skills in 31 individuals with SZ over a 12-month period. The performance of both NLP groups was compared to the performance of 17 age- and education-matched healthy controls. In this randomized, double blind study, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was administered at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after initiating medication. The relationship between executive functioning and the course of clinical symptoms, as assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was also investigated. Results showed that, relative to healthy controls, individuals with SZ showed marked impairment in WCST from baseline through 12 months of treatment. Also, participants under haloperidol or risperidone NLP medication performed similarly on the WCST at all assessment periods showing that risperidone and haloperidol do not differ in their effect on executive functioning. Risperidone treatment, however, was more effective in the reduction of negative symptoms. The differential efficacy of risperidone over negative symptoms and WCST performance strongly suggests that the executive impairments are to some extent the result of brain abnormalities independent of those that produce the major psychopathology manifestations seen in SZ.

In control and diabetic rats, specific binding sites for B-2 receptors were detected in the brain and in various laminae of the spinal cord, predominantly in superficial laminae (K-d = 34 pM). In diabetic rats, B-2 receptor densities were significantly increased in lamina I of the dorsal horn (+35% at 7 and 21 days), spinal trigeminal nucleus (+70% at 7 and 21 days) and nucleus tractus solitarius (+100% at 2 and 7 days). 132 receptor analogues D-Arg[Hyp(3),Thi(5) D-TiC7, OIC8-BK (Hoe 140), 3-(4 hydroxyphenyl)propionyl-Hoe 140 (HPP-Hoe 140), LF16-0687 mesylate ((2-Pyrrolidinecarboxamide, N-[3-[[4-aminoiminomethyl)benzoyl]amino]propyl]-1-[[2,4-dichoro-3-[[(2,4-dimethyl-8-quinolinyl)oxy]methyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-(2S)-(9Cl)), and BK decreased binding of [I-125]- HPP-Hoe 140 in the spinal dorsal horn, with K-i values of 0.5, 1.5, 3.2, and 3.7 nM, respectively. These values were not significantly different in diabetic rats at 7 days (0.5 (Hoe 140), 0.7 (HPP-Hoe 140), 1.2 (BK), and 1.7 (LF16-0687) nM). While des-Arg(10)-Hoe 140 was three orders of magnitude less potent than Hoe 140, 131 receptor agonist (desArg(9)-BK) and antagonist (AcLys[D-beta Nal7, Ile(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK, R-715) did not affect [I-125]- HPP-Hoe 140 binding at 1 mu M concentration. Data suggest a very discrete and temporal increase of B-2 receptor density (without affinity changes) in the spinal cord and hind-brain of STZ-diabetic rats. This contrasts with the early induction and over-expression of B-1 receptors reported in the brain and spinal cord of STZ-diabetic rats.

A subcutaneous forelimb mass on a cat	VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Article						cat; cytology; peripheral nerve sheath tumor; schwannoma	MALIGNANT SCHWANNOMA; SHEATH TUMORS; DOG	A 16-year-old, male, neutered cat had a 2.5 X 1.5 cm mass on the medial aspect of the right carpus. Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate of the mass indicated a markedly pleomorphic population of plasmacytoid to histiocytic-appearing cells. The cytologic diagnosis was malignant neoplasia of probable mesenchymal or round cell origin. The right forelimb was surgically removed and the scapular, axillary, and prescapular lymph nodes were excised. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma was tentatively diagnosed histologically; however, the tumor cells subsequently were found to be negative for histiocytic (MAC 387, antitrypsin), T-cell (CD3), and B-lymphocyte (immunoglobulin light chains, Ly 5/CD45R) markers, and positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and S-100. Based on the immunohistochemical results, the diagnosis was modified to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST). Six months after surgery the cat was reported to be well and had no evidence of metastasis. PNSTs are rare tumors in cats, and are considered as synonymous with schwannomas, neurofibrosarcomas, and hemangiopericytomas. In this cat, the plasmacytoid and pleomorphic appearance of the PNST cells in cytologic and histologic specimens was unusual, and made it difficult to reach an accurate diagnosis without immunocytochemistry.

Age- related impairments and their in vitro reversibility were evaluated, and underlying pathogenic mechanisms were assessed and compared with those seen in AD brains. Vasoconstrictions to 5- HT and endothelin-1 were preserved, except in the oldest (18-21 months of age) TGF(+) mice. Despite unaltered relaxations to sodium nitroprusside, acetylcholine (ACh) and calcitonin gene-related peptide-mediated dilatations were impaired, and there was an age-related deficit in the basal availability of nitric oxide (NO) that progressed more gradually in TGF(+) mice. The expression and progression of these deficits were unrelated to the onset or extent of thioflavin-S-positive vessels. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) was upregulated in pial vessels and around brain microvessels of APP(+) mice, pointing to a role of superoxide in the dysfunctions elicited by amyloidosis. In contrast, vascular wall remodeling associated with decreased levels of endothelial NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and increased contents of vascular endothelial growth factor and collagen-I and -IV characterized TGF(+) mice. Exogenous SOD or catalase normalized ACh dilatations and NO availability in vessels from aged APP(+) mice but had no effect in those of TGF(+) mice. Increased perivascular oxidative stress was not evidenced in AD brains, but vascular wall alterations compared well with those seen in TGF(+) mice. We conclude that brain vessel remodeling and associated alterations in levels of vasoactive signaling molecules are key contributors to AD cerebrovascular dysfunctions.

We compared the association of NFs with kinesin in mice expressing or lacking NF-H or NF-M. In normal and M-/- mice, the leading edge of metabolically labeled NF subunits was selectively co-precipitated with kinesin. By contrast, the entire wave of radiolabeled subunits co-precipitated with kinesin in H-/- mice. Similar bulk levels of NFs co-precipitated with kinesin from normal and H-/- mice, but reduced levels co-precipitated from M-/- mice. These data suggest that both NF-H and NF-M regulate the association of NFs with kinesin. They further indicate that phosphorylation of NF-H dissociates NFs from kinesin and provides a mechanism by which NF-H phosphorylation can contribute to the slowing of NF axonal transport.

Recent studies suggest that activity in right anterior insular cortex may underlie thermal perception, particularly that of cold. We now examine whether this region is also important for the perception of wan-nth. We applied cutaneous warm stimuli on the left leg (warmth) in normal subjects (n=7) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After each stimulus, subjects rated their subjective intensity of the stimulus using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and correlations were determined between the fMRI signal and the VAS ratings. We found that intensity ratings of warmth correlated with the fMRI signal in the right (contralateral to stimulation) anterior insular cortex. These results, in conjunction with previous reports, suggest that the right anterior insular cortex is important for different types of thermal perception. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Menard, C; Patenaude, C; Massicotte, G				Menard, C; Patenaude, C; Massicotte, G			Phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunits is differentially regulated by phospholipase A(2) inhibitors	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						phospholipases A(2); glutamate receptor; phosphorylation; brain sections	A(2) ACTIVITY; RAT-BRAIN; PLASTICITY	Our laboratory recently discovered that the phosphorylation of subunits forming the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptors is regulated by constitutive phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity in rat brain sections. In the present investigation, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) and bromoenol lactone (BEL) were used to compare the influence of calcium-dependent (cPLA(2)) and calcium-independent (iPLA(2)) enzymes on phosphorylation of AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtypes of glutamate receptors. Incubation of rat brain sections with 3 mu M BEL enhanced phosphorylation on the serine (Ser) 831 residue of the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit in synaptosomal P2 fractions, whereas AACOCF3 at the same concentration resulted in increased phosphorylation on residues Ser880/891 of GluR2/3 subunits. These effects were restricted to the AMPA receptor subtype as no changes in phosphorylation were elicited on the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit. The effects of BEL and AACOCF3 were not occluded during blockade of protein phosphatases since AMPA receptor phosphorylation was still apparent in the presence of okadaic acid, indicating that the PLA(2) inhibitor-induced increase in AMPA receptor phosphorylation does not rely on a decrease in dephosphorylation reactions. However, pretreatment of rat brain sections with a cell-permeable protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor prevented BEL- and AACOCF3-induced phosphorylation on the Ser831 and Ser880/891 sites of GluR1 and GluR2/3 subunits, respectively. These results suggest that constitutive cPLA(2) and iPLA(2) systems may differentially influence AMPA receptor properties and function in the rat brain through mechanisms involving PKC activity.

To examine whether such epigenetic programming is reversible in adult life, we centrally infused the adult offspring with the essential amino acid L-methionine, a precursor to S-adenosyl-methionine that serves as the donor of methyl groups for DNA methylation. Here we report that methionine infusion reverses the effect of maternal behavior on DNA methylation, nerve growth factor-inducible protein-A binding to the exon 17 promoter, GR expression, and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal and behavioral responses to stress, suggesting a causal relationship among epigenomic state, GR expression, and stress responses in the adult offspring. These results demonstrate that, despite the inherent stability of the epigenomic marks established early in life through behavioral programming, they are potentially reversible in the adult brain.

ASIC3, an acid-sensing ion channel, is expressed in metaboreceptive sensory neurons	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article								Background: ASIC3, the most sensitive of the acid-sensing ion channels, depolarizes certain rat sensory neurons when lactic acid appears in the extracellular medium. Two functions have been proposed for it: 1) ASIC3 might trigger ischemic pain in heart and muscle; 2) it might contribute to some forms of touch mechanosensation. Here, we used immunocytochemistry, retrograde labelling, and electrophysiology to ask whether the distribution of ASIC3 in rat sensory neurons is consistent with either of these hypotheses. Results: Less than half (40%) of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons react with anti-ASIC3, and the population is heterogeneous. They vary widely in cell diameter and express different growth factor receptors: 68% express TrkA, the receptor for nerve growth factor, and 25% express TrkC, the NT3 growth factor receptor. Consistent with a role in muscle nociception, small (< 25 mu m) sensory neurons that innervate muscle are more likely to express ASIC3 than those that innervate skin (51% of small muscle afferents vs. 28% of small skin afferents). Over 80% of ASIC3+ muscle afferents co-express CGRP ( a vasodilatory peptide). Remarkably few (9%) ASIC3+ cells express P2X3 receptors ( an ATP-gated ion channel), whereas 31% express TRPV1 ( the noxious heat and capsaicin-activated ion channel also known as VRI). ASIC3+/CGRP+ sensory nerve endings were observed on muscle arterioles, the blood vessels that control vascular resistance; like the cell bodies, the endings are P2X3- and can be TRPV1+. The TrkC+/ASIC3+ cell bodies are uniformly large, possibly consistent with non-nociceptive mechanosensation. They are not proprioceptors because they fail two other tests: ASIC3+ cells do not express parvalbumin and they are absent from the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. Conclusion: Our data indicates that: 1) ASIC3 is expressed in a restricted population of nociceptors and probably in some non-nociceptors; 2) co-expression of ASIC3 and CGRP, and the absence of P2X3, are distinguishing properties of a class of sensory neurons, some of which innervate blood vessels. We suggest that these latter afferents may be muscle metaboreceptors, neurons that sense the metabolic state of muscle and can trigger pain when there is insufficient oxygen.

Perpendicular divisions are more likely to be asymmetric and generate one progenitor and one neuronal precursor. Whether the orientation of the mitotic spindle actually determines their asymmetric outcome is unclear. Here, we characterize a mammalian homolog of Inscuteable (mlnsc), a key regulator of spindle orientation in Drosophila. mlnsc is expressed temporally and spatially in a manner that suggests a role in orienting the mitotic spindle in the developing nervous system. Using retroviral RNAi in rat retinal explants, we show that downregulation of mlnsc inhibits vertical divisions. This results in enhanced proliferation, consistent with a higher frequency of symmetric divisions generating two proliferating cells. Our results suggest that the orientation of neural progenitor divisions is important for cell fate specification in the retina and determines their symmetric or asymmetric outcome.

They defined 21 recommendations for general practitioners, long-term care physicians, and specialists, based on the knowledge currently available (2005). The aim of care at all stages is to mitigate the quality-of-life of patient, caregiver, and family insofar as possible, combining care and future planning until the end of life. Management, to take into account problems including nutritional status, behavior disorders, and ability (or inability) to perform activities of daily living, must be global, multidisciplinary, and coordinated and must optimize use of local medical and social resources. The group also stressed the importance of clinical research to improve knowledge of disease course and assess management strategies and recommended specific area for research.

However, these studies have not yet been completely corroborated in human tumors. Methods: Using RT PCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry we assessed the presence and the processing patterns of the convertases PC1 and PC2 as well as the PC2 specific chaperone 7B2 in human liver metastases originating from colorectal cancer and compared them to unaffected and normal liver. Furthermore, we assessed the presence and processing profiles of PC1, PC2 and 7B2 in primary colon cancers. Results: mRNA, protein expression, and protein cleavage profiles of proprotein convertases 1 and 2 are altered in liver colorectal metastasis, compared to unaffected and normal liver. Active PC1 protein is overexpressed in tumor, correlating with its mRNA profile. Moreover, the enhanced PC2 processing pattern in tumor correlates with the overexpression of its specific binding protein 7B2. These results were corroborated by immunohistochemistry. The specific and uniform convertase pattern observed in the metastases was present only in a fraction of primary colon cancers. Conclusion: The uniformly altered proprotein convertase profile in liver metastases is observed only in a fraction of primary colon cancers, suggesting possible selection processes involving PCs during metastasis as well as an active role of PCs in liver metastasis. In addition, the exclusive presence of 7B2 in metastatic tumors may represent a new target for early diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment.

Little is known about how these processes are integrated to yield mature behaviors. We showed previously that, during the maturation of the locomotor network of the zebrafish, endogenous serotonin (5HT) increased motor activity by reducing intervals of inactivity, without affecting the active swim periods that are the target of 5HT in other and more mature preparations. Because membrane properties were constant during the rest intervals, we examined here whether 5HT modulates chloride homeostasis. We compared the effects of blocking (inward) chloride cotransport with bumetanide to the effects of 5HT and its antagonists, both behaviorally by video imaging and cellularly by whole-cell and gramicidin-perforated patch recordings. Bumetanide mimicked the effects of 5HT antagonists, by prolonging rest intervals without affecting the properties of swim episodes (duration; frequency; extent of depolarization) either behaviorally or during fictive swimming. Furthermore, bumetanide and 5HT antagonists suppressed the amplitude of depolarizing responses evoked by ionophoresis of glycine onto spinal neurons in the presence of tetrodotoxin and transiently suppressed the amplitude of responses to glycine measured after fictive swimming. The effects of bumetanide contrasted with and occluded the effects of 5HT. We suggest that, during development, endogenous 5HT modulates chloride homeostasis during the quiescent intervals and thereby offsets the long periods of quiescence commonly observed in developing networks to allow expression of sustained and behaviorally relevant activity.

We demonstrated previously that the growth factor-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and its downstream target, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors, are essential for neurogenesis in cultured cortical precursor cells (Menard et al., 2002). Here, we examined a role for this pathway during cortical cell fate determination in vivo using in utero electroporation of the embryonic cortex. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of the activity of either MEK or the C/EBPs inhibits the genesis of neurons in vivo. Moreover, the MEK pathway mediates phosphorylation of C/EBP beta in cortical precursors, and expression of a C/EBP beta construct in which the MEK pathway phosphorylation sites are mutated inhibits neurogenesis. Conversely, expression of a C/EBP beta construct, in which the same sites are mutated to glutamate and therefore are "constitutively" phosphorylated, enhances neurogenesis in the early embryonic cortex. A subpopulation of precursors in which C/EBP activity is inhibited are maintained as cycling precursors in the ventricular/subventricular zone of the cortex until early in postnatal life, when they have an enhanced propensity to generate astrocytes, presumably in response to gliogenic signals in the neonatal environment. Thus, activation of an MEK-C/EBP pathway in cortical precursors in vivo biases them to become neurons and against becoming astrocytes, thereby acting as a growth factor-regulated switch.

The oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein is anchored solely in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and through its leucine-rich repeat domain, it likely interacts with other proteins. In the present study, we compare its buoyancy and detergent solubility characteristics with those of other myelin proteins. Based on its detergent solubility profile and membrane fractionation using established ultracentrifugation procedures, we conclude that the oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein is a lipid raft component that is closely associated with the axolemma. Moreover, it associates with caveolin-1 and caveolin-l-enriched membranes. We postulate that, by virtue of its concentration in lipid rafts and perhaps through interactions with caveolin-1, the oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein may influence signaling pathways.

Endogenous CNS-resident microglia as well as exogenous (immigrant) bone marrow-derived cells contribute to reactive microgliosis, raising fundamental questions about the cellular composition, kinetics, and functional characteristics of the reactive microglial cell population. Bone marrow chimeric mice reconstituted with green fluorescent protein-expressing (GFP(+)) donor bone marrow cells were subjected to entorhinal cortex lesion, resulting in selective axonal degeneration and a localized microglial reaction in the hippocampus. Flow cytometric evaluation of individually dissected hippocampi differentiated immigrant GFP(+) microglia from resident GFP(-) microglia (CD11b(+)CD45(dim)) and identified a subset of mainly resident CD11b(+) microglia that was induced to express CD34. The proportion of immigrant GFP(+) microglia (CD11b(+)CD45(dim)) increased signficantly by 3 and 5 days postlesion and reached a maximum of 13% by 7 days. These cells expressed lower CD11b levels than resident microglia, forming a distinct subpopulation on CD11b/CD45 profiles. The proportion of CD34(+)CD11b microglia was significantly increased at 3 days postlesion but had normalized by 5 and 7 days, when the microglial reaction is known to be at its maximum. Our results show that distinct subpopulations of microglia respond to minor CNS injury. The heterogeneity in microglial response may have functional consequences for repair and possibly therapy.

We investigated whether mechanisms commonly thought to be involved in determining synaptic efficacy of vertebrate motor neurones are involved in these long-term changes. The nerve supplying the cutaneus pectoris muscle was chronically stimulated via skin surface electrodes in freely moving frogs for 5-7 days. Chronic stimulation induced a 50% reduction in evoked endplate potential (EPP) amplitude at stimulated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). These changes appear to be presynaptic since miniature EPP (mEPP) amplitude was unchanged while mEPP frequency was decreased by 46% and paired-pulse facilitation was increased by 26%. High frequency facilitation (40 Hz, 2 s) was also increased by 89%. Moreover, stimulated NMJs presented a 92% decrease in synaptic depression (40 Hz, 2 s). An increase in mitochondrial metabolism was observed as indicated by a more pronounced labelling of active mitochondria (Mitotracker) in stimulated nerve terminals, which could account for their greater resistance to synaptic depression. NMJ length visualized by cc-bungarotoxin staining of nAChRs was not affected. Presynaptic calcium signals measured with Calcium Green-1 were larger in stimulated NMJs at low frequency (0.2 Hz) and not different from control NMJs at higher frequency (40 Hz, 2 s and 30 s). These results suggest that some mechanisms downstream of calcium entry are responsible for the determination of synaptic output, such as a down-regulation of some calcium-binding proteins, which could explain the observed results.

Sequences of 189 bp and 273 bp were sufficient to achieve maximal activity of the upstream and downstream promoter, respectively. However, subtle differences in minimal promoter lengths and in promoter activities were observed between the cell lines. Both promoters demonstrated comparable activity in NlH/3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells, while in Neuro-2a cells, the upstream promoter was 15-fold more active than the downstream promoter. Alignment and data mining tools identified a candidate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) binding site at the 3'end of the downstream promoter that is conserved throughout several species. NF-kappa B activation experiments in cultured cells were associated with increased Mthfr mRNA. Co-transfection of NF-kappa B and promoter constructs demonstrated Mthfr up-regulation by at least 2-fold through its downstream promoter in Neuro-2a cells; this increase was significantly reduced when the putative binding site was mutated. EMSA analysis demonstrated direct binding of NF-kappa B to this non-mutated site. This study, a first step into the elucidation of Mthfr regulation, demonstrates that two TATA-less, GC-rich promoters differentially drive transcription of Mthfr in a cell-specific manner, and provides a novel link of Mthfr to possible roles in the immune response and cell survival.

METHODS: After medical therapy was optimized, 258 patients who had heart failure (mean age [+/-SD], 63+/-10 years; ejection fraction, 24.5+/-7.7 percent) and central sleep apnea (number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep, 40+/-16) were randomly assigned to receive CPAP (128 patients) or no CPAP (130 patients) and were followed for a mean of two years. During follow-up, sleep studies were conducted and measurements of the ejection fraction, exercise capacity, quality of life, and neurohormones were obtained. RESULTS: Three months after undergoing randomization, the CPAP group, as compared with the control group, had greater reductions in the frequency of episodes of apnea and hypopnea (-21+/-16 vs. -2+/-18 per hour, P<0.001) and in norepinephrine levels (-1.03+/-1.84 vs. 0.02+/-0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009), and greater increases in the mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (1.6+/-2.8 percent vs. 0.4+/-2.5 percent, P<0.001), ejection fraction (2.2+/-5.4 percent vs. 0.4+/-5.3 percent, P=0.02), and the distance walked in six minutes (20.0+/-55 vs. -0.8+/-64.8 m, P=0.016). There were no differences between the control group and the CPAP group in the number of hospitalizations, quality of life, or atrial natriuretic peptide levels. An early divergence in survival rates without heart transplantation favored the control group, but after 18 months the divergence favored the CPAP group, yet the overall event rates (death and heart transplantation) did not differ (32 vs. 32 events, respectively; P=0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Although CPAP attenuated central sleep apnea, improved nocturnal oxygenation, increased the ejection fraction, lowered norepinephrine levels, and increased the distance walked in six minutes, it did not affect survival. Our data do not support the use of CPAP to extend life in patients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure.

These stimuli are known to activate the fusiform face area as well as area V4 in normal adults. The electrophysiological data showed a PI latency that reached a maturation asymptote before 3 years of age, whereas that of N1 and P2 became adultlike by 13 years of age. In addition, the distribution of the P2 component over the scalp was focalized in the primary visual cortex before adolescence and became distributed over the entire brain after adolescence. Radially modulated concentric stimuli thus induce brain activation that is not mature until 13 years of age.

We report results from a genome scan of 166 schizophrenia families collected through the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program. Our definition of affection status included schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, depressed type and we defined families as European American (EA) and African American (AA) based on the probands' and parents' races based on data collected by interviewing the probands. We also assessed evidence for racial heterogeneity in the regions most suggestive of linkage. The maximum LOD score across the genome was 2.96 for chromosome 18, at 0.5 cM in the combined race sample. Both racial groups showed LOD scores greater than 1.0 for chromosome 18. The empirical P-value associated with that LOD score is 0.04 assuming a single genome scan for the combined sample with race narrowly defined, and 0.06 for the combined sample allowing for broad and narrow definitions of race. The empirical P-value of observing a LOD score as large as 2.96 in the combined sample, and of at least 1.0 in each racial group, allowing for narrow and broad racial definitions, is 0.04. Evidence for the second and third largest linkage signals come solely from the AA sample on chromosomes 6 (LOD 2.11 at 33.2 cM) and 14 (LOD = 2.13 at 51.0). The linkage evidence differed between the AA and EA samples (chromosome 6 P-value = 0.007 and chromosome 14 P-value = 0.004). (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The inclusive set of cues required to guide a given motor axon subtype from cell body to target has yet to be identified, in any species. This is attributable, in part, to the unavailability of markers that demarcate the complete trajectory followed by a specific class of spinal motor axons. Most spinal motor neurons extend axons out of the CNS through ventral exit points. In contrast, spinal accessory motor neurons (SACMNs) project dorsally directed axons through lateral exit points (LEPs), and these axons assemble into the spinal accessory nerve (SAN). Here we show that an antibody against BEN/ALCAM/SC1/DM-GRASP/MuSC selectively labels mouse SACMNs and can be used to trace the pathfinding of SACMN axons. We use this marker, together with a battery of transcription factor-deficient or guidance cue/receptor-deficient mice to identify molecules required for distinct stages of SACMN development. Specifically, we find that Gli2 is required for the initial extension of axons from SACMN cell bodies, and that netrin-1 and its receptor Dcc are required for the proper dorsal migration of these cells and the dorsally directed extension of SACMN axons toward the LEPs. Furthermore, in the absence of the transcription factor Nkx2.9, SACMN axons fail to exit the CNS. Together, these findings suggest molecular mechanisms that are likely to regulate key steps in SACMN development.

Because protein aggregation is very complex, involving a variety of oligomeric metastable intermediates, the detailed aggregation paths and structural characterization of the intermediates remain to be determined. Yet, there is strong evidence that these oligomers, which form early in the process of fibrillogenesis, are cytotoxic. In this paper, we review our current understanding of the underlying factors that promote the aggregation of peptides into amyloid fibrils. We focus here on the structural and dynamic aspects of the aggregation as observed in state-of-the-art computer simulations of amyloid-forming peptides with all emphasis on the activation-relaxation technique.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Library (1966-2004). Keywords used were: polycythemia, partial exchange transfusion, hyperviscosity, and limited to newborn. Randomized studies in newborns with polycythemia were selected for evaluation. Outcomes examined were: long-term neurodevelopment; short-term physiological effects; improvement in clinical symptoms; reduction in haematocrit at 4-6 h; haematocrit at 24 h; and frequency of serious complications. Results: Four randomized controlled clinical trials, including 200 patients in total, with evaluable data, which satisfied our criteria, were found. There were no data on long-term outcomes. There is no reported important difference in short-term physiologic effects. Use of crystalloid was as effective as colloid in both correction of haematological values and reduction of clinical symptoms following partial exchange transfusion. Conclusion: Crystalloid solutions are as effective as colloid solutions for partial exchange transfusion. When crystalloid solutions are used for this purpose, there is no risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases, there is no risk of anaphylaxis, they are rapidly and easily available, and are less expensive. The use of crystalloid should become the standard for partial exchange transfusion.

Brain imaging research spans a wide area, covering both structure and function, and ranging from the physics and physiology associated with novel acquisition techniques, to the development of sophisticated image processing algorithms. This paper briefly describes two methods on either end of this spectrum: the "pipeline" framework for the fully automated morphometric analysis of brain imaging data, and molecular MRI, which holds promise for the non-invasive detection of molecular targets of new pharmacological compounds. The potential use of these technologies is illustrated by examples of their applications in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and oncology.

For mean [tNA] values, there was (i) a large-effect-sized overall decrease in patients' lesional WM relative to NC WM (25 comparisons), (ii) a medium-effect-sized overall decrease in patients' non-lesional WM relative to NC WM (36 comparisons) and (iii) a medium-effect-sized overall decrease in patients' GM relative to NC GM (14 comparisons). Patients' mean [tNA] values were sometimes statistically normal but were never statistically increased. For mean [tCr] values, there was (i) no statistically significant overall change in the patients' lesional WM relative to NC WM (24 comparisons), although statistically significant increases and decreases were sometimes found, (ii) a medium-effect-sized overall increase in patients' non-lesional WM relative to NC WM (33 comparisons) and (iii) no statistically significant overall change in patients' GM relative to NC GM (12 comparisons), although a significant decrease was found in one comparison. Of 41 comparisons with statistically significant changes, 38 combined in a way that would probably result in decreased mean [tNA]/[tCr] ratios such that (i) 66% had statistically decreased mean [tNA] and statistically unchanged mean [tCr] values, (ii) 13% had statistically decreased mean [tNA] and statistically increased mean [tCr] values and (iii) 21% had statistically unchanged mean [tNA] values and statistically increased mean [tCr] values. Of the 25 comparisons that came from studies that also analysed [tNA]/[tCr] ratios, the direction of change in mean [tNA] values and mean [tNA]/[tCr] ratios was concordant in 84%. In comparisons that quantified both [tNA] and [tCr], there was a similar amount of variability in both measures in each of the different tissue types studied, both in patients and NCs. Together, these results suggest that within-voxel tNA/tCr ratios can be interpreted as valid and accurate surrogate measures of 'cerebral tissue integrity'-with decreased tNA/tCr ratios indicating some combination of neuroaxonal disturbance, oligodendroglial disturbance, and astrocytic proliferation. These results also suggest that, although within-voxel tNA/tCr ratios are not perfect indicators of [tNA] content, they do represent a practical compromise to acquiring surrogate measures of within-voxel neuroaxonal integrity.

Although capable of acting as a peptide-presenting molecule, its strong immune-inhibitory properties identify HLA-G as a mediator of immune tolerance with specific relevance at immune-privileged sites such as trophoblast or thymus. To assess the role of HLA-G in CNS immunity, we investigated its expression in brain specimens from patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 11), meningitis (n = 2) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 2) and non-pathological CNS controls (n = 6). Furthermore, cultured human microglial cells and CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis and controls were assessed. Furthermore, CSF from MS patients and controls, as well as cultured human microglial cells were assessed. Using several HLA-G specific mAb and immunohistochemistry, HLA-G protein was found strongly expressed in brain specimens from patients with multiple sclerosis while it was rarely detectable in the non-pathological control specimens. In multiple sclerosis brain specimens, HLA-G immunoreactivity was observed in acute plaques, in chronic active plaques, in perilesional areas as well as in normal appearing white matter. In all areas microglial cells, macrophages, and in part endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of expression. HLA-G was also found in other disease entities (meningitis, Alzheimer's specimens) where expression correlated to activation and MHC class II expression on microglial cells. Importantly, ILT2, a receptor for HLA-G, was also found in multiple sclerosis brain specimens thus emphasizing the relevance of this inhibitory pathway in vivo. HLA-G mRNA and protein expression and regulation could also be corroborated on cultured human microglial cells in vitro. Further, expression of HLA-G in the CSF of multiple sclerosis patients and controls was analysed by flow cytometry and ELISA. Monocytes represented the main source of cellular HLA-G expression in the CSF. Corresponding to the observations with the tissue specimens, CSF mean levels of soluble HLA-G were significantly higher in multiple sclerosis than in non-inflammatory controls (171 +/- 31 versus 39 +/- 10 U/ml; P = 0.0001). The demonstration of HLA-G and its receptor ILT2 on CNS cells and in areas of microglia activation implicate HLA-G as a contributor to the fundamental mechanisms regulating immune reactivity in the CNS. This pathway may act as an inhibitory feedback aimed to downregulate the deleterious effects of T-cell infiltration in neuroinflammation.

Immediate extubation using thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has become more popular after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). In this randomized prospective double-blind study, we present the first comparison of preoperative and postoperative haemodynamics during different regimens of TEA for immediate extubation after cardiac surgery. Methods. Sixty patients undergoing OPCAB were enrolled in this study. TEA was installed > 1 h before application of heparin at levels T2-T4. Analgesia was provided by bupivacaine 0.25%, 8 ml, 15 min before surgery and extubation, and at 10 ml h(-1) during surgery and up to 72 h afterwards using one of the following regimens: bupivacaine 0.125% alone, bupivacaine 0.125% with fentanyl 3 mu g ml(-1) or bupivacaine 0.125% with clonidine 0.6 mu g ml(-1). Patients were block-randomized for one of the three treatments. Pain scores and infusion rates of TEA were assessed up to 48 h after surgery. Respiratory function was assessed by Pa-o2 and Pa-o2 immediately after surgery, and haemodynamic stability was recorded in the form of heart rate and diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Results. Patient characteristics, respiratory function and haemodynamic stability did not vary between the three groups. Pain control was very good and was not significantly different between the groups using similar infusion rates after surgery. Paraesthesia in dermatomes T1 or C8 occurred equally in all three groups. There was no neurological complication related to TEA in this study. Conclusions. We conclude that immediate extubation after OPCAB using TEA is feasible with different TEA regimens. Respiratory function, haemodynamic stability and pain control are not different between TEA with bupivacaine alone, bupivacaine with fentanyl or bupivacaine with clonidine.

Methods: Fifteen skin-grafted male burn survivors (47.7 +/- 10.4 years old) with deep partial- or full-thickness thermal burn injuries covering an average of 11 +/- 5.6% of their total body surface and with normal skin at a matching, unburned, contralateral site were recruited into this study. Threshold determinations and magnitude estimations for touch, cold, warmth and heat-pain were performed at sites with grafted and normal skin, using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments and the Medoc TSA 2001 thermal stimulator. Skin biopsies from both the grafted and normal sites were stained with antibodies for protein gene product 9.5 (PGP) and neurofilament 200 kDa. Nerve fibers in the epidermis and nerve fibers or bundles of nerve fibers in the superficial and deep dermis as well as innervated blood vessels, hair follicles and sweat glands were counted. Results: On average, the data were collected 43.1 +/- 10.4 months after grafting. When thresholds on grafted skin were compared to thresholds on normal skin, they showed elevated sensory thresholds [touch (p < 0.003), cold (p < 0.031), warmth (p < 0.009)]. Magnitude estimates of touch, cold and warmth differed on the two sides with sensations elicited from grafts being smaller than those from normal skin. Heat-pain thresholds and heat-pain magnitude estimations were not statistically different on the two sites. By comparison to the normal side, and consistent with the attenuated sensory functions of the grafts, counts of neural structures showed a reduction in innervation density; PGP-immunoreactive nerve fibers[bundles were reduced in grafted epidermis (p < 0.026) and superficial dermis (p < 0.001). The numbers of sweat glands (p < 0.006) and hair follicles (p < 0.001) were also reduced. The number of innervated blood vessels did not differ significantly on the two sides. There were significant correlations between sensory thresholds and the neuroanatomical variables: thresholds of cold and touch were correlated with the number of sweat glands in both grafted and normal skin (r(2) = 0.56 and 0.50, respectively; p < 0.001), while warmth thresholds were significantly correlated with the number of innervated blood vessels in grafted skin (r(2)) = 0.62, p < 0.001). Encapsulated mechanoreceptors were not encountered in this study of hairy skin. Conclusions: Touch, cold and warmth thresholds and magnitude estimations do not return to normal levels after skin grafting in burn survivors. The elevation of thresholds and reduction of sensory intensity is accompanied by a general decrease in the density of nerve terminals. The lack, or numerical reduction, of sweat glands and innervated blood vessels was also indicative of diminished sensation on grafted skin. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

J	Moore, FGA; Chalk, C				Moore, FGA; Chalk, C			How well does neurology residency mirror practice?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							INTERNAL-MEDICINE; UNDERGRADUATE	Objective: To report the residency training experience of two neurologists, focusing on setting and diagnoses encountered. Methods: Data from prospective patient logs kept by the authors during residencies completed a decade apart were compared with each other and the literature. Results: The range of diagnoses was broadly similar between residencies, as were the proportions of common or uncommon disorders, and the proportion of cases without a neurological diagnosis. Although most patients were seen in in-patient settings, the rates at which common neurological conditions and functional disorders were seen was comparable to published experiences of community neurologists. Conclusions: The diagnostic profile of North American neurology residency appears to be relatively stable, regardless of location or date of training. In several respects, the content of current neurology residencies mirrors clinical practice well. Changes to residency training are doubtless needed, but they should be guided by a clear understanding of the experiences of contemporary trainees.

Epilepsies are divided into two categories (focal and generalized) that are differentiated by the neuropsychological symptoms that are present. Cognitive difficulties present in children suffering from focal epilepsy are usually specific to the cerebral area involved, while generalized epilepsies are linked to a diffuse neuropsychological deficit profile as well as to a more limited intellectual functioning. The aim of this article was to establish a neuropsychological profile of the various syndromes of focal and generalized epilepsy, and to outline the psychological and social effects of epilepsy among children with this condition.

However, it is rarely assessed in routine clinical practice and receives little attention. Although the cerebral consequences of cardiopulmonary bypass have been measured clinically, insights into the resulting molecular and pathologic events within the brain have only begun to be investigated. POCD is likely to impair quality of life and constitutes a large burden on society when elderly patients prematurely lose their independence. Numerous studies have reported that neurocognitive deficit is associated with heightened mortality, increased length of hospital stay, and discharge to a nursing home. This is linked with a tremendous demand for health-care resources. Because of the magnitude of the clinical problem, serious consideration must be directed toward understanding its etiology and the development of neuroprotective strategies. Clearly identifying the mechanisms of POCD is challenging. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent developments in our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms, prevention, and treatments that have been designed to ameliorate brain dysfunction after cardiac surgery.

This is potentially misleading since electrodes record activity from several sources, but the nearest ones generate large amplitudes that can overpower distant sources. Our objective was to improve foci detection in intracerebral recordings by applying source localization methods. Methods: Data were simulated by placing 3 sources in a semi-infinite medium near 3 intracerebral electrodes. Potentials were generated and contaminated with white and correlated noise. Two inverse problem algorithms, beamforming and RAP-MUSIC, were used to calculate equivalent dipoles. Results: Simulations for each noise types showed that the two methods detected the source locations accurately, with RAP-MUSIC reporting lower orientation errors. With correlated noise, beamforming reconstructed original source waveforms poorly. A spatial resolution analysis was performed, in which beamforming adequately distinguished sources separated by 1.2 cm, whereas RAP-MUSIC separated Sources as close as 0.4-0.6 cm. Conclusions: Both source localization methods proved useful in detecting the location of dipolar Sources based on simulated intracerebral potentials. For all simulations, RAP-MUSIC was more accurate than beamforming. Significance: It is possible to use source localization methods traditionally applied to scalp recordings for improving source detection from intracerebral recordings.

CONSTRUCTIVIST FOUNDATIONS			English	Article						Inversion of experience; 0-D constructivism; problem of metaphysics-ontology; mind-brain relation		Purpose: This conceptual-epistemological paper deals with the old problem of inversion of thinking, as typified by traditional metaphysics-ontology. It is proposed that a thorough constructivism - which views structures of mind, nature, and all, as not derived from (not referring to) any pre-structured given mind-independent reality (zero-derivation, 0-D) can go beyond this conceptual impasse; it can also serve as a fall-back position for positive ontologies. Practical implications: The practical result of 0-D is that all structures of experience are understood as tools serving individual and collective subjects. Conclusions: This conceptual correction results in a simplification for the understanding of some conceptual puzzles, such as the mind-brain relation, but also in a considerable increase of responsibility, because entities and agents formerly considered responsible, and outside the mind, are recognized to be extensions of the subjects. Key words: Inversion of experience, 0-D constructivism, problem of metaphysics-ontology, mind-brain relation.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, there are two types of GABA receptors that elicit opposite effects: excitatory receptors that open cation-selective channels, and inhibitory receptors that open anion-selective channels. The four non-striated enteric muscle cells required for the expulsion step of the defecation behavior are all sensitive to GABA: the sphincter muscle expresses a classical GABA-sensitive chloride channel (UNC-49) and probably relaxes in response to GABA, while the other three cells express a cation-selective channel (EXP-1) and contract. Here we show that the expression of the exp-1 gene is under the control of dsc-1, which encodes a Paired-like homeodomain protein, a class of transcription factors previously associated with the terminal differentiation of neurons in C. elegans. dsc-1 mutants have anatomically normal enteric muscles but are expulsion defective. We show that this defect is due to the lack of expression of exp-1 in the three cells that contract in response to GABA. In addition, dsc-1, but not exp-1, affects the periodicity of the behavior, revealing an unanticipated role for the enteric muscles in regulating this ultradian rhythm.

One of the neural mechanisms may involve saccade-related modulation of neural activity in the visual cortex. Using the perception of phosphenes induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the visual cortex (VC) as an index of cortical excitability, we sought to determine if VC excitability was modulated at varying times relative to saccade onset. We used two measures of excitability: (1) stimulator intensity required to induce phosphenes in 50% of trials, also called the phosphene threshold (PT), and (2) the subjective intensity of the phosphene. We found that there was no change in PT for different saccade-TMS onset asynchronies while there was an increase in perceived phosphene-intensity near the time of saccade onset (F(7,42)=4.34, P=0.001). Contrary to what would be expected from a saccadic suppression model, our results suggest that excitability of the visual cortex is slightly enhanced at the time of saccade onset.

Consequently, recent studies have experimentally screened human genes in an attempt to initiate a catalog of genes possessing cis-acting variants. In this study, we use human EST data in dbEST as the source of allelic expression data, and the HapMap database to provide expected allele frequencies in human populations. We demonstrate a greater concordance of allele frequencies estimated from human ESTs in dbEST with those derived from the CEPH HapMap sample representing Caucasians from northern and western Europe, than population samples obtained in Asia and Africa. Deviations between allele frequencies observed in EST databases and the ones obtained from the CEPH HapMap samples may result from common heritable cis-acting variants altering the relative allele distribution in RNA. We provide in silico as well as experimental evidence that this strategy does allow significant enrichment of genes harboring common heritable cis-acting polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with expressed alleles.

Irradiated male Wistar rats transplanted with beta-actin promoter-driven, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled, unfractionated bone marrow cells were subjected to coronary artery ligation. Three weeks after MI, GFP-labeled bone C, marrow cells were detected in the infarct region, and a modest number were associated with nestin immunoreactivity. The paucity of GFP(+)/nestin(+) cells in the scar tissue provided the impetus to explore whether neural-like stein cells were derived from cardiac tissue. Nestin mRNA and immunoreactivity were detected in normal rat myocardium, and transcript levels were increased in the damaged heart after MI. In primary-passage, cardiac tissue-derived neural cells, filamentous nestin staining was associated with a diffuse, cytoplasmic glial fibrillary acidic protein signal. Unexpectedly, in viable myocardium, numerous nestin(+)/glial fibrillary acidic protein(+) fiberlike structures of varying length were detected and observed in close proximity to neurofilarnent-M+ fibers. The infarct region was likewise innervated, and the preponderance of neurofilament-M+ fibers appeared to be physically associated with nestin(+) fiberlike structures. These data highlight the novel observation that the normal rat heart contained resident nestin(+)/glial fibrillary acidic protein(+) neural-like stein cells, fiberlike structures, and nestin mRNA levels that were increased in response to myocardial ischemia. Cardiac tissue-derived neural stem cell migration to the infarct region and concomitant nestin(+) fiberlike innervation represent obligatory events of reparative fibrosis in the damaged rat myocardium.

Due to the growing number of mobile users, global connectivity, and the small size of cells, one of the most critical issues regarding these networks is location management. In recent years, several strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of the location management procedure in 3G mobile networks. In this paper, we present a user pattern learning strategy (UPL) using neural networks to reduce the location update signaling cost by increasing the intelligence of the location procedure in UMTS. This strategy associates to each user a list of cells where she is likely to be with a given probability in each time interval. The implementation of this strategy has been subject to extensive tests. The results obtained confirm the efficiency of UPL in significantly reducing the costs of both location updates and call delivery procedures when compared to the UMTS standard and with other strategies well-known in the literature.

Only children with more than 2 years of follow-up were included. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors predictive of remission (successful cessation of medication). One hundred ninety-six children (mean age 7.6 +/- 3.7 years at first seizure, mean follow-up 55 30 months) were identified. Ninety-eight of 196 children (50%) had an idiopathic epilepsy, 63 of 196 (32.1%) had cryptogenic epilepsy; and 35 of 196 (17.9%) had remote symptomatic epilepsy. At final assessment, 52.6% were in remission, 12.8% had a poor outcome (recurrent seizures on therapeutic antiepileptic drug levels within 6 months prior to the final assessment), and 6.9% were intractable (more than one seizure/month over I year with failure of three or more anti-convulsants). One year after initiating treatment, factors associated with a lower probability of remisson included seizure recurrence in the 6- to 12-month interval after therapy initiation (hazard ratio 0.24), multiple seizure types (hazard ratio 0.40), and mental retardation at onset (hazard ratio 0.19). Factors predictive of a poor outcome included seizure recurrence in the 6- to 12-month interval after therapy initiation (odds ratio 21.6), more than one seizure type (odds ratio 8.9), and global developmental delay at onset (odds ratio 8.9). Factors predictive of intractability included multiple seizure types (hazard ratio 6.5), mental retardation at onset (hazard ratio 7.2), and seizure recurrence in the first 6 to 12 months of treatment (hazard ratio 70). It appears that response in the first 6 to 12 months on antiepileptic medication is predictive of outcome. Clinical features of the underlying epilepsy and concurrent neurologic conditions were independently associated with intractability and a lower probability of remission.

Ca2+-dependent NO synthase activity was increased in endothelium-denuded aortic segments from hypoxia-exposed rats. N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester enhanced the contractile responses of endothelium-denuded aortic rings and mesenteric arterioles from hypoxia-exposed but not normoxic rats (P < 0.05). The hypoxia-inducible mRNA transcript expressed by human cells was found to contain a novel 5'-untranslated region, consistent with activation of transcription in the genomic region contiguous with exon 2. Translational efficiency of this transcript is markedly increased compared with previously described human nNOS mRNAs. Transgenic mice possessing a lacZ reporter construct under control of these genomic sequences demonstrated expression of the construct after exposure to hypoxia (8% O-2, 48 hours) in the aorta, mesenteric arterioles, renal papilla, and brain. These results reveal a novel human nNOS promoter that confers the ability to rapidly upregulate nNOS expression in response to hypoxia with a functionally significant effect on vascular smooth muscle contraction.

This study aimed to investigate the differences in chewing indicators between a group of 11 adults with Down syndrome and a group of 12 healthy subjects without Down syndrome. Chewing ability was evaluated by means of video recordings taken during a standardized meal that included 10 natural foods. The variables collected were masticatory time, number of masticatory cycles, chewing frequency, number of open masticatory cycles, and number of food refusals. There were several differences in both directions for masticatory time and number of masticatory cycles between the two groups. In addition, with the exception of puree, the group with Down syndrome had significantly lower mean chewing frequency than the reference group, and was unable to eat all the foods presented.

All these structures are innervated by small branches of the intestinal nerve. Electrical stimulation of the nerve increased the rate at which gametes were transported in the duct and caused autosperm to flow into the fertilization pouch-spermathecal complex. These events were accompanied by stimulation-induced peristaltic contractions along the duct and activation of the cilia lining the interior of the duct. Acetylcholine and serotonin were identified as excitatory transmitters in this system, while FMRFamide was identified as a muscle relaxant. The nervous control of ejaculation may contribute to optimizing the size of the ejaculate in a context of sperm competition, while the involvement of the nervous system in ovulation may stem from a requirement for sensory integration that is peculiar to the Stylommatophora.

To assess a possible role of galanin in modulation of glutamatergic synapses and excitotoxicity, we studied effects of a galanin receptor 2(3) agonist (AR-M1896) on several molecular events induced by glutamate administration in primary neural hippocampal cells. Exposure of cells, after 5 days in vitro, to glutamate 0.5 mm for 10 min caused morphological alterations, including disaggregation of beta-tubulin and MAP-2 cytoskeletal protein assembly, loss of neurites and cell shrinkage. When present in culture medium together with glutamate, 1 and 10 mm of AR-M1896 reduced these alterations. Moreover, AR-M1896 counteracted glutamate-induced c-fos mRNA and c-Fos protein up-regulation after 30-150 min, and 24 h, respectively. Massive nuclear alterations (Hoechst 33258 staining), observed 24 h after glutamate exposure, were also antagonized by AR-M1896 (0.1-100 mm) in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that galanin, probably mainly through its type 2 receptor, interferes with events associated with glutamate toxicity.

The fact that patients with multiple sclerosis can develop a secondary progressive phase of their disease which is resistant to anti-inflammatory therapies, together with the fact that brain atrophy can develop in patients with a relatively low volume of white matter lesions, has led to suggestions that multiple sclerosis may be a degenerative disease. However, primary degenerative disorders are not usually associated with recurrent episodes of inflammatory demyelination.

Described here are two psychophysical studies that examined the effects of repeated exposure to thermal stimuli, assessing potential attenuation of the perception of pain and its possible spatial specificity. Twenty-two subjects were presented thermal stimuli to the volar surface of the right and left forearms. Twelve subjects in study 1 received the same stimuli and conditions on each of five daily experimental sessions, whereas 10 subjects in study 2 received thermal stimuli, which were restricted to one side for four daily sessions and then applied to the other side on the fifth session. Ratings of warmth intensity, pain intensity, and pain unpleasantness were recorded while the subjects performed a thermal sensory discrimination task. Results of study 1 demonstrate that repeated stimulation with noxious heat can lead to long-term attenuation of pain perception; results of study 2 extend these findings of attenuation to both pain intensity and unpleasantness and show that this effect is highly specific to the exposed body side for both aspects of the pain experience. We suggest that the functional plasticity underlying this attenuation effect lies in brain areas with a strong contralateral pattern of pain-related activation.

Surgery is an accepted treatment for carefully selected patients with focal epilepsy. In the present study, the authors assessed clinical and surgery-related data obtained in a large series of children suffering from intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods. Etiological, pathological, and clinical features of possible prognostic significance were studied in 109 children who underwent surgery for TLE at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital and the Montreal Children's Hospital between 1985 and 2000. The mean age of patients at seizure onset was 5.5 years and the duration of epilepsy ranged from 0.1 to 17.6 years. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed mesial sclerosis in 51 patients, a mass lesion in 45, and no visible abnormalities in 12. In six patients invasive monitoring was required. Cortical amygdalohippocampectomy was performed in 72% of patients, whereas 20% underwent transcortical selective amygdalohippocampectomy. In 23 patients a second surgical intervention was necessary. Low-grade tumors were found in 35% and mesial sclerosis was confirmed on pathological evaluation in 45%. Outcome was excellent (seizure free or > 90% reduction) in 94 patients (86%). The patients were followed prospectively for a median of 10.9 years (range 5-20.2 years). There were no permanent neurological complications and no deaths. Conclusions. Successful postsurgical outcomes, especially in patients treated for mesial temporal lobe sclerosis and lesion-related epilepsies, can be obtained in pediatric patients suffering minimal complications. Unfavorable outcomes are most likely to occur when epileptiform discharges are bitemporal or multifocal in distribution and in cases involving incomplete resection of mesiotemporal structures.

Pulvinar neurons have been shown to integrate the component signals of a plaid pattern into a coherent global percept (pattern-motion selectivity). Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have investigated the possibility that the human pulvinar is also involved in plaid-defined higher-order motion integration. Plaid patterns were presented to normal observers in two conditions (coherent vs. transparent) created by varying the relative spatial frequency of the two gratings comprising the plaid. Regions of interest analysis revealed a significant activation of the pulvinar in the coherent condition supporting the notion that the human pulvinar nucleus is involved in higher-order motion processing. Plaid pattern activation was also observed in the media temporal gyrus (area MT/V5), a motion area with strong anatomical connections to the pulvinar. These data provide the first direct evidence that the human pulvinar is involved in complex motion integration, as previously shown in animal models, and further support the existence of cortico-thalamo-cortical computational networks involved in higher-order visual processing.

The study goal is to enhance the efficacy of arteriovenous malformation embolization by adding a beta-emitting isotope to the embolic agent. Methods: The pig rete mirabile was used as a BAVM model. The body distribution of radioactivity was evaluated after selective rete injection of N-butyl,2-cyanoacrylate mixed with I-131-lipiodol in 8 animals using immediate whole body gamma-scintigraphy. Activities within the whole rete mirabile and selected tissue samples were quantified with a gamma counter immediately after sacrifice. Two pigs were submitted to serial gamma-scintigraphies for 6 weeks to detect delayed isotope leaching. Long-term effects of in situ irradiation were evaluated using a mixture of Re-188/N-butyl,2-cyanoacrylate in 8 pigs. In 1 animal, autoradiography was performed to evaluate local rete mirabile distribution of the radioactivity. Seven pigs were injected with Re-188/glue in 1 rete mirabile and with glue only on the opposite side, and the degree of vascular occlusion of both sides was compared on histology at 2 (n = 2) or 6 months (n = 5). Results: There was negligible activity outside the target. Radiation caused occlusion of vessels unreached by the glue itself but in the vicinity of the radioactive source in 5 of 7 rete mirabile. Conclusions: Selective deposition of a beta-emitter inside a BAVM model may be achieved by current embolization techniques. The adjunct use of an isotope may increase the efficacy of embolization.

Among these, noradrenaline-, histamine- and orexin-containing neurons fire during waking with behavioral arousal, decrease firing during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and cease firing during paradoxical sleep (PS), which is also known as rapid-eye-movement sleep. By, contrast, acetylcholine (ACh)-containing neurons discharge during waking, decrease firing during SWS and fire at high rates during PS in association with fast cortical activity. Neurons that do not contain ACh, including GABA-containing neurons in the basal fore-brain and preoptic area, are active in a reciprocal manner to the neurons of the arousal systems: one group discharges with slow cortical activity during SWS, and another discharges with behavioral quiescence and loss of postural muscle tone during SWS and PS. The reciprocal activities and interactions of these wake-active and sleep-active cell groups determine the alternation between waking and sleeping. Selective enhancement and attenuation of their discharge, transmitter release and postsynaptic actions comprise the substrates for the major stimulant and hypnotic drugs.

Cytokines, peptide hormones and their shared receptors/ligands are used as a common biological language for communication within and between the immune and neuroendocrine systems. Such communication suggests an immunoregulatory role for the brain and a sensory function for the immune system. We used a radioimmunoassay to measure the concentrations of steroid hormones (cortisol, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone) and pituitary hormones [follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and prolactin] in peripheral blood plasma from 78 young Gabonese women with chronic filarial infections. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the concentrations of four proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6] in the same plasma samples. Progesterone was unchanged and all other steroid hormone plasma concentrations were lower in microfilaremic women than in amicrofilaremic women. The concentration of LH was higher in amicrofilaremic women, whereas the prolactin concentration was higher in microfilaremics. The plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 and IL-6 were higher in microfilaremic women. A strong negative correlation was found between the steroid and pituitary hormones and the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conversely, a strong positive correlation was found between prolactin and the same cytokines. These data provide first evidence of immune system and hormonal system disturbance during chronic filarial infections and suggest that the observed imbalance should be taken into account in the diagnosis and treatment of filarial infections.

In both neocortex and subcortical structures, TLE1 expression was mostly localized to neurons. In addition to the expected nuclear localization, TLE1 immunoreactivity was also detected in apical dendritic shafts of neocortical layer III and V pyramidal cells and in Purkinje cell dendrites. These results demonstrate that TLE1 expression occurs in the mature nervous system and suggest that this protein may perform new functions outside of the nucleus in selected cortical and cerebellar neurons.

However, the immune response to tissue damage is likely to differ depending on whether or not the injury is accompanied by infection. Many clinically important inflammatory pain states involve a sterile tissue injury. However, existing animal models of cutaneous inflammatory pain use injuries that are likely to involve those components of the immune system that are specialized for combating pathogens (e.g., injections of Complete Freund's Adjuvant, carrageenan, or zymosan). We describe here a model of cutaneous inflammatory pain in the rat produced by a sterile injury evoked by a single exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. The animals develop heat-hyperalgesia, mechano-hyperalgesia, mechano-allodynia, and cold-allodynia that last for several days. Cold-allodynia appears within 6 h or less, but the other symptoms are not clearly evident until 12-36 h after exposure. This model offers several advantages for the experimental analysis of the causes of inflammatory allodynia and hyperalgesia. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thirteen FA+ subjects and 11 FA- subjects were scanned while being presented with a series of emotionally negative and neutral pictures. Experientially, the viewing of the negative pictures induced a negative emotional state whose intensity was significantly greater in the FA- group than in the FA+ group. Neurally, the Negative minus Neutral contrast revealed, in the FA- group, significant loci of activation in the midbrain, pons, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal pole, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and extrastriate visual cortex. In the FA+ group.. this contrast produced significant loci of activation in the midbrain, pons, anterior temporal pole, and extrastriate visual cortex. When the brain activity measured in the FA+ group was subtracted from that measured in the FA- group, only the lingual gyrus was significantly activated. Perhaps in FA+ subjects an amygdaloid malfunction rendered the amygdala unable to correctly evaluate the emotional meaning of the pictures presented, thus preventing effective connectivity linking the amygdala to the brain regions implicated in the physiological and experiential dimensions of emotion. Alternatively, a disturbance of effective connectivity in the neural networks linking the midbrain and the medial prefrontal system may have been responsible for the quasi absence of emotional reaction in FA+ subjects, and the abnormal functioning of the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in the FA+ group.

NATURE			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; EPISODIC MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; EVENTS; HIPPOCAMPUS; HUMANS; BRAIN; FMRI	Investigators since Freud have appreciated that memories of the people, places, activities and emotions of daily life are reflected in dreams but are typically so fragmented that their predictability is nil. The mechanisms that translate such memories into dream images remain largely unknown. New research targeting relationships between dreaming, memory and the hippocampus is producing a new theory to explain how, why and when we dream of waking life events.

Existing ASIC knock-out mouse experiments are complicated by the heteromultimerization of ASIC subunits. Therefore, we have generated transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative form of the ASIC3 subunit that inactivates all native neuronal ASIC-like currents by oligomerization. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we examined the response properties of acutely isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons to protons (pH 5.0). We found that whereas 33% of the proton-responsive neurons from wild-type mice exhibited an ASIC-like transient response, none of the neurons from the transgenic mice exhibited a transient inward current. Capsaicin-evoked responses mediated by the TRPV1 receptor were unaltered in transgenic mice. Adult male wild-type and transgenic mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral nociceptive assays, including tests of thermal, mechanical, chemical/inflammatory, and muscle pain. The two genotypes were equally sensitive to thermal pain and to thermal hypersensitivity after inflammation. Compared with wild types, however, transgenic mice were more sensitive to a number of modalities, including mechanical pain (von Frey test, tail-clip test), chemical/inflammatory pain (formalin test, 0.6% acetic acid writhing test), mechanical hypersensitivity after zymosan inflammation, and mechanical hypersensitivity after intramuscular injection of hypotonic saline. These data reinforce the hypothesis that ASICs are involved in both mechanical and inflammatory pain, although the increased sensitivity of transgenic mice renders it unlikely that they are direct transducers of nociceptive stimuli.

Since the uptake of drugs in the CNS can be modulated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we propose to determine whether the P-gp inhibitor verapamil can enhance the uptake of DM in the CNS. Rats (n = 42) received an oral dose of DM (20 mg/kg) alone or 15 min after an intravenous dose of verapamil (1 mg/kg). Rats were euthanized at different time points over 12 h, and concentrations of DM and DX (conjugated and unconjugated) were assessed in plasma, brain and spinal cord using a LC-ESI/MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. Verapamil treatments did not affect the biodisposition of DM in plasma. On the other hand, verapamil treatments increased the area under curve of DM in the brain (from 1221 to 2393 ng h/g) and spinal cord (from 1753 to 3221 ng h/g) by approximately 2-fold. The uptake of DX in brain and spinal cord were markedly lower than those of DM and increased by only 15% and 22% following verapamil treatments, respectively. These results suggest that the P-gp inhibitor verapamil can enhance the uptake of DM in the CNS without affecting that of DX. This change is most likely related to an inhibition of P-gp or other transporters located in the BBB since the biodisposition of DM in plasma remained unaffected by verapamil treatments.

As medulloblastomas (MBs), the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood, are believed to arise from neuronal cerebellar precursors, we asked whether there is a potential role for Cxcr4 in the pathogenesis of MB. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry revealed expression of Cxcr4 in different variants of MBs. Whereas 18/20 classic MBs showed very low levels of CXCR4 mRNA, high amounts were expressed in 17/18 desmoplastic and 6/7 extensively nodular MBs. In addition, a significant correlation of high CXCR4 mRNA levels and presence of the neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) or expression of ATOH1 and GL11 suggests that CXCR4 is a reliable marker for tumors derived from the cerebellar external granular layer. Because Cxcr4 is important for migration and cell cycle control of granular precursors, we screened for mutations in the coding region by SSCP and gene sequencing. In a series of 90 MBs and 8 MB cell lines, we found one germline and one somatic mutation resulting in amino acid substitutions in the first (Ile53Leu) and second (Asp97Asn) transmembrane regions, respectively. These data suggest that Cxcr4 may be involved in the pathogenesis of MBs. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Using cortical precursor cultures, which temporally mimic this in vivo differentiation pattern, we demonstrate that cortical neurons synthesize and secrete the neurotrophic cytokine cardiotrophin-1, which activates the gp130-JAK-STAT pathway and is essential for the timed genesis of astrocytes in vitro. Our data indicate that a similar phenomenon also occurs in vivo. In utero electroporation of neurotrophic cytokines in the environment of embryonic cortical precursors causes premature gliogenesis, while acute perturbation of gp130 in cortical precursors delays the normal timed appearance of astrocytes. Moreover, the neonatal cardiotrophin-1(-l-) cortex contains fewer astrocytes. Together, these results describe a neural feedback mechanism; newly born neurons produce cardiotrophin-1, which instructs multipotent cortical precursors to generate astrocytes, thereby ensuring that gliogenesis does not occur until neurogenesis is largely complete.

However, the developmental shift in transmembrane anion gradient, potentially affecting the outcome of GABA(A) transmission, was shown to be completed within 1 week after birth in the spinal cord, an apparent disparity with the observation that reflex hypersensitivity persists throughout the first 2-3 postnatal weeks. To further investigate this issue, we used several approaches to assess the action of GABA throughout development in spinal lamina I (LI) neurons. GABA induced an entry of extracellular calcium in LI neurons from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P21 rats, which involved T- and N-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Gramicidin perforated-patch recordings revealed that the shift in anion gradient was completed by P7 in LI neurons. However, high chloride pipette recordings demonstrated that these neurons had not reached their adult chloride extrusion capacity by P10-P11. Simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging revealed that biphasic responses to GABA, consisting of a primary hyperpolarization followed by a rebound depolarization, produced a rise in [Ca2+](i). Thus, even if E-anion predicts GABA(A)- induced hyperpolarization from rest, a low chloride extrusion capacity can cause a rebound depolarization and an ensuing rise in [Ca2+](i). We demonstrate that GABA action in LI neurons matures throughout the first 3 postnatal weeks, therefore matching the time course of maturation of withdrawal reflexes. Immature spinal GABA signaling may thus contribute to the nociceptive hypersensitivity in infant rats.

Of 29 patients studied ( age, 30.3 +/- 10.9 years), 21 had transposition of the great arteries with a Mustard baffle, and 8 had congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Baseline values were as follows: Vo(2)max, 29.8 +/- 5.6 mL (.) kg(-1) (.) min(-1) (73.5 +/- 12.9% predicted value); RV ejection fraction, 41.6 +/- 9.3%; N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), 257.7 +/- 243.4 pg/mL ( normal < 125 pg/mL); and angiotensin II, 5.7 +/- 4.9 pg/mL ( normal < 5.0 pg/mL). Comparing losartan to placebo showed no differences in Vo(2)max (29.9 +/- 5.4 versus 29.4 +/- 6.2 mL (.) kg(-1 .) min(-1); P = 0.43), exercise duration (632.3 +/- 123.0 versus 629.9 +/- 140.7 seconds; P = 0.76), and NT-proBNP levels (201.2 +/- 267.8 versus 229.7 +/- 291.5 pg/mL; P = 0.10), despite a trend toward increased angiotensin II levels (15.2 +/- 13.8 versus 8.8 +/- 12.5 pg/mL; P = 0.08). Conclusions - In adults with systemic RVs, losartan did not improve exercise capacity or reduce NT-proBNP levels. Minimal baseline activation of the renin-angiotensin system may explain this lack of benefit and imply an alternative pathophysiological mechanism for the progressive ventricular dysfunction and impaired exercise capacity observed in such patients.

By recording the electroencephalogram during the functional MRI, changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal were obtained in response to epileptic discharges observed in the electroencephalogram of 15 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. A group analysis was performed to determine the regions of positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) blood oxygenation level-dependent responses that were common to the patients. Activations were found bilaterally and symmetrically in the thalamus, mesial midfrontal region, insulae, and midline and bilateral cerebellum and on the borders of the lateral ventricles. Deactivations were bilateral and symmetrical in the anterior frontal and parietal regions and in the posterior cingulate gyri and were seen in the left posterior temporal region. Activations in thalamus and midfrontal regions confirm known involvement of these regions in the generation or spread of generalized epileptic discharges. Involvement of the insulae in generalized discharges had not previously been described. Cerebellar activation is not believed to reflect the generation of discharges. Deactivations in frontal and parietal regions remarkably followed the pattern of the default state of brain function. Thalamocortical activation and suspension of the default state may combine to cause the actual state of reduced responsiveness observed in patients during spike-and-wave discharges. This brief lapse of responsiveness may therefore not result only from the epileptic discharge but also from its effect on normal brain function.

Morphologically, we distinguished three groups of layer II principal neurons. The most numerous group included cells with multiple radiating dendrites that spread over layers II and I in a fan-like fashion. While morphologically "fan" neurons were similar to the "stellate" cells of the medial EC, electrophysiologically the fan cells lacked the persistent rhythmic subthreshold oscillations and the very pronounced time-dependent inward rectification typical of the stellate cells. The second group consisted of pyramidal cells that manifested regular spike firing and had a more negative resting potential and a longer spike duration than the fan cells. In the third group we included all those neurons that had diverse multipolar appearances distinct from the fan cells. Neurons in this group had electrophysiological profiles intermediate between those of the fan and pyramidal cells. All neurons recorded in layer III were pyramidal in shape with a basal dendritic tree that could extend into layer V and an axon that could also give off collaterals into layer V. Electrophysiologically, layer III pyramidal cells were very similar to those of layer II. On the basis of these and other data we suggest that in different EC regions layer II neurons may be conducting more input-dependent specialized processing, while cells from layer III may perform a more global or generalized function.

Extensive analyses over the past decade led to the detection of several BRCA1 alternative splice variants. Here, we identify the first BRCA1 alternative splice variant containing an additional in-frame exon. This previously unknown exon 13A-containing transcript is generated by the insertion of 66 nucleotides between exons 13 and 14, due to alternative splicing in intron 13 (IVS13-2786-2720). Furthermore, exon 13A-containing transcript was detectable in total RNA samples from 12 normal tissues and several breast and other cancer cell lines. As revealed by real-time PCR analysis, this transcript corresponds to 20 to 25% of the total BRCA1 mRNA expression levels in leukocytes, brain and cerebellum tissues, whereas its relative level of expression is less than 5% in other tested tissues and cancer cell lines. This novel alternative transcript adds 22 amino acids after residue 1452, thus modifying the primary structure of the trans-activation domain 1 (AD1) and the protein-protein interacting domain of BRCA1 with BRCA2, AR and MSH2. No sequence variant has been detected by direct genomic sequencing of exon 13A in individuals originating from high-risk breast/ovarian cancer families. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is well known that stress induces tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activation, resultingin increased serotonin (5-HT) synthesis. In our experimental procedure to measure 5-HTsynthesis using alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) autoradiographic method, the hind limbs of animals are restrained using a loose-fitted plaster cast such that the fore limbs of the animal remain free. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the changes, if any, in 5-HT synthesis, after injecting these restrained rats with the TPH activation inhibitor AGN-2979. The effect on regional 5-HT synthesis was studied using the alpha-MTrp autoradiographic method. The hypothesis was that the TPH activation inhibitor would reduce 5-HT synthesis, if TPH activation was induced by this restraint. The rats received injection of AGN-2979 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or distilled water vehicle (1 mL/kg, i.p.) 1 h prior to tracer administration. The free and total tryptophan concentrations were not significantly different between the treatment and control groups. The results demonstrate that 5-HT synthesis in. AGN-2979 treated rats is significantly decreased (- 12 to -35%) in both the raphe nuclei and their terminal areas when compared to the control rats. These findings suggest that restrained conditions, such as those used in our experimental protocol, induce TPH activation resulting in an increased 5-HT synthesis throughout the brain. The reduction in 5-HT synthesis in the AGN-2979 group is not related to a change in the plasma tryptophan. Because there was no activation in the pineal body, the structure having a different isoform. of TPH, we can propose that it is only the brain TPH that becomes activated with this specific restraint.

Many people spend a significant amount of time listening to music, and its emotional power is assumed but not well understood. Here, we use functional and effective connectivity analyses to show for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus and insula, which are thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli. Responses in the NAc and the VTA were strongly correlated pointing to an association between dopamine release and NAc response to music. Responses in the NAc and the hypothalamus were also strongly correlated across subjects, suggesting a mechanism by which listening to pleasant music evokes physiological reactions. Effective connectivity confirmed these findings, and showed significant VTA-mediated interaction of the NAc with the hypothalamus, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The enhanced functional and effective connectivity between brain regions mediating reward, autonomic, and cognitive processing provides insight into understanding why listening to music is one of the most rewarding and pleasurable human experiences.

Seven epilepsy patients performed a periodic (1 Hz) right-hand pinch grip using similar to 8% of their maximum voluntary contraction, a paradigm previously shown to produce contralateral M1 neuronal excitation and ipsilateral Nil neuronal inhibition. A multi-slice interleaved pulsed arterial spin labeling and T-2*-weighted gradient echo sequence was employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and BOLD changes. EEG was recorded throughout the imaging session and reviewed to identify the IEDs. During the motor task, BOLD, CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) signals increased in the contra- and decreased in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. The relative changes in CMRO2 and CBF were linearly related, with a slope of 0.46 +/- 0.05. The ratio of contra- to ipsilateral CBF changes was smaller in the present group of epilepsy patients than in the healthy subjects examined previously. IEDs produced both increases and decreases in BOLD and CBF signals. In the two case studies for which the estimation criteria were met, the coupling ratio between IED-induced CMRO2, and CBF changes was estimated at 0.48 +/- 0.17. These findings provide evidence for a preserved coupling between hemodynamic and metabolic changes in response to both functional activation and, for the two case studies available, in response to interictal epileptiform activity.

Brainstem gliomas (BSGs) are resistant to all therapy. Based on their imaging characteristics, we postulated that inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) associated with endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier might enhance penetration of xenobiotic antineoplastics. Procedure. Seven patients were enrolled in a Phase I study of etoposide, continuous infusion cyclosporine A given with and escalating doses of vincristine and concomitant standard-dose irradiation. Results. Six patients were entered at the first level and one at the second. Closure of the study was mandated by dose-limiting neurotoxicity, consisting of seizures associated with white-matter changes, and alteration of consciousness with bulbar signs. One patient had tumor necrosis at 6 weeks, suggesting some tumor effect. Median survival for the group was 11 months, and for the patients who completed more than 1 month of therapy it was 11 months. Conclusion. This regimen proved excessively toxic.

Because these morphological types appear to differ in functional properties and receptor expression, we examined their distribution in the rat to test how their identification relates to earlier classification schemes. LI STT cells were retrogradely labeled with cholera toxin subunit b (CTb). Three types were recognized on the basis of cell body shape and proximal dendrites in the horizontal plane: fusiform, multipolar, and pyramidal. The relative distribution of these types was: 43, 26, and 28%, respectively, similar to that observed in the cat and monkey. 3D reconstructions were used to view each cell in all three major projection planes: horizontal, parasagittal, and transverse. Most LI STT neurons appeared fusiform in the parasagittal plane even though they belonged to different types based on their appearance in the horizontal plane, except in the most lateral portion of the dorsal horn, where LI curves ventrally. The proportion of SIT neurons within LI was quantified by using the optical dissector method. To label all LI neurons, we used an anti-neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibody. We found that approximately 9% of LI neurons projected to the thalamus, We also investigated neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1r) expression in LI STT neurons. As in the monkey, most pyramidal STT neurons did not express NK-1r. These results provide further evidence that distinct morphological types of neurons differ in phenotype but not in their projection pattern.

We examined the protective properties of chlortetracycline (CTC) and demeclocycline (DMC) and showed that these two tetracyclines were also potent neuroprotective against glutamate-induced neuronal death in vitro and cerebral ischemia in vivo. However, CTC and DMC appeared to confer neuroprotection through a unique mechanism compared with minocycline. Rather than inhibiting microglial activation and caspase, CTC and DMC suppressed calpain activities. In addition, CTC and DMC only weakly antagonized N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) receptor activities causing 16 and 14%, respectively, inhibition of NMDA-induced whole cell currents and partially blocked NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx, commonly regarded as the major trigger of neuronal death. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the two compounds selectively inhibited the activities of calpain I and II activated following glutamate treatment and cerebral ischemia. In contrast, minocycline did not significantly inhibit calpain activity. Taken together, these results suggested that CTC and DMC provide neuroprotection through suppression of a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of calpains.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and disease ensue only when the proportion of mutated mtDNAs is high, thus a reduction in this proportion should provide an effective therapy for these disorders. We developed a system to decrease specific mtDNA haplotypes by expressing a mitochondrially targeted restriction endonuclease, ApaLI, in cells of heteroplasmic mice. These mice have two mtDNA haplotypes, of which only one contains an ApaLI site. After transfection of cultured hepatocytes with mitochondrially targeted ApaLI, we found a rapid, directional, and complete shift in mtDNA heteroplasmy (2-6 h). We tested the efficacy of this approach in vivo, by using recombinant viral vectors expressing the mitochondrially targeted ApaLI. We observed a significant shift in mtDNA heteroplasmy in muscle and brain transduced with recombinant viruses. This strategy could prevent disease onset or reverse clinical symptoms in patients harboring certain heteroplasmic pathogenic mutations in mtDNA.

However, p75NTR-positive cells demonstrate a higher susceptibility to NCS-induced cell damage. Furthermore, treatment of p75NTR-positive cells with the p75NTR-specific ligand, MCI 92, resulted in apoptosis, while treatment of these cells with the TrkA-specific ligand, NGF-rnAbNGF30, protected them from NCS-induced death, implying that both the naked and liganded p75NTR receptors have a pro-apoptotic effect on PC 12 cells. Microarray studies aimed at examining differential gene expression between p75NTR-positive and p75NTR-negative cells suggested that enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway are differentially expressed. We therefore tested the hypothesis that altered cholesterol biosynthesis contributes directly to the pro-apoptotic effects of p75NTR in this PC12 cell-NCS model. Subsequent Northern blotting studies confirmed that the expression of p75NTR is associated with the upregulation of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG CoA reductase), farnesyl-diphosphate synthase, and 7-dehydro-cholesterol reductase. Mevastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, converts the apoptosis susceptibility of p75NTR-positive cells to that of p75NTR-negative cells. It does so at concentrations that do not themselves alter cell survival. These studies provide evidence that the pro-apoptotic effects of p75NTR in PC12 cells are related to the upregulation of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes and consequent increased cholesterol biosynthesis.

Other evidence has shown that alcohol administration can influence opioid activity. In this regard, the majority of studies have concentrated on endorphinergic systems, whereas other opioid systems have been granted comparably less attention. This is the case despite some compelling evidence that has implicated enkephalinergic pepticle systems, particularly Met-enkephalin, in mediating alcohol preference. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of alcohol administration on extracellular levels of Met-enkephalin in the rat nucleus accumbens-a brain region that plays a significant role in the processes underlying reinforcement and stress. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a microdialysis probe aimed at the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid was pumped at a rate of 1.75 mu l/min in awake and freely moving rats and dialysates were collected at 30-minute intervals. After several baseline collections, rats were injected intraperitoneally with either physiological saline or one of four doses of alcohol: 0.8, 1.6, 2.4, or 3.2 g/kg ethanol body weight. The levels of Met-enkephalin in the dialysates were analyzed with solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Results: Within the first 30 minutes of administration, an alcohol dose of 1.6 g/kg caused a significant and prolonged elevation in the extracellular levels of Met-enkephalin. Alcohol did not have a major effect on the release of Met-enkephalin at any other dose. Conclusions: In this experiment, only a moderate dose of alcohol was capable of stimulating Metenkephalin release in the nucleus accumbens. Enkephalins may modulate local neurotransmitter release by binding to presynaptic delta-opioid receptors, or, they may inhibit effector cells by binding to postsynaptic delta- or c-opioid receptors. This may be one of multiple neurological mechanisms that modulate alcohol-drinking behavior.

Method: Thirteen medication-free individuals with acute PTSD and no axis I psychiatric comorbidity were scanned while viewing pictures of fearful or happy faces, presented above or below consciousness, with backward masking. Results: There was a significant positive correlation between the severity of PTSD and the difference in amygdala responses between masked fearful and happy faces and a corresponding negative correlation for the difference between unmasked fearful and happy faces. Conclusions: These findings suggest that functional abnormalities in brain responses to emotional stimuli observed in chronic PTSD are already apparent in its acute phase.

However, the influence on MAC of baseline sensitivity to the noxious stimuli used to assess MAC has virtually never been studied. The authors assessed room air nociceptive sensitivity and isoflurane MAC in multiple mouse strains. Isoflurane requirement for loss of righting response (MAC(LORR)) was also measured. Methods: One outbred and 10 inbred mouse strains were tested for latency to respond (in room air) to a tail clip (either 500 g or 2,000 g). Naive mice of the same 11 strains were tested for isoflurane MAC and MAC(LORR). To assess the role of opioid-mediated stress-induced antinociception, mice were also tested for nociceptive sensitivity after injection of naloxone (10 mg/kg) or saline. Results: Robust strain differences were observed for all measures. The authors found that tail-clip latency (using a 500-g or 2,000-g clip, respectively) correlated significantly with MAC (r = -0.76 and -0.58, respectively) but not MACLORR (r = -0.10 and -0.26). Naloxone produced strain-dependent reductions in open air tail-clip latencies, and these reductions were also strongly correlated with MAC (r = -0.67 and -0.71). Conclusions: The authors suggest that genetic variability in isoflurane MAC (but not MAC(LORR)) may reflect genetic variability in the underlying sensitivity to the noxious stimulus being used to measure MAC. This variable sensitivity to nociception in the awake state is at least partially mediated by endogenous antinociceptive mechanisms activated by the tail-clip stimulus itself.

However, previous findings by Bertone et al. indicate that neuro-integrative mechanisms used to detect complex motion, rather than motion perception per se, may be impaired in autism. We present here the first demonstration of concurrent enhanced and decreased performance in autism on the same visuo-spatial static task, wherein the only factor dichotomizing performance was the neural complexity required to discriminate grating orientation. The ability of persons with autism was found to be superior for identifying the orientation of simple, luminance-defined (or first-order) gratings but inferior for complex, texture-defined (or second-order) gratings. Using a flicker contrast sensitivity task, we demonstrated that this finding is probably not due to abnormal information processing at a sub-cortical level (magnocellular and parvocellular functioning). Together, these findings are interpreted as a clear indication of altered low-level perceptual information processing in autism, and confirm that the deficits and assets observed in autistic visual perception are contingent on the complexity of the neural network required to process a given type of visual stimulus. We suggest that atypical neural connectivity, resulting in enhanced lateral inhibition, may account for both enhanced and decreased low-level information processing in autism.

We studied 76 patients with MCD, including focal cortical dysplasia (n = 29; lesions located outside the temporal lobe in all), heterotopia (lesions outside of the temporal lobe, n = 14; lesions extending into the temporal lobe, n = 16), polymicrogyria (bilateral perisylvian, n = 14; unilateral perisylvian, n = 3) and 30 patients with TLE (hippocampal atrophy, n = 15; normal hippocampal volumes, n = 15). Shape and positioning of the HF were evaluated using a set of eight predefined morphological characteristics. In addition, the degree of hippocampal vertical orientation and medial positioning were assessed quantitatively. Patients were compared with 50 healthy controls. At least three criteria describing abnormal HF shape and positioning were found in 5/50 (10%) healthy controls, 37/76 (49%) MCD and 13/30 (43%) TLE patients. An association with all criteria was found in MCD and TLE, but not in healthy controls. In MCD there was no association between the side of HF shape abnormalities and the side of the cortical malformation or the EEG focus. Likewise, in TLE, HF abnormalities were not related to the side of the EEG focus. In both MCD and TLE patients who had hippocampal atrophy, no association was found between the side of HF shape abnormalities and the side of atrophy. Abnormal HF shape and positioning are found in a similar proportion in MCD and TLE. In TLE, they may be a marker of a more extensive disorder of brain development and may participate in the development of this condition.

Mounting evidence supports the first two assumptions, but data lack regarding cognition in dual diagnosis schizophrenia. Seventy-six schizophrenia outpatients (DSM-IV) were divided into two groups: with (n = 44) and without (n = 32) a substance use disorder. Motor speed and visuo-spatial explicit memory were investigated using CANTAB. As expected, dual diagnosis patients showed a better cognitive performance. Our results suggest either that substance abuse relieves the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia or that the patients with less cognitive deficits are more prone to substance abuse.

The purpose of this study is to compare NMB at the vastus medialis with the adductor pollicis muscle using phonomyography (PMG). Methods: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 0.25 to 0.5 mu g(.)kg(-1.)min(-1), followed by propofol 2 to 2.5 mg(-1.)kg(-1) iv. Analgesia was provided by remifentanil 0.05 to 0.25 mu g(.)kg(-1.)min(-1) iv throughout surgery A small piezo-electric microphone was attached to the middle of the thenar mass of the right hand to record acoustic signals produced by the contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle. A second microphone was fixed to the medial part of the thigh, 10 cm over the patella, to record the response from the vastus medialis muscle. The ulnar nerve and the im branches of the femoral nerve were stimulated using train-of-four stimulation every 12 sec. Onset, maximum effect, and offset of neuromuscular block were measured after mivacurium 0.2 mg(.)kg(-1) iv and compared. Results: At the vastus medialis muscle, the onset of NMB was significantly shorter at 1.9 +/- 0.6 min vs 2.8 +/- 0.7 min, the maximum effect less pronounced at 85 +/- 11% vs 96 +/- 2% and recovery of NMB to 25%, 75%, 90% of twitch control height more rapid than at the adductor pollicis muscle at 17 +/- 2.2 min vs 21.6 +/- 4.2 min, 26.7 +/- 6.5 vs 21 +/- 4.1 min and 30.7 +/- 6.6 vs 35.9 +/- 7.1 min, respectively. Conclusions: PMG can be used to measure NMB at the vastus medialis muscle. We found a shorter onset time, less pronounced maximum effect and more rapid recovery of NMB at the vastus medialis muscle than at the adductor pollicis muscle.

It was the work of a single individual, a young cardiologist with a vision. Paul David (1919-1999) trained in the late 1940s - first, in Boston with Paul Dudley White and, second, in Paris with jean Lenegre, two of the well-known cardiologists of the times. In the early 1950s, the only heart institute in the world was the one that Ignacio Chavez had founded in Mexico in 1944. Montreal had a medical institute of its own, the Montreal Neurological Institute, which Wilder Penfield had established in 1934. David probably got his inspiration from these two institutions. Two events also coincided somewhat at the time. In 1950, David attended the first meeting of the International Society of Cardiology in Paris where Alfred Blalock presented his experience with his operation for blue babies and Charles Bailey discussed valvular commissurotomy for mitral stenosis. Shortly after he returned from France, David was approached by the Sisters of Charity to lead the cardiology division of a new hospital under construction in Montreal. The young man, barely out of residency, insisted on having a full floor of the hospital to himself with complete administrative independence from the main hospital. He also indicated that he would call the place a Heart Institute, no less. The nuns took him seriously and, after two or three encounters, agreed with his requests, perhaps much to his surprise. The rest, as they say, is history.

The Most Successful therapy has been attenuation of neurohumoral overactivation with antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as beta-adrenergic blockade. Cardiac surgical interventions, which include not only aortocoronary artery bypass surgery but also interventions that remodel the heart and repair the mitral valve, have also been advocated. However, randomized clinical trials to prove their benefit and to identify which patients could derive the most benefit from these interventions are lacking. Cardiac devices, such as biventricular pacemakers (for cardiac resynchronization) and implantable cardiac defibrillators, have proved useful in improving survival and quality of life. The treatment of sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure has shown some promise, as has immune modulation therapy, but more research to conclusively prove their efficacy is necessary. Cell therapy with skeletal myoblasts or pluripotential stein cells is all interesting and emerging area of research that shows enormous promise. However, fundamental questions regarding the optimal use of this therapy remain unanswered. Finally, although exciting, these developments, along with the changing demographics of the Canadian population, will require a change in the way we provide care for patients with congestive heart failure. These changes will require greater involvement of health care professionals other than physicians, and greater emphasis on Outpatient care, early detection and prevention, and evidence-based practice.

We sought to explore the incidence and management of TD in the era of atypical antipsychotics because it remains an important latrogenic adverse effect. Methods: We conducted a review of TD incidence and management literature from January 1, 1965, to January 31, 2004, using the terms tardive dyskinesia, management, therapy, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. Additional articles were obtained by searching the bibliographies of relevant references. We considered articles that contributed to the current understanding of both the incidence of TD with atypical antipsychotics and management strategies for TD. Results: The incidence of TD is significantly lower with atypical, compared with typical, antipsychotics, but cases of de novo TD have been identified. Evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic therapy ameliorates long-standing TD. This paper outlines management strategies for TD in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusion: The literature supports the recommendation that atypical antipsychotics should be the first antipsychotics used in patients who have experienced TD as a result of treatment with conventional antipsychotic agents. The other management strategies discussed may prove useful in certain patients.

Older patients are increasingly suffering trauma, and comorbid medical conditions are also increasing. Our objective was to determine the separate and combined effect of these 2 factors on length of hospital stay for trauma patients in a tertiary trauma centre. Methods: All 994 consecutive trauma patients surviving to hospital discharge between Apr. 1, 2000, and Mar. 31, 2001, were identified. Patient characteristics, injury severity and length of hospitalization were obtained from the hospital trauma registry. Each medical record was then reviewed for completeness of information and assessment of comorbid conditions. A multivariate linear regression model was developed to predict logarithmic length of stay from age and presence of a cormorbid condition while adjusting for the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.7 ( range from 14-100) years and median ISS was 9 ( range from 1-50). At least 1 comorbid condition was present in 321 (32%) patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 15.3 days. The proportion of patients with a comorbid condition increased steadily with age, from 8.7% before the age of 55 years to 92% at 85 or more years of age (p < 0.001). According to the multivariate model, the presence of comorbidity, age and ISS were all independent predictors of hospital stay (p < 0.001). When applied to patients with the mean ISS value of 9, the model showed an increase in length of hospitalization for patients with a comorbid condition over those without; (3.6 v. 13.1 d for patients < 55 and >= 85 yr respectively). Length of hospital stay increased particularly with neurologic and pulmonary problems. Conclusions: Comorbidity and age were both independently significant predictors of length of hospitalization over and beyond that which is expected based on the severity of the injuries. With an aging population, this phenomenon should severely affect resource utilization in trauma centres in the near future. Researchers should take account of both age and comorbidity in order to compare trauma populations.

We hypothesized that bimodal selective attention results from increased activity in corresponding sensory cortices with a suppression of activity in non-corresponding sensory cortices. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we presented melodies and shapes alone (unimodal) or simultaneously (bimodal). Subjects monitored for changes in an attended modality while ignoring the other. Subsequently, memory for both attended and unattended stimuli was tested. Subjects remembered attended stimuli equally well in unimodal and bimodal conditions, and significantly better than ignored stimuli in bimodal conditions. When a subject focused on a stimulus, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response increased in sensory cortices corresponding to that modality in both unimodal and bimodal conditions. Additionally, the BOLD response decreased in sensory cortices corresponding to the non-presented modality in unimodal conditions and the unattended modality in bimodal conditions. We conclude that top-down attentional effects modulate the interaction of sensory cortical areas by gating sensory input. This interaction between sensory cortices enhances processing of one modality at the expense of the other during selective attention, and subsequently affects memory encoding.

The French-Canadian population of Quebec, currently about 6 million people, descends from about 8500 French settlers who arrived in Nouvelle-France between 1608 and 1759. The migrations of those settlers and their descendants led to a series of regional founder effects, reflected in the geographical distribution of genetic diseases in Quebec. This review describes elements of population history and clinical genetics pertinent to the treatment of French Canadians and other population groups from Quebec and summarizes the cardinal features of over 30 conditions reported in French Canadians. Some were discovered in French Canadians, such as autosomal recessive ataxia of the Charlevoix-Saguenay (MIM 270550), agenesis of corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy (MIM 218000) and French-Canadian-type Leigh syndrome (MIM 220111). Other conditions are particularly frequent or have special genetic characteristics in French Canadians, including oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, hepatorenal tyrosinaemia, cystic fibrosis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and familial hypercholesterolaemia. Three genetic diseases of Quebec First Nations children are also discussed: Cree encephalitis (MIM 608505), Cree leukoencephalopathy (MIM 603896) and North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (MIM 604901).

J	Grewal, S; Gotman, J				Grewal, S; Gotman, J			An automatic warning system for epileptic seizures recorded on intracerebral EEGs	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; intracerebral electrodes; seizure detection; warning	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ALGORITHM; SERIES; ONSET; BRAIN	Objective: A new clinical seizure waning system for intracerebral EEG is proposed. It is aimed at a better performance than existing systems and at user tuneability. Methods: The system employs data filtering in multiple bands, spectral feature extraction, Bayes' theorem, and spatio-temporal analysis. The a priori information in Bayes' theorem was provided by 407 It of EEG from 19 patients having 152 seizures. Results: The testing data (19 patients, 389 h, 100 seizures, independent of the training data) yielded a sensitivity of 89.4%, a false detection rate of 0.22/h, and median delay time of 17.1 s when tuning was used, and 86%, 0.47/h and 16.2 s without tuning. Missed seizures were of short duration or had subtle seizure activity. False detections were caused by technical artefacts, non-epileptic large amplitude rhythmic bursts or very low amplitude activity. It was established that performance could easily be tuned. Results were also compared to the clinical system of Gotman (1990). Conclusions: The system offers a performance that is acceptable for clinical use. User tuneability allows for reduction in false detection with minimal loss to sensitivity. Significance: Epilepsy monitoring generates large amounts of recordings and requires intense observation. Automatic seizure detection and warning systems reduce review time and facilitate observation. We propose a method with high sensitivity and few false alarms.

There has been little Success at re-combining those features into moving objects. Here, a novel model of attentive visual motion processing is presented that addresses both decomposition of the signal into constituent features as well as the re-combination, or binding, of those features into wholes. A new feed-forward rnotion-processing pyramid is presented motivated by the neurobiology of primate motion processes. On this structure the Selective Tuning (ST) model for visual attention is demonstrated. There are three main contributions: (1) a new feed-forward motion processing hierarchy, the first to include a Multi-level decomposition with local spatial derivatives of velocity; (2) examples of how ST operates on this hierarchy to attend to motion and to localize and label motion patterns; and (3) a new solution to the feature binding problem sufficient for grouping motion features into coherent object motion. Binding is accomplished using a top-down selection mechanism that does not depend on a single location-based saliency representation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent studies in behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry reveal the importance of epigenetic mechanisms of transmission that center on the developmental consequences of variations in parental care. Studies with rats suggest that environmental adversity results in patterns of parent-offspring interactions that increase stress reactivity through sustained effects on gene expression in brain regions known to regulate behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses to stress. While such effects might be adaptive, the associated cost involves an increased risk for stress-related illness.

J	Girard, F				Girard, Francois			Managing head injured patients	CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						cerebral ischemia; cerebral perfusion pressure; clinical trials; hyperoxia; outcome; secondary brain injury; traumatic brain injury		Purpose of review In this article we aim to review the recent literature concerning the management of traumatic brain injury patients, summarize the main findings, and discuss the impact of these findings on clinical practice. Recent findings Several authors have focused on the development of more reliable and informative tools to predict outcome in traumatic brain injury as well as refining the definition of cerebral ischemia in last year's literature. The validity of the current cerebral perfusion pressure management guidelines has also come under scrutiny. It appears that a one size fits all therapy is not a suitable approach for traumatic brain injury patients. An individualized approach, depending on the integrity of pressure autoregulation mechanisms, would be more advisable. Clinical trials investigating brain protective treatments in head injured patients have been disappointing so far. Increasing the homogeneity of patients entering brain protective studies might be an answer. Finally, the use of hyperoxia as well as factors contributing to secondary brain injury such as the occurrence of hyperthermia, with or without an infectious process, have been assessed in head injury patients. Summary The key term for the management of traumatic brain injury patients in the early twenty-first century will clearly be 'individualized therapy'. The search of an ideal cerebral perfusion pressure target that would fit every head-injured patients is a utopia. More energy should be focused on the development of reliable tools for outcome prediction and outcome assessment for traumatic brain injured patients. That, and a better targeting of patients entering brain protective trials, should increase the likelihood of demonstrating a significant salvaging effect of a particular treatment in humans.

It usually manifests clinically as nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia with or without mental retardation.* We further characterize a syndrome of autosomal recessive cerebellar hypoplasia in the Hutterite population, referred to as dysequilibrium syndrome (DES). We reviewed 12 patients (eight females, four males; age range 4 to 33y) with this syndrome. Patients were examined and underwent a standard set of investigations to characterize better the clinical features, natural history, and neuroimaging of this syndrome. DES is an autosomal recessive disorder with distinct clinical features including global developmental delay, late ambulation (after age 6y), truncal ataxia, and a static clinical course. Neuroimaging is characterized by hypoplasia of the inferior portion of the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, and mild simplification of cortical gyri.

The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is coexpressed with Trk receptors in long-range projection neurons, in which it facilitates neurotrophin binding to Trk and enhances Trk activity. Here, we show that TrkA and TrkB receptors undergo robust ligand-dependent ubiquitination that is dependent on activation of the endogenous Trk activity of the receptors. Coexpression of p75NTR attenuated ubiquitination of TrkA and TrkB and delayed nerve growth factor-induced TrkA receptor internalization and receptor degradation. These results indicate that p75NTR may prolong cell-surface Trk-dependent signalling events by negatively regulating receptor ubiquitination.

In this study, we used in vitro intracellular recording and staining to describe the basic membrane properties and morphology of nPontc neurones and to further explore interactions with adjacent structures, using coronal sections of the brainstem of 78 rats, aged 9-28 days. Neurones were large, with dendrites that spread in all directions, and about 64% fired tonically even in the absence of synaptic inputs. Tonic neurones were predominant in the centre of the nucleus. Electrical stimulation of all regions of the nPontc produced mixed excitatory and inhibitory effects on interneurones of lateral tegmental nuclei. Focal inactivation of the dorsal nPontc with injections of tetrodotoxin also had mixed effects on the spontaneous firing of both interneurones and motoneurones but similar injections in the ventral nPontc produced mostly increases of firing. Sixty-five percent of nPontc neurones received synaptic inputs from the lateral tegmental areas and most of these (68%) were excitatory and mediated by glutamatergic receptors. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were mediated by GABA(A) or glycinergic receptors. Although most responses occurred at relatively long latencies (> 2 ms), they could follow relatively high-frequency stimulation (> 50 Hz). Excitatory and inhibitory connections between ipsi- and contralateral nPontc neurones were also documented, which could contribute to bilateral coordination of jaw movements. This study provides evidence that the nPontc exerts both tonic and phasic influences on the premotor components of the masticatory central pattern generator.

Using such a model, we report electrophysiological and morphological evidence of alterations in somatosensory synaptic function. In arthritic rats, the baseline activity of dorsal spinal cord wide dynamic range or nociceptive-specific neurons was greater than in control animals. Moreover, neuronal responses elicited by an innocuous stimulation with von Frey filaments applied to the arthritic joint were greater in amplitude and produced the afterdischarge that normally characterizes a nociceptive response. In contrast to the response in control animals, passive movement of the arthritic joint produced an increase in the amplitude of the response of these neurons to iontophoretic application of glutamate receptor agonists over a time frame of 10-30 min. This potentiation was blocked by pretreatment with a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist, suggesting the involvement of substance P. Ultrastructural analysis of the dorsal horn revealed that movement of the arthritic joint also induced NK-1 receptor internalization, indicative of nociception. Morphological examination revealed significantly increased expression of substance P and its receptor within the superficial dorsal horn of monoarthritic animals. These unique functional and chemical changes reflect alterations in both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in nociceptive transmission at the spinal level. Thus, although treatment of arthritis should obviously target its peripheral aetiology, targeting its central components is a logical therapeutic complementary objective.

Methods: Six right-handed healthy male volunteers (34.3 +/- 10.9 years) with a negative family history for psychiatric disorders were scanned twice in the resting condition, 22 +/- 17 days apart. An unbiased semiautomatic segmentation of the brain was used to define VOIs. The trapping constant K* (ml g(-1) min(-1)) for a[C-11] MT was calculated for the whole brain and seven brain regions using the graphical method for irreversible tracers. In addition, parametric maps of K* were obtained from dynamic scans using the same method. Comparison of test and retest K* functional images was performed using SPM99. Student's paired t statistic was applied for comparisons of a[C-11] MT brain trapping in a priori selected VOIs. Results: a[C-11] MT brain trapping in VOIs showed a mean variability 2.6 +/- 1.8% (0.3 - 5%) for absolute and 1.5 +/- 2.1% (1.4 - 4.1%) for normalized K*. Intraclass correlations between test and retest conditions were 0.61 +/- 0.34 for absolute K* values and 0.73 +/- 0.20 for K* values normalized by global mean. SPM99 analysis using a height threshold of p= 0.05 ( two tailed) and an extent threshold of 100 voxels showed no significant differences between scans. Conclusion: Rest measurements in healthy male volunteers of the trapping constant for a[C-11] MT, using PET, appeared to be stable during an average interval of 3 weeks.

J	Gill, KJ; Boyle, AE				Gill, KJ; Boyle, AE			Genetic basis for the psychostimulant effects of nicotine a quantitative trait locus analysis in AcB/BcA recombinant congenic mice	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						A/J; AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains; C57BL/6J; inbred strains; locomotor activity; nicotine; quantitative trait loci; RCS	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; STRAINS; RECEPTOR; SMOKING; SENSITIVITY; DOPAMINE; MOUSE; BRAIN; DRUGS; ABUSE	Genetic differences in sensitivity to nicotine have been reported in both animals and humans. The present study utilized a novel methodology to map genes involved in regulating both the psychostimulant and depressant effects of nicotine in the AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains (RCS) of mice. Locomotor activity was measured in a computerized open-field apparatus following subcutaneous administration of saline (days 1 and 2) or nicotine on day 3. The phenotypic measures obtained from this experimental design included total basal locomotor activity, as well as total nicotine activity, nicotine difference scores, nicotine percent change and nicotine regression residual scores. The results indicated that the C57BL/6J (136) were insensitive to nicotine over the entire dose-response curve (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg). However, the 0.8-mg/kg dose of nicotine produced a significant decrease in the locomotor activity in the A/J strain and a wide and continuous range of both locomotor excitation and depression among the AcB/BcA RCS. Single-locus association analysis in the AcB RCS identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the psychostimulant effects of nicotine on chromosomes 11, 12, 13, 14 and 17 and one OTL for nicotine-induced depression on chromosome 11. In the BcA RCS, nicotine-induced locomotor activation was associated with seven putative regions on chromosomes 2, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16 and 17. There were no overlapping OTL and no genetic correlations between saline- and nicotine-related phenotypes in the AcB/BcA RCS. A number of putative candidate genes were in proximity to regions identified with nicotine sensitivity, including the alpha 2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the dopamine D3 receptor.

J	Koerich, AL; Sabourin, R; Suen, CY				Koerich, AL; Sabourin, R; Suen, CY			Recognition and verification of unconstrained handwritten words	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						word hypothesis rejection; classifier combination; large vocabulary; handwriting recognition; neural networks	CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; FUSION	This paper presents a novel approach for the verification of the word hypotheses generated by a large vocabulary, offline handwritten word recognition system. Given a word image, the recognition system produces a ranked list of the N-best recognition hypotheses consisting of text transcripts, segmentation boundaries of the word hypotheses into characters, and recognition scores. The verification consists of an estimation of the probability of each segment representing a known class of character. Then, character probabilities are combined to produce word confidence scores which are further integrated with the recognition scores produced by the recognition system. The N-best recognition hypothesis list is reranked based on such composite scores. In the end, rejection rules are invoked to either accept the best recognition hypothesis of such a list or to reject the input word image. The use of the verification approach has improved the word recognition rate as well as the reliability of the recognition system, while not causing significant delays in the recognition process. Our approach is described in detail and the experimental results on a large database of unconstrained handwritten words extracted from postal envelopes are presented.

We retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and clinical data on prospectively collected consecutive patients treated by embolization from 1994 to 2004. The general philosophy was to attempt treatment by a combination of approaches only when an angiographic cure was likely or at least possible. The clinical outcome was assessed according to the modified Rankin scale. Although 404 patients were collected, complete files and follow-lips are available for 227 or 56% only. Most patients presented with hemorrhages (53%) or seizures (23%). The final management consisted in embolization alone in 34%, embolization followed by surgery in 47%, embolization and radiotherapy in 16%, and embolization, surgery and radiotherapy in 3% of patients. The embolization procedure itself could lead to an angiographic cure in only 16% of patients. When the management strategy could be completed, the cure rate increased to 66%. Complications of embolization occurred in 22.6% of patients. Overall clinical outcome was excellent (Rankin 0) in 43%, good (Rankin 1) in 38%, fair (Rankin 2) in 10%, poor (Rankin 3-5) in 2%, and the death rate was 7%. A combined strategy initially designed to provide angiographic cures cannot be completed in a significant number of patients; the total morbidity of treatment remains significant. There is no scientific evidence that cerebral arteriovenous malformations should be treated, and no clinical trial to prove that one approach is better than the other. Various treatment protocols have been proposed on empirical grounds. Small lesions can often be eradicated, with surgery when lesions are superficial, or with radiation therapy for deeper ones. There has been little controversy regarding therapeutic indications in these patients'. The management of larger AVMs, sometimes in more eloquent locations, is much more difficult and controversial(2-4). Endovascular approaches have initially been developed to meet this challenge(5-6). It became quickly evident that embolization alone would rarely suffice to completely cure these lesions. The philosophy behind combined approaches is founded oil 2 opinions: 1) There is no proven value of partial embolization, not even "'partial benefits", and treatment should aim at an angiographic cure 7 and 2) By appropriately tailoring all available tools to each situation, such a cure could be reached with minimum or reasonable risks. We have used such a combined strategy for more than a decade now Endovascular techniques and materials have evolved, and it is perhaps possible today to reach a cure by embolization alone in a larger proportion of patients than before(8). Aggressive embolizations, aiming for an endovascular cure, even sometimes in large lesions, have recently been promoted for their power or criticized for their risks'. But before evaluating the advantages and inconveniences of new treatments, it may be wise to review the results we could achieve with a conventional approach combining endovascular, surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques.

Evidence for a defect in representing diagnostic facial information following brain damage	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							UNFAMILIAR FACES; FEATURE DISPLACEMENT; TEMPORAL CORTEX; INVERTED FACES; RECOGNITION; FEATURES; PERCEPTION; FAMILIAR; DISCRIMINATION; SENSITIVITY	One of the most impressive disorders following brain damage to the ventral occipitotemporal cortex is prosopagnosia, or the inability to recognize faces. Although acquired prosopagnosia with preserved general visual and memory functions is rate, several cases have been described in the neuropsychological literature and Studied at the functional and neural level over the last decades. Here we tested a brain-damaged patient (PS) presenting a deficit restricted to the category of faces to clarify the nature of the missing and preserved components of the face processing system when it is selectively damaged. Following learning to identify 10 neutral and happy faces through extensive training, we investigated patient PS's recognition of faces using Bubbles, a response classification technique that sampled facial information across the faces in different bandwidths of spatial frequencies [Gosselin, F., & Schyns, P. E., Bubbles: A technique to reveal the use of information in recognition tasks. Vision Research, 41, 2261-2271, 2001]. Although PS gradually used less information (i.e., the number of bubbles) to identify faces over testing, the total information required was Much larger than for normal controls and decreased less steeply With practice. Most importantly, the facial information used to identify individual faces differed between PS and controls. Specifically, in marked contrast to controls, PS did not use the optimal eye information to identify familiar faces, but instead the lower part of the face, including the mouth and the external contours, as normal observers typically do when processing unfamiliar faces. Together, the findings reported here suggest that damage to the face processing system is characterized by an inability to use the information that is optimal to judge identity, focusing instead on suboptimal information.

J	Hawkes, C; Jhamandas, JH; Kar, S				Hawkes, C; Jhamandas, JH; Kar, S			Selective loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons by 192 IgG-saporin is associated with decreased phosphorylation of Ser(9) glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Akt kinase; cell death; cholinergic markers; immunolesion; lithium chloride; tau phosphorylation	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TAU PHOSPHORYLATION; MOOD STABILIZERS; TRANSGENIC MICE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ANIMAL-MODELS; KINASE 3-BETA; CELL-SURVIVAL; LITHIUM; BETA	Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in a variety of biological events including development, glucose metabolism and cell death. Its activity is inhibited by phosphorylation of the Ser(9) residue and up-regulated by Tyr(216) phosphorylation. Activated GSK-3 beta increases phosphorylation of tau protein and induces cell death in a variety of cultured neurons, whereas phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase-dependent protein kinase B (Akt), which inhibits GSK-3 beta activity, is one of the best characterized cell survival signaling pathways. In the present study, the cholinergic immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin was used to address the potential role of GSK-3 beta in the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which are preferentially vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. GSK-3 beta co-localized with a subset of forebrain cholinergic neurons and loss of these neurons was accompanied by a transient decrease in PI-3 kinase, phospho-Ser(473)Akt and phospho-Ser(9)GSK-3 beta levels, as well as an increase in phospho-tau levels, in the basal forebrain and hippocampus. Total Akt, GSK-3 beta, tau and phospho-Tyr(216)GSK-3 beta levels were not significantly altered in these brain regions in animals treated with 192 IgG-saporin. Systemic administration of the GSK-3 beta inhibitor LiCl did not significantly affect cholinergic marker or phospho-Ser(9)GSK-3 beta levels in control rats but did preclude 192-IgG saporin-induced alterations in PI-3 kinase/phospho-Akt, phospho-Ser(9)GSK-3 beta and phospho-tau levels, and also partly protected cholinergic neurons against the immunotoxin. These results provide the first evidence that increased GSK-3 beta activity, via decreased Ser(9) phosphorylation, can mediate, at least in part, 192-IgG saporin-induced in vivo degeneration of forebrain cholinergic neurons by enhancing tau phosphorylation. The partial protection of these neurons following inhibition of GSK-3 beta kinase activity suggests a possible therapeutic role for GSK-3 beta inhibitors in attenuating the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons observed in AD.

The isometric forces increased in monotonic fashion in the direction of the force target. The forces exerted against the handle in the movement task were more complex, including an initial accelerating force in the direction of movement followed by a transient decelerating force opposite to the direction of movement as the hand approached the target. EMG activity of proximal- arm muscles reflected the difference in task dynamics, showing directional ramplike activity changes in the isometric task and reciprocally tuned " triphasic" patterns in the movement task. The apparent instantaneous directionality of muscle activity, when expressed in hand- centered spatial coordinates, remained relatively stable during the isometric ramps but often showed a large transient shift during deceleration of the arm movements. Single- neuron and population-level activity in M1 showed similar task- dependent changes in temporal pattern and instantaneous directionality. The momentary dissociation of the directionality of neuronal discharge and movement kinematics during deceleration indicated that the activity of many arm- related M1 neurons is not coupled only to the direction and speed of hand motion. These results also demonstrate that population- level signals reflecting the dynamics of motor tasks and of interactions with objects in the environment are available in caudal M1. This task-dynamics signal could greatly enhance the performance capabilities of neuroprosthetic controllers.

Outcome measures included an 11-point numerical rating scale for pain intensity (NRS-PI), a 5-point satisfaction scale, blood chemistry screen, drug and metabolite levels, urinalyses, electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical examination. Adverse events were monitored. Twenty-one subjects completed the trial. At 6 months, subjects reported an average long-term reduction in pain of 34% (standard deviation [So] = 37%); 5 subjects (25%) achieved 50% or greater reduction in pain and 1 subject (5%) achieved 100% reduction in pain. At 12 months, the average reduction in pain was 37% (SD = 40%); 7 subjects (40%) achieved 50% or greater pain reduction. At the end of the study, 89% of subjects rated their satisfaction as 3/5 or greater and 2 subjects (10%) were pain free. Minimal adverse events were reported and there were no serious medication related adverse events. Blood levels revealed minimal systemic absorption. in conclusion, topical 2% amitriptyline/1% ketamine cream was associated with long-term reduction (6-12 months) in perceived pain, moderate to complete satisfaction, and was well tolerated in treatment of neuropathic pain. There was no significant systemic absorption of amitriptyline or ketamine. Perspective: This study demonstrates that topical 2% amitriptyline/1% ketamine, given over 6-12 months, is associated with long-term perceived analgesic effectiveness in treatment of neuropathic pain. Antidepressants and ketamine both produce multiple pharmacologic effects that may contribute to peripheral analgesia; such actions include block of peripheral N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, local anesthetic properties, and interactions with adenosine systems.

Selective agonists and antagonists have recently been developed allowing for detailed functional studies as to the pathophysiological role of a given subtype as well as receptor binding characteristics and distribution. To precisely investigate the discrete localization and ligand selectivity profile of Y-4 and Y-5 receptors, a series of selective molecules were used as radioligands and competitors in rat brain tissues. Binding data revealed that Y-4 and Y-5 receptor-related agonists and antagonists competed with high affinity for specific I-125-[Leu(31), Pro(34)]human peptide YY (hPYY) binding in the presence of BIBO3304 [(R)-N-[[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-phenyl]methyl]-N-2-(diphenylacetyl)-argininamide trifluoroacetate] to mask Y-1 sites as well as specific I-125-labeled human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP) binding. Competition binding profiles were best fitted to a two-site model for both radioligands, suggesting the likely recognition of the Y-4 and Y-5 subtypes. We were surprised to find that the visualization of these specific binding sites by receptor autoradiography clearly revealed the distinct distribution of specific I-125-[Leu(31), Pro(34)]hPYY (in presence of Y-1 and Y-5 blockers) and I-125-hPP (in presence of Y-5 blocker) binding sites. Moreover, significant amounts of specific I-125-hPP binding were observed in the medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, and various brainstem nuclei, even after masking Y-4 and Y-5 receptors. Similar results were obtained using I-125-hPYY(3-36) in presence of Y-2 and Y-5 blockers. These results suggest the possible existence of at least one additional subtype of NPY receptor sites in the rat brain, with enrichment seen in midbrain and brainstem areas involved in the regulation of food intake and cardiorespiratory parameters.

Using the model of the isolated rat tail artery, we show that the vasoactive mediator 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), via the 5-HT2A metabotropic receptor, regulates the desensitization kinetics of P2X1 responses by increasing their rate of recovery. Reconstituting the potentiation of P2X1 ATP-gated currents by 5-HT2A receptors in the Xenopus oocyte expression system, we provide evidence that this modulation depends on the activation of novel protein kinase C isoforms and protein kinase D (also named PKC mu) downstream of phospholipase C beta. Other major kinases like Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II, protein kinase A, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and tyrosine kinases were found not to be involved. Moreover, we report that buffering intracellular Ca2+ ions with the chelator 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) decreases the rate of recovery of P2X1 responses and increases their sensitivity to potentiation by 5-HT2A receptors or by the diacylglycerol analog phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate. We conclude that intracellular Ca2+ and a subset of diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinases regulate the activity of P2X1 receptor channels by modulating their recovery from desensitization.

It is clinically useful to distinguish two types of hereditary NDI: A "pure" type characterized by loss of water only and a complex type characterized by loss of water and ions. Patients who have congenital NDI and bear mutations in the AVPR2 or AQP2 genes have a "pure" NDI phenotype with loss of water but normal conservation of sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. Patients who bear inactivating mutations in genes (SLC12A1, KCNJ1, CLCNKB, CLCNKA and CLCNKB in combination, or BSND) that encode the membrane proteins of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle have a complex polyuro-polydipsic syndrome with loss of water, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These advances provide diagnostic and clinical tools for physicians who care for these patients.

Relatively few studies have looked at the statistical relationships between the modeled responses to natural scenes of the luminance (LUM), red-green (RG), and blue-yellow (BY) postreceptoral channels of the primate visual system. Here we consider the correlations among these channel responses in terms of pixel, first-order, and second-order information. First-order linear filtering was implemented by convolving the cosine-windowed images with oriented Gabor functions, whose gains were scaled to give equal amplitude response across spatial frequency to random fractal images. Second-order filtering was implemented via a filter-rectify-filter cascade, with Gabor functions for both first- and second-stage filters. Both signed and unsigned filter responses were obtained across a range of filter parameters (spatial frequency, 2-64 cycles/image; orientation, 0-135 degrees). The filter responses to the LUM channel images were larger than those for either RG or BY channel images. Cross correlations between the first-order channel responses and between the first- and second-order channel responses were measured. Results showed that the unsigned correlations between first-order channel responses were higher than expected on the basis of previous studies and that first-order channel responses were highly correlated with LUM, but not with RG or BY, second-order responses. These findings imply that course-scale color information correlates well with course-scale changes of fine-scale texture. (D 2005 Optical Society of America.

J	Abdel-Karim, AM; Barthlow, HG; Bialecki, RA; Elhilali, MM				Abdel-Karim, AM; Barthlow, HG; Bialecki, RA; Elhilali, MM			Effects of M274773 a neurokinin-2 receptor antagonist, on bladder function in chronically spinalized rats	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						bladder; spinal cord injuries; receptors; tachykinin; rats; Sprague-Dawley; urodynamics	DETRUSOR HYPERREFLEXIA; TACHYKININ RECEPTORS; CONSCIOUS RATS; CORD-INJURY; CAPSAICIN; INVOLVEMENT; MICTURITION; AFFERENTS; TRACT	Purpose: Increased afferent nerve activity may have an important role in the pathogenesis of neurogenic detrusor overactivity. We tested the efficacy of the neuokinin-2 receptor antagonist M274773 ((S)-N-[2-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-4-[4-(2-oxoperhydro-pyrimidin-1-yl) piperidinolbutyl]-N-methylbenzamide dihydrochloride) on neurogenic detrusor overactivity after spinal cord injury in rats. Materials and Methods: Included in this study were 48 adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Six animals served as normal controls, while 32 underwent spinal cord transection at the 10th thoracic vertebra. Two weeks after spinal cord injury 6 animals underwent filling cystometrography to confirm neurogenic detrusor overactivity, while another 12 served as paraplegic controls. The remaining 24 paraplegic animals were used to test the drug and they were divided into 2 equal groups of 12. Group 1 received the drug at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg daily, while group 2 received a dose of 0.6 mg/kg daily. Each paraplegic control and treatment group was further subdivided into 2 subgroups of 6 rats each. In subgroup 1 filling cystometrography was done 3 weeks after spinal cord injury, while in subgroup 2 it was done 4 weeks after spinal cord injury. Results: Three weeks after spinal cord injury neurogenic detrusor overactivity developed in all paraplegic control animals with a mean bladder capacity +/- SD of 0.7 +/- 0.2 ml and a mean voiding pressure of 59 +/- 14.2 cm H2O. Neurogenic detrusor overactivity resolved in 50% and 83% of the animals that received M274773 for 1 week at doses of 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg daily, respectively. Mean cystometric bladder capacity was 1.2 +/- 0.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.4 ml and mean voiding pressure was 46.1 +/- 10.8 vs 40 +/- 9.9 cm H2O in animals that received 0.3 vs 0.6 mg/kg daily, respectively. The drug produced better urodynamic results when given for 2 weeks rather than 1 week. Conclusions: M274773 is effective for neurogenic detrusor overactivity after spinal cord injury in the rat. It may provide an alternative clinical treatment option for neurogenic detrusor overactivity and urgency/frequency syndrome. This new neurokinin-2 selective antagonist has time and dose response effects, which further suggests the potential for clinical application.

In mice, SSCs are quiescent at birth but actively proliferate during the first postnatal week, while they rarely divide in adult, suggesting an age-dependent difference in SSC characteristics. As an approach to evaluate this possibility, we studied the expression pattern of cell-surface molecules on neonatal, pup, and adult mouse SSCs. Using immunomagnetic cell sorting, testis cells were selected for the expression Of alpha(6) integrin, alpha(v) integrin, c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (Kit), or a binding subunit of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor, GFR alpha 1. Selected cells were assayed for their stem cell activity using spermatogonial transplantation. The results showed that SSCs expressed alpha(6) integrin, but not alpha(v) integrin and Kit, regardless of age. The SSC activity in pup GFR alpha 1(+) cells was higher than that in adult and neonatal cells, indicating that the expression pattern of GFR alpha 1 varied age-dependently. To evaluate if SSCs show an age-dependent difference in their response to GDNF, we cultured highly enriched pup and adult SSCs with GDNF: we could not observe such an age-dependent difference in vitro. In addition, we failed to immunologically detect the expression of two types of GDNF receptor signaling subunits on SSCs. These results indicate that SSCs may change the expression patterns of cell-surface molecules during postnatal development, and suggest that GDNF receptor molecules may not be abundantly or specifically expressed in the in vivo population of mouse SSCs.

Despite his deficit, F.G. obtained normal scores on neuropsychological tests of executive functions, language, praxis and primary visuoperceptual skills. Brain MRI showed atrophy predominantly in the right temporal lobe, particularly in the fusiform gyrus and the parahippocampal cortex. The present study investigated F.G.'s ability to orient himself in familiar and new environments. His wayfinding abilities in a familiar environment (i.e., his hometown) were preserved despite an inability to recognize familiar and famous buildings, Monuments and landmarks in this environment. Wayfinding was achieved through a heavy reliance on written indications (e.g., names of restaurants and streets), preservation of a pre-existing cognitive map of this familiar environment, and normal executive functions necessary to plan the execution of a given trajectory. In an unfamiliar environment, F.G.'s topographical agnosia resulted in severe wayfinding difficulties and in the inability to build an adequate cognitive spatial representation. F.G.'s topographical agnosia results from a high-level visuoperceptual deficit, characterized by an inability to access a global configuration of complex Visual stimuli such as familiar and famous monuments, and an over-reliance on the processing of local features.

Primary neurons were incubated with [1-C-13]glucose in the absence or presence of glutamine (2 mM) and/or NH4Cl (5 mM). After ammonia-treatment, the concentrations of high-energy phosphates decreased up to 84% of control, which was aggravated in glutamine-containing medium (up to 42% of control). These effects could not be attributed to changes in mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Withdrawal of glutamine decreased amino acid concentrations, e.g. of glutamate to 53%, but also considerably lessened the C-13 enrichment in [4-C-13]glutamate to 8.3% of control, and decreased the C-13-enrichment in acetyl-CoA entering the Krebs cycle (P < 0.001). Thus, although glutamine is potent in replenishing neuronal glutamate stores, glutamate formation is mainly attributed to its de novo synthesis from glucose. Furthermore, mitochondrial glucose metabolism strongly depends on the supply of carbons from glutamine, indicating that exogenous glutamine is a well-suited substrate to replenish neuronal Krebs cycle intermediates.

We introduce a novel speed function for surface evolution that is derived from either diffusion tensor (DT) data, high angular resolution diffusion (HARD) data, or a combined DT-HARD hybrid approach. We use the model-free q-ball imaging (QBI) approach for HARD reconstruction. The anisotropic diffusion phantom allows us to compare and evaluate the performance of different fiber tracking approaches in the presence of real imaging artifacts, noise, and subvoxel partial volume averaging of fiber directions. The surface evolution approach, using the full diffusion tensor as opposed to the principal diffusion direction (PDD) only, is compared to PDD-based line propagation fiber tracking. Additionally, DT reconstruction is compared to HARD reconstruction for fiber tracking, both using surface evolution. We show the potential for surface evolution using the full diffusion tensor to map connections in regions of subvoxel partial volume averaging of fiber directions, which can be difficult to map with PDD-based methods. We then show that the fiber tracking results can be improved by using high angular resolution reconstruction of the diffusion orientation distribution function in cases where the diffusion tensor model fits the data poorly.

Since its first application in 1967, numerous case series indicate that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective treatment for the management of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). However, only one randomized controlled trial has demonstrated that SCS provides more effective pain relief than re-operation and conventional medical management. The PROCESS randomized, controlled, multicenter trial aims to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SCS when added to conventional medical management compared to conventional medical management alone in patients with FBSS. Methods/Design. A total of 100 FBSS patients with predominantly neuropathic leg pain will be recruited from 12 centers and randomized to receive either conventional medical management alone or in combination with SCS for a period of 24 months. Patients will be evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. At the 6-month visit, patients will be classified as successful (>= 50% pain relief in the legs) or unsuccessful (< 50% pain relief in the legs). If the results of the randomized treatment are unsuccessful, patients can cross over to the alternative treatment arm. Discussion. This paper highlights the rationale, design, methods, and challenges of an ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that has been undertaken to obtain conclusive evidence of the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an SCS system in patients with FBSS.

This procedure, based on a fast registration algorithm and a tailored pulse sequence, is used to reposition single voxels for H-1 MRS data acquired in vivo. The impact of the repositioning method on the extent of voxel overlap and on the reproducibility of metabolite concentration measurements is studied. A statistically significant increase in voxel overlap and generally decreased short-term measurement variability (decreased coefficients of variation and increased reproducibility coefficients) are observed. Differences in the long-term variances of metabolite concentrations and concentration ratios measured using the eye and automatic repositioning scheme, however, do not reach statistical significance. The improved workflow associated with the use of the automatic repositioning process, which obviates the need for skilled operator intervention for voxel repositioning, suggests that approaches similar to the one presented here may be a standard element in tomorrow's longitudinal MRI and MRS exams.

Review revealed 60 children with cryptogenic epilepsy: 32 (53.3%) males, 11 (18.3%) prior febrile seizure, 9 (15.0%) developmental delay at onset, and 38 (63.3%) placement in regular classes. Twenty-two (35.7%) had generalized seizures. Mean follow-up after initiating antiepileptic medication was 53 months (range 24-128 months). Four (6.7%) were intractable; 4 (6.7%) had very poor outcomes; 8 (13.3%) had poor outcomes; 44 (73.3%) were well controlled. Sixteen (26.7%) and 31 (51.7%) had seizure recurrence within the last 12 and 24 months, respectively. Twenty-nine (48.3%) were seizure-free for at least 24 months. Factors associated with a poor outcome include seizure recurrence in the 6- to 12-month interval after therapy initiation (P = 0.006) and developmental delay at onset (P = 0.023). This case series suggests that children with cryptogenic epilepsy tend to have a favorable outcome. Seizure recurrence in the first months after therapy initiation and developmental delay apparent at onset are predictive of poor outcome. (c) 2005 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, it remains largely underdiagnosed and its underlying pathogenesis is presently unknown. Women are more affected than men and early-onset disease is associated with familial cases. A genetic origin has been suggested but the mode of inheritance is unknown. Secondary causes of RLS may share a common underlying pathophysiology implicating iron deficiency or misuse. The excellent response to dopaminegic drugs points to a central role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of RLS. Iron may also represent a primary factor in the development of RLS, as suggested by recent pathological and brain imaging studies. However, the way dopamine andiron, and probably other compounds, interact to generate the circadian pattern in the occurrence of RLS and PLM symptoms remains unknown. The same is also the case for the level of interaction of the two compounds within the central nervous system (CNS). Recent electrophysiological and animals studies suggest that complex spinal mechanisms are involved in the generation of RLS and PLM symptomatology. Dopamine modulation of spinal reflexes through dopamine D3 receptors was recently highlighted in animal models. The present review suggests that RLS is a complex disorder that may result from a complex dysfunction of interacting neuronal networks at one or several levels of the CNS and involving numerous neurotransmitter systems.

Clearly, the relevance of these experimental findings would be strengthened by the demonstration that similar fundamental mechanisms are at work in the human epileptic brain. Epilepsy surgery has indeed opened the possibility to directly study the functional properties of human brain tissue in vitro, and to analyze the mechanisms underlying seizures and epileptogenesis. Here, we summarize the findings obtained over the last 40 years from electrophysiological, histochemical and molecular experiments made with the human brain tissue. In particular, this review will focus on (i) the synaptic and nonsynaptic properties of neocortical neurons along with their ability to Produce synchronous activity; (ii) the anatomical and functional alterations that characterize limbic structures in patients presenting with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; (iii) the issue of antiepileptic drug action and resistance; and (iv) the pathophysiology of seizure genesis in Taylor's type focal cortical dysplasia. Finally, we will address some of the problems that are inherent to this type of experimental approach, in particular the lack of proper controls and possible strategies to obviate this limitation.

Objectives: The aims of this study were to (1) describe behavioral and corticosterone elevations that occur in aggressive mice conditioned to respond for the opportunity to fight another mouse, (2) determine if corticosterone elevations are necessary for operant responding and escalated aggression, and (3) determine if corticosterone elevations alter the aggression-heightening effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor positive modulators. Methods and results: Aggressive male CFW mice were conditioned to respond under the control of a fixed-interval 10-min (FI10) schedule that reinforced their operant behavior by the presentation of an intruder mouse into their home cage. After the FI10, aggressive behavior was ca. 75% higher than the species-typical levels of fighting and plasma corticosterone was more than twice as high after briefly fighting and/or responding on the FI10 schedule. Inhibition of corticosterone synthesis by metyrapone (30-100 mg/kg) reduced both conditioned responding as well as the aggressive behavior after the FI. Although the benzodiazepine midazolam (0.3 - 3 mg/kg) heightened species-typical aggressive behavior, it did not increase the high level of aggression engendered by the FI schedule. However, midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) and the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (17 mg/kg) both heightened aggression when given after corticosterone synthesis inhibition by metyrapone (56 mg/kg). Conclusions: These data suggest that corticosterone elevations are required for responding that is motivated by aggressive behavior and for escalated aggression that follows this responding. Corticosterone elevations also appear to inhibit the aggression heightening effect of GABA(A) receptor positive modulators.

Methods: One hundred ten LCA patients were screened for various probable disease-causing gene sequence variations. Those patients with a probable disease-causing sequence variation in one of six genotypes were recalled for a follow-up examination. Evaluations included assessment of visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and dilated fundus examination. When possible, Goldmann perimetry was also performed. Results: Of the 37 LCA patients with suspected disease-causing sequence variations, 7 had an AIPL1 variation, 8, a CRB1 variation, 2, a CRX variation, 4, a GUCY2D variation, 11, an RPE65 variation, and 5, an RPGRIP1 variation. Across the 6 genotypes, we observed a wide range of visual acuities from 20/40 to no light perception. The widest range of vision was noted for patients with a CRB1 or RPE65 variation. Younger patients with an AIPL1 or RPGRIP1 variation were found to have severely reduced vision. Drusen-like deposits were more selectively observed in patients with mutations in the AIPL1, CRB1, RPE65, and RPGRIP1 genes, whereas focal regions of peripheral chorioretinal atrophy were observed only in patients with AIPL1 or RPE65 variations. Neurologic, intellectual, or psychomotor developmental delay was noted in 8.1% of our cohort. Conclusions: There was considerable overlap of phenotypic expression in six genetic subtypes in our LCA cohort. However, phenotypic trends were noted in our patients' visual acuities and posterior segment findings within genotypes. These findings have practical value for genetic screening strategies for LCA patients based upon phenotype as well as for counseling patients on their visual prognosis.

The authors applied a new MRI visual rating scale to assess WMH within cholinergic pathways in patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic microvascular disease. Methods - Subjects included 60 AD patients with and without WMH, matched for age, as well as 15 control subjects. A visual rating scale was developed based on published immunohistochemical tracings of the cholinergic pathways in humans. On 4 selected axial images, the severity of WMH in the cholinergic pathways was rated on a 3-point scale for ten regions, identified with major anatomical landmarks. A published, consensus-derived, general WMH scale was also applied. All subjects underwent standardized neuropsychological testing. Results - The Cholinergic Pathways HyperIntensities Scale showed reliability and was validated with volumetry of strategic WMH. After accounting for age and education in a multiple linear regression model, The Cholinergic Pathways HyperIntensities Scale ratings were associated with impaired performance on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (r=0.40; P=0.02) and accounted for 12% of the variance (corrected r(2)). A similar model was not significant for general WMH scores. Conclusions - The new MRI rating scale for WMH in cholinergic pathways is reliable and shows stronger correlations with cognitive performance than a general WMH rating scale in AD with WMH. This new rating scale provides indirect evidence that localization of WMH within neurotransmitter systems may contribute to cognitive decline.

The standard treatment of these patients continues to include whole brain radiation. An unavoidable toxicity of this treatment is acute iatrogenic alopecia. This alopecia is a significant cause of patient distress. Our purpose was to quantify the sparing of the hair bearing skin that could be achieved by using a complex hair-sparing approach. To achieve this goal, we treat an anthropomorphic phantom with both conventional and inverse-planned intensity-modulated portals. The skin dose was evaluated through dose-volume histograms and thermo-luminescent dosimetry. The median calculated dose was reduced by 38%. The average measured dose at five surface points was reduced by 53% - from 95% of the prescription dose with the conventional plan, to 44%, with the IMRT plan. This sparing was achieved while maintaining adequate target coverage. Because of the low radiation tolerance of the hair follicle, this dose reduction is not expected, on its own, to eliminate radiation alopecia but bears promise in combination with other toxicity-sparing strategies.

The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands. It is found in the subcutaneous tissue of the face, overlying the mandibular ramus and anterior and inferior to the external ear. The classification system is based on a multifeature tissue characterization approach, using fuzzy inference systems as higher-order classifiers. Baseband ultrasonic echo data were acquired during conventional ultrasound imaging examinations using standard ultrasound equipment. Several tissue-describing parameters were calculated within numerous small regions of interest to evaluate spectral and textural tissue properties. The parameters were processed by an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, using the results of conventional histology after parotidectomy as the "gold standard." The results of the classification are presented as a numerical score indicating the probability of a certain tumor or alteration for each parotid gland. The score can be presented to the physician during examination of the patient to improve the differentiation between various types of parotid gland tumors. The system was evaluated on n = 23 cases of patients undergoing radical parotidectomy. The receiver operating characteristic curve area is A(ROC) = 0.95 +/- 0.07 when using fourfold cross-validation over cases and differentiating between various benign parotid gland tumors and monomorphic adenoma.

Amplitude modulation thresholds were measured for discriminating the direction of motion of luminance-modulated (first-order) and contrast modulated (second-order) horizontal sine-wave gratings. Early visual deprivation, whether monocular or binocular, caused losses in sensitivity to both first- and second-order motion, with greater losses for second-order motion than for first-order motion. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the two types of motion are processed by different mechanisms and suggest that those mechanisms are differentially sensitive to early visual input.

Some studies have proposed that action observation involves a bilateral network of brain areas, whereas others have suggested left-hemisphere dominance. We explored hemispheric lateralization associated with action observation using transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex devoid of callosal influences. We assessed corticospinal excitability related to observation of finger movements in one split-brain patient and six controls. Results revealed that the left hemisphere of the split-brain patient shows enhanced excitability during action observation, whereas no enhancement was found in the right hemisphere. The controls showed increased excitability in both hemispheres during action observation. Our findings suggest a left-hemisphere dominance for mirror-neuron function in the absence of a corpus callosum.

Additional clinical scenarios, such as use of endarterectomy combined with cardiac surgery, are also reviewed. Methods: The authors selected nine important clinical questions. A systematic search was performed for articles from 1990 (the year of the last statement) until 2001. Additional articles from 2002 through 2004 were included using prespecified criteria. Two reviewers also screened for other relevant articles from 2002 to 2004. Case reports, review articles, technical studies, and single surgeon case series were excluded. Results: For several questions, high quality randomized clinical trials had been completed. Carotid endarterectomy reduces the stroke risk compared to medical therapy alone for patients with 70 to 99% symptomatic stenosis (16% absolute risk reduction at 5 years). There is a smaller benefit for patients with 50 to 69% symptomatic stenosis (absolute risk reduction 4.6% at 5 years). There is a small benefit for asymptomatic patients with 60 to 99% stenosis if the perioperative complication rate is low. Aspirin in a dose of 81 to 325 mg per day is preferred vs higher doses (650 to 1,300 mg per day) in patients undergoing endarterectomy. Conclusions: Evidence supports carotid endarterectomy for severe (70 to 99%) symptomatic stenosis (Level A). Endarterectomy is moderately useful for symptomatic patients with 50 to 69% stenosis (Level B) and not indicated for symptomatic patients with < 50% stenosis (Level A). For asymptomatic patients with 60 to 99% stenosis, the benefit/risk ratio is smaller compared to symptomatic patients and individual decisions must be made. Endarterectomy can reduce the future stroke rate if the perioperative stroke/death rate is kept low (< 3%) (Level A). Low dose aspirin (81 to 325 mg) is preferred for patients before and after carotid endarterectomy to reduce the rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death (Level A).

In the central nervous system of Aplysia, serotonin is associated with various behaviors. For example, it induces short-, intermediate-, and long-term synaptic changes in sensory neurons during learning and inhibits the afterdischarge of the bag cells that initiate egg-laying behavior. Little is known about the nature and contribution of serotonin receptors involved in the numerous serotonin-mediated physiological responses in Aplysia. Recently, two G(i)-coupled serotonin receptors (5-HTap1 and 5-HTap2) were cloned. We now report that, by using in situ hybridization to express the profile of these receptors, we are able to gain critical insight into their roles in the behavior of Aplysia. We compared their distribution to that of sensorin-A, a peptide specifically found in sensory neurons. We wished to determine their involvement in some simple forms of behavioral modifications. 5-HTap1 and 5-HTap2 mRNAs are expressed in all ganglia of the Aplysia central nervous system. Stronger signal was observed with the 5-HTap2 antisense probe than with the 5-HTap1 antisense probe. Notably, mRNA coding for the receptors was found in several identified neurons, in the bag cells, in characterized serotonergic neurons, and in neurons of the mechanosensory clusters that expressed sensorin. We also observed heterogeneity of receptor expression between R2 and LPl1 and among neurons of a single cluster of sensory neurons. These results suggest that 5-HTap1 and 5-HTap2 receptors may regulate the response to serotonin and/or its release in several neurons.

Nevertheless, the molecular basis underlying the developmental action of HAND proteins remains undefined. Within the embryo, HAND1 is first detected in the developing heart where it becomes restricted to the atrial and left ventricular compartments, a pattern identical to that of the Nppa gene, which encodes atrial natriuretic factor, the major secretory product of the heart. We hereby report that the cardiac atrial natriuretic factor promoter is directly activated by HAND1, making it the first known HAND1 transcriptional target. The action of HAND1 does not require heterodimerization with class I basic helix-loop-helix factors or DNA binding through E-box elements. Instead, HAND1 is recruited to the promoter via physical interaction with MEF2 proteins. MEF2/HAND1 interaction results in synergistic activation of MEF2-dependent promoters, and MEF2 binding sites are sufficient to mediate this synergy. MEF2 binding to DNA is not enhanced in the presence of HAND1. Instead, cooper-ativity likely results from corecruitment of co-activators such as CREB-binding protein. The related HAND2 protein can also synergize with MEF2. Thus, HAND proteins act as cell-specific developmental co-activators of the MEF2 family of transcription factors. These findings identify a novel mechanism for HAND action in the heart and provide a general paradigm to understand the mechanism of HAND action in organogenesis.

Interactions with the PDZ domain-containing proteins PIST and PDZK1 are mediated by the PDZ ligand motif at the C terminus of the receptor; in case of the human and mouse ( but not the rat) receptors, a slight sequence variation of this motif also allows for binding of the peroxisomal receptor PEX5. PIST is Golgi-associated and retains SSTR5 in the Golgi apparatus when coexpressed with the receptor; PDZK1 on the other hand associates with the SSTR5 at the plasma membrane. Endogenous SSTR5 in the neuroendocrine AtT-20 tumor cell line is colocalized with PIST in the Golgi apparatus. On a functional level, removal of the PDZ ligand motif of the receptor does not interfere with agonist-dependent internalization of the receptor or its targeting to a Golgi-associated compartment; however, recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane after washout of the agonist is inhibited, suggesting that the PDZ-mediated interaction of SSTR5 is required for postendocytic sorting.

The fifth kringle domain (K5) of human plasminogen is distinct from angiostatin and has been shown, on its own, to act as a potent endothelial cell inhibitor. We propose that tumor-targeted K5 cDNA expression may act as an effective therapeutic intervention as part of a cancer gene therapy strategy. In this study, we provide evidence that eukaryotically expressed His-tagged human K5 cDNA (hK5His) is exported extracellularly and maintains predicted disulfide bridging conformation in solution. Functionally, hK5His protein produced by retrovirally engineered human U87MG glioma cells suppresses in vitro migration of both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human macrophages. Subcutaneous implantation of Matrigel-embedded hK5His-producing glioma cells in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice reveals that hK5His induces a marked reduction in blood vessel formation and significantly suppresses the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating CD45(+)Mac3(+)Gr1(-) macrophages. Therapeutically, we show in a nude mouse orthotopic brain cancer model that tumor-targeted K5 expression is capable of effectively suppressing glioma growth and promotes significant long-term survival (>120 days) of test animals. These data suggest that plasminogen K5 acts as a novel two-pronged anticancer agent, mediating its inhibitory effect via its action on host-derived endothelial cells and tumor-associated macrophages, resulting in a potent, clinically relevant antitumor effect.

Recent work has provided support for several mechanisms that may account for neurodegeneration, but no unifying mechanism has emerged. We have previously demonstrated that in SCA3, the expanded CAG tract in the MJD-1 transcript is prone to frameshifting, which may lead to the production of polyalanine-containing proteins. To further examine the occurrence of frameshifting and understand its mechanism and possible role in pathogenesis, a cellular model was established. We show that this phenomenon results from ribosomal slippage to the -1 frame exclusively, that ribosomal frameshifting depends on the presence of long CAG tracts and that polyalanine-frameshifted proteins may enhance polyglutamine-associated toxicity, possibly contributing to pathogenesis. Finally, we present evidence that anisomycin, a ribosome-interacting drug that reduces -1 frameshifting, also reduces toxicity, suggesting a new therapeutic opportunity for these disorders.

The cytokine function of PGI/AMF targets multiple cell types however mechanisms that regulate and sequester this ubiquitous, circulating cytokine remain largely unidentified. PGI/AMF is shown here to exhibit fibronectin (FN)-dependent cell surface association at both neutral and acid pH. Direct PGI/AMF binding to FN and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PGI/AMF and FN were detected only at pH 5. At neutral pH, the interaction of PGI/AMF with FN is receptor-mediated requiring prior clathrin-dependent endocytosis. PGI/AMF and FN do not co-internalize and PGI/AMF undergoes a second round of endocytosis upon recycling to the plasma membrane indicating that recycling PGI/AMF receptor complexes associate with FN fibrils. Heparan sulphate does not affect cell association of PGI/AMF at neutral pH but enhances the FN-independent cell surface association of PGI/AMF at acid pH identifying two distinct mechanisms for PGI/AMF sequestration under acidic conditions. However, only PGI/AMF sequestration by FN at acid pH was able to stimulate cell motility upon pH neutralization identifying FN as a pH-dependent cytokine trap for PGI/AMF. The multiple ways of cellular association of PGI/AMF may represent acquired mechanisms to regulate and harness the cytokine function of PGI/AMF.

Solubilization of the PPF corresponds to disruption of the presynaptic specialization. We show that the PPF is insoluble to repeated TX-100 extraction at pH 6.0 but becomes soluble in detergent at pH 8.0. By immunolocalization, we find that the major proteins of the PPF, clathrin and dynamin, are concentrated in the presynaptic compartment. By using multidimensional protein identification technology, we compared the protein compositions of the PPF and the PSD fraction. We identified a total of 341 proteins, 50 of which were uniquely found in the PPF, 231 in the PSD fraction, and 60 in both fractions. Comparison of the two fractions revealed a relatively low proportion of actin and associated proteins and a high proportion of vesicle or intracellular compartment proteins in the PPF We conclude that the PPF consists of presynaptic proteins not connected to the actin-based synaptic framework; its insolubility in pH 6 and solubility in pH 8 buffered detergent suggests that clathrin might be an anchorage scaffold for many proteins in the PPF.

A test battery of motor, sensory, postural, and autonomic functions was used to compare young control and homozygous Dst(dt-J) mice. The Dst(dt-J) mutants were severely impaired for muscle strength, limb coordination, and postural reflexes. As a result of a loss in motor control, the mutants were hypoactive in the open-field and fell quickly from the stationary beam. In sensory tests, the acoustic startle response was impaired, but not tactile reflexes and contact righting, attesting to preserved labyrinthine function and non-lemniscal pathways. Dst(dt-J) mutants were also distinguishable from controls on the basis of tremor, a paler skin, piloerection, and half-open eyes, as well as low body weight and fecal boli. Grooming episodes were less frequent in the mutants but without any reduction in grooming time. The neurologic screening battery delineated the functional integrity of some sensorimotor pathways in a spinocerebellar mutant whose severe phenotype prevents a more elaborate evaluation.

Visuo-spatial tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were administered to assess cognitive performance in 55 subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who completed a rehabilitation program. The Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS) was used to measure dimensions of community functioning. One subscale of the Client's Assessment of Strengths, Interests, and Goals (CASIG) provided a measure of subjective quality of life (QoL). Improvement was defined as a 15% or more increase in psychosocial scores between baseline and follow-up. Worse baseline sustained attention predicted better self-rated quality of life, and better baseline visual memory predicted better community functioning over the rehabilitation follow-up period, in particular, higher autonomy in activities of daily living, and less physical and psychiatric symptoms that could interfere with rehabilitation. Baseline cognitive performances predicted community functioning improvement during the followup period: visual memory predicted improvement in daily living autonomy and in social competence; sustained attention predicted improvement in behavioral problems (such as medication compliance, collaboration with treatment providers or impulse control) and social competence; planning performances predicted improvement in social competence. These cognitive functions could be specifically targeted in a rehabilitation program aimed at enhancing functioning in those particular dimensions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study investigates how activity influences synaptic differentiation as synapses mature during early postnatal life. Specifically, we ask what happens to presynaptic terminals when synapses develop without functional postsynaptic receptors and without fast synaptic transmission. To address this issue, we investigated cholinergic nicotinic synapses in sympathetic ganglia of mice with a null mutation for the alpha 3 nicotinic ACh receptor gene. Disrupting the alpha 3 gene completely eliminates fast excitatory synaptic potentials on postganglionic sympathetic neurons, establishing a crucial role for alpha 3-containing postsynaptic receptors in synaptic transmission. Interestingly, the preganglionic nerve terminals form morphologically normal synapses with sympathetic neurons, and these synapses persist without activity in postnatal animals. Surprisingly, when stimulating the preganglionic nerve at physiological rates, we discovered a significant decrease in ACh output from the presynaptic terminals in these alpha 3(-/-) sympathetic ganglia. We show that this decrease in ACh output from the presynaptic terminals results, in part, from a lack of functional high-affinity choline transporters. We conclude the following: (1) fast synaptic transmission in mammalian SCG requires alpha 3 expression; (2) in the absence of activity, the preganglionic nerve forms synapses that appear morphologically normal and persist for several weeks; and (3) to sustain transmitter release, developing presynaptic terminals require an activity-dependent retrograde signal.

In the present study, we sought to determine whether some of these antinociceptive effects might be elicited via stimulation of low-affinity NTS2 receptors. We first established, using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical techniques, that NTS2 receptors were extensively associated with putative spinal nociceptive pathways, both at the level of the dorsal root ganglia and of the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We then examined the effects of intrathecal administration of NT or selective NTS2 agonists on acute thermal pain. Both NT and NTS2 agonists, levocabastine and Boc-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr Psi(CH2NH)Ile-Leu-OH (JMV- 431), induced dose-dependent antinociceptive responses in the tail-flick test. The effects of levocabastine and of JMV- 431 were unaffected by coadministration of the NTS1-specific antagonist 2-[(1-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)- 5-( 2,6- dimethoxy- phenyl) pyrazol- 3- yl) carboxylamino] tricyclo) 3.3.1.1.(3.7))-decan-2-carboxylic acid (SR48692), confirming that they were NTS2 mediated. In contrast, the antinociceptive effects of NT were partly abolished by coadministration of SR48692, indicating that NTS1 and NTS2 receptors were both involved. These results suggest that NTS2 receptors play a role in the regulation of spinal nociceptive inputs and that selective NTS2 agonists may offer new avenues for the treatment of acute pain.

In the mouse, at least, much of this variability is genetic because inbred strains differ robustly in their behavioral sensitivity to noxious heat. These strain differences are shown here to reflect differential responsiveness of primary afferent thermal nociceptors to heat stimuli. We further present convergent behavioral and electrophysiological evidence that the variable responses to noxious heat are due to strain-dependence of CGRP expression and sensitivity. Strain differences in behavioral response to noxious heat could be abolished by peripheral injection of CGRP, blockade of cutaneous and spinal CGRP receptors, or long-term inactivation of CGRP with a CGRP-binding Spiegelmer. Linkage mapping supports the contention that the genetic variant determining variable heat pain sensitivity across mouse strains affects the expression of the Calca, gene that codes for CGRP alpha.

However, Fas is also widely expressed in a number of other tissues, including in neurons. Here, we report that defects in the Fas/Fas ligand system unexpectedly render mice highly susceptible to neural degeneration in a model of Parkinson's disease. We found that Fas-deficient lymphoproliferative mice develop a dramatic phenotype resembling clinical Parkinson's disease, characterized by extensive nigrostriatal degeneration accompanied by tremor, hypokinesia, and loss of motor coordination, when treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) at a dose that causes no neural degeneration or behavioral impairment in WT mice. Mice with generalized lymphoproliferative disease, which express a mutated Fas ligand, display an intermediate phenotype between that of lymphoproliferative and WT mice. Moreover, Fas engagement directly protects neuronal cells from MPTP/1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion toxicity in vitro. Our data show that decreased Fas expression renders dopaminergic neurons highly susceptible to degeneration in response to a Parkinson-causing neurotoxin. These findings constitute the first evidence for a neuroprotective role for Fas in vivo.

This study examined temporal changes in neurohormones related to cardiac remodeling and prognosis in patients with systolic dysfunction and heart failure receiving therapeutic inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Temporal changes in plasma renin, angiotensin-II, aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and Nterminal atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-ANP) in 768 treated patients with heart failure measured at baseline and 17 and 43 weeks after randomization were examined for their relations with concurrent changes in the EF, cardiac volumes, and risk for subsequent adverse clinical outcomes. Increasing BNP (p < 0.0001) and NT-ANP (p = 0.01) over time were associated with a concurrent decreasing EF, increasing end-diastolic volume (EDV), and increasing end-systolic volume (ESV; all p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, Delta BNP and Delta NT-ANP were independent predictors of Delta ESV and Delta EDV, whereas Delta BNP also predicted EF (all p < 0.0001). Patients who died or experienced heart failure hospitalization had larger antecedent increases in NT-ANP (+293.7 vs -21.5 pmol/ml, p = 0.006) and lesser decreases in norepinephrine (-22.3 vs -48.5 pg/ml, p = 0.04). Increasing NT-ANP (hazard ratio [HR] 3.45, p = 0.009) and norepinephrine (HR 2.04, p = 0.02) over time independently predicted increased risk for subsequent death or heart failure hospitalization. In conclusion, in treated patients with heart failure, increasing NT-ANP and BNP over time predict a decreasing EF and ventricular dilatation, while increasing NT-ANP and norepinephrine independently predict greater mortality and morbidity. Serial measurements of these neurohormones may serve as useful surrogate markers of ventricular remodeling and prognosticators for clinical risk stratification. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

An identity-by-descent mapping approach using eight patients from three interrelated Hutterite families localized the gene for this syndrome to chromosome region 9p24. Haplotype analysis identified familial and ancestral recombination events and refined the minimal region to a 2-Mb interval between markers D9S129 and D9S1871. A 199-kb homozygous deletion encompassing the entire very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) gene was present in all affected individuals. VLDLR is part of the reelin signaling pathway, which guides neuroblast migration in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. To our knowledge, this syndrome represents the first human lipoprotein receptor malformation syndrome and the second human disease associated with a reelin pathway defect.

We hypothesized that the infraclavicular approach would result in shorter performance times with a quality of block similar to that of the supraclavicular approach. Eighty patients were randomized into two equal groups: Group I (infraclavicular) and Group S (supraclavicular). All blocks were performed using ultrasound visualization with a 7.5-MHz linear probe and neurostimulation. The anesthetic mixture consisted of 0.5 mL/kg of bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine hydrocarbonate 2% (13 vol.) with epinephrine 1:200,000. Sensory block, motor block, and supplementation rates were evaluated for the musculocutaneous, median, radial, and ulnar nerves. Surgical anesthesia without supplementation was achieved in 80% of patients in group I compared with 87% in Group S (P = 0.39). Supplementation rates were significantly different only for the radial territory: 18% in Group I versus 0% in group S (P = 0.006). Block performance times were not different between groups (4.0 min in Group I versus 4.65 min in Group S; P = 0.43). Technique-related pain scores were not different between groups (I: 2.0; S: 2.0; P = 1.00). We conclude that USG infraclavicular block is at least as rapidly executed as USG supraclavicular block and produces a similar degree of surgical anesthesia without supplementation.

The deficit is limited to music and cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, or any cognitive or socioaffective disturbance. Recent behavioral results suggest that this disorder is critically dependent on fine-grained pitch discrimination. Here, we present novel electrophysiological evidence that this disorder can be traced down to a right-lateralized N2-P3 response elicited by pitch changes. This abnormal brain response begins as early as 200 milliseconds after tone onset and may serve as a marker of an anomaly in music acquisition.

ARCHIVES OF PEDIATRICS & ADOLESCENT MEDICINE			English	Article							DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS; PARENTS; DISABILITIES; PERSPECTIVE; CARE	Objective: To describe when and by whom concern is first expressed for children referred to rehabilitation because of neuromotor problems. Study Design and Setting: We conducted a survey of parents of 92 children (aged 0-6 years) who were on the waiting list for physical or occupational therapy services at rehabilitation centers in Montreal, Quebec. We compared age of child at initial concern with who first expressed concern for children who were considered at risk due to their perinatal history of prematurity and those who were not born prematurely but were later diagnosed as having neuromotor problems. Intervention: Parents were interviewed regarding their child's medical history and utilization of health care services. Results: Parents were concerned later than physicians were regarding their child's development (mean difference, 8.2 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7-12.6 months). There was no significant difference in time of recognition of problems between the premature (10.2 months) and full-term (11.9 months) groups. Even after controlling for risk group, parental concern occurred later than physician concern (beta coefficient, 7.3 95% CI, 2.5-12.2). The child's age at the time of initial concern was associated with the child's age at referral to rehabilitation (beta coefficient, 0.04; 95% Cl, 0.01-0.06). Conclusions: Early recognition is important if a child is to benefit from early rehabilitation. It may be important to improve primary care screening of children for neuromotor problems and to increase parental awareness regarding normal motor development of their children. Prompt, simultaneous referral to medical evaluation and rehabilitation resources may decrease delays in rehabilitation.

Phonomyography (PMG) is a novel method to monitor neuromuscular block. It is non-invasive and can be applied to any muscle. It can be used interchangeably with mechanonnyography (MMG). The staircase phenomenon has not been investigated for this method or at the corrugator supercilii muscle. The purpose of this work was to determine the staircase effect at three different muscles using two different methods. Methods. In 10 patients undergoing general anaesthesia with sevoflurane, using a laryngeal mask airway without the aid of neuromuscular block, one piezo-electric microphone each was applied to the corrugator supercilii muscle and the first dorsal interosseus muscle. In addition, a force transducer was attached to the tip of the thumb to determine the force of the adductor pollicis muscle. Supramaximal stimulation at 1 Hz was used at the ulnar and the facial nerve. All signals were simultaneously recorded for 30 min. Data are presented as means (SD). Results. The staircase effect was significantly positive for the first dorsal interosseus muscle and the adductor pollicis muscle. The signal potentiation was not significantly different between the first dorsal interosseus muscle with a maximum increase at 148 (19)% using PMG, and the adductor pollicis muscle at 154 (22)% using MMG. The evoked signals reached a plateau after 15-18 min at both muscles. There was only a small initial increase in signal height at the corrugator supercilii to a maximum of 117 (20)% at 7 min, after which the signals decreased to reach a plateau at 25 min. In comparison with the signal height of 105 (25)% at 30 min, there was no significant difference of signal heights throughout the observation period. Conclusions. A positive staircase phenomenon is found equally at the first dorsal interosseus muscle and the adductor pollicis muscle. There is no significant staircase effect at the corrugator supercilii muscle.

Because overexpression of the inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was neuroprotective in a culture model of motor neuron disease, this study investigated whether NSAIDs induce Hsp70 and confer cytoprotection in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures exposed to various stresses. Two NSAlDs, sodium salicylate and niflumic acid, lowered the temperature threshold for induction of Hsp70 in glia but failed to do so in motor neurons. At concentrations that increased Hsp70 in heat shocked glial cells, sodium salicylate failed to delay death of motor neurons exposed to hyperthermia, paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Neither sodium salicylate nor the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, niflumic acid, protected motor neurons from the toxicity of mutated Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) linked to a familial form of the motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, treatment with 2 types of NSAIDs failed to overcome the high threshold for the activation of heat shock response in motor neurons.

There is evidence for the involvement of both systems in neurodegenerative disease, and a therapeutic target is the heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, which mediates upregulation of Hsps in response to cellular stress. The mechanisms regulating expression of proteasomal proteins in mammalian cells are less well defined. To assess any direct effect of Hsf1 on expression of proteasomal subunits and activity in mammalian cells, a plasmid encoding a constitutively active form of Hsf1 (HSf1(act)) was expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Hsf1 and in cultured human myoblasts. Plasmid encoding an inactivatible form of Hsf1 (Hsf1(inact)) served as control. In cultures transfected with plasmid hsf1(act), robust expression of the major stress-inducible Hsp, Hsp70, occurred but not in cultures transfected with hsf1(inact). No significant changes in the level of expression of representative proteasomal proteins (structural [20S alpha], a nonpeptidase beta subunit [20S beta 3], or 2 regulatory subunits [19S subunit 6b, 11S alpha]) or in chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and caspaselike activities of the proteasome were measured. Thus, stress-induced or pharmacological activation of Hsf1 in mammalian cells would upregulate Hsps but not directly affect expression or activity of proteasomes.

Direct binding, binding competition, and biological screens identified agonistic ligands of the ectodomain of the neurotrophin receptors TrkC and TrkA. Agonism is intrinsic to the peptidomimetic ligand (in the absence of neurotrophins), and/or can also be detected as potentiation of neurotrophin action. Remarkably, some peptidomimetics afford both neurotrophic activities of cell survival and neuronal differentiation, while others afford discrete signals leading to either survival or differentiation. The high rate of hits identified suggests that focused minilibraries may be desirable for developing bioactive ligands of cell surface receptors. Small, selective, proteolytically stable ligands with defined biological activity may have therapeutic potential.

Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 have been reported in several subjects with AAAS. Over the last 5 years, we have evaluated six subjects with the clinical diagnosis of AAAS. Three subjects had mutations in the AAAS gene - including one novel mutation (IVS8+1 G > A) - and a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. However, three subjects with classic AAAS did not have mutations in the AAAS gene on both alleles. This finding supports the notion of genetic heterogeneity for this disorder, although other genetic mechanisms cannot be excluded.

As functional neuroimaging studies have implicated both temporal and frontal lobes in the phonological aspect of reading [K.R. Pugh, B.A. Shaywitz, S.E. Shaywitz, et al. Brain 1996;119:1221-38], seizure activity originating in either region could interfere with phonological processing, whereas generalized seizures would not disturb this function as much. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the meta phonological skills of school-aged children with either temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), or generalized absence seizures (ABS) with those of healthy controls. While the reading ability of all epileptic children was close to 2 years behind expectations, children with TLE did not differ from the controls on phonological tasks. In contrast, children with FLE exhibited significant deficits, whereas children with ABS showed difficulties restricted to phonemic segmentation. The results suggest that FLE and, to a lesser extent, generalized seizures may interfere with phonological processing, whereas TLE may affect other aspects of reading. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The rehabilitation of aphasia and, more recently, of other cognitive disorders is an important area of neurological rehabilitation. We report here a review of the available evidence about effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation. Given the limited number and generally low quality of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in this area of therapeutic intervention, the Task Force considered, besides the available Cochrane reviews, evidence of lower classes which was critically analysed until a consensus was reached. In particular, we considered evidence from small group or single cases studies including an appropriate statistical evaluation of effect sizes. The general conclusion is that there is evidence to award a grade A, B or C recommendation to some forms of cognitive rehabilitation in patients with neuropsychological deficits in the post-acute stage after a focal brain lesion (stroke, TBI). These include aphasia therapy, rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect (ULN), attentional training in the post-acute stage after TBI, the use of electronic memory aids in memory disorders, and the treatment of apraxia with compensatory strategies. There is clearly a need for adequately designed studies in this area, which should take into account specific problems such as patient heterogeneity and treatment standardization.

J	Schonwiesner, M; Rubsamen, R; von Cramon, DY				Schonwiesner, M; Rubsamen, R; von Cramon, DY			Hemispheric asymmetry for spectral and temporal processing in the human antero-lateral auditory belt cortex	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory cortex; auditory information processing; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; speech	SPEECH-PERCEPTION; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; LOWER LIMIT; CUES; LANGUAGE; NEURONS; PITCH; DISCRIMINATION; SPECIALIZATION	The present study investigates the acoustic basis of the hemispheric asymmetry for the processing of speech and music. Experiments on this question ideally involve stimuli that are perceptually unrelated to speech and music, but contain acoustic characteristics of both. Stimuli in previous studies were derived from speech samples or tonal sequences. Here we introduce a new class of noise-like sound stimuli with no resemblance of speech or music that permit independent parametric variation of spectral and temporal acoustic complexity. Using these stimuli in a functional MRI experiment, we test the hypothesis of a hemispheric asymmetry for the processing of spectral and temporal sound structure by seeking cortical areas in which the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal covaries with the number of simultaneous spectral components (spectral complexity) or the temporal modulation rate (temporal complexity) of the stimuli. BOLD-responses from the left and right Heschl's gyrus (HG) and part of the right superior temporal gyrus covaried with the spectral parameter, whereas covariation analysis for the temporal parameter highlighted an area on the left superior temporal gyrus. The portion of superior temporal gyrus in which asymmetrical responses are apparent corresponds to the antero-lateral auditory belt cortex, which has been implicated with spectral integration in animal studies. Our results support a similar function of the anterior auditory belt in humans. The findings indicate that asymmetrical processing of complex sounds in the cerebral hemispheres does not depend on semantic, but rather on acoustic stimulus characteristics.

Subjects lay supine with one foot placed in a custom-fitted boot attached to an electro-hydraulic actuator. They were instructed to relax while pseudo-random binary sequence perturbations were applied to their ankle joint. The ankle position and torque, as well as EMG from the ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors were recorded. These were used to identify reflex and intrinsic components of ankle stiffness, using a non-linear, parallel-cascade, system identification method. Results demonstrated that the majority of stroke patients (7/11) had ankle stiffness similar to that of control subjects. In contrast, a minority of stroke patients (4/11) had an abnormal increase in ankle stiffness, most of which could be attributed to an increased reflex gain. Reflex stiffness increased as the ankle was dorsiflexed in all subjects. These results differ from a previous study showing that reflex gain and intrinsic stiffness were increased in all patients with spinal cord injury. This difference may reflect the different topography of the lesions in the two neurological conditions.

Experiments were conducted on urethane-anesthetized and paralyzed rabbits. In five animals (experimental group), rhythmical bouts of fictive masticatory-like motoneuron activity (cumulative duration 60-130 min) were induced by electrical stimulation of the left cortical "masticatory area" and recorded from the right digastric motoneuron pool. A control group of five animals (non-masticatory) were treated in the same way as the experimental animals with regard to surgical procedures, anesthesia, paralysis, and survival time. To detect the c-Fos-like protein, the animals were perfused, and the brainstems were cryosectioned and processed immunocytochemically. In the experimental group, the number of c-Fos-like immunoreactive neurons increased significantly in several brainstem areas. In rostral and lateral areas, increments occurred bilaterally in the borderzones surrounding the trigeminal motor nucleus (Regio h); the rostrodorsomedial half of the trigeminal main sensory nucleus; subnucleus oralis-gamma of the spinal trigeminal tract; nuclei reticularis parvocellularis pars alpha and nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (RPc) pars alpha. Further caudally-enhanced labeling occurred bilaterally in nucleus reticularis parvocellularis and nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (Rgc) including its pars-alpha. Our results provide a detailed anatomical record of neuronal populations that are correlated with the generation of the masticatory motor behavior.

Discharges localized awhile in one part of the brain cause focal-onset seizures. A genetically determined generalized hyperexcitability had been predicted in primarily generalized seizures, but surprisingly the first epilepsy gene discovered, CHRNA4, was in a focal (frontal lobe)-onset syndrome. Another surprise with CHRNA4 was its encoding of an ion channel present throughout the brain. The reason why CHRNA4 causes focal-onset seizures is unknown. Recently, the second focal (temporal lobe)-onset epilepsy gene, LGI1 (unknown function), was discovered. CHRNA4 led the way to mutation identifications in 15 ion channel genes, most causing primarily generalized epilepsies. Potassium channel mutations cause benign familial neonatal convulsions. Sodium channel mutations cause generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus or, if more severe, severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy. Chloride and calcium channel mutations are found in rare families with the common syndromes childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Mutations in the EFHC1 gene (unknown function) occur in other rare JME families, and yet in other families, associations are present between JME (or other generalized epilepsies) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the BRD2 gene (unknown function) and the malic enzyme 2 (ME2) gene. Hippocrates predicted the genetic nature of the 'sacred' disease. Genes underlying the 'malevolent' forces seizing 1% of humans have now been revealed. These, however, still account for a mere fraction of the genetic contribution to epilepsy. Exciting years are ahead, in which the genetics of this extremely common, and debilitating, neurological disorder will be solved.

As a consequence, the use of functional neuroimaging, for instance, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), constitutes an appealing way of constraining the solution. However, the match between bioelectric and metabolic activities is desirable but not assured. Therefore, the introduction of spatial priors derived from other functional modalities in the EEG/MEG inverse problem should be considered with caution. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian characterization of the relevance of fMRI-derived prior information regarding the EEG/MEG data. This is done by quantifying the adequacy of this prior to the data, compared with that obtained using an noninformative prior instead. This quantitative comparison, using the so-called Bayes factor, allows us to decide whether the informative prior should (or not) be included in the inverse solution. We validate our approach using extensive simulations, where fMRI-derived priors are built as perturbed versions of the simulated EEG sources. Moreover, we show how this inference framework can be generalized to optimize the way we should incorporate the informative prior.

Unfortunately, none has been able to provide a relevant, self-contained, and common definition of brain interaction. In this paper, we propose a first step in this direction. We first introduce a common terminology together with a cross-modal definition of interaction. In this setting, we investigate the commonalities shared by some measures of interaction proposed in the literature. We show that temporal correlation, nonlinear correlation, mutual information, generalized synchronization, phase synchronization, coherence, and phase locking value (PLV) actually measure the same quantity (namely correlation) when one is investigating linear interactions between independently and identically distributed Gaussian variables. We also demonstrate that these data-driven measures can only partly account for the interaction patterns that can be expressed by the effective connectivity of structural equation modeling (SEM). To bridge this gap, we suggest the use of conditional correlation, which is shown to be related to mediated interaction.

We assessed cognitive (MDI) and motor (PDI) developments with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley, 1993). At time of arrival, children presented physical, cognitive, and motor delays, as well as health problems. Growth parameters improved with time, but differently among the groups. East Asian children, in a better physical state at time of arrival, changed less than the others did across time. Children adopted from Russia globally had lower MDI than the others, while children adopted from East Asia had the highest PDI. Hierarchical linear modelling indicated that initial MDI was related to height/age ratio (index of chronic malnutrition), while its change over time was related to age at time of arrival. PDI was also related to height/age ratio, as well as to presence/absence of neurological signs at time of arrival. Infants with a higher risk index had lower MDI and PDI initial scores.

To test the hypothesis that adenovirus (Ad)-mediated gene delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) to Muller cells can protect photoreceptors from light-induced retinal degeneration. METHODS. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats received an intraocular injection of Ad. BDNF, control Ad containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, or BDNF recombinant protein. Animals were then exposed to 5, 10, or 16 days of constant light. The effect of Ad. BDNF on photoreceptor survival was examined histologically, by measuring the outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness, and functionally, by measuring the electroretinographic ( ERG) response. RESULTS. Ad. BDNF mediated sustained expression of bioactive neurotrophin by Muller cells that lasted for at least 30 days after viral vector administration. BDNF gene delivery to Muller glia markedly increased the survival and structural integrity of light-damaged photoreceptors. For example, after 10 days of exposure to light, the average percentage of ONL preservation in the superior central retina of eyes that received Ad. BDNF was 71%, compared with 46% in eyes that received a control Ad. GFP or 15% in contralateral eyes. Of importance, retinas exposed to Ad. BDNF had more photoreceptor nuclei than retinas that received a single intraocular injection of BDNF recombinant protein. The neuroprotective effect of Ad. BDNF was accompanied by preservation of the ERG response of the treated eyes. CONCLUSIONS. These data provide proof of the concept that BDNF gene transfer into Muller cells is an effective strategy for preserving structure and function of photoreceptors in retinal degeneration.

Blood pressure, heart rate, and cerebral blood velocity (transcranial Doppler) were recorded at rest and during 80 degrees head-up tilt (HUT). Static cerebral autoregulation, as assessed from the change in cerebrovascular resistance during HUT, was the same in POTS and in controls. The properties of dynamic cerebral autoregulation were inferred from transfer gain, coherence, and phase of the relationship between blood pressure and cerebral blood velocity estimated from filtered data segments (0.02-0.8 Hz). Dynamic cerebral autoregulation of patients with POTS did not differ from that of controls. The patients' dynamic cerebral autoregulation did not change over the course of HUT, despite increased tachycardia suggestive of worsening orthostatic stress. Inflation of military anti-shock trouser pants substantially reduced the tachycardia of patients with POTS without affecting cerebral autoregulation. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance were reduced in one-half of the patients following military anti-shock trouser pants inflation. We conclude that cerebral perfusion and autoregulation in many patients with POTS do not differ from that of normal control subjects.

We therefore examined the influence of acute exercise on glucose uptake in the patellar and quadriceps tendons during dynamic exercise in humans. Glucose uptake was measured in five healthy men in the patellar and quadriceps tendons and the quadriceps femoris muscle at rest and during dynamic knee-extension exercise (25 W) using positron emission tomography and [F-18]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG). Glucose uptake index was calculated by dividing the tissue activity with blood activity of [F-18]FDG. Exercise increased glucose uptake index by 77% in the patellar tendon (from 0.30 +/- 0.09 to 0.51 +/- 0.16, P = 0.03), by 106% in the quadriceps tendon (from 0.37 +/- 0.15 to 0.75 +/- 0.36, P = 0.02), and by 15-fold in the quadriceps femoris muscle (from 0.31 +/- 0.11 to 4.5 +/- 1.7, P = 0.005). The exercise-induced increase in the glucose uptake in neither tendon correlated with the increase in glucose uptake in the quadriceps muscle (r = -0.10, P = 0.87 for the patellar tendon and r = -0.30, P = 0.62 for the quadriceps tendon). These results show that tendon glucose uptake is increased during exercise. However, the increase in tendon glucose uptake is less pronounced than in muscle and the increases are uncorrelated. Thus tendon glucose uptake is likely to be regulated by mechanisms independently of those regulating skeletal muscle glucose uptake.

The paracrine regulation of brain angiogenesis by platelet-derived growth factors is, however, poorly understood. In the present study, we assessed the role of S1P on brain EC migration and tubulogenesis, using rat brain-derived (RBE4) EC as an in vitro model. We show that S1P inhibits brain EC migration and tubulogenesis, while it displays proangiogenic activity towards noncerebral EC. Overexpression of the S1P receptor S1P-1 in RBE4 cells potentiated all of the S1P-mediated events. We also show that the lack of expression of MT1-MMP a membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase that is thought to cooperate with S1P in tubulogenic processes, may explain the antiangiogenic activity of S1P on brain vasculature. Altogether our results support the hypothesis of a tissue-specific, antiangiogenic role of S1P in the brain, which may help to stabilize the cerebral vasculature and thus have crucial impact on the setting and regulation of normal brain vascularization.

The role of the prefrontal and parietal cortex in cognitive control	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED FMRI; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; TASK PREPARATION; WORKING-MEMORY; COMPONENTS; STROOP; WORD; SET; ACTIVATIONS; POTENTIALS	Cognitive control processes enable us to adjust our behavior to changing environmental demands. Although neuropsychological studies suggest that the critical cortical region for cognitive control is the prefrontal cortex, neuro-imaging studies have emphasized the interplay of prefrontal and parietal cortices. This raises the fundamental question about the different contributions of prefrontal and parietal areas in cognitive control. It was assumed that the prefrontal cortex biases processing in posterior brain regions. This assumption leads to the hypothesis that neural activity in the prefrontal cortex should precede parietal activity in cognitive control. The present Study tested this assumption by combining results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) providing high spatial resolution and event-related potentials (ERPs) to gain high temporal resolution. We collected ERP data using a modified task-switching paradigm. In this paradigm, a situation where the same task was indicated by two different cues was compared with a situation where two cues indicated different tasks, Only the latter condition required updating of the task set. Task-set updating was associated with a midline negative ERP deflection peaking around 470 msec. We placed dipoles in regions activated in a previous fMRI study that used the same paradigm (left inferior frontal junction, right inferior frontal gyrus, right parietal Cortex) and fitted their directions and magnitudes to the ERP effect. The frontal dipoles contributed to the ERP effect earlier than the parietal dipole, providing support for the view that the prefrontal cortex is involved in updating of general task representations and biases relevant stimulus-response associations in the parietal cortex.

In this work, we study the problem of finding biomarkers through mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF) spectra from cancerous and normal tissues. In contrast to the common practice of using vague methods such as genetic algorithms, or uninterpretable methods such as Support Vector Machines, we look for a method that is simple, intuitive, interpretable, usable, and more accurate. We introduce decision lists to this domain. Our experiments on clinical cancer datasets demonstrate that decision lists can achieve more accurate results than other methods. More interestingly, the resulting decision lists are more interpretable for possible causal relationship between cancer and differentially expressed proteins, and directly usable in clinical biomarker design. In particular, our approach is capable of finding multiple biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity. Such a feature will provide clues for medical experts to thoroughly investigate the roles of protein in cancer development and progression.

Participants and Methods: Thirty-four children (mean age: 12 +/- 3 years) in each group. Children with mTBI were assessed I day postinjury (to document preinjury status) and at 12 weeks post-mTBI using a self-efficacy questionnaire, the Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Athletic Competence subscale of the Self-Perception Profile for Children or Adolescents, and the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire. Noninjured children underwent the same assessments at a corresponding time interval. Results: At 12 weeks postinjury, self-efficacy scores of children with mTBI were significantly lower than initial (ie, pretraumatic) values and those of noninjured children. The children with mTBI had, however, returned to their preinjury level of participation in physical activities and maintained their athletic competence. Conclusions: After mTBI, children appear to lack confidence in their ability to perform during physical activities as compared to before their injury, Intervention strategies such as information or counseling sessions targeting children and their parents may minimize the impact of the mTBI on children's confidence in their performance in physical activities.

Thirty-three patients and 33 controls were evaluated by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The defense mechanisms were evaluated by the Defense Style Questionnaire at the beginning of the study and after 16 weeks of sertraline treatment. Panic disordered patients used more neurotic (4.6 vs. 3.6; p = 0.003) and immature (3.6 vs. 3.0; p = 0.024) defenses at baseline. Patients who achieved complete remission (N = 25) differed from the control group in the use of neurotic defenses at the baseline (4.4 vs. 3.6; p = 0.033). After treatment, they showed a reduction in the use of neurotic (4.4 vs. 3.7; p = 0.014) and immature (3.4 vs. 3.1; p = 0.019) defenses. Defense mechanisms in PD are influenced by the presence of symptoms, severity, and outcome of the disease.

Patients and Methods: Retrospective review of patients' charts. Results: Twenty-one patients were included. Visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 50% of the eyes. Three eyes developed a retinal detachment. When computerized tomography of the orbit demonstrated peripapillary scleral staphyloma and intraocular calcifications, this correlated with poor visual acuity. Computerized tomography of the brain revealed abnormalities in three asymptomatic patients. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated retinal tissue overhanging the peripapillary scleral staphyloma. Conclusions: Morning glory syndrome has a spectrum of severity, with most patients retaining useful vision. Orbital and cerebral computerized tomography scan as well as B-scan ultrasonography may help with diagnosis and management.

The opioid activity profiles of these peptides were determined in the mu-opioid receptor representative binding assay and in the Guinea-Pig Ileum assay/Mouse Vas Deferens assay (GPI/MVD) bioassays in vitro, as well as in the mouse hot-plate test of analgesia in vivo. In the binding assay the affinity of all new analogs for the mu-opioid receptor was reduced compared with endomorphin-2. The two most potent analogs were [D-1-Nal(4)]- and [D-2-Nal(4)]endomorphin-2, with IC50 values 14 +/- 1.25 and 19 +/- 2.1 nM, respectively, compared with 1.9 +/- 0.21 nM for endomorphin-2. In the GPI assay these analogs were found to be weak antagonists and they were inactive in the MVD assay. The in vitro GPI assay results were in agreement with those obtained in the in vivo hot-plate test. Antinociception induced by endomorphin-2 was reversed by concomitant intracerebroventricula (i.c.v.) administration of [D-1-Nal(4)]- and [D-2-Nal(4)]-endomorphin-2, indicating that these analogs were mu-opioid antagonists. Their antagonist activity was compared with that of naloxone. At a dose 5 mu g per animal naloxone almost completely inhibited antinociceptive action of endomorphin-2, while [D-1-Nal(4)]endomorphin-2 in about 46%.

Methods: The Montreal Imaging Stress Task ( MIST), derived from the Trier Mental Challenge Test, consists of a series of computerized mental arithmetic challenges, along with social evaluative threat components that are built into the program or presented by the investigator. To allow the effects of stress and mental arithmetic to be investigated separately, the MIST has 3 test conditions ( rest, control and experimental), which can be presented in either a block or an event-related design, for use with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) or positron emission tomography ( PET). In the rest condition, subjects look at a static computer screen on which no tasks are shown. In the control condition, a series of mental arithmetic tasks are displayed on the computer screen, and subjects submit their answers by means of a response interface. In the experimental condition, the difficulty and time limit of the tasks are manipulated to be just beyond the individual's mental capacity. In addition, in this condition the presentation of the mental arithmetic tasks is supplemented by a display of information on individual and average performance, as well as expected performance. Upon completion of each task, the program presents a performance evaluation to further increase the social evaluative threat of the situation. Results: In 2 independent studies using PET and a third independent study using fMRI, with a total of 42 subjects, levels of salivary free cortisol for the whole group were significantly increased under the experimental condition, relative to the control and rest conditions. Performing mental arithmetic was linked to activation of motor and visual association cortices, as well as brain structures involved in the performance of these tasks ( e. g., the angular gyrus). Conclusions: We propose the MIST as a tool for investigating the effects of perceiving and processing psychosocial stress in functional imaging studies.

In this paper, we summarize the data obtained in this study to date. We have found that long-term exposure to high endogenous levels of cortisol is associated with both memory impairments and a 14% smaller volume of the hippocampus. We also report on studies showing that in older adults with moderate levels of cortisol over time, memory performance can be acutely modulated by pharmacologic manipulations of cortisol. We describe one participant who was included in the group of older adults presenting with increased cortisol levels over time, memory impairments and reduced hippocampal volume and in whom major depression, followed by Alzheimer's disease, developed during the course of the study. Together, the results of the Douglas Hospital Longitudinal Study of Normal and Pathological Aging show that increased secretion of cortisol in the older human population is significantly associated with impairment of cognitive function during aging.

Normal-hearing controls and postlingually deaf adults read elicitation lists of /hVd/ syllables with and without bite blocks and auditory feedback. Deaf participants' auditory feedback was provided by a cochlear prosthesis and interrupted by switching off their implant microphones. Recording sessions were held before prosthesis was provided and one month and one year after. Long-term absence of auditory feedback was associated with heightened dispersion of vowel tokens, which was inflated further by inserting bite blocks. The restoration of some hearing with prosthesis reduced dispersion. Deaf speakers' vowel spaces were reduced in size compared to controls. Insertion of bite blocks reduced them further because of the speakers' incomplete compensation. A year of prosthesis use increased vowel contrast with feedback during elicitation. These findings support the inference that models of speech production must assign a role to auditory feedback in error-based correction of feedforward commands for subsequent articulatory gestures.

J	Mann, R; Langer, MS				Mann, R; Langer, MS			Spectrum analysis of motion parallax in a 3D cluttered scene and application to egomotion	JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION			English	Article							VISUAL NAVIGATION; ROBUST ESTIMATION; COMPUTER VISION; NEURAL NETWORK; OPTICAL-FLOW; EGO-MOTION; ALGORITHM; IMAGE; FIELD; MODEL	Previous methods for estimating observer motion in a rigid 3D scene assume that image velocities can be measured at isolated points. When the observer is moving through a cluttered 3D scene such as a forest, however, pointwise measurements of image velocity are more challenging to obtain because multiple depths, and hence multiple velocities, are present in most local image regions. We introduce a method for estimating egomotion that avoids pointwise image velocity estimation as a first step. In its place, the direction of motion parallax in local image regions is estimated, using a spectrum-based method, and these directions are then combined to directly estimate 3D observer motion. There are two advantages to this approach. First, the method can be applied to a wide range of 3D cluttered scenes, including those for which pointwise image velocities cannot be measured because only normal velocity information is available. Second, the egomotion estimates can be used as a posterior constraint on estimating pointwise image velocities, since known egomotion parameters constrain the candidate image velocities at each point to a one-dimensional rather than a two-dimensional space.

This study investigated the application of EMET using a novel few-leaf electron collimator (FLEC) in head and neck and breast sites in comparison with three-dimensional conventional radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques. Treatment planning was performed for two parotid cases and one breast case. Four plans were compared for each case: 3D-CRT, IMRT, 3D-CRT in conjunction with EMET (EMET-CRT), and IMRT in conjunction with EMET (EMET-IMRT), all of which were performed and calculated with Monte Carlo techniques. For all patients, dose volume histograms (DVHs) were obtained for all organs of interest and the DVHs were used as a means of comparing the plans. Homogeneity and conformity of dose distributions were calculated, as well as a sparing index that compares the effect of the low isodose lines. In addition, the whole-body dose equivalent (WBDE) was estimated for each plan. Adding EMET delivered with the FLEC to 3D-CRT improves sparing of normal tissues. For the two head and neck cases, the mean dose to the contralateral parotid and brain stem was reduced relative to IMRT by 43% and 84%, and by 57% and 71%, respectively. Improved normal tissue sparing was quantified as an increase in sparing index of 47% and 30% for the head and neck and the breast cases, respectively. Adding EMET to either 3D-CRT or IMRT results in preservation of target conformity and dose homogeneity. When adding EMET to the treatment plan, the WBDE was reduced by between 6% and 19% for 3D-CRT and by between 21% and 33% for IMRT, while WBDE for EMET-CRT was reduced by up to 72% when compared with IMRT. FLEC offers a practical means of delivering modulated electron therapy. Although adding EMET delivered using the FLEC results in perturbation of target conformity when compared to IMRT, it significantly improves normal tissue sparing while offering enhanced target conformity to the 3D-CRT planning. The addition of EMET systematically leads to a reduction in WBDE especially when compared with IMRT. (C) 2005 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Hippocrates 2500 years ago described 'encephalopathy' simply translated as 'inside head suffering.' Over 1500 papers have been written on hepatic encephalopathy since 1966, but only a minority of these actually refer to the original observation of hepatic encephalopathy and the link with ammonia made by Marcel Nencki and Ivan Pavlov in 1893 with very little acknowledgement being made to the early landmark studies which described the importance of the muscle and kidneys in maintaining ammonia homeostasis as well as the liver and gut. Furthermore, infection was recognized as being an important modulator of brain function by the ancient Greek physicians and philosophers. This review focuses upon the original experiments of Nencki and Pavlov and describes how they fit into what we understand about the pathophysiology and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy today.

These proteins are thought to transport mRNA and to control their translation. While FMR1P is highly expressed in neurons, substantial levels of FXR1P are found in striated muscles and heart, which are devoid of FMRP and FXR2P. However, little is known about the functions of FXR1P. We have isolated cDNAs for Xenopus Fxr1 and found that two specific splice variants are conserved in evolution. Knockdown of xFxr1p in Xenopus had highly muscle-specific effects, normal MyoD expression being disrupted, somitic myotomal cell rotation and segmentation being inhibited, and dermatome formation being abnormal. Consistent with the absence of the long muscle-specific xFxr1p isoform during early somite formation, these effects could be rescued by both the long and short mRNA variants. Microarray analyses showed that xFxr1p depletion affected the expression of 129 known genes of which 50% were implicated in muscle and nervous system formation. These studies shed significant new light on Fxr1p function(s).

In this paper, we review data on diagnosis and clinical features of BD that could be used in genetic studies to better characterize patients or to define homogeneous subgroups. Clinical symptoms, long-term course, comorbid conditions, and response to prophylactic treatment may define groups associated with more or less specific loci. One such group is characterized by symptoms of psychosis and linkage to 13q and 22q. A second group includes mainly bipolar II patients with comorbid panic disorder, rapid mood switching, and evidence of chromosome 18 linkage. A third group comprises typical BD with an episodic course and favourable response to lithium prophylaxis. Reproducibility of cognitive deficits across studies raises the possibility of using cognitive profiles as endophenotypes of BD, with deficits in verbal explicit memory and executive function commonly reported. Brain imaging provides a more ambiguous data set consistent with heterogeneity of the illness.

Loss of vision in glaucomatous optic neuropathy is caused by the selective degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor in glaucoma, but visual field defects continue to progress in some patients despite the use of drugs that lower intraocular pressure. At present, there are no effective neuroprotective strategies for the treatment of this disease. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2 pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism used by several peptide factors to promote cell survival. Here we tested if selective activation of Erk1/2 protected RGCs in a rat model of experimental glaucoma. We used recombinant adeno-associated virus to transcluce RGCs with genes encoding constitutively active or wild-type MEK1 (approved gene symbol MAMI), the upstream activator of Erk1/2. MEKI gene transfer into RGCs markedly increased neuronal survival: 1366 +/- 70 RGCs/mm(2) (mean SEM) were alive in the dorsal retina at 5 weeks after ocular hypertension surgery, a time when only 680 +/- 86 RGCS/mm(2) of these neurons remained in control eyes. We conclude that the Erk1/2 pathway plays a key role in the protection of RGCs from ocular hypertensive damage. This study identifies a novel gene therapy strategy in which selective activation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway effectively slows cell death in glaucoma.

J	Holahan, MR				Holahan, MR			Complementary roles for the amygdala and hippocampus during different phases of appetitive information processing	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						amygdala; hippocampus; conditioned cue preference; appetitive conditioning; muscimol	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DORSAL STRIATUM; CONTEXTUAL FEAR; MEMORY-SYSTEMS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; DRUG REWARD; AMPHETAMINE; LESIONS; ACQUISITION	Evidence collected from rodent models of memory storage suggests that rapid forms of learning engage the involvement of multiple brain regions each of which may participate in a different component of information processing. The present study used temporary inactivation of the amygdala and hippocampus during different phases of information processing on a one-trial appetitive-conditioning task to examine how these two regions might participate in the storage of appetitive memories. Male Long Evans rats were chronically implanted into the amygdala or dorsal hippocampus and food deprived. Rats were trained on a radial maze conditioned cue preference task where training occurred in one 40-min session and testing took place 24 h later. The amygdala or hippocampus was inactivated separately with muscimol (50 ng/mu l) injected immediately before or after training, or immediately before testing. Saline-injected rats displayed a conditioned preference by spending more time in the arm that previously contained food than in the arm that did not contain food. Muscimol injected into the amygdala before training or testing blocked the conditioned preference. Muscimol injected into the hippocampus immediately after training blocked the conditioned preference. These results suggest that the processing of memories may require multiple contributions from separate brain systems for at least short-term (24 h) storage. The resulting output from each system may converge on a similar downstream target to influence behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VPS13A is located in a tail-to-tail arrangement with GNA14 on chromosome 9q21. ChAc shows substantial allelic heterogeneity, with no single VPS13A mutation causing the majority of cases. We examined 11 patients in four French Canadian ChAc pedigrees for mutations in VPS13A. Affected members of three families were homozygous for a 37-kb deletion of the four terminal exons of VPS13A (EX70_EX73del). This deletion also encompasses the two terminal exons of GNA14. Two affected females in family 4 were homozygous for the splicing mutation 4242+1G > T. Remarkably, the affected males in this highly consanguineous pedigree were compound heterozygotes for EX70_EX73del and 4242+1G > T. PCR analysis of the deletion breakpoint junction revealed that an additional patient with French Canadian ancestry was heterozygous for the EX70_EX73del allele. The identification of a common 9q21 haplotype associated with EX70_EX73del in at least four apparently unrelated ChAc families implies that ChAc shows a founder effect in French Canadians, and that routine testing for EX70_EX73del in suspected ChAc cases may therefore be worthwhile in this population. The deletion breakpoint PCR described here will enable rapid identification of both homozygous and heterozygous carriers of EX70_EX73del.

J	Lovasik, JV; Kergoat, H; Gagnon, M				Lovasik, John V.; Kergoat, Helene; Gagnon, Marc			Experimentally Reduced Perfusion of One Eye Impairs Retinal Function in Both Eyes	OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE			English	Article						ocular perfusion pressure; contralateral effect; pattern electroretinogram; retinal vascular regulation		Purpose. The oscillatory potential index of scotopic white flash electroretinograms is reversibly enhanced in the contralateral eye when the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) to the test eye is transiently reduced. A transient increase in the intraocular pressure (IOP) and decrease in the OPP in the test eye induced quantifiable vascular changes in the optic nerve head of the contralateral eye. We explored this contralateral phenomenon looking at ganglion cell function in both eyes during elevated IOP and decreased OPP in the test eye only. Our specific objective was to characterize the effects that transient hypoperfusion had on the neural generators of the pattern-reversal electroretinograms (pERGs), the ganglion cells, and preganglion neurons. Methods. A transient elevation in the IOP was sustained in 10 healthy subjects by scleral suction to reduce the baseline OPP by 15, 30, 45, and 60% for 2-min intervals. For each level of OPP, pERGs were evoked by a checkerboard with 75 minarc high-contrast black-white checks reversing at 5 Hz and recorded bilaterally using DTL fiber electrodes. The pERGs were also recorded immediately after removal of scleral suction and at 2-min intervals thereafter for an 8-min recovery interval. Results. The unilateral decrease in OPP differentially reduced the pERG in the test and contralateral eyes. The pERG for the test eye returned to baseline amplitude within 2 min of removing the suction cup. In contrast, the pERG in the contralateral eye remained below baseline throughout the entire 8-min recovery interval. Conclusions. The observation of a bilateral decrease in the pERGs while the OPP was decreased in the test eye only suggested that these neuronal changes were modified at more central visual centers for retinal function to be compromised bilaterally. This latter effect may have been mediated by the transiently altered OPP or yet unknown neurohormonal mechanisms.

PHYSICS; DETECTOR; SUPERSYMMETRY; CALORIMETER; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; TEV	We present a measurement of the top pair production cross section in p (p) over bar collisions at root s=1.96 TeV. We collect a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 194 +/- 11 pb(-1) with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We use an artificial neural network technique to discriminate between top pair production and background processes in a sample of 519 lepton+jets events, which have one isolated energetic charged lepton, large missing transverse energy and at least three energetic jets. We measure the top pair production cross section to be sigma(t (t) over bar)=6.6 +/- 1.1 +/- 1.5 pb, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.

PHYSICS; COLLIDERS	We present a search for electroweak production of single top quarks in the s-channel and t-channel using neural networks for signal-background separation. We have analyzed 230 pb(-1) of data collected with the DO detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV and find no evidence for a single top quark signal. The resulting 95% confidence level upper limits on the single top quark production cross sections are 6.4 pb in the s-channel and 5.0 ph in the t-channel. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Milner, B				Milner, B			The medial temporal-lobe amnesic syndrome	PSYCHIATRIC CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA			English	Article							BILATERAL HIPPOCAMPAL LESIONS; ENDURING MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; VISUAL RECOGNITION; RETENTION; EXCISION; MONKEYS; COMPLEX; PATIENT; SYSTEM; FORNIX	Memory forms a bridge between past and present and implies the existence of enduring changes in the brain. This historical review reviews memory research in the 1950s and shows how the systematic study of a few patients with profound anterograde amnesia, resulting from bilateral damage to the medial structures of the temporal lobe, provided early evidence for the existence of multiple memory systems in the human brain. Acceptance of these findings hinged on the subsequent discovery of an appropriate animal model, with convergent findings from neurobehavioral studies in human and nonhuman primates. This collaborative work of neuropsychologists, neuroanatomists, and neurosurgeons points to the value of a cross-disciplinary approach.

They defined 21 recommendations for general practitioners, long-term care physicians and specialists based on knowledge available in 2005. At all stages of the disease, the objective of care is to improve as much as possible quality-of-life for the patient and his/her family, including a life project until the end of life. It is always possible to do something for these patients and their family: nutritional status, behavior disorders, and incapacities to deal with basic activities of daily life have to be taken in consideration. Ressource allocation and proximity care have to be targeted. Research areas necessary to improve the care of patients with severe dementia has been selected.

Soc Biol Psychiat		schizophrenia; family history; response to neuroleptics		Objective: It is suggested that schizophrenic patients who respond to neuroleptic medication and those who do not might differ with respect to their pathogenesis. In particular, it has been proposed that genetic factors may contribute to treatment response and/or outcome. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the pattern of familial aggregation of schizophrenia related disorders in schizophrenic patients who are either responders (R) or nonresponders (NR) to typical neuroleptics. Method: R (n=36) or NR (n=35) patients to typical neuroleptics and healthy controls (n=63) were recruited. At least one key informant relative of each proband was interviewed blind as to the status of the proband using the Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Morbid risk for schizophrenia and cluster A personality disorders and family loading score for schizophrenia were examined in first- and second-degree relatives of these probands. Results: First-degree relatives of NR patients were at a significantly higher risk for schizophrenia (MR=8.84), compared, respectively, to relatives of controls (MR=1.52) or relatives of R patients (MR=2.45). The same pattern was observed in second-degree relatives. Family loading score for schizophrenia in first- and second-degree relatives was significantly higher in NR compared to R patients.

The autosomal dominant form of this disease is caused by a polyalanine expansion from 10 to 12-17 residues, located at the N-terminus of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). A distinct pathological hallmark of OPMD is the presence of filamentous intranuclear aggregates in patients' skeletal muscle cells. Wildtype PABPN1 protein is expressed ubiquitously and was shown to be mostly concentrated in discrete nuclear domains called 'speckles'. Using an established cell- culture model, we show that most mutant PABPN1- positive (alanine expanded form) intranuclear aggregates are structures distinct from intranuclear speckles. In contrast, the promyelocytic leukaemia protein, a major component of nuclear bodies, strongly colocalized to intranuclear aggregates of mutant PABPN1. Wildtype PABPN1 can freely shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We determined whether the nuclear environment is necessary for mutant PABPN1 inclusion formation and cellular toxicity. This was achieved by inactivating the mutant PABPN1 nuclear localization signal and by generating full-length mutant PABPN1 fused to a strong nuclear export sequence. A green fluorescence protein tag inserted at the N-terminus of both wildtype PABPN1 (ala10) and mutant PABPN1 (ala17) proteins allowed us to visualize their subcellular localization. Targeting mutant PABPN1 to the cytoplasm resulted in a significant suppression of both intranuclear aggregates formation and cellular toxicity, two histological consequences of OPMD. Our results indicate that the nuclear localization of mutant PABPN1 is crucial to OPMD pathogenesis.

Fourteen right-handed healthy volunteers had to practice 15 min daily a sequence of eight moves using the left hand. MRI sessions were performed on days 1, 14 and 28. In both putamen, activation decreased with practice in rostrodorsal (associative) regions. In contrast, there was a significant signal increase in more caudoventral (sensorimotor) regions of the putamen. Subsequent correlation analyses between signal variations and behavioral variables showed that the error rate (movement accuracy) was positively correlated with signal changes in areas activated during early learning, whereas reaction time (movement speed) was negatively correlated with signal changes in areas activated during advanced learning stages, including the sensorimotor putamen and globus pallidus. These results suggest the possibility that motor representations shift from the associative to the sensorimotor territories of the striato-pallidal complex during the explicit learning of motor sequences, suggesting that motor skills are stored in the sensorimotor territory of the basal ganglia that supports a speedy performance.

We investigated whether the hippocampus is activated by discrimination of stimulus-stimulus relationships in novel versus familiar pairs of visual stimuli in 15 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were asked to recognize the previously rewarded stimulus in each case. We found significantly greater activation of the right hippocampus when discriminating previously seen compared with novel pairs of visual stimuli. This activation was evident in individual subjects and was not related to stimulus novelty, reward contingency, or task instruction. Right hippocampal activation during discrimination of previously seen pairs of objects was correlated with activity in the anteromedial thalamus, cingulate cortex, and contralateral hippocampus.

Like memory, synaptic plasticity includes an early phase that depends on modification of pre-existing proteins, and a late phase that requires transcription and synthesis of new proteins(1,2). Activation of postsynaptic targets seems to trigger the transcription of plasticity-related genes. The new mRNAs are either translated in the soma or transported to synapses before translation. GCN2, a key protein kinase, regulates the initiation of translation. Here we report a unique feature of hippocampal slices from GCN2(-/-) mice: in CA1, a single 100-Hz train induces a strong and sustained long-termpotentiation ( late LTP or L-LTP), which is dependent on transcription and translation. In contrast, stimulation that elicits L-LTP in wild-type slices, such as four 100-Hz trains or forskolin, fails to evoke L-LTP in GCN2(-/-) slices. This aberrant synaptic plasticity is mirrored in the behaviour of GCN2(-/-) mice in the Morris water maze: after weak training, their spatial memory is enhanced, but it is impaired after more intense training. Activated GCN2 stimulates mRNA translation of ATF4, an antagonist of cyclic-AMP-response-element-binding protein ( CREB). Thus, in the hippocampus of GCN2(-/-) mice, the expression of ATF4 is reduced and CREB activity is increased. Our study provides genetic, physiological, behavioural and molecular evidence that GCN2 regulates synaptic plasticity, as well as learning and memory, through modulation of the ATF4/CREB pathway.

In the work presented here, we tested this hypothesis by training eight nonmusicians to associate each of four different complex musical sounds ( triad chords) with an arbitrary number in a task designed to have limited analogy to absolute-pitch identification. Each subject underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning procedure both before and after training. Active condition ( identification of chords)-control condition (amplitude-matched noise bursts) comparisons for the pretraining scan showed no significant activation maxima. The same comparison for the posttraining scan revealed significant peaks of activation in posterior dorsolateral prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal, and parietal areas. A conjunction analysis was performed to show that the posterior dorsolateral prefrontal activity in this study is similar to that observed in the aforementioned PET study. We conclude that the posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is selectively involved in the conditional association aspect of our task, as it is in the attribution of a verbal label to a note by absolute-pitch musicians.

All reported mutations predict the production of truncated forms of Alsin suggesting a loss of function mechanism for these motor neuron disorders. Here we used the tetracycline-regulated expression system to overexpress the full-length and truncated forms of Alsin in different cell lines. Alsin overexpression caused severe phenotypic changes in monkey COS-7 cells including the enlargement and accumulation of early endosomes, impairment of mitoebondria trafficking and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. Our results further demonstrate the requirement of the Alsin VPS9 domain for occurrence of the vacuolation process and the role of Alsin as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5. Transfected human SW 13 cells exhibited an unexpected centrosomal localization for Alsin that was linked to the presence of the c-terminal part of the protein. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a colocalization of Alsin with the centrosomal markers gamma-tubulin and A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP-450). Similar results were obtained with human LA-N-2 and SK-N-SH neuronal cells. Moreover endogenous Alsin was detected in a centrosome preparation purified from human cortical brain. Considering the crucial role of centrosome in the production of microtubules required for intracellular transport, these findings are of potential relevance for unravelling the disease mechanisms linked to Alsin mutations.

Little is known about proteins that modulate and interact with the cytoskeleton during myelination. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) in mediating process formation in OLs. In this study, we report that tubulin is a major CNP-interacting protein. In vitro, CNP binds preferentially to tubulin heterodimers compared with MTs and induces MT assembly by copolymerizing with tubulin. CNP overexpression induces dramatic morphology changes in both glial and nonglial cells, resulting in MT and F- actin reorganization and formation of branched processes. These morphological effects are attributed to CNP MT assembly activity; branched process formation is either substantially reduced or abolished with the expression of loss-of-function mutants. Accordingly, cultured OLs from CNP-deficient mice extend smaller outgrowths with less arborized processes. We propose that CNP is an important component of the cytoskeletal machinery that directs process outgrowth in OLs.

Using single-cell multiplex RT-PCR (sc-RT-mPCR), we show that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 mRNAs were coexpressed in most of the sampled neurons from the rat hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum at postnatal Day (P)14 but not P60. In accordance, changes in VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 mRNA concentrations were found to occur in these and other brain areas between P14 and P60, as revealed by semiquantitative RT-PCR and quantitated by ribonuclease protection assay. VGLUT1 and -2 coexpression in the hippocampal formation is supported further by in situ hybridization data showing that virtually all cells in the CA1-CA3 pyramidal and granule cell layers were highly positive for both transcripts until P14. It was revealed using sc-RT-mPCR that transcripts for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were also present in neurons of the cerebellum, striatum, and septum that expressed markers for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic or cholinergic phenotypes, as well as in hippocampal cells containing transcripts for the glial fibrillary acidic protein. Our study suggests that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 proteins may often transport glutamate into vesicles within the same neuron, especially during early postnatal development, and that they are expressed widely in presumed glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons, as well as in astrocytes. Furthermore, our study shows that such coexpressing neurons remain in the adult brain and identifies several areas that contain them in both young and adult rats. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This study examined the differences in tactile hypersensitivity across 6 different strains of male mice, and between male and female rats of 3 different strains in a rodent model of low back pain associated with lumbar radiculopathy. Objective. We investigated the possibility that differences in tactile allodynia following the same nerve root injury are affected by genotype and sex in rodents. Summary of Background Data. Low back pain associated with radiculopathy affects countless people throughout the world, encompassing a wide range of individual pain susceptibility. The roles of genetics and sex on differences in nociceptive sensitivities following lumbar nerve root injury have yet to be fully characterized. Methods. Six strains of mice (BALB/cJ, CBA/J, C57BL/6J, 129P3/J, C3H/HeJ, and C58/J; all males) and male and female Sprague Dawley, Holtzman, and Long-Evans rats underwent a lumbar nerve root injury followed by assessment of tactile allodynia. Results. The most sensitive mouse strains following nerve root injury were: 129P3/J, C58/J, and BALB/cJ; and the less sensitive strains were: C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and CBA/J. Female Sprague Dawley and Long-Evans rats displayed increased hypersensitivity following nerve root injury compared to males. No sex differences were observed in Holtzman rats. Conclusions. Different mouse strains, and male and female rats that are exposed to identical nerve root injuries have diverse levels of tactile hypersensitivity, supporting the hypothesis that genetic factors and sex play a key role in radicular pain. Our results correlate with data compiled in identical mouse and rat strains after L5 - L6 nerve ligation, suggesting that the precise nature of the injury is not relevant to the inheritance of neuropathic symptom sensitivity.

Its clinical prognosis correlates with the expression of members of the Trk neurotrophin receptor family, which includes TrkA and TrkB. TrkA expression is associated with favorable prognosis, whereas TrkB expression is associated with poor prognosis. Here we show that TrkA expression induces the apoptosis of NB cells and does so by modulating the levels or activities of a number of proteins involved in regulating cell survival and apoptosis, including p53, Bcl-2, and caspase-3. TrkA increased the expression of p53 target proteins and failed to induce apoptosis in cells where p53 was inactivated by mutation or via expression of dominant inhibitory p53 or E1B55K, indicating that TrkA mediates apoptosis, at least in part, through p53. Treatment with a caspase inhibitor or overexpression of Bcl-X-L also prevented TrkA from inducing apoptosis. In contrast, elevated expression of TrkA in non-transformed sympathetic neurons resulted in the suppression of p53 levels and enhanced survival. These results identify apoptosis as a novel biological response of TrkA in NB cells and imply that TrkA is a good prognosis marker for NB due in part to its ability to mediate apoptosis when expressed at sufficient levels.

Herein we show that the Tudor domains of the spinal muscular atrophy gene product SMN, the splicing factor 30 kDa ( SPF30), and the Tudor domain-containing 3 ( TDRD3) proteins interacted with arginine-glycine-rich motifs in a methylarginine-dependent manner. The Tudor domains also associated with methylarginine-containing cellular proteins, providing evidence that methylated arginines represent physiological ligands for this protein module. In addition, we report that spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles core Sm proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm when arginine methylation was inhibited with adenosine dialdehyde or in the presence of an excessive amount of unmethylated arginine-glycine-rich peptides. These data provide in vivo evidence in support of a role for arginine methylation in the proper assembly and localization of spliceosomal Sm proteins.

Well-designed evaluations of health services are frequently made today. However, the extent of the evaluations' benefits and costs is not well documented, creating uncertainty whether their use is optimal from society's perspective. We examined these costs and benefits using data from one well-designed evaluation, the Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project (QNSP). It screened most Quebec newborns between 1989 and 1994 for neuroblastoma. As previously reported, the screening did not reduce neuroblastoma mortality and caused adverse health effects. Methods: We compared the cost of doing the QNSP with its benefits. Had the QNSP not been undertaken, neuroblastoma screening would have been implemented throughout North America. We assume that screening would have started in 1989 and ended in 2002. The QNSP's benefits include the health costs and adverse health effects averted by not using ineffective screening during those 14 years. In our calculations we used neuroblastoma incidence data for the QNSP and for Ontario where there was no screening, detailed data describing the health services used by the patients, and Quebec cost data for those services. Results: The QNSP cost $8.77 million (2002 US dollars). By not implementing similar screening programs between 1989 and 2002, the United States and Canada avoided $574.1 million in health costs, the unnecessary treatment of 9223 children, and false-positive findings for 5003 children screened. Conclusions: The health care costs and adverse health effects averted by the QNSP justify its costs. These results show that well-designed evaluations can yield-at least sometimes-benefits substantially greater than their high costs. This raises an important policy issue: are these evaluations now being under-or over used?.

Two alleles (L764P and W887R) showed loss-of-function, whereas a third (T345A) is fully functional but with altered Na,K-ATPase kinetics. This study describes two additional mutants, R689Q and M731T, originally identified by Vanmolkot et al. [Vanmolkot, K. R., et al. (2003) Ann. Neurol. 54, 360-366], which we show here to also be functional and kinetically altered. Both mutants have reduced catalytic turnover and increased apparent affinity for extracellular K+. For both R689Q and M731T, sensitivity to vanaclate inhibition is decreased, suggesting that the steady-state E-1 double left right arrow E-2 poise of the enzyme is shifted toward El. Whereas the K'(ATP) is not affected by the R689Q replacement, the M731T mutant has an increase in apparent affinity for ATP. Analysis of the structural changes effected by T345A, R689Q, and M731T mutations, based on homologous replacements in the known crystal structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, provides insights into the molecular bases for the kinetic alterations. It is suggested that the disease phenotype is the consequence of lowered molecular activity of the a2 pump isoform due to either decreased K+ affinity (T345A) or catalytic turnover (R689Q and M731T), thus causing a delay in extracellular K+ clearance and/or altered localized Ca2+ handling/signaling secondary to reduced activity in colocalized Na+/Ca2+ exchange.

Reactive oxygen species play a major role in apoptosis induction and enactment. Using two polyclonal PC12 populations that, respectively, do or do not express p75NTR, this paper demonstrates that p75NTR expression confers resistance to oxidant stress upon PC12 cells maintained in serum-containing medium. The effect of p75NTR on cell survival is mimicked in p75-negative cells by expression of constructs that produce the p75NTR intracellular domain (ICD) or p75NTR with the extracellular domain deleted (Delta ECD), suggesting that binding of an extracellular ligand to p75NTR is not required. Our studies further document that the differential sensitivity to oxidant stress is serum-dependent and associated with differential oxidation of glutathione between p75-positive and p75-negative cells. These results suggest that the role of p75NTR in determining the consequences and treatment of age-related disorders and conditions in which reactive oxygen species are involved may require neither the extracellular receptor domain nor, by inference, the cognate extracellular ligands of this neurotrophin receptor.

During 18 years of follow-up, from 1982 to 2000, there were 81,114 cancer deaths. Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain adjusted relative risks for all cancer mortality and for cancer mortality at 12 sites associated with allergy indicators. There were significant inverse associations between a history of both asthma and hay fever and overall cancer mortality (relative risk (RR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83, 0.93) and colorectal cancer mortality (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.91) in comparison with persons with neither of these allergic conditions. A history of hay fever only was associated with a significantly lowered risk of pancreatic cancer mortality, and a history of asthma only was associated with a significantly lowered risk of leukemia mortality. In never smokers, these associations persisted but were no longer significant. Results for mortality from cancer at other sites were less consistent. Collectively, these results suggest an inverse association between a history of allergy and cancer mortality; however, the strength of evidence for this association is limited.

By use of genealogical reconstructions of maternal lineages, a woman married in Quebec City in 1669 is identified as the shared female ancestor for 11 of 13 affected individuals, who were previously not known to be related. These individuals carry identical mitochondrial haplogroups. The current geographic distribution of French Canadian cases overlaps with that of the founder's female descendants in 1800. This is the first example of genealogical reconstruction to identify the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation by a woman in a founder population.

In separate testing, flash electroretinograms (ERGs) provided electrophysiological indexes of the relative response of short-wave cones (s-cones) and rods to blue light stimulation. Group-averaged, normalized ChBF measurements revealed that it was modulated by similar to 9% by flicker frequency. Increasing the blue flicker luminance from low to high attenuated the subfoveal ChBF, volume, and velocity by similar to 32%, similar to 30%, and similar to 5%, respectively. Decreasing the luminance from high to low over the same range had no effect on the subfoveal choroidal hemodynamics. The markedly different effects of reversed directions of change in blue flicker luminance on the subfoveal ChBF were linked to transitions between rod-dominated and s-cone-dominated retinal responses. Collectively, these findings indicate that the blue light-induced photoreceptor response is associated with a differential distribution of the ChBF across the ocular fundus according to the degree and type of retinal photoreceptor stimulated.

We tested, for the first time, the role of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in suppressing pain in partial sciatic nerve ligation-injured rats. Six groups of male Wistar rats were fed an identical casein-based, fat-free diet for I wk preceding partial sciatic nerve ligation injury and for 1 wk thereafter. In addition, rats received, via gavage, I mL/day of pure canola, corn, hemp, SOY, or sunflower oil, differing significantly in their omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid content, or I mL of plain water. Responses to tactile and noxious heat stimuli were recorded before and after surgery and a difference score was calculated for each group by subtracting the preoperative from the post-partial sciatic nerve ligation values. Heat hyperalgesia, but not tactile allodynia, was significantly different among the dietary groups (P = 0.005). Heat hyperalgesia of rats fed hemp oil, developing the most robust response, was significantly larger compared with rats fed corn oil, developing the least pain model (difference score: 24.3 +/- 4.1 s versus 6.1 +/- 3.1 s, respectively, P < 0.001). These oils contain similar levels of (omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (hemp, 60%; corn, 58%) but their omega-3 levels are 28-fold different (20% versus 0.7%, respectively). A significant correlation was found among dietary levels of omega-3, but not omega-6 or the omega-3/omega-6 ratio, of the six dietary groups and heat hyperalgesia (P = 0.006). We conclude that dietary oil might predict levels of neuropathic pain in rats and that this effect may be associated with dietary omega-3 levels.

Nine isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticits and one isolate each of Vibrio fluvialis, Vibrio hollisae, and Vibrio vulnificus were analyzed. Pyrolysis mass spectra, generated via an alternative ionization method, metastable atom bombardment, were subject to principal component-discriminant analysis. The spectral patterns were used to distinguish Vibrio isolates differing in species, serotype and expression of the thermostable direct hemolysin gene. The patterns of similarity and dissimilarity amongst spectra in the Vibrio test set generally reflected those associated with species, serotype or hemolysin-producing genes, though the combined influence of these and other variables in the multi-dimensional data did not produce a simple clustering with respect to any one of these characteristics. These results suggested that with enough examples to model the most common combinations, the method should be able to characterize Vibrio isolates according to their phenotypic characteristics. Pyrolysis-mass spectrometry with metastable atom bombardment and pattern recognition appeared suitable for rapid infraspecific comparison of Vibrio isolates. This integrated analytical, pattern-recognition system should be examined further for potential utility in clinical and public health diagnostic contexts.

With the anticipated wide use of CL-20, there is the potential for soil and groundwater contamination resulting in adverse toxicologic effects on environmental receptors. Presently, there is a lack of data describing the toxic effects of CL-20 on avian species. The present study describes the effect of CL-20 on Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) modified from standard toxicity test guidelines. First, a 14-day subacute assay was adopted using repeated gavage doses (0, 307, 964, 2439, 3475, or 5304 mg CL-20/kg body weight (BW)/d for 5 days followed by no CL-20 exposure (vehicle only) for 10 days. Second, a subchronic feeding assay (0, 11, 114, or 1085 mg CL-20/kg feed) was done for 42 days. During both studies, no overt toxicity was observed in the CL-20-treated birds. During the first 5 days of the subacute study, CL-20-exposed birds showed a dose-dependent decrease in BW gain, whereas increased liver weight, plasma sodium, and creatinine levels were observed in birds receiving the highest dose tested. For the subchronic study, embryo weights were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Embryos from CL-20-exposed birds were observed to have multiple cranial and facial deformities, beak curvatures, possible mid-brain enlargement, and classic one-sided development with micro-opthalamia (nonstatistical comparisons with control embryos). A trend toward decreased number of eggs laid per female bird was also observed. We conclude that CL-20 (or its degradation products) elicits few effects in adults but may affect avian development, although these preliminary findings should be confirmed.

Norms for 15- to 34-year-olds for different versions of the finger-to-nose test. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2005;86:1665-9. Objectives: To develop norms for the time to execute different versions of the finger-to-nose test (FNT) and to determine the effects of different testing procedures on performance in people aged 15 to 34 years. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Research center. Participants: Healthy subjects (149 men, 148 women; age range, 15-34y) participated, and 36 men and 36 women were included in each of the 4 age categories studied (15-19y, 20-24y, 25-29y, 30-34y). Participants performed, in random order, 5 forms of the test in 2 positions (sitting, supine) with the right and left upper limbs (ULs). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Time (in seconds) to complete 5 cycles of movement. Results: Test version and side of UL were found to affect performances; right-sided performances were faster than left-sided. Performances did not vary significantly (P >.001) with sex or among age categories; therefore, the results are presented for the group. Mean performances varied from 3.44 to 4.29 seconds. Subsequent analysis of variance (with data for each UL) showed main effects for testing position (sitting > lying) and eye condition (eyes open > eyes closed). Versions were strongly interrelated (.85 < r <.98). Conclusions: Norms for the time to execute different FNT versions were developed for both ULs for healthy people ages 15 to 34 years.(c) 2005 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

M. Gibson and S. J. Shettleworth (2005) have shown that rats can simultaneously acquire both place and response information. Experiments in which these 2 kinds of information are presented sequentially (response followed by place), provide some evidence for blocking of place learning, suggesting an influence of information acquired by a response-learning system on the subsequent acquisition of information by a place-learning system. A detailed examination of the results in the context of information about the kinds of learning that take place on a maze suggests that the memory processes underlying the rats' behavior in this experiment were considerably more complex than is acknowledged by Gibson and Shettleworth. The discussion illustrates the importance of considering both behavioral and physiological information for understanding how learning and memory functions are organized in the brain.

The possibility that a local serotonergic network might also exist in the female gonads of vertebrate species, including mammals, remains poorly documented. To clarify this possibility, we investigated mouse cumulus cells, oocytes, and embryos for three key serotonergic components, namely, 5-HT itself; the rate-limiting enzyme for its production, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1); and the 5-HT-specific transporter (SLC6A4) required for modulating its cellular effects. Using a combination of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we showed that mouse cumulus cells, oocytes, and embryos contain 5-HT and SLC6A4, while only cumulus cells possess the 5-HT-producing enzyme TPH1 and may thus be the local source of 5-HT observed in their neighboring cells. With a semiquantitative assay in single cells, we demonstrated that 5-HT can actively be taken up by isolated oocytes when it is supplied exogenously in vitro. This 5-HT transport in isolated oocytes is driven by a classical serotonin transporter, expressed up to the blastocyst stage, that is sensitive to the antidepressants fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, which belong to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor family. All together, our results show that 5-HT may be produced locally by cumulus cells and that it can be actively taken up by mammalian oocytes and embryos as part of a likely larger serotonergic network possibly regulating various developmental processes much earlier than previously thought.

Methods and procedures: Six participants were recruited based on inclusion criteria. They had been living with a brain injury for an average of 14 years. The primary method of data collection was semi-structured interviews, which was supplemented by programme reports to enhance methodological triangulation. Results: The results revealed that factors influencing involvement in productive activities over time were conceptually linked to learning about one's capacity. These factors involved: an opportunity to try, support and feedback from others, experimenting, and participants' appraisals of themselves. Conclusions: Recommendations for clinical practice include incorporating the postulates of the social cognitive theory in rehabilitation and moving from a deficits approach towards a strengths model of practice.

J	Wieczorek, PM; Carli, F				Wieczorek, PM; Carli, F			Obstructive sleep apnea uncovered after high spinal anesthesia: a case report	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							SEDATION	Purpose: To illustrate how a patient's previously undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea was uncovered after administration of a spinal anesthetic with a high sensory blockade, and to discuss possible explanations for this occurrence and anesthetic implications. Clinical features: A 55-yr-old male presented for osteotomy and open reduction and internal fixation of his left femur secondary to malunion from a previous fracture. Past medical history consisted of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, bipolar disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and cluster headaches. A combined spinal-epidural technique was chosen. Isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% (15 mg), was provided for the spinal anesthetic, along with I mg iv miclazolam for procedural sedation and 0.5 mg iv droperidol for mild nausea. Throughout the operation, many apneic events were noted, often with respiratory efforts. The patient was easily arousable during each event and would breathe normally until the next episode. Vital signs remained stable throughout. Postoperative respirology consultation was requested, and a sleep study revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea. The patient was subsequently started on continuous positive airway pressure with marked improvement in symptoms, including the cluster headaches. Conclusion: Recent literature suggests that high spinal blockade can result in altered levels of arousal by producing a de-afferentation of peripheral proprioceptive and sensory stimuli necessary for maintaining an awake state. In patients predisposed to upper airway obstruction, decreasing the level of consciousness can result in airway obstruction as occurs during sleep in these patients. This serves to underline the importance of considering capnography for all cases utilizing a neuraxial anesthestic technique.

J	Moss, IR				Moss, IR			Canadian Association of Neuroscience Review: Respiratory control and behavior in humans: Lessons from imaging and experiments of nature	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review							OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; CENTRAL HYPOVENTILATION-SYNDROME; ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VOLITIONAL INSPIRATION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; MEDULLA-OBLONGATA; AIR HUNGER; CHILDREN; CHEMOSENSITIVITY	The purpose of this review is to demonstrate that respiration is a complex behavior comprising both brainstem autonomic control and supramedullary influences, including volition. Whereas some fundamental mechanisms had to be established using animal models, this review focuses on clinical cases and physiological studies in humans to illustrate normal and abnormal respiratory behavior. To summarize, central respiratory drive is generated in the rostroventrolateral medulla, and transmitted to both the upper airway and to the main and accessory respiratory muscles. Afferent feedback is provided from lung and muscle mechnoreceptors, peripheral carotid and aortic chemoreceptors, and multiple central chemoreceptors. Supramedullary regions, including cortex and subcortex, modulate or initiate breathing with volition, emotion and at the onset of exercise. Autonomic breathing control can be perturbed by brainstem pathology including space occupying lesions, compression, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome. Sleep-wake states are important in regulating breathing. Thus, respiratory control abnormalities are most often evident during sleep, or during transition from sleep to wakefulness. Previously undiagnosed structural brainstem pathology may be revealed by abnormal breathing during sleep. Ondine's curse and 'the locked-in syndrome' serve to distinguish brainstem from supramedullary regulatory mechanisms in humans: The former comprises loss of autonomic respiratory control and requires volitional breathing for survival, and the latter entails loss of corticospinal or corticobulbar tracts required for volitional breathing, but preserves autonomic respiratory control.

The International League against Epilepsy has suggested the term "visual-sensitive" replace "photosensitive". Visual-sensitive seizures may be more common than is realized. A classification for visual-sensitive epilepsies is presented. Chromosomal and DNA testing may help to refine the classification further. A standardized approach for neurophysiologic testing, such as that proposed by European experts, is recommended. These steps should promote evidenced-based management for this group of disorders.

Worldwide recognition of the RTT clinical phenotype in the early 1980's allowed many cases to be diagnosed, and established RTT as one of the most common mental retardation syndromes in females. The years since then led to a refinement of the phenotype and the recent elaboration of Revised Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). Here, we study the impact of the presence versus the absence of the use of diagnostic criteria from the RDC to make a diagnosis of RTT on MECP2 mutation detection in Canadian patients diagnosed and suspected of having RTT. Methods: Using dHPLC followed by sequencing in all exons of the MECP2 gene, we compared mutation detection in a historic cohort of 35 patients diagnosed with RTT without the use of specific diagnostic criteria to a separate more recent group of 101 patients included on the basis of strict fulfillment of the RDC. Results: The MECP2 mutation detection rate was much higher in subjects diagnosed using a strict adherence to the RDC (20% vs. 72%). Conclusions: These results suggest that clinical diagnostic procedures significantly influence the rate of mutation detection in RTT, and more generally emphasize the importance of diagnostic tools in the assessment of neurobehavioral syndromes.

Methods: A retrospective hospital-based, follow-up study of infants treated in London, Ontario between 1985 and 1996. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interviews and clinic visits. Outcome was measured according to physical and cognitive scales. Perinatal risk factors and hemorrhage characteristics were correlated with final outcome. Results: For this study 66 infants with ICH were identified, of which seven died during the first week of life. We obtained follow-up in all but ten cases (median = 3-years; range 1.0 to 10.9 years). Overall, 57% of infants had no physical or cognitive deficits at follow-up. Death occurred most frequently among those with primarily subarachnoid hemorrhage (19%) and the most favorable outcomes occurred among those with subdural hemorrhage (80% had no disability). In univariate models, thrombocytopenia (platelet count <= 70 x 10(9)/L), increasing overall hemorrhage severity, frontal location and spontaneous vaginal delivery as opposed to forceps-assisted delivery increased risk for poor outcome. In multivariate models, all these factors tended towards increased risk, but only thrombocytopenia remained significant for physical disability (OR = 7.6; 95% CI = 1.02-56.6); thrombocytopenia was borderline significant in similar models for cognitive disability (OR = 4.6; 95% CI = 0.9-23.9). Conclusion: Although forceps-assisted delivery may contribute to ICH occurrence, our study found better outcomes among these infants than those who had ICH following a spontaneous vaginal delivery. Hemorrhage in the frontal lobe was the most disabling hemorrhage location and if multiple compartments were involved, disability was also more likely to occur. However, in this report we found that the factor that was most likely to contribute to poor outcome was thrombocytopenia and this remained important in multivariate analysis.

Transient focal lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) have been previously described in patients with epilepsy or without epilepsy but receiving antiepileptic drugs (AED). Case reports: Two epileptic patients were admitted to our long-term monitoring unit. Antiepileptic drugs were completely discontinued a few days later. One patient had no seizures. The other had three attacks, the last of which occurred two days before a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. In both cases brain MRI showed a lesion in the SCC characterized by high signal on T2-weighted images and no enhancement after Gadolinium infusion. The patients were discharged with their pre-admission medications. A follow-up MRI five weeks later showed resolution of the SCC lesions. Conclusions: The pathogenesis of transient SCC lesions in epileptic patients is still unclear. In our patients, either the sudden AED withdrawal or the seizures activity may be presumed to be the cause, though an individual susceptibility must also be considered.

Several mechanisms may exist for this phenomenon. Mechanisms for the lower incidence of TD with atypical antipsychotics also remain to be fully understood. We undertook to explore and better understand these mechanisms. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of TD pathophysiology literature from January 1, 1965, to January 31, 2004, using the terms tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, pathophysiology, and mechanisms. Additional articles were obtained by searching the bibliographies of relevant references. Articles were considered if they contributed to the current understanding of the pathophysiology of TD. Results: Current TD vulnerability models include genetic vulnerability, disease-related vulnerability, and decreased functional reserve. Mechanisms of TD induction include prolonged blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors, postsynaptic dopamine hypersensitivity, damage to striatal GABA interneurons, and damage of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Atypical antipsychotics may cause less TD because they have less impact on the basal ganglia and are less likely to cause postsynaptic dopamine hypersensitivity. Conclusion: Although the ultimate model for TD is not yet understood, it is plausible that several of these vulnerabilities and mechanisms act together to produce TD. The lower incidence of TD with atypical antipsychotics has helped to elucidate the mechanisms of TD.

The term "neuroactive steroid" (NAS) refers to steroids that, independent of their origin, are capable of modifying neural activities. NASs bind and modulate different types of membrane receptors. The gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and Sigma receptor complexes have been the most extensively studied, while glycine chloride channels, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and voltage-activated calcium channels, although less explored, are also modulated by NASs. Within the glutamate receptor family, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and kainate receptors have been shown to be targets for NA and NAS modulation. Inside the neuron, Oxidized ring A reduced pregnanes, tetrahydroprogesterone (THP), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) hind to the progesterone intracellular receptor (PR) and in this way can also regulate gene expression. Animal experimentation showed that cardinal symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and memory dysfunctions are partly regulated by NAS. In turn, NAS and NS levels are modulated by psychotropic medications. NS levels, as well as NAS plasma concentrations, change in patients with depression syndromes, the levels return to normal baseline with recovery, but normalization is not necessary for successful therapy. Rather than with nosological syndromes and psychiatric disorders, NAS and NS steroid levels seem to correlate with specific symptoms. Hence, it will be profitable to search for and establish symtom-steroid relationships, as well as pharmacological and endogenous factors that can modulate NS biosynthesis and NAS formation, to be able to use these steroids in therapy.

We sought to characterize reflex seizures in patients with MCDs and refractory epilepsy. Methods: Clinical, electrographic, and neuroimaging data were reviewed in eight patients with MCDs who had reflex seizures reproduced during presurgical evaluation. Results: All eight patients had both reflex and spontaneous seizures. In six, however, drop attacks or axial myoclonic seizures occurred only upon specific sensory stimulation. Reflex seizures were induced by more than one type of stimulus in most patients, but anatomofunctional correlations could usually be invoked. Six patients had significant intellectual impairment. Surgical resection controlled seizures in two patients. Conclusions: Reflex seizures in patients with MCDs may be medically refractory and may often manifest as drop attacks or axial myoclonus. Surgical resection of focal lesions can bring reflex seizures under control. Putative mechanisms related to the relatively low frequency of reflex seizures in MCDs are discussed.

Seizures are not uncommon in ChAc but have not been well characterized in the literature. We report two ChAc families in which patients presented with temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Detailed medical and family histories were obtained. EEG, video-telemetry, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with volumetric studies of amygdala and hippocampus, as well as neuropsychological testing were performed. Blood smears were examined for acanthocytosis. Mutation analysis of VPS13A was carried out in five patients. Results: Six patients in three sibships were initially seen with seizures. Age at seizure onset ranged from 22 to 38 years. Seizures preceded other clinical manifestations of ChAc by <= 15 years. The epileptic aura consisted of a sensation of deja-vu, fear, hallucinations, palpitations, or vertigo. EEG with video-telemetry showed epileptiform discharges originating either from one or both temporal lobes. Epilepsy was generally well controlled, but some patients had periods of increased seizure frequency requiring treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs). Both families shared a deletion of exons 70-73 of VPS13A, extending to exons 6-7 of GNA14. Conclusions: Temporal lobe epilepsy may be the presenting feature of ChAc and may delay its diagnosis. Epilepsy in ChAc patients represents a challenge, because seizures may at times be difficult to control, and some AEDs may worsen the involuntary movements.

J	Jass, JR				Jass, JR			The intestinal lesion of autistic spectrum disorder	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY			English	Article						autism; inflammation; intestine	LYMPHONODULAR HYPERPLASIA; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD	This editorial briefly reviews the significance of lymphoid nodular hyperplasia in the intestinal tract of children with autistic spectrum disorder. The distinction between physiological and pathological lymphoid hyperplasia of the intestinal tract is of importance in the context of a possible causative link with autism. A primary intestinal lesion may occur as part of the broad spectrum of immunological disorders to which autistic children are prone. This could result in increased intestinal permeability to peptides of dietary origin which may then lead to disruption of neuroregulatory mechanisms required for normal brain development Alternatively, there could be a primary defect in the translocation and processing of factors derived from the intestinal lumen. These possibilities deserve further investigation and should not be lost in the fog of the controversy regarding the role of measles/mumps/rubella vaccination in the aetiology of autistic spectrum disorder.

J	Petit, A; Kennedy, TE; Bagnard, D; Doucet, G				Petit, A; Kennedy, TE; Bagnard, D; Doucet, G			Membrane-associated guidance cues direct the innervation of forebrain and midbrain by dorsal raphe-derived serotonergic axons	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						axon guidance; development; explant culture; membrane stripe assay; rat	ADULT-RAT NEOSTRIATUM; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; UNIFIED NOMENCLATURE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CELL-ADHESION; GROWTH CONE; BRAIN; TERMINALS; ORGANIZATION	Unlike many neurons that extend an axon precisely to a single target, individual dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons project to multiple brain regions and their axon terminals often lack classical synaptic specializations. It is not known how 5-HT axon collaterals select between multiple target fields, or even if 5-HT axons require specific guidance cues to innervate their targets. Nor is it known how these axon collaterals are restrained within specific innervation target regions. To investigate this, we challenged explants of dorsal raphe with co-explants, or cell membrane preparations of ventral midbrain, striatum or cerebral cortex. We provide evidence for membrane-associated cues that promote 5-HT axon growth into each of these three target regions. The axon growth-promoting activity was heat-, protease- and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase-C (PI-PLC)-sensitive. Interestingly, 5-HT axons specifically lost the ability to grow in heterotypic explants, or membrane carpets, following contact with ventral midbrain or striatal, but not cortical, explants or membranes. This inductive activity associated with striatal and ventral midbrain membranes was sensitive to both high salt extraction and PI-PLC treatment. By contrast, the activity that inhibited 5-HT axon growth onto heterotypic membranes was sensitive only to high salt extraction. These results provide evidence that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane protein promotes 5-HT axon growth, and that short-range membrane-bound, as well as GPI-linked, molecules contribute to the guidance of 5-HT axon collaterals. These findings suggest that 5-HT axon collaterals acquire a target-induced growth-inhibitory response to alternative targets, increasing their selectivity for the newly innervated field.

J	Apkarian, AV; Bushnell, MC; Treede, RD; Zubieta, JK				Apkarian, AV; Bushnell, MC; Treede, RD; Zubieta, JK			Human brain mechanisms of pain perception and regulation in health and disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Review							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; PHANTOM-LIMB PAIN; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; NOXIOUS THERMAL-STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS	Context: The perception of pain due to an acute injury or in clinical pain states undergoes substantial processing at supraspinal levels. Supraspinal, brain mechanisms are increasingly recognized as playing a major role in the representation and modulation of pain experience, These neural mechanisms may then contribute to interindividual variations and disabilities associated with chronic pain conditions. Objective: To systematically review the literature regarding how activity in diverse brain regions creates and modulates the experience of acute and chronic pain states, emphasizing the contribution of various imaging techniques to emerging concepts. Data Sources: MEDLINE and PRE-MEDLINE searches were performed to identify all English-language articles that examine human brain activity during pain, using hemodynamic (PET, fMRI), neuroelectrical (EEG, MEG) and neurochemical methods (MRS, receptor binding and neurotransmitter modulation), from January 1, 1988 to March 1, 2003. Additional studies were identified through bibliographies. Study Selection: Studies were selected based on consensus across all four authors. The criteria included well-designed experimental procedures, as well as landmark studies that have significantly advanced the field. Data Synthesis: Sixty-eight hemodynamic studies of experimental pain in normal subjects, 30 in clinical pain conditions, and 30 using neuroelectrical methods met selection criteria and were used in a meta-analysis. Another 24 articles were identified where brain neurochemistry of pain was examined. Technical issues that may explain differences between studies across laboratories are expounded. The evidence for and the respective incidences of brain areas constituting the brain network for acute pain are presented. The main components of this network are: primary and secondary somatosensory, insular, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices (S1, S2, IC, ACC, PFC) and thalamus (Th). Evidence for somatotopic organization, based on 10 studies, and psychological modulation, based on 20 studies, is discussed, as well as the temporal sequence of the afferent volley to the cortex, based on neuroelectrical studies. A meta-analysis highlights important methodological differences in identifying the brain network underlying acute pain perception. It also shows that the brain network for acute pain perception in normal subjects is at least partially distinct from that seen in chronic clinical pain conditions and that chronic pain engages brain regions critical for cognitive/emotional assessments, implying that this component of pain may be a distinctive feature between chronic and acute pain. The neurochemical studies highlight the role of opiate and catecholamine transmitters and receptors in pain states, and in the modulation of pain with environmental and genetic influences. Conclusions: The nociceptive system is now recognized as a sensory system in its own right, from primary afferents to multiple brain areas. Pain experience is strongly modulated by interactions of ascending and descending pathways. Understanding these modulatory mechanisms in health and in disease is critical for developing fully effective therapies for the treatment of clinical pain conditions.

Methods: The sample included 70 patients with herniated disk, stenosis, chronic low back pain of unknown etiology or acute low back pain. They were assessed twice before treatment (test-retest) and a third measure six months to one year afterwards. Results: The mean time of administration was 24 and 20 min for the test and post-treatment evaluation, respectively. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was between 0.78 and 0.92 on the baseline test and 0.90 or higher on the post-treatment evaluation. The test-retest reproducibility was 0.95 (0.91-0.98) for 'neurological symptoms', 0.82 (0.63-0.91) for 'pain/disability' and 0.63 (0.25-0.82) for 'expectations'. The associations with other measures and clinical criteria were generally moderate to high and in the expected direction. The effect size for 'pain/disability' in combination with 'neurological symptoms' was 2.02 for patients who improved versus an effect of -0.09 in patients who were stable between test and retest; the area under the curve on this joint scale was 0.81 (0.69-0.90). Conclusions: The instrument is valid, sensitive to clinical changes and reliable for comparisons between groups, but further study is needed for its application in monitoring individual patients.

Following nerve injury, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), an important member of this family, is sequentially increased in neurons, microglia and astrocytes of the dorsal horn and gracile nucleus, and in injured large DRG neurons. Nerve injury-induced phosphorylation of ERK occurs early and is long-lasting. In several animal models of neuropathic pain, MEK inhibitors, known to suppress the synthesis of ERK, have proven effective to alleviate pain at various time points. Thus, the regulation of ERK/MAPK can be considered as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

The model makes it possible to infer, from behavioral data, the growth of the rewarding effect as a function of stimulation strength. Measurement of this function provides information about the stage of the reward circuitry where drugs or lesions alter the rewarding effect. The labor-supply model is used to illustrate how approaches drawn from economics, psychology, and neuroscience can inform each other. The model is linked to a set of psychological processes, including those responsible for transformation of the transient neural signal produced by the rewarding stimulation into an enduring record of payoff, estimation of a mean effort price, delay discounting, and estimation of the substitutability of work and leisure goods. All of these processes seem germane to economic behavior. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In anticipation of clinical application, we have reported the synthesis and characterization of a magnetized ferrofluid alginate that potentially allows tracking of these microcapsules in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We now report the properties of these ferrofluid microcapsules important for applications in gene therapy. When a mouse myoblast cell line was encapsulated in these microcapsules, it showed similar viability as in regular unmodified alginate capsules, both arc vitro and in vivo, in mice. The permeability of these magnetized microcapsules, a critical parameter for immunoisolation devices, was comparable to that of classic alginate in the transit of various recombinant molecules of various molecular masses (human factor IX, 65 kDa; murine IgG, 150 kDa; and beta-glucuronidase, 300 kDa). When followed by MRI in vitro and in vivo, the ferrofluid microcapsules remained intact and visible for extended periods, allowing quantitative monitoring of microcapsules. At autopsy, the ferrofluid microcapsules were mostly free within the intraperitoneal cavities, with no overt inflammatory response. Serological analyses demonstrated a high level of biocompatibility comparable to that of unmodified alginate. In conclusion, ferrofluid-enhanced alginate microcapsules are comparable to classic alginate microcapsules in permeability and biocompatibility. Their visibility and stability to MRI monitoring permitted qualitative and quantitative tracking of the implanted microcapsules without invasive surgery. These properties are important advantages for the application of immunoisolation devices in human gene therapy.

MTHFR is a critical enzyme in folate metabolism; the product of the MTHFR reaction, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, is required for homocysteine remethylation to methionine and synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). To understand the mechanisms by which MTHFR deficiency leads to significant neuropathology, we examined early postnatal brain development in mice with a homozygous knockout of the Mthfr gene. These mice displayed a dramatically reduced size of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, with enlarged lateral ventricles. Mthfr deficiency affected granule cell maturation, but not neurogenesis. Depletion of external granule cells and disorganization of Purkinje cells were mainly confined to the anterior lobules of mutant cerebella. Decreased cellular proliferation and increased cell death contributed to the granule cell loss. Reduced expression of Engrailed-2 (En2), Reelin (Reln) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1(Itpr1) genes was observed in the cerebellum. Supplementation of Mthfr(+/-) dams with an alternate methyl donor, betaine, reduced cerebellar abnormalities in the Mthfr(-/-) pups. Our findings suggest that MTHFR plays a role in cerebellar patterning, possibly through effects on proliferation or apoptosis. (c) 2005 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Twelve DSM-IV schizophrenia patients with blunted affect (BA+) were scanned before and after 22 weeks of quetiapine treatment. Whole-brain, voxel-based methods were used to assess the differential hemodynamic response to quetiapine. In addition, a post hoc comparison to an independent group of 11 schizophrenia patients without blunted affect (BA-) was performed to compare them with BA+ (postquetiapine) in response to emotion processing. A 22-week treatment with quetiapine resulted in significant clinical improvement in the 12 study completers (mean +/- SD posttreatment PANSS blunted affect score of 5.50 +/- 0.76 at baseline to 2.08 +/- 1.00 at end point; t = 7.78, df = 11, P < 0.0001). Treatment response was associated with significant BOLD changes: increases in prefrontal cortex activation particularly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA 46) and the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, BA 32); and in the left putamen, right anterior temporal pole (ATP), and right amygdala. Conversely, before treatment with quetiapine, the same subjects activated the midbrain bilaterally and the right pons. The post hoc conjunctional analyses demonstrated that BA- subjects activated the left ACC, left insula, left ATP (BA 21), left ATP (BA 38), left amygdala, and right medial prefrontal cortex. Quetiapine seems to affect clinical recovery by modulating the functioning of specific brain regions. Unique BOLD changes in the putamen and DLPFC with quetiapine, in the BA+ postquetiapine, may reflect modality-specific effects. Controlled studies are needed to further assess these preliminary findings.

Calculations were made using the respondents' history and self-reported symptoms during the previous 12 months. Five hundred twenty-two of 700 approached patients responded to the anonymous questionnaire. Of respondents, 20.1% (105/522) answered that they had experienced symptoms of a concussion after being hit in the head during the previous 12 months. Of the 105 respondents who experienced a concussion, 88.6% (93/105) did not recognize that they had suffered a concussion. There were 28.2% (147/522) of all respondents who were actively engaging in at least one activity that was considered to be at high risk for concussions. Headache was the most common symptom for both recognized and unrecognized concussions. Respondents who experienced nausea after being hit in the head were the most likely to seek some form of medical attention, followed by people who suffered a loss of consciousness. Those patients who suffered a loss of consciousness were the most likely to visit an ED. Many patients have a poor understanding of concussions and these patients may be actively participating in high-risk activities while still suffering symptoms from a concussion. Therefore, these patients may be at risk for further concussions and Second Impact Syndrome. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

One long-standing hypothesis is that object shapes are represented in terms of volumetric component parts and their spatial configuration. This hypothesis is examined in 3 experiments using a whole-part matching paradigm in which participants match object parts to whole novel 3D object shapes. Experiments 1 and 2, consistent with volumetric image segmentation, show that whole-part matching is faster for volumetric component parts than for either. Open or closed nonvolumetric regions of edge contour. However, the results of Experiment 3 show that an equivalent advantage is found for bounded regions of edge contour that correspond to object surfaces. The results are interpreted in terms of a surface-based model of 3D shape representation, which proposes edge-bounded 2-dimensional polygons as basic primitives of surface shape.

However, some studies have found low cortisol levels, while others have found elevated cortisol levels. The present study compared variously defined aggressive subgroups for differences in salivary cortisol. A population-based sample of boys was followed longitudinally from childhood to adolescence. Assessments of different forms of antisocial behaviour were obtained from various informants at several points in time, and cortisol was collected at age 13. Higher cortisol levels were found in boys with conduct disorder (CD) than in boys without CD. In addition, boys with an aggressive form of CD had higher cortisol levels than boys who showed a covert form of CD. Furthermore, reactive aggression was strongly correlated with elevated cortisol. Adolescent boys with chronic reactive aggression and those who scored high on aggressive CD symptoms seem to have a more active hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system.

To this end, Kir channels show a polarized subcellular distribution with the predominant channel subunit in Muller glia, Kir4.1, clustered in the endfeet of these cells at the inner limiting membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their distribution have yet to be identified. Here, we show that laminin, agrin and alpha-dystroglycan (DG) codistribute with Kir4.1 at the inner limiting membrane in the retina and that laminin-1 induces the clustering of alpha-DG, syntrophin and Kir4.1 in Muller cell cultures. In addition, we found that alpha-DG clusters were enriched for agrin and sought to investigate the role of agrin in their formation using recombinant C-agrins. Both C-agrin 4,8 and C-agrin 0,0 failed to induce alpha-DG clustering and neither of them potentiated the alpha-DG clustering induced by laminin-1. Finally, our data reveal that deletion of the PDZ-ligand domain of Kir4.1 prevents their laminin-induced clustering. These findings indicate that both laminin-1 and alpha-DG are involved in the distribution of Kir4.1 to specific Muller cell membrane domains and that this process occurs via a PDZ-domain-mediated interaction. Thus, in the basal lamina laminin is an essential regulator involved in clearing excess potassium released during neuronal activity, thereby contributing to the maintenance of normal synaptic transmission in the retina.

In the present study, intracellular transduction pathways required for the HA-mediated recognition by infiltrating glioma cells in brain was investigated. We show that the overexpression of the GTPase RhoA up-regulated MT1-MMP expression and triggered CD44 shedding from the U-87 glioma cell surface. This potential implication in cerebral metastatic processes was also observed in cells overexpressing the full-length recombinant MT1-MMP, while the overexpression of a cytoplasmic domain truncated from of MT1-MMP failed to do so. This suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP transduces intracellular signaling leading to RhoA-mediated CD44 shedding. Treatment of glioma cells with the Rho-kinase (ROK) inhibitor Y27632, or with EGCg, a green tea catechin with anti-MMP and anti-angiogenesis activities, antagonized both RhoA- and MT1-MMP-induced CD44 shedding. Conversely, overexpression of recombinant ROK stimulated CD44 release. Taken together, our results suggest that RhoA/ROK intracellular signaling regulates MT1-MMP-mediated CD44 recognition of HA. These molecular processes may partly explain the diffuse brain-infiltrating character of glioma cells within the surrounding parenchyma and thus be a target for new approaches to anti-tumor therapy.

This study aims to help delineate gabapentin's antihyperalgesic mechanisms. We assessed the effectiveness of gabapentin at decreasing mechanical and cold hypersensitivity induced in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Thus, we compared the effectiveness of pre- or post-treatment with systemic or intrathecal (i.t.) gabapentin at reducing the development and maintenance of the neuropathic pain symptoms. Gabapentin successfully decreased mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, both as a pretreatment and post-treatment. Furthermore, both i.t. and systemic administration of gabapentin were effective in reducing the behavioral hypersensitivity; however, the i.t. administration was superior to the systemic. We also examined gabapentin's effects at inhibiting hindpaw formalin-induced release of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) both in naive rats and in rats with neuropathic pain. We present the first evidence that gabapentin reduces the formalin-induced release of both glutamate and aspartate in SCDH. Furthermore, i.t. gabapentin reduces the enhanced noxious stimulus-induced spinal release of glutamate seen in neuropathic rats. These data suggest that gabapentin reduces neuropathic pain symptoms by inhibiting the release of glutamate in the SCDH.

Most data indicate that the locomotor central pattern generator ( CPG) shortens cycle duration mainly by shortening the durations of extensor rather than flexor phases of the step cycle. Here we report that in fictive locomotion elicited by electrical stimulation of the midbrain locomotor region ( MLR) in the cat, spontaneous variations in cycle duration were due more to changes in flexor rather than extensor phase durations in 22 of 31 experiments. The locomotor CPG is therefore not inherently extensor- or flexor- biased. We coined the term " dominant" to designate the phase ( flexion or extension) showing the larger variation. In a simple half- center oscillator model, experimental phase duration plots were fitted well by adjusting two parameters that corresponded to background drive (" bias") and sensitivity (" gain") of the oscillator's timing elements. By analogy we argue that variations in background drive to the neural timing elements of the CPG could produce larger variations in phase duration in the half- center receiving the lower background drive, i. e., background drive may determine which half- center is dominant. The fact that data from normal cats were also fitted well by the model indicates that sensory input and central drive combine to determine locomotor phase durations. We conclude that there is a considerable flexibility in the control of phase durations in MLR- induced fictive locomotion. We posit that this may be explained by changes in background excitation of neural timing elements in the locomotor CPG.

Apelin naturally occurs in the brain and plasma as 13 (pE13F) and 17 amino-acid (K17F) fragments of a single pro-peptide precursor. In transfected CHO cells, K17F and pE13F bind with high affinity to the rat APJ receptor, promote receptor internalization, and inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP formation. In the same cells, pE13F activates MAP kinase and P13 kinase pathways. Apelin and APJ receptors are both widely distributed in the brain but are particularly highly expressed in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) hypothalamic nuclei. Dual labeling studies demonstrate that within these two nuclei, apelin and its receptor are colocalized with vasopressin (AVP) in a subset of magnocellular neurons. In lactating rats, characterized by increases in both synthesis and release of AVP, central injection of apelin inhibits the phasic electrical activity of AVP neurons, reduces plasma AVP levels, and increases aqueous diuresis. Moreover, water deprivation, while increasing the activity of AVP neurons, reduces plasma apelin concentrations and induces an intra-neuronal pile up of the peptide, thereby decreasing the inhibitory effect of apelin on AVP release and preventing additional water loss at the kidney level. Taken together, these data demonstrate that apelin counteracts the effects of AVP in the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis. In addition, apelin and its receptor are present in the cardiovascular system, i.e. heart, kidney and vessels. Systemically administered apelin reduces arterial blood pressure, increases cardiac contractility and reduces cardiac loading. The development of non peptidic analogs of apelin may therefore offer new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.

Here, we address this issue by focusing upon C/EBP beta a transcription factor implicated in cellular injury and regeneration. We show that C/EBP beta mRNA is expressed in neurons throughout the mature brain and that levels of both C/EBP beta mRNA and phosphoprotein are increased in facial motor neurons following axonal injury. To determine the importance of these increases, we examined the regeneration-associated Tal alpha-tubulin gene which contains functional C/EBP binding sites in its promoter. In transgenic mice, expression of a minimal 176 nucleotide Tot] alpha-tubulin promoter:nlacZ reporter gene was upregulated in injured facial motor neurons. This injury-induced transcriptional increase was inhibited in C/EBP beta -/- mice. A similar inhibition was observed in C/EBP beta -/- mice that carried a larger 1.1-kb promoter Totl:nlacZ reporter construct. Moreover, in situ hybridization revealed that the injury-induced upregulation of the enclogenous mouse alpha 1 alpha-tubulin mRNA, and of a second regeneration-associated mRNA, GAP-43, was inhibited in C/FBP13 -/- mice. Thus, C/EBP beta is essential for the neuronal injury response, acting to transcriptionally activate regeneration-associated gene expression. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we have investigated the expression and distribution of individual gamma-protocadherins (Pcdhs-gamma) in the developing mouse brain. We find that transfection of Pcdh-gamma genes promotes calcium-dependent cell adhesion in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, Pcdh-gamma can be recruited to synapses of transfected primary hippocampal neurons. Several individual members of the in total 22 Pcdhs-gamma were chosen to examine the expression of the three subfamilies, Pcdh-gamma A, -gamma B, and -gamma C. These Pcdh-gamma transcripts are expressed all over the brain, with minor regional and cell-type specific differences. Interestingly, a distinct, later onset of expression is observed for Pcdh-gamma C5, a gene located at the end of the Pedh-gamma cluster. Largely overlapping expression patterns of individual Pcdh-gamma proteins are detected with anti-peptide antibodies. Small differences are observed in the staining of dendritic processes and synapse-rich layers. Our results support the idea that Pcdhs-gamma participate in neuronal differentiation and may be implicated in the fine-tuning of neuronal morphology and synaptogenesis. Cell autonomous regulation of transcription might generate the widespread distribution of individual Pcdh-gamma in the brain, which is strikingly different from the restricted expression patterns observed for classical cadherins. Thus, a defined set of Pcdhs-gamma may engage in neuronal adhesion and signaling on the cellular level. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The stoichiometry of stable protein complexes including clathrin heavy chain and clathrin light chain dimers and adaptor protein (AP) heterotetramers was assessed. We detected a deficit of clathrin light chain compared with clathrin heavy chain in non-brain tissues, suggesting a level of regulation of clathrin cage formation specific to brain. The high ratio of AP-1 to AP-2 in liver CCVs is reversed compared with brain where there is more AP-2 than AP-1. Despite this, general endocytic cargo proteins were readily detected in liver but not in brain CCVs, consistent with the previous demonstration that a major function for brain CCVs is recycling synaptic vesicles. Finally we identified 21 CCV-associated proteins in liver not yet characterized in mammals. Our results further validate the peptide accounting approach, reveal new information on the properties of CCVs, and allow for the use of quantitative proteomics to compare abundant components of organelles under different experimental and pathological conditions.

We have used subcellular fractionation and tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins associated with brain CCVs. The resulting proteome contained a near complete inventory of the major functional proteins of synaptic vesicles (SVs), suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis provides a major mechanism to recycle SV membrane proteins following neurotransmitter release. Additionally, we identified several new components of the machineries for clathrin-mediated membrane budding, including enthoprotin/epsinR and NECAP 1/2. These proteins bind with high specificity to the ear domains of the clathrin adaptor proteins (APs)-1 and -2, and, intriguingly, they each utilize novel peptide motifs based around the core sequence OXXO. Detailed mutational analysis of these motifs, coupled with structural studies of the ear domains, has revealed the basis of their specificity for clathrin adaptors. Moreover, the motifs have now been recognized in multiple proteins functioning in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking, revealing new mechanisms in the formation and function of CCVs. Thus, proteomics analysis of isolated organelles can provide insights ranging from peptide motifs to global organelle function.

We analyzed characteristics of resting and postural tremors of subclinical amplitude in 17 patients with idiopathic PD without visible resting tremor, having a postural tremor in their least-affected hand rated 0 (12 subjects) or 1 (5 subjects) on Item 21 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, compared to 17 control subjects matched for age, sex, and handedness. Tremor was recorded at the tip of the index finger using a displacement laser transducer. Overall results show that subclinical resting tremor in PD is significantly different from physiological tremor in terms of amplitude fluctuation, frequency dispersion, harmonic index, and proportional power in 4 to 6 Hz. No significant differences were found for postural tremor. These differences appear to originate mainly from patients with the mixed form of the disease. This study also confirms the preservation of physiological tremor likely originating from a distinct central oscillator in PD. The use of this method in the early and detailed characterization of PD tremors when amplitude is still within normal limits is proposed. (c) 2005 Movement Disorder Society.

The Anatomic Segmentation using Proximity (ASP) algorithm, previously developed by our group, provides a topology-preserving cortical surface deformation method that has been extensively used for the aforementioned purposes. However, constraints in the algorithm to ensure topology preservation occasionally produce incorrect thickness measurements due to a restriction in the range of allowable distances between the gray and white matter surfaces. This problem is particularly prominent in pediatric brain images with tightly folded gyri. This paper presents a novel method for improving the conventional ASP algorithm by making use of partial volume information through probabilistic classification in order to allow for topology preservation across a less restricted range of cortical thickness values. The new algorithm also corrects the classification of the insular cortex by masking out subcortical tissues. For 70 pediatric brains, validation experiments for the modified algorithm, Constrained Laplacian ASP (CLASP), were performed by three methods: (i) volume matching between surface-masked gray matter (GM) and conventional tissue-classified GM, (ii) surface matching between simulated and CLASP-extracted surfaces, and (iii) repeatability of the surface reconstruction among 16 MRI scans of the same subject. In the volume-based evaluation, the volume enclosed by the CLASP WM and GM surfaces matched the classified GM volume 13% more accurately than using conventional ASP. In the surface-based evaluation, using synthesized thick cortex, the average difference between simulated and extracted surfaces was 4.6 +/- 1.4 unit for conventional ASP and 0.5 +/- 0.4 unit for CLASP. In a repeatability study, CLASP produced a 30% lower RMS error for the GM surface and a 8% lower RMS error for the WM surface compared with ASP. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Information about CAR expression in normal and diseased human skeletal muscle is lacking. C'- or N'-terminally directed polyclonal antibodies against CAR were generated and immunohistochemical analysis of CAR on morphologically normal and regenerating human skeletal muscle of children and adults was performed. In morphologically normal human muscle fibers, CAR immunoreactivity was limited to the neuromuscular junction. In regenerating muscle fibers, CAR was abundantly co-expressed with markers of regeneration. The function of CAR at the neuromuscular junction is currently unknown. Co-expression of CAR with markers of regeneration suggests that CAR is developmentally regulated, and may serve as a marker of skeletal muscle fiber regeneration. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Since antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs act mainly by enhancing serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in forebrain areas, the main focus of the present review is to critically examine the electrophysiological effects of NK1 receptor antagonists on serotoninergic and noradrenergic neurons, and then hippocampal neurons. It is concluded that NK1 antagonists increase the firing and burst activity of 5-HT neurons, increase burst activity of NE neurons, and modulate postsynaptic transmission at the hippocampus level. Further research is needed in order to develop more selective ligands for the human NK1 receptor and to gain better knowledge of required brain penetration and optimal pharmacodynamic conditions for their use in patients.

The use of either pre-selected scaling factors or unsealed stimuli sometimes leads to non-monotonic changes in performance as a function of eccentricity. We argue that such non-monotonic changes arise when performance is limited by more than one type of constraint at each eccentricity. Building on current methods developed to investigate peripheral perception [e.g., Watson, A. B. (1987). Estimation of local spatial scale. Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 4 (8), 1579-1582; Poirier, F. J. A. M., & Gurnsey, R. (2002). Two eccentricity dependent limitations on subjective contour discrimination. Vision Research, 42, 227-238; Strasburger, H., Rentschler, L, & Harvey Jr., L. O. (1994). Cortical magnification theory fails to predict visual recognition. European Journal of Neuroscience, 6, 1583-1588], we show how measured scaling can deviate from a linear function of eccentricity in a grating acuity task [Thibos, L. N., Still, D. L., & Bradley, A. (1996). Characterization of spatial aliasing and contrast sensitivity in peripheral vision. Vision Research, 36(2), 249-258]. This framework can also explain the central performance drop [Kehrer, L. (1989). Central performance drop on perceptual segregation tasks. Spatial Vision, 4, 45-62] and a case of "reverse scaling" of the integration window in symmetry [Tyler, C. W. (1999). Human symmetry detection exhibits reverse eccentricity scaling. Visual Neuroscience, 16, 919-922]. These cases of non-monotonic performance are shown to be consistent with multiple sources of resolution loss, each of which increases linearly with eccentricity. We conclude that most eccentricity research, including "oddities", can be explained by multiple-scaling theory as extended here, where the receptive field properties of all underlying mechanisms in a task increase in size with eccentricity, but not necessarily at the same rate.

By comparison to non-transgenic controls, PS1/I2I3T KI mice had retarded acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze without being impaired in the probe trial and in the visible platform subtest. PS1/I2I3T KI mice were more likely to display whole-body startle to an auditory stimulus and a tighter grip on a horizontal grid. PS1/I2I3T KI mice also had fewer enclosed arm entries in the elevated plus-maze, but did not differ from controls in open-field, photocell actimeter, and T-maze spontaneous alternation tests. No intergroup difference was seen in three motor coordination tests. The dissociation between hidden and visible platform versions in the water maze is consistent with the hypothesis that elevated AP(42) concentrations cause cognitive disturbances.

In order to dissect possible genetic causes of the syndrome,wild-typeSOD1/SOD1 transgenic mice were compared to FVB/N non-transgenic controls at 5 months of age in tests of exploratory activity and motor coordination. Wild-type SOD1/SOD1 transgenic mice had fewer stereotyped movements in an open-field and fell sooner from a rotorod than controls. In contrast, wild-type SOD1/SOD1 transgenic mice had fewer falls on a wire suspension test. There was no intergroup difference for ambulatory movements in the open-field, exploration of the elevated plus-maze, emergence from a small compartment, and motor coordination on a stationary beam. These results indicate that homozygous mice expressing human SOD1 are impaired in their ability to adjust their posture in response to a moving surface and make fewer small-amplitude movements without any change in general exploratory activity.

Targeted deletion of Ilk from embryonic mouse dorsal forebrain neuroepithelium results in severe cortical lamination defects resembling cobblestone ( type II) lissencephaly. Defects in adult mutants include neuronal invasion of the marginal zone, downward displacement of marginal zone components, fusion of the cerebral hemispheres, and scalloping of the dentate gyrus. These lesions are associated with abundant astrogliosis and widespread fragmentation of the basal lamina at the cortical surface. During cortical development, neuronal ectopias are associated with severe disorganization of radial glial processes and displacement of Cajal- Retzius cells. Lesions are not seen when Ilk is specifically deleted from embryonic neurons. Interestingly, targeted Ilk deletion has no effect on proliferation or survival of cortical cells or on phosphorylation of two Ilk substrates, Pkb/Akt and Gsk-3 beta, suggesting that Ilk does not regulate cortical lamination via these enzymes. Instead, Ilk acts in vivo as a major intracellular mediator of integrin- dependent basal lamina formation. This study demonstrates a critical role for Ilk in cortical lamination and suggests that Ilk- associated pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of cobblestone lissencephalies.

Methods: Volumetric MRI of the hippocampus, amygdale, and entorhinal cortex were performed in 86 consecutive patients with TLE and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the relation between the volumetric measurements and the clinical parameters. Results: In simple regressions, duration of epilepsy but not age at seizure onset was related to hippocampal (r(2) = 0.19, p < 0.001), entorhinal cortex (r(2) = 0.11, p = 0.002), and amygdalar (r(2) = 0.15, p < 0.001) atrophy ipsilateral to the seizure focus. Prediction of the regression function to time of onset of recurrent seizures (time = 0) resulted in a y intercept of < 0 for the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex but was not different from 0 for the amygdala. Patients with a positive history of febrile convulsions had smaller hippocampal volumes ipsilateral to the seizure (p < 0.001). No relationship was found between febrile convulsions and entorhinal cortex and amygdalar volumes or between secondary generalization of seizures and any mesial temporal volume. Conclusion: Progressive volume loss in the mesial temporal lobe in relation to duration of epilepsy is not limited to the hippocampus but affects the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala.

Endothelium-intact (E+) and denuded rings (E-) obtained from the rat thoracic aorta were exposed to three administrations of a supramaximal concentration of AVP (100 W), lasting 20 min and 45 min apart. N-Omega-nitro-L-arginine (NNLA), a non-selective inhibitor of all isoforms of NO synthase, and AMT, a selective inhibitor for the inducible (iNOS) and neuronal (nNOS) isoforms, diminished the tachyphylaxis to AVP significantly in both E+ and in E- rings. No iNOS could be detected by Western blots in freshly isolated rings or in rings exposed to AVP, despite a strong signal in rings isolated from LPS-treated rats, while nNOS could be constitutively detected. Inhibition of prostaglandins or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) synthesis by diclofenac or clotrimazole, respectively, had no effect on tachyphylaxis while combination of these agents diminished tachyphylaxis in E+ only. Combination of NNLA, diclofenac and clotrimazole blocked completely the tachyphylaxis. Inhibition of PKC by either chelerythrine or bisindolylmaleimide I-HCl (BisI) led to a significant diminution of AVP tachyphylaxis only in E-. Activation of PKC with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) simulated tachyphylaxis to AVP in E- only, effect blocked by the NO donor, SNP. In conclusion, NO produced from constitutive nNOS present in vascular smooth muscle cells participates in tacbyphylaxis to AVR PKC is involved in this tachyphylaxis only in E- rings, the presence of NO probably diminishing the effects of this kinase.

Layer IV of the primary visual cortex (VI) and layers III and V of the extrastriate areas showed the most abundant SMI-32-ir. The different areal and laminar distribution of SMI-32-ir allowed the distinction between various extrastriate areas and determined their exact anatomical boundaries in the New World monkey, Callithrix penicillata. It is shown here that the parcellating nature of SMI-32 described earlier in the visual cortical areas of other mammals - including Old World monkeys - is also present in the marmoset. Furthermore, a comparison became possible between the chemoanatomical organization of New World and Old World primates' visual cortical areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A particularly intriguing question is why individuals in some species have been selected to migrate, whereas in other species they have been selected to be sedentary. In this paper, we suggest that this diverging selection might partially result from differences among species in the behavioural flexibility of their responses to seasonal changes in the environment. This hypothesis is supported in a comparative analysis of Palaearctic passerines. First, resident species tend to rely more on innovative feeding behaviours in winter, when food is harder to find, than in other seasons. Second, species with larger brains, relative to their body size, and a higher propensity for innovative behaviours tend to be resident, while less flexible species tend to be migratory. Residence also appears to be less likely in species that occur in more northerly regions, exploit temporally available food sources, inhabit non-buffered habitats and have smaller bodies. Yet, the role of behavioural flexibility as a response to seasonal environments is largely independent of these other factors. Therefore, species with greater foraging flexibility seem to be able to cope with seasonal environments better, while less flexible species are forced to become migratory.

We sought to replicate and extend these findings in a sample of individuals with acute PTSD. Methods: The ACCs of individuals with acute PTSD (n = 14) and matched healthy control subjects (n = 14) were compared using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), semi-automated volumetric analyses, and probabilistic maps. Posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis was ascertained by a psychologist using a structured interview. Results: Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed significantly less gray-matter density in the right pregenual ACC and in the left insula of the PTSD group. However, volumetric analyses of the ACC revealed no significant differences between groups. Probabilistic maps of the labels of the pregenual ACC indicated that the difference between groups in gray matter density was due to shape differences. Conclusions: Although there are no volumetric differences in the ACC of acute PTSD individuals compared with normal control subjects, significant shape differences exist, which might indicate volumetric differences in the surrounding structures.

Although much has been learned from cell culture studies, the physiological properties of these neurons remain difficult to study in such models because they are usually in minority and are difficult to distinguish from other non-dopaminergic neurons. Here we have taken advantage of a recently engineered transgenic mouse model expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter to establish a more effective dopaminergic neuron cell culture model. We first evaluated the specificity of the EGFP expression. Although ectopic expression of EGFP was found in cultures derived from postnatal day 0 pups, this decreased over time in culture such that after 2 weeks, approximately 70% of EGFP-expressing neurons were dopaminergic. We next sought to validate this dopaminergic neuron culture model. We evaluated whether EGFP-expressing dopaminergic neurons displayed some of the well-established properties of dopaminergic neurons. Autoreceptor stimulation inhibited the activity of dopaminergic neurons while neurotensin receptor activation produced the opposite effect. Confocal imaging of the synaptic vesicle optical tracer FM4-64 in EGFP-expressing dopaminergic neurons demonstrated the feasibility of high resolution monitoring of the activity of single terminals established by these neurons. Together, this work provides evidence that primary cultures of postnatal TH-EGFP mice currently represent an excellent model to study the properties of these cells in culture. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Comprehensive ESRS definitions and basic instructions are given. Factor analysis provided six ESRS factors: 1) hypokinetic Parkinsonism; 2) orofacial dyskinesia; 3) trunk/limb dyskinesia; 4) akathisia; 5) tremor; and 6) tardive dystonia. Two pivotal studies found high inter-rater reliability correlations in both antipsychotic-induced movement disorders and idiopathic Parkinson disease. For inter-rater reliability and certification of raters, >= 80% of item ratings of the complete scale should be 1 point of expert ratings and >= 70% of ratings on individual items of each ESRS subscale should be 1 point of expert ratings. During a cross-scale comparison, AIMS and ESRS were found to have a 96% (359/374) agreement between TD-defined cases by DSM-IV TD criteria. Two recent international studies using the ESRS included over 3000 patients worldwide and showed an incidence of TD ranging from 10.2% (2000) to 12% (1998).

A 7-year-old ambulatory girl with complete bilateral agenesis of the ilium is reported. Objective. To document the clinical evolution and the spino-pelvic balance of a girl with bilateral agenesis of the ilium. Summary of Background Data. Scapuloiliac dysostosis is a rare focal skeletal dysplasia consisting in hypoplasia of ilium and scapula. Methods. A 7-year-old girl with a short stature was referred to our clinic at 35 months of age for an asymptomatic lumbar hyperlordosis. She presented a waddling gait, and normal range of motion of her upper and lower limbs. The neurologic examination was within normal limits. Results. Initial radiographs at 35 months of age showed complete bilateral agenesis of the ilium with preservation of the pubis, ischium, and sacrum, associated with a bilateral high hip dislocation. The lumbar lordosis and sacral slope were 89 degrees and 84 degrees, respectively. A radiographic skeletal survey also showed hypoplasia of both scapulae. At 7 years old, the girl was fully ambulatory, with a waddling gait and had no pain. The sacral slope and lumbar lordosis have increased to 97 degrees and 97 degrees, respectively. There was no evidence of spondylolisthesis. So far, the patient has required no treatment for her condition. Conclusion. This article reports a unique case of scapuloiliac dysostosis with complete bilateral agenesis of the ilium in an ambulatory girl. This case indicates that a functional gait is possible with bilateral congenital absence of the ilium, provided that there is adequate muscular support and normal neurologic function.

To learn how orexin neurons maintain wakefulness, we recorded neurons in head-fixed rats across the sleep - waking cycle and then labeled them with Neurobiotin to identify them by immunohistochemistry. We show that identified orexin neurons discharge during active waking, when postural muscle tone is high in association with movement, decrease discharge during quiet waking in absence of movement, and virtually cease firing during sleep, when postural muscle tone is low or absent. During PS, they remain relatively silent in association with postural muscle atonia and most often despite phasic muscular twitches. They increase firing before the end of PS and thereby herald by several seconds the return of waking and muscle tone. The orexin neurons would thus stimulate arousal, while antagonizing sleep and muscle atonia.

Due to their wide variety, the identification of the appropriate genetic test is difficult but could be aided by magnetic resonance data. In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MRI) data were recorded for 20 ataxia patients of six different types and compared to 20 normal subjects. Spectra were acquired in the pons, left frontal lobe, left basal ganglia, left cerebellar hemisphere and vermis. Both metabolite spectra and absolute metabolite concentrations were determined. Differences in metabolite levels were observed between ataxia patients and control subjects and between ataxia patients of different types. A number of correlations were found between metabolite ratios, atrophy levels, number of repeats on the small and large allele, age at examination, symptoms duration and age at symptoms onset for ataxia patients. These MR characteristics are expected to be useful for the identification of the ataxia type. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Ltrk is a related receptor that is expressed in the CNS of the mollusk Lymnaea, although little is known of its cellular distribution. This study provides three independent lines of evidence (based on RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry) that Ltrk is universally expressed by neurons and dorsal body cells of both the juvenile and the adult Lymnaea CNS. The highest level of expression by neuronal somata occurs in the late juvenile stage, whereas axon collaterals express high levels throughout the animal's life span. Our data support multifunctional roles for Ltrk that parallel those of its mammalian counterparts. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The possible role of a mild deficiency in methylenetetrahydrofol ate reductase (MTHFR) and low dietary folate in pregnancy outcomes and heart morphogenesis requires further investigation. Objective: We investigated the effect of mild MTHFR deficiency, low dietary folate, or both on resorption rates, on length and weight, and on the incidence of heart malformations in murine embryos. Design: Female Mthfr +/+ and +/- mice were fed a control diet (CD) or a folic acid-deficient diet (FADD) before mating with male Mthfr +/- mice. On gestational day 14.5, implantation and resorption sites were recorded and viable embryos were examined for gross malformations, growth delay, and congenital heart defects. Results: Plasma homocysteine in Mthfr +/- dams and in FADD-treated dams was significantly higher than that in Mthfr +/+ dams and CD-treated dams, respectively. A significantly higher rate of resorption and greater developmental delay were observed in hyperho-mocysteinemic mice than in CD-treated +/+ dams. Heart defects were identified in 4 of 11, 5 of 10, and 4 of 10 litters from CD-treated +/-, FADD-treated +/+, and FADD-treated +/- dams, respectively, but not in any of those from CD-treated +/+ dams (0/11 litters). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that mild MTHFR deficiency, low dietary folate, or both in the dams increase the incidence of fetal loss, intrauterine growth retardation, and heart defects. These data support the benefit of folic acid supplementation in pregnant women, particularly in those with MTHFR deficiency.

Methods: Ninety-two patients with diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, or postsurgical/posttramnatic neuropathic pain with allodynia, hyperalgesia, or pinprick hypesthesia were randomly assigned to receive one of four creams (placebo, 2% amitriptyline, 1% ketamine, or 2% amitriptyline-1% ketamine combined). The primary outcome measure was change in average daily pain intensity (baseline week vs. final week) using an 11-point numerical pain rating scale. Secondary outcomes included the McGill Pain Questionnaire, measures of allodynia and hyperalgesia, and patient satisfaction. Results: A reduction in pain scores of 1.1-1.5 units was observed in all groups, and there was no difference between groups. Blood concentrations revealed no significant systemic absorption. Minimal side effects were encountered. Conclusion: This randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining topical 2% amitriptyline, 1% ketamine, and a combination in the treatment of neuropathic pain revealed no difference between groups. Optimization of doses may be required, because another study has revealed that higher concentrations of these agents combined do produce significant analgesia.

Words used to describe pain were brought together and categorized, and an attempt was made to scale them on a common intensity dimension. The data show that: 1) there are many words in the English language to describe the varieties of pain experience; 2) there is a high level of agreement that the words fall into classes and subclasses that represent particular dimensions or properties of pain experience; 3) substantial portions of the words have approximately the same relative positions on a common intensity scale for people who have widely divergent backgrounds. The word lists provide a basis for a questionnaire to study the effects of anesthetic and analgesic agents on the experience of pain.

However, whether a causal relation exists between these conditions is currently unknown. We have previously shown that a focal cortical lesion induced in the neonatal rat predisposes to the development of atypical hyperthermic seizures. We show here that 86% of the lesion plus hyperthermia group experience development of spontaneous recurrent seizures recorded from the amygdala ipsilateral to the lesion. Control rats did not have spontaneous recurrent behavioral or electrographic seizures. Lesioned rats with hyperthermic seizures also showed an impaired performance on the Morris water maze when compared with naive control rats, suggesting mild deficits in learning and memory. These findings support a link between the atypical febrile seizure and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and at the same time establish a new model for this condition through which new preventative and therapeutic strategies can be tested.

These patients had a favourable clinical evolution and positive F-18-fluorodopa PET scans and did not develop motor complications. The surviving transplanted dopamine neurons were positively identified with phenotypic markers of normal control human substantia nigra (n = 3), such as tyrosine hydroxylase, G-protein-coupled inward rectifying current potassium channel type 2 (Girk2) and calbindin. The grafts restored the cell type that provides specific dopaminergic innervation to the most affected striatal regions in the parkinsonian brain. Such transplants were able to densely reinnervate the host putamen with new dopamine fibres. The patients received only 6 months of standard immune suppression, yet by post-mortem analysis 3-4 years after surgery the transplants appeared only mildly immunogenic to the host brain, by analysis of microglial CD45 and CD68 markers.

We first show that PrP is very specific for Bax and cannot prevent Bak (Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1)-, tBid-, staurosporineor thapsigargin-mediated cell death. As Bax activation involves Bax conformational change, mitochondrial translocation, cytochrome c release and caspase activation, we investigated which of these events was inhibited by PrP. PrP inhibits Bax conformational change, cytochrome c release and cell death in human primary neurons and MCF-7 cells. Serum deprivation-induced Bax conformational change is more rapid in PrP-null cells. PrP does not prevent active caspase-mediated cell death. PrP does not colocalize with Bax in normal or apoptotic primary neurons and cannot prevent Bax-mediated cytochrome c release in a mitochondrial cell-free system. We conclude that PrP protects against Bax-mediated cell death by preventing the Bax proapoptotic conformational change that occurs initially in Bax activation.

Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to investigate the regional distribution of cortical atrophy in AD in vivo. One marker for the disease-specific atrophy is the thickness of the cortical mantle across the brain, obtained with automated 3-D image processing. Here, we present data from 36 subjects ( 17 controls and, 19 patients diagnosed as probable AD) investigated for cortical thickness across the entire brain. We show significant cortical thickness decline in AD in temporal, orbitofrontal and parietal regions, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the allocortical region of the medial temporal lobes, outlining the parahippocampal gyrus, and representing a loss of > 1.25 millimeters of cortical thickness. Moreover, focal cortical areas decline with progression of the disease as measured by time from baseline scan as well as the Mini-Mental State Exam. The results demonstrate the ability of this method to detect changes in cortical thickness in AD, across the entire brain, without need of prior anatomical definitions. The regional distribution of changes reported here is consistent with independent findings on the distribution of neuropathological alterations in AD. Using cortical thickness, moreover, we provide a direct quantitative index of atrophy in the disease.

We assume limited knowledge of the reaction kinetics. An adaptive learning technique is introduced to construct an optimum-seeking algorithm that drives the system states to optimal equilibrium concentrations of the reaction mixture. Lyapunov's stability theorem is used in the design of the extremum-seeking controller structure and the development of the parameter-learning laws. Under mild assumptions, the resulting controller is an output-feedback controller. The performance of the technique is demonstrated with the van de Vusse reaction system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on such self-reports, subjects have been classified as 'bad' or 'good' imagers. The present study examined whether a differential strategy in re-enacting the olfactomotor response during imagery may explain the dissociation between 'bad' and 'good' olfactory imagers. As previously reported, odor imagery was accompanied by sniffing. Although 'bad' and 'good' olfactory imagers did not differ in their overall sniffing volume, they used different strategies when re-enacting the motor component of olfaction during imagery. Particularly, as in real perception, 'good' but not 'bad' imagers generated bigger sniffs when imagining a pleasant smell compared with an unpleasant smell (P < 0.02). Furthermore, preventing sniffing significantly hampered mental imagery of pleasant odors in 'good' but not 'bad' imagers (P < 0.03). Taken together, these results suggest (i) the validity of the dissociation between 'bad' and 'good' olfactory imagers as revealed by self-report; (ii) that sniffing may be a causal factor in the creation of olfactory imagery; and (iii) that sniff measurements may serve as a reliable non-verbal tool in exploring individual differences in odor imagery.

Its use as an analgesic is starting to extend to the treatment of noncancer pain, particularly neuropathic pain. Unfortunately, the evidence for its use in the management of neuropathic pain is limited to a few case studies. We examined retrospectively during a 12-month study period the clinical response of all 13 patients at our pain clinic who were prescribed methadone in an attempt to control neuropathic pain resistant to conventional analgesics. A questionnaire was also administered to the 9 patients who continued to take methadone at 12 months posttreatment. A total of 4 patients (31%) discontinued it by the end of the 12-month study period. Patients discontinued methadone due to the absence of pain relief and due to various intractable, undesirable side effects. Somnolence was the most common adverse effect reported, followed by nausea, constipation, and vomiting. All patients took coanalgesics (eg, amitriptyline, gabapentin) or other analgesics (eg, morphine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) during methadone treatment to control pain. The 9 patients who continued to take methadone at 12 months reported experiencing on average 43% pain relief (range 0-80%), 47% improvement in quality of life (range 0-100%), and 30% improvement in quality of sleep (range 0-60%). Methadone was effective at relieving pain and ameliorating quality of life and sleep in 62% of patients. These findings suggest that methadone can offer an acceptable success rate for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Prospective randomized, placebo-controlled studies are now needed to examine more rigorously the benefits of methadone for this type of pain.

Anticholinergics are usually the main way to treat bladder overactivity. Side effects and lack of efficacy are the two main causes for considering alternative treatment. Up to recently, invasive surgery, mainly bladder augmentation, was the only available treatment for these intractable bladders. Here, we report on botulinum A toxin injection as an alternative to surgery in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. Recent findings There are only four published articles on the use of botulinum A toxin in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity. However, an increasing number of reports indicate clinical benefit and a good safety profile of botulinum A toxin in neurogenic and idiopathic detrusor overactivity. Extrapolation of the data published in adults treated with botulinum A toxin injections and understanding the mechanism of action on the detrusor muscle are worthwhile to encourage paediatric physicians to propose this option to their patients. Furthermore, the literature does not seem to warn against drug resistance or ultrastructural changes of the detrusor after repeated injection. Summary Botulinum A toxin appears to be a reasonable alternative to surgery in the management of intractable overactive bladder in children. However, studies of the delivery method, site of injection, dose and long-term follow-up are required to confirm the good safety profile/clinical benefit of this new, minimally invasive approach.

We revisit Penfield's first use of invasive EEG monitoring, emphasizing its historical importance for the evolution of epilepsy surgery. Methods: Patients' hospital charts and articles published before 1940 regarding EEG and epilepsy or EEG and cerebral lesions were reviewed to evaluate the historical context of the surgery. Results: In April 1939, Penfield performed trephination over both temporal regions and placed electrodes on the dura, intending to lateralize seizure origin in a patient with bitemporal epilepsy. The patient underwent serial EEGs with this technique. The final report of the recordings from epidural leads was "continued random delta activity in the left temporal region indicating a cortical lesion on this side." The pneumoencephalogram showed "the presence of diffuse cerebral atrophy, particularly in the left cerebral hemisphere." Based on these findings, the patient underwent surgery on April 21, revealing a meningocerebral scar in the posterior part of the left temporal lobe. Brain stimulation and electrocorticography delineated the extent of resection, while preserving the speech area. Seizures did not improve. Conclusions: We revisit the first case of epidural EEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery and show that the concept of EEG-directed surgery was already present at the Montreal Neurological Institute in the late 1930s.

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), traditional healers (THs) play a prominent role in caring for PWE, yet little is known about epilepsy care by THs. We conducted a multimethod, qualitative study to better understand the epilepsy care delivered by THs in Zambia. Methods: We conducted focus-group discussions with THs, in-depth semistructured interviews with a well-recognized TH at his place of work, and multiple informal interviews with health-care providers in rural Zambia. Results: THs recognize the same symptoms that a neurologist elicits to characterize seizure onset (e.g., olfactory hallucinations, jacksonian march, automatisms). Although THs acknowledge a familial propensity for some seizures and endorse causes of symptomatic epilepsy, they believe witchcraft plays a central, provocative role in most seizures. Treatment is initiated after the first seizure and usually incorporates certain plant and animal products. Patients who do not experience further seizures are considered cured. Those who do not respond to therapy may be referred to other healers. Signs of concomitant systemic illness are the most common reason for referral to a hospital. As a consequence of this work, our local Epilepsy Care Team has developed a more collaborative relationship with THs in the region. Conclusions: THs obtain detailed event histories, are treatment focused, and may refer patients who have refractory seizures to therapy to other healers. Under some circumstances, they recognize a role for modem health care and refer patients to the hospital. Given their predominance as care providers for PWE, further understanding of their approach to care is important. Collaborative relationships between physicians and THs are needed if we hope to bridge the treatment gap in SSA.

Although the mode of inheritance is usually complex, mutations in single genes have been shown to cause the disease in some families with autosomal dominant inheritance. The first mutation in a multigeneration JME family has been recently found in the alpha(1)-subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABRA1), predicting the single amino acid substitution A322D. We further characterized the functional consequences of this mutation by coexpressing alpha(1)-, beta(2)- and gamma(2)-subunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. By using an ultrafast application system, mutant receptors have shown reduced macroscopic current amplitudes at saturating GABA concentrations and a highly reduced affinity to GABA compared to the wild-type (WT). Dose-response curves for current amplitudes, activation kinetics, and GABA-dependent desensitization parameters showed a parallel shift towards 30- to 40-fold higher GABA concentrations. Both deactivation and resensitization kinetics were considerably accelerated in mutant channels. In addition, mutant receptors labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were not integrated in the cell membrane, in contrast to WT receptors. Therefore, the A322D mutation leads to a severe loss-of-function of the human GABA(A) receptor by several mechanisms, including reduced surface expression, reduced GABA-sensitivity, and accelerated deactivation. These molecular defects could decrease and shorten the resulting inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in vivo, which can induce a hyperexcitability of the postsynaptic membrane and explain the occurrence of epileptic seizures.

Much of our knowledge has necessarily been obtained on the basis of sophisticated psychophysical studies as well as from electrophysiological explorations on the visual pathways in animal models of amblyopia. This study combines these two approaches to the problem by employing similar psychophysical probes of performance on animal models of two forms of amblyopia (deprivation and strabismic) to those employed earlier on human amblyopes (Hess & Field, 1994, Vis. Res., 34, 13397-13406). The tests explore two competing explanations for the visual deficits, namely an evenly distributed loss of neural connections (undersampling) with the amblyopic eye as opposed to disordered connections with this eye (neural disarray). Unexpectedly, the results in animal models of deprivation amblyopia were not in accord with expectations based upon an even distribution of lost connections with the amblyopic eye. However, the results were similar to those observed in a strabismic amblyopic animal and to strabismic amblyopic humans. We suggest that deprivation amblyopia may be accompanied by an uneven loss of connections that results in effective neural disarray.

J	Patenaude, C; Massicotte, G; Lacaille, JC				Patenaude, C; Massicotte, G; Lacaille, JC			Cell-type specific GABA synaptic transmission and activity-dependent plasticity in rat hippocampal stratum radiatum interneurons	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						GABAergic synapses; hippocampus; IPSCs; Sprague-Dawley rat; synaptic plasticity	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; LACUNOSUM-MOLECULARE INTERNEURONS; RECEPTOR-ALPHA SUBUNITS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; INHIBITORY SYNAPSES; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; CANNABINOID RECEPTORS; NONPYRAMIDAL NEURONS; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES	In hippocampal pyramidal cells, the efficacy of synaptic transmission at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synapses, is modulated by activity. However, whether such plasticity occurs at inhibitory synapses on interneurons remains largely unknown. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampal slices, we examined whether GABA synapses of stratum radiatum interneurons were affected by stimulation protocols known to alter efficacy at inhibitory synapses of CA1 pyramidal cells. Monosynaptically evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) exhibited different properties with significantly faster kinetics, higher coefficients of variation, a current-voltage (I-V) relationship shifted to depolarized values and a smaller paired-pulse depression, in interneurons than in pyramidal cells. GABA synapses on interneurons also showed a different capacity for plasticity. Indeed, theta-burst stimulation induced a long-term potentiation of eIPSCs in both cell types, but the induction mechanisms differed in interneurons, as it was not affected by antagonists of GABA(B) receptors and group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Furthermore, 100-Hz tetanization selectively elicited a short-term depression of eIPSCs in pyramidal cells. A postsynaptic depolarization produced a transient suppression of eIPSCs (depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition) in pyramidal cells but not in interneurons. Spontaneous IPSCs were similarly reduced following depolarization in pyramidal cells, but not in interneurons. These results indicate that GABA synapses of stratum radiatum interneurons exhibit different properties and capacity for activity-dependent plasticity than those of pyramidal cells. This cell-type specific mode of transmission and adaptive regulation of GABA synapses may contribute to hippocampal plasticity and functions.

J	Yao, S; Yan, B; Chen, B; Zeng, Y				Yao, S; Yan, B; Chen, B; Zeng, Y			An ANN-based element extraction method for automatic mesh generation	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						mesh generation; element extraction; artificial neural network; quadrilateral mesh; evolution of rules	NEURAL-NETWORKS	This paper proposes an artificial neural network based element extraction method for automatic finite element mesh generation. A finite element mesh is a discretized representation of a geometric domain. A domain is discretized into elements, which may be triangles, quadrilaterals. tetrahedron, or hexahedron. The element extraction method repeatedly generates element (s) within the domain using some predefined 'if-then' rules until the whole domain is filled with required elements. This method has an advantage of creating meshes for domains with complex boundaries. However, the 'if-then' rules for element extraction are usually difficult to acquire, because these rules not only generate elements but also change the problem they are designed to solve. In this paper, a Back-Propagation (BP) neural network is used to represent the 'if-then' element extraction rules and to train the relationship behind these rules. The input for this network includes the coordinates of some boundary points while the output defines the parameters for extracting an element. In order to generate good quality element while keeping the updated problem still solvable, the design and definition of the neural network is more complex than those in the traditional classification problems. This paper discusses issues related to the design of the neural network for element extraction. Numerical experiments on quadrilateral mesh generation have shown that this method is effective.

Transposons may provide an important mechanism for the generation of genetic diversity in this organism. Here, we describe Taf1, the first class II transposon to be identified in A. fumigatus. Taf1, a member of the mariner superfamily and pogo family of transposons, is distinguished by the presence of extremely long (89 bp) inverted repeats that flank the transposase coding sequence. Taf1 is present in different locations and copy number among clinical strains of A. fumigatus and is transcribed. Analysis of multiple insertion sequences within a single strain suggests that Taf1 elements undergo inactivation by a repeat induced polymorphism-like mechanism. Taf1 insertion patterns were extremely stable despite multiple stressors including heat shock, serial passage, and infection in mice. Thus Taf1 may be useful for strain identification and molecular typing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results show that financial time series include both predictable deterministic and unpredictable random components. Neural networks can identify the properties of homeostatic dynamics and model the dynamic relation between endogenous and exogenous variables in financial time series input-output system.

J	Goertzen, AL; Jones, DW; Seidel, J; Li, K; Green, MV				Goertzen, AL; Jones, DW; Seidel, J; Li, K; Green, MV			First results from the high-resolution mouseSPECT annular scintillation camera	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						micro SPECT; mouse imaging; pinhole SPECT	PINHOLE SPECT; MICE	High-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in small animals tends to use long imaging times and large injected doses due to the poor sensitivity of single pinhole gamma cameras. To increase sensitivity while maintaining spatial resolution, we designed and constructed a multi-pinhole collimator array to replace the parallel hole collimators of a Ceraspect human SPECT brain scanner. The Ceraspect scanner is composed of an annular NaI(Tl) crystal within which the eight pinhole collimators (1-mm-diameter holes) rotate while projecting nonoverlapping images of the object onto the stationary annular crystal. In this manner, only one-eighth of a collimator rotation is required to acquire a full circle orbit tomographic data set. The imaging field of view (FOV) has a diameter of 25.6 mm in the transverse direction, which is sufficient to encompass a mouse in the transverse direction. The axial FOV is 25.6 mm at the center of the FOV and 13.9 mm at the edge of the transverse FOV. Data are currently acquired in step-and-shoot mode; however, the system is capable of list mode acquisition with the collimator continuously rotating. Images are reconstructed using a cone-beam ordered subsets expectation maximization method. The reconstructed spatial resolution of the system is 1.7 mm and the sensitivity at the center of the FOV is 13.8 cps/microCi. A whole-body bone scan of a mouse injected with [Tc-99 m]MDP clearly revealed skeletal structures such as the ribs and vertebral bodies. These preliminary results suggest that this approach is a good tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity and, with further refinement, may permit dynamic imaging in living animals.

Specifically, both a structure level as well as a function level adaptation methodologies are utilized in constructing the network. The functional level adaptation scheme ensures that the "growing" or constructive network has different activation functions for each neuron such that the network may be able to capture the underlying input-output map more effectively. The activation functions considered consist of orthonormal Hermite polynomials. It is shown through extensive simulations that the proposed network yields improved performance when compared to networks having identical sigmoidal activation functions.

The present study examined whether neural stem cells were recruited to the infarct region of the rat heart following coronary artery ligation. The neural stein cell marker nestin was detected in the infarct region of 1-week post-myocardial infarct NO male rats and cultured scar-derived neural-like cells. By contrast, nestin staining was undetected in either scar myofibroblasts or cardiac myocytes residing in the non-infarcted left ventricle. Reactive astrocytes were isolated from the infarct region and characterized by the co-expression of nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and vimentin. Specific staining of oligodendrocytes and neurons was also detected in the infarct region and cultured scar-derived neural-like cells. Furthermore, neurofilament-M positive fibers were identified in the scar and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was observed in peripherin-positive neurons. Neurite formation was induced in PC12 cells treated with the conditioned-media of primary passage scar-derived cells, highlighting the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic factors. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were detected in myofibroblasts and neural cells, and both cell types expressed the NGF receptors trkA and p75. These data highlight the novel observation that neural stem cells were recruited to the infarct region of the damaged rat heart and may contribute in part to nerve fiber growth and subsequent innervation of the scar.

We evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations, with particular focus on the location of splice site mutations, using mutation and clinical information on 831 patients from 528 NF2 families with identified constitutional NF2 mutations. The clinical characteristics examined were age at onset of symptoms of NF2 and number of intracranial meningiomas, which are the primary indices of the severity of NF2. Two regression models were used to analyse genotype-phenotype correlations. People with splice site mutations in exons 1 - 5 had more severe disease than those with splice site mutations in exons 11 - 15. This result is compatible with studies showing that exons 2 and 3 are required for self-association of the amino terminal of the NF2 protein in vitro, and that deletions of exons 2 and 3 in transgenic and knockout mouse models of NF2 cause a high prevalence of Schwann cell derived tumours.

As a result, they have an essential role in fundamental physiological responses including regulation of blood volume and fluid homeostasis. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is present at high levels in the hypothalamus. Although CNP is known to decrease hormone secretion from MNCs, no studies have examined the role of the natriuretic peptide C receptor (NPR-C) in these neurons. In this study, whole cell recordings from acutely isolated MNCs, and MNCs in a coronal slice preparation, show that CNP (2 x 10(-8) M) and the selective NPR-C agonist, cANF (2 x 10(-8) M), significantly inhibit L-type Ca(2+) current ( I(Ca(L))) by similar to 50%. This effect on I(Ca(L)) is mimicked by dialyzing a G(i)-activator peptide (10(-7) M) into these cells, implicating a role for the inhibitory G protein, G(i). These NPR-C-mediated effects were specific to I(Ca(L)). T-type Ca(2+) channels were unaffected by CNP. Current-clamp experiments revealed the ability of CNP, acting via the NPR-C receptor, to decrease (similar to 25%) the number of action potentials elicited during a 500 ms depolarizing stimulus. Analysis of action potential duration revealed that CNP and cANF significantly decreased 50% repolarization time (APD(50)) in MNCs. In summary, our findings show that CNP has a potent and selective inhibitory effect on I(Ca(L)) and on excitability in MNCs that is mediated by the NPR-C receptor. These data represent the first electrophysiological evidence of a functional role for the NPR-C receptor in the mammalian hypothalamus.

Prior functional neuroimaging data indicate that episodic encoding during phonological task performance is correlated with activation in bilateral posterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (pVLPFC), although uncertainty remains regarding whether these prefrontal regions make necessary contributions to episodic memory formation. Using functional MRI data to guide application of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS), this study examined the necessity of left and right pVLPFC for episodic encoding ( as expressed through subsequent memory performance). To assess the timing of critical computations, pVLPFC function was transiently disrupted at different poststimulus onset times while subjects made syllable decisions about visually presented familiar and unfamiliar words; subsequent memory for these stimuli was measured. Results revealed that left pVLPFC disruption during encoding of familiar words impaired subsequent memory, expressed as a decline in recognition confidence, with disruption being maximal at 380 ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, right pVLPFC disruption facilitated subsequent memory for familiar words, expressed as an increase in medium confidence recognition, with this facilitation being maximal at 380 ms. Finally, phonological (syllable) decision accuracy was facilitated by right pVLPFC disruption, with this effect being maximal at 340 ms, but was unaffected by left pVLPFC disruption. These findings suggest that left pVLPFC mechanisms onset between 300 and 400 ms during phonological processing of words, with these mechanisms appearing necessary for effective episodic encoding. In contrast, disruption of correlated mechanisms in right pVLPFC facilitates encoding, perhaps by inducing a functional shift in the mechanisms engaged during learning.

The results of these studies: (1) provide quantitative, site-specific 3-D models of physical properties that are of more use for applied studies than qualitative 2-D models commonly derived from facies modeling or sequence stratigraphic analysis, (2) are generally more geologically reasonable than studies based on geostatistics alone, (3) can provide sedimentary geologists with fundamental insights into depositional and/or diagenetic controls on the distribution of properties of interest, (4) need to be rigorously evaluated by integrating other types of data and analyses, and (5) are best thought of as supplementing, rather than replacing, conventional geologic analyses. The concepts and methods we illustrate may have application in various branches of sedimentary geology. Our study area is Appleton Field in southern Alabama. At this location we predict the 3-D distribution of porosity in carbonates of the Upper Jurassic Smackover Formation using a probabilistic neural network and a combination of four attributes. Our results suggest that porosity was best developed, and preserved, in thrombolite facies of the reef front.

The current model proposes an initial envelopment at the inner nuclear membrane of capsids newly assembled in the nucleus. The capsids are then released in cytosol by fusion with the outer nuclear membrane. They are finally reenveloped at a downstream organelle before traveling to the plasma membrane for their extracellular release. Although the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is often cited as a potential site of reenvelopment, other organelles have also been proposed, including the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, aggresomes, tegusomes, and early or late endosomes. To clarify this important issue, we followed herpes simplex virus type 1 egress by immunofluorescence under conditions that slowed intracellular transport and promoted the accumulation of the otherwise transient reenvelopment intermediate. The data show that the capsids transit by the TGN and point to this compartment as the main reenvelopment site, although a contribution by endosomes cannot formally be excluded. Given that viral glycoproteins are expected to accumulate where capsids acquire their envelope, we examined this prediction and found that all tested could indeed be detected at the TGN. Moreover, this accumulation occurred independently of capsid egress. Surprisingly, capsids were often found immediately adjacent to the viral glycoproteins at the TGN.

The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC-CTG) conducted a phase 11 study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of troxacitabine in untreated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previously untreated patients were eligible if they had inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, ECOG PS <= 2, adequate hematology and biochemistry, and at least one bidimensionally measurable lesion. Patients with prior malignancy or brain metastases were excluded. Troxacitabine (10 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Between June 1999 and May 2000, 17 eligible patients received treatment. Patient characteristics included: median age 64 years; female 41%; stage IV (94%); PS 0 (12%), 1 (59%), and 2 (29%), 3 or more disease sites (59%). In 17 patients, there were 8 stable disease, 9 disease progression, and no objective responses. Median duration of stable disease was 3.6 months (range = 2.0-7.1). A total of 56 cycles were administered (median = 3), and 88% of patients received 90% or more of the planned dose intensity. The majority (82%) of patients experienced skin rash. Hematologic and biochemical toxicities, grade 3/4 (%) were: granulocytopenia (41), anemia (12), thrombocytopenia (6), and hyperglycemia (6). Troxacitabine appears to have little activity in NSCLC in the dose and schedule tested.

The present study adopts a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach to examine the association between DAT1 and a continuous measure of ADHD behaviours in a general-population sample, as well as to explore whether there is an independent association between DAT1 and performance on neuropsychological tests of attention, response inhibition, and working memory. From an epidemiological sample of 872 boys aged 6-11 years, we recruited 58 boys scoring above the 90th percentile for teacher reported ADHD symptoms (SWAN ADHD scale) and 68 boys scoring below 10th percentile for genotyping and neuropsychological testing. A significant association was found between the DAT1 homozygous 10/10-repeat genotype and high-scoring boys (chi(2)square=4.6, P < 0.03; odds ratio = 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.0). Using hierarchical linear regression, a significant independent association was found between the DAT1 10/10-repeat genotype and measures of selective attention and response inhibition after adjusting for age, IQ, and ADHD symptoms. There was no association between DAT1 and any component of working memory. Furthermore, performance on tasks of selective attention although associated with DAT1 was not associated with SWAN ADHD high scores after controlling for age and IQ. In contrast, impairment on tasks that tapped sustained attention and the central executive component of working memory were found in high-scoring boys after adjusting for age and IQ. The results suggest that DAT1 is a QTL for continuously distributed ADHD behaviours in the general population and the cognitive endophenotype of response inhibition.

J	Zwingmann, C; Butterworth, R				Zwingmann, C; Butterworth, R			An update on the role of brain glutamine synthesis and its relation to cell-specific energy metabolism in the hyperammonemic brain: Further studies using NMR spectroscopy	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						ammonia; brain edema; energy metabolism; glutamine; hepatic encephalopathy	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID GLUTAMINE; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; AMINO-ACID CHANGES; AMMONIA IN-VITRO; PORTACAVAL ANASTOMOSIS; RAT-BRAIN; PYRUVATE-CARBOXYLASE	Ammonia is a neurotoxin that is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy due to acute and chronic liver failure. However, its relation to neurological damage and brain edema is poorly understood. During the last decades, it has been the prevailing hypothesis that an osmotic disturbance induced by the astrocytic accumulation of glutamine leads to brain edema. However, various findings, are at variance with this hypothesis. The present review will discuss: (a) correlation of ammonia with encephalopathy and brain edema in HE; (b) glutamine synthesis and astrocyte swelling; (c) glutamine synthesis and the glutamine-cycle: relation to brain energy metabolism; (d) glutamine synthesis and the glutamate-glutamine cycle and its relation to anaplerotic activity; (e) evidence favouring the "glutamine hypothesis"; (f) evidence contradicting the "glutamine hypothesis"; (g) glutamine synthesis and osmoregulation; (h) glutamine synthesis in chronic liver failure; (i) impaired brain energy metabolism in acute liver failure (ALF) and its relation to astrocytic glutamine synthesis. Taken together, the precise role of glutamine in the development of brain edema in ALF remains unclear. Astrocytic changes due to glutamine accumulation may lead secondarily to effects on brain energy metabolism. However, the relation between impaired energy metabolism and glutamine accumulation has not been well established. It is noteworthy that no single biochemical factor appears to be responsible for the many symptoms of HE. For example, brain glutamine accumulation and low-grade brain edema occur in chronic liver failure (CLF) suggesting common mechanisms are responsible for the neurological dysfunction in CLF and ALF. Recent NMR spectroscopic studies have provided considerably new information in this area. Future NMR studies using the stable isotope C-13 may be useful in the study of the dynamics of brain metabolism in patients with ALF so as to better elucidate the precise role of glutamine accumulation and of glutamine-independent components to brain edema in ALF.

Multinuclear (H-1-, P-31- C-13-) NMR spectra were recorded to quantify water-soluble metabolites, the cellular energy state, as well as the incorporation of [1-C-13]glucose into amino acids of primary astrocyte cultures. Myo-inositol levels were strongly decreased already at 3 h after treatment with NH4Cl; other intracellular osmolytes, such as hypotaurine and choline-containing compounds were also decreased, along with a concomitant increase of both the total concentration and the amount of newly synthesized glutamine, alanine, and glutathione. During ammonia stress, the decrease of organic osmolytes compensated in part for increased intracellular osmolarity caused by amino acid synthesis. Hypotonic conditions alone also lowered the content of organic osmolytes including cellular amino acids, but much less than in hyperammonemia. This was due to impaired mitochondrial metabolic activity via the Krebs cycle, which also enhanced ammonia-induced ATP decrease. However, the changes in the sum of organic osmolytes were not significantly different after ammonia-treatment in hypoosmotic compared to anisoosmotic media, suggesting that the decrease of cellular organic osmolytes may not adequately compensate for the increased intracellular osmolarity caused by amino acids under hyponatremia. Therefore, the ammonia-induced release of osmolytes is an early process in response to increased intracellular osmolarity evoked by increased glutamine and alanine as a consequence of stimulated metabolic activity. The imperfect correlation of changes in astrocytic glutamine, other organic osmolytes, and the cellular energy state under hyperammonemic stress in isoosmotic and hypoosmotic media, however, point to additional mechanisms contributing to astrocyte dysfunction in hyperammonemic states, which are independent from glutamine formation.

A direct effect of ammonia on GABAergic neurotransmission was proposed as a mechanism that may explain its neurotoxic effect on the basis of electrophysiological and biochemical studies performed in animal models of liver failure. In the present study, we investigated using a radiometric assay the effect of ammonia on the binding of GABA-A receptor ligands to membranes from normal human brains. Ammonium tartrate significantly decreased the maximal binding of [H-3]flunitrazepam to well-washed frontal cortical membranes (366 +/- 63 fmol/mg protein in absence of ammonia versus 294.1 +/- 51 fmol/mg protein in presence of 2 mM ammonia; p < 0.05). The efficacy of the effects of ammonia was within the millimolar range (IC50 = 4.8 mM). This effect was not seen in cerebellum or hippocampus. Ammonia exposure decreased the maximal binding of [H-3]flumazenil (284.9 +/- 24.2 fmol/mg protein in absence of ammonia versus 146.4 +/- 15.6 fmol/mg protein in presence of 2 mM ammonia; p < 0.01). This effect was seen with a greater potency (I-max = 32.4%) and a lower IC50 (0.1 mM). Inhibition of [H-3]flumazenil binding was significant in all brain regions. The apparent ammonia-induced decrease of [3 H]flunitrazepam and [3 H]flumazenil binding was due to a decrease in the binding affinities of these ligands for the benzodiazepine site. In contrast, ammonium tartrate exposure did not cause significant changes to the binding of [H-3]muscimol in any brain region. These findings demonstrate that ammonia interacts negatively with components of the benzodiazepine-associated site at the GABA-A receptor complex in human brain in contrast to previous reports in the rat, and thus, does not support the notion that ammonia directly activates the GABA-A receptor complex resulting in increased GABAergic neurotransmission in human hepatic encephalopathy. These findings also suggest that positron emission tomography studies in cirrhotic patients using [C-11]flumazenil may be underestimating GABA-A receptor sites depending upon the degree of hyperammonemia of the patient.

However, the dynamics of changes in glucose metabolism remain unclear. The present study was undertaken using H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the rates of incorporation of glucose into amino acids and lactate via cell-specific pathways in mice with lupus. In the well-established MRL/lpr lupus mouse model, 24-week-old mice had a significant increase of 30-80% (P < 0.001) in total brain glutamine, glutamate and lactate concentrations, while alanine, aspartate, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) remained unchanged as compared to the congenic MRL +/+ control mice. Although succinate concentration was increased in lupus brain, it did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, C-13 isotopomer analysis showed a selective increase of de novo synthesis of lactate from [1-C-13] glucose through glycolysis resulting in 1.5-fold increased fractional C-13 enrichments in lactate in MRL/lpr mice. [4-C-13] Glutamate, which is synthesized mainly by the neuronal pyruvate dehydogenase, was selectively increased, while [2-C-13] and [3-C-13] GABA synthesis were decreased by 25% compared to controls. In accordance with the total concentrations, aspartate synthesis remained unaltered in brains of lupus mice, while alanine synthesis was elevated, indicating increased utilization of alanine. Creatine was unchanged in MRL/lpr mice as compared to controls. An interesting finding was a significant increase (158%, P < 0.005) in choline concentration in MRL/lpr mice while the myo-inositol concentration remained the same in both groups. Furthermore a significant increase in total brain water content was observed, indicative of possible edema. In conclusion, the cumulative effect of increased brain lactate synthesis, altered glucose metabolism and intracellular glutamine accumulation could be an important mechanism causing brain pathology in SLE. The alteration in metabolites could alter downstream pathways and cause neurological dysfunction. Future NMR spectroscopic studies using stable isotopes and real-time measurements of metabolic rates, along with levels of metabolites in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, could be valuable in the elucidation of the cerebral metabolic consequences of systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) in humans.

The results of this experiment are novel in showing an interaction between cerebellum and primary motor cortex (MI) during learning that appears to be mediated by the dentate nucleus (DN) and in demonstrating that activity in these regions is directly related to performance. Subjects were scanned during learning (LRN) across three blocks of practice and during isochronous (ISO) and perceptual (PER) baseline conditions. CBF was compared across blocks of learning and between the LRN and baseline conditions. Results demonstrated an interaction between the cerebellum and MI such that earlier, poorer performance was associated with greater activity in the cerebellar hemispheres and later, better performance was associated with greater activity in MI. Inter-regional correlation analyses confirmed that as CBF in the cerebellum decreases, blood flow in MI increases. Importantly, these analyses also revealed that activity in cerebellar cortex was positively correlated with activity in right DN and that DN activity was negatively correlated with blood flow in MI. Activity in the cerebellar hemispheres early in learning is likely related to error correction mechanisms which optimize movement kinematics resulting in improved performance. Concurrent DN activity may be related to encoding of this information and DIN output to MI may play a role in consolidation processes that lay down motor memories. Increased activity in MI later in learning may reflect strengthening of synaptic connections associated with changes in motor maps that are characteristic of learning in both animals and humans.

High-order B-splines are used to calculate the curvature of the contours of handwritten numerals. The concept of a distribution center is introduced so that a one-dimensional periodic signal can be normalized as shift invariant. Consequently, the curvature of the contour of a character becomes rotation invariant. To reduce the dimension of the features, wavelet basis decomposition is used to produce more compact features. Finally, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) are employed to train the features and design classifiers of high recognition rates. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.

The present study aims at determining whether 131 receptors are also induced and over-expressed in the brain of STZ-rats at 2, 7, and 21 days post-treatment. This was addressed by in situ hybridization using the [S-35]-UTP alpha S-labeled riboprobe and by in vitro autoradiography with the radioligand [I-125]-HPP-des-Arg(10)-Hoe 140. In control rats, B, receptor mRNA was found widely distributed in many brain regions. Low mRNA levels were found in thalamus and hypothalamus (7-12 nCi/g) while high mRNA signals were detected in cortical regions and hippocampus (18-29 nCi/g). In diabetic rats, B-1 receptor mRNA was markedly increased in hippocampus, temporal/parietal cortices and amygdala at 2 and 7 days (+88 to +150%). Low densities of B-1 receptor binding sites were detected in all analyzed regions in control rats (0.18-0.37 fmol/mg tissue). In diabetic rats, 131 receptor binding sites were significantly increased in hippocampus, amygdala, temporal/ parietal, and perhinal/piriform cortices (+ 55 to + 165 %) at 7 days only. Results highlight an early but transient and reversible up-regulation of B-1 receptors in specific brain regions of STZ-diabetic rats. This may offer the advantage of reducing putative central side effects with B-1 receptor antagonists if used for the treatment of diabetic complications in the periphery. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

(2) When treating unstimulable phonemes, which treatment procedures will result in the best outcome? A summary of the findings from 3 randomized controlled trials is provided. In these studies, outcomes were generally better when stimulable targets were treated; however, Outcomes for unstimulable targets were improved by including phonemic perception training alongside phonetic placement procedures in the treatment program. The clinician must take final responsibility for judging the applicability, of these research findings to each individual case.

There has been controversy(5,6) over whether monkeys possess an area comparable to human area 44. We have addressed this question in the macaque monkey by combining quantitative architectonic analysis of the cortical areas within the ventrolateral frontal region with electrophysiological recording of neuron activity and electrical intracortical microstimulation. Here we show that, immediately in front of the ventral part of the agranular premotor cortical area 6, there is a distinct cortical area that is architectonically comparable to human area 44 and that this monkey area 44 is involved with the orofacial musculature. We suggest that area 44 might have evolved originally as an area exercising high-level control over orofacial actions, including those related to communicative acts, and that, in the human brain, area 44 eventually also came to control certain aspects of the speech act.

Here, we show that caspase-8 can act as an initiator of ORN apoptosis after bulbectomy and also after synaptic instability is induced by NMDA-mediated excitotoxic death of ORN target neurons in the olfactory bulb. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 are sequentially activated within ORN presynaptic terminals, and caspase-8 complexes with dynactin p150(Glued), (a retrograde motor protein) and is transported retrogradely, preceding axonal caspase-3 activation and apoptosis of ORN cell bodies. Focal in vivo inhibition of initiator caspase activation or microtubule-dependent transport (with Taxol) at the lesioned axon terminus results in a significant reduction in retrograde axonal caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and inhibition of retrograde ORN death. Caspase-8 activation and retrograde transport afterNMDAlesion is similarly reduced in mice null for p75, the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor. The retrograde apoptosis of ORNs thus involves a novel mechanism that used p75 in the local activation of caspase-8. Once caspase-8 is maximally activated in the presynaptic terminal, it is transported retrogradely by the motor complex dynactin/dynein, a process that can be inhibited focally to inhibit ORN apoptosis after acute axonal lesion. These data have revealed a novel mechanism of retrograde apoptosis, in which caspase-8 complexes directly with axonal dynactin p150Glued to reveal a differential vulnerability of subpopulations of ORNs to undergo apoptosis after axonal damage and the loss of olfactory bulb target neurons.

The ascending neuron 1 (AN1), which is tuned to the dominant carrier frequency (CF) of cricket songs, selectively codes the limited range of amplitude modulation ( AM) frequencies that occur in these signals. AN2, which is most sensitive to the ultrasonic frequencies that occur in echolocation calls of insectivorous bats, codes a broader range of AM frequencies, as occur in bat calls. A third neuron, omega neuron 1 (ON1), which is dually tuned to both ranges of carrier frequency, was shown previously to have CF-specific coding properties, allowing it to represent accurately the differing temporal structures of both cricket songs and bat calls. ON1 is a source of contralateral inhibition to AN1 and AN2, enhancing binaural contrast and facilitating sound localization. We used dichotic stimulation to examine the importance of the temporal structure of contralateral inhibition for enhancing binaural contrast. Contralateral inhibition degrades the coding of temporal pattern by AN1 and AN2, but only if the temporal pattern of inhibitory input matches that of excitation. Firing rate is also decreased most strongly by temporally matched contralateral inhibition. This is apparent for AN1 in its mean firing rate; for AN2, high-frequency firing is selectively suppressed. Our results show that the CF-specific coding properties of ON1 allow this single neuron to enhance effectively localization cues for both cricket-like and bat-like acoustic signals.

J	Schwartz, JM; Stapp, HP; Beauregard, M				Schwartz, JM; Stapp, HP; Beauregard, M			Quantum physics in neuroscience and psychology: a neurophysical model of mind-brain interaction	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						mind; consciousness; brain; neuroscience; neuropsychology; quantum mechanics		Neuropsychological research on the neural basis of behaviour generally posits that brain mechanisms will ultimately suffice to explain all psychologically described phenomena. This assumption stems from the idea that the brain is made up entirely of material particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience can therefore be formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. Thus, terms having intrinsic mentalistic and/or experiential content (e.g. 'feeling', 'knowing' and 'effort') are not included as primary causal factors. This theoretical restriction is motivated primarily by ideas about the natural world that have been known to be fundamentally incorrect for more than three-quarters of a century. Contemporary basic physical theory differs profoundly from classic physics on the important matter of how the consciousness of human agents enters into the structure of empirical phenomena. The new principles contradict the older idea that local mechanical processes alone can account for the structure of all observed empirical data. Contemporary physical theory brings directly and irreducibly into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made by human agents about how they will act. This key development in basic physical theory is applicable to neuroscience, and it provides neuroscientists and psychologists with an alternative conceptual framework for describing neural processes. Indeed, owing to certain structural features of ion channels critical to synaptic function, contemporary physical theory must in principle be used when analysing human brain dynamics. The new framework, unlike its classic-physics-based predecessor, is erected directly upon, and is compatible with, the prevailing principles of physics. It is able to represent more adequately than classic concepts the neuroplastic mechanisms relevant to the growing number of empirical studies of the capacity of directed attention and mental effort to systematically alter brain function.

Double immunohistochemical staining showed strong colocalization of CaMKIV with p-opioid receptors: Chronic treatment with morphine produced an increase in expression of CaMKIV and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, whereas a decrease in CaMKIV and pCREB expression was observed in the caudate putamen. Interestingly, chronic morphine induced a decrease in protein expression of CaMKIV in the basolateral amygdale and the primary somatosensory cortex without any concomitant changes in pCREB. These findings suggest that CaMKIV-dependent signaling may play a role in chronic morphine-induced neuroplasticity in a brain region-specific mariner.

Panic disorder patients showed appreciably high state anxiety before scanning, and exhibited significantly higher levels of glucose uptake in the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus, and in the midbrain, caudal pons, medulla, and cerebellum than controls. These results provided the first functional neuroimaging support in human patients for the neuroanatomical hypothesis of panic disorder focusing on the amygdala-based fear network.

Depletion of the NO gene in mice mimicks the reduced NFL mRNA levels seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and causes perikaryal accumulation of neurofilament proteins and axonal hypotrophy in motoneurons. NFL -/- mice were evaluated for regional brain metabolism by means of quantitative histochemical estimation of cytochrome oxidase (COx) activity. The NFL null mice displayed enzymatic activity alterations in numerous hindbrain regions, mainly the cerebellum, connected regions of the brainstem (red nucleus, vestibular nuclei, and reticular formation), and cranial nerve nuclei.

Despite a normal capacity to ambulate, NFL -/- mice had fewer rears in an open field, crossed fewer segments on stationary beams, and fell more frequently when suspended on a horizontal bar. In addition, the distance swum before reaching the escape platform was greater in NFL -/- mice than in controls during acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze at the start of training. The motor impairments were linearly correlated with increased cytochrome oxidase activity seen in cerebellum and brainstem. These results indicate that, as early as 6 months, depletion of the NFL protein is sufficient to cause mild sensorimotor dysfunctions and spatial deficits, but without overt signs of paresis.

Motion is seen from black -> blue -> white -> yellow -> black. Many hypotheses for the illusory motion have been proposed, although none have been tested physiologically. We found that the illusion works well even if it is achromatic: yellow is replaced with light gray, and blue is replaced with dark gray. We show that the critical feature for inducing illusory motion is the luminance relationship of the static elements. Illusory motion is seen from black -> dark gray -> white -> light gray -> black. In psychophysical experiments, we found that all four pairs of adjacent elements when presented alone each produced illusory motion consistent with the original illusion, a result not expected from any current models. We also show that direction-selective neurons in macaque visual cortex gave directional responses to the same static element pairs, also in a direction consistent with the illusory motion. This is the first demonstration of directional responses by single neurons to static displays and supports a model in which low-level, first-order motion detectors interpret contrast-dependent differences in response timing as motion. We demonstrate that this illusion is a static version of four-stroke apparent motion.

J	Zangenehpour, S; Chaudhuri, A				Zangenehpour, S; Chaudhuri, A			Patchy organization and asymmetric distribution of the neural correlates of face processing in monkey inferotemporal cortex	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; HUMAN FUSIFORM GYRUS; SPLIT-BRAIN MONKEYS; VISUAL AREA MT; TEMPORAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; NEURONS; MACAQUE; PERCEPTION; OBJECTS	Background: It is believed that a face-specific system exists within the primate ventral visual pathway that is separate from a domain-general nonface object coding system. In addition, it is believed that hemispheric asymmetry, which was long held to be a distinct feature of the human brain, can be found in the brains of other primates as well. We show here for the first time by way of a functional imaging technique that face- and object-selective neurons form spatially distinct clusters at the cellular level in monkey inferotemporal cortex. We have used a novel functional mapping technique that simultaneously generates two separate activity profiles by exploiting the differential time course of zif268 mRNA and protein expression. Results: We show that neurons activated by face stimulation can be visualized at cellular resolution and distinguished from those activated by nonface complex objects. Our dual-activity maps of face and object selectivity show that face-selective patches of various sizes (mean, 22.30 mm(2); std, 32.76 mm(2)) exist throughout the IT cortex in the context of a large expanse of cortical territory that is responsive to visual objects. Conclusions: These results add to recent findings that face-selective patches of various sizes exist throughout area IT and provide the first direct anatomical evidence at cellular resolution for a hemispheric asymmetry in favor of the right hemisphere. Together, our results support the notion that human and monkey brains share a similarity in both anatomical organization and distribution of function with respect to high-level visual processing.

Methods: All 82 ELBW survivors consecutively born in or referred to a single tertiary center in 1976 - 1981 were traced at a mean age of 18 y. Three disabled children had died. Fifty-nine subjects ( 75%) had their IQ tested and 69 ( 87%) responded to a questionnaire. They were compared to 44 term, normal birthweight ( NBW) matched controls. Outcome measures were: IQ ( Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) and educational outcome. The main outcome variables were compared between groups and analyzed for neonatal and demographic data and in the ELBW group for childhood data. Results: There was a strong relationship (r(2) = 0.55, p < 0.0001) between childhood and adult IQ for the 41 ELBW subjects tested at both ages (6.1 +/- 1.3 and 18.4 +/- 1.9 y). Differences were significant between ELBW and NBW groups: in mean full-scale IQ (94 +/- 12 vs 108 +/- 14), verbal IQ ( 93 +/- 12 vs 106 +/- 14) and performance IQ ( 97 +/- 14 vs 109 +/- 16) ( < 0.0001). Differences between ELBW and NBW groups in prevalence of IQ < 85 ( 19 vs 2%, p = 0.012), of schooling in a regular curriculum for age ( 36 vs 68%, p = 0.0011), of requirement for special classes or schools ( 33 vs 9%, p = 0.0032), and of obtainment of secondary school diploma for those 18 y or older ( 56 vs 85%, p = 0.018) were largely due to fathers' socioeconomic score. Conclusion: ELBW subjects had a mean adult IQ in the normal range; however, it was one standard deviation below that of NBW subjects and they had more school failures. Despite this, more than half of ELBW subjects aged 18 y or more had obtained their secondary school diploma.

In 12 patients, data were obtained at both sites using phonomyography. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 0.25-0.5 mu g (.) kg(-1) (.) min(-1) followed by propofol 2-3 mg/kg. A small piezo-electric microphone was positioned beside the vocal cords into the muscular process at the base of the arytenoid cartilage to record acoustic signals from the contraction of the LCA. A second microphone was positioned at an external site, lateral to the trachea, just below the thyroid notch. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was stimulated supramaximally using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 s. Onset, maximum effect, and offset of NMB were measured and compared. peak effect, time to reach (T) 25%, 75%, and 90% of control twitch response, and TOF recovery to TOF ratios 0.5-0.8 were significantly longer at the external site, The onset time was not significantly different between the two sites. We used phonomyography with a microphone placed at the neck to evaluate the possibility to externally monitor NMB at the larynx, When compared with LCA, we found a more pronounced peak effect and longer offset of NMB. The acoustic signals recorded at this external site are unlikely to stern from laryngeal muscle contraction but are rather a result of contraction of the strap muscles of the neck.

Fos expression was used as a marker for neuronal activation and compared across the forebrains of rats that underwent the different types of surgery. Electrolytic and excitotoxic PRh lesions produced dramatic increases in Fos expression in the cortex, and excitotoxic and aspiration PRh lesions increased Fos expression in the dentate gyrus. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that different lesion methods have separable effects on neural function in regions outside the lesion site that could account for inconsistencies in the literature regarding the behavioral effects of PRh lesions on tests of spatial memory.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is thought to implicate frontal-striatal circuitry. We used oculomotor tests to investigate executive functions and methylphenidate response in two subtypes of ADHD. Methods: Subjects were boys aged 11.5-14 years, with ADHD-combined (n = 10), ADHD-inattentive (n = 12), and control subjects (n = 10). Executive functions assessed were motor planning (tapped with predictive saccades), response inhibition (antisaccades), and task switching (saccades-antisaccades mixed), Results: The ADHD-combined boys were impaired relative to control subjects in motor planning (p &LT; .003) and response inhibition (p &LT; .007) but not in task switching (p &GT; 92). They were also significantly impaired relative to ADHD-inattentive boys, making fewer predictive saccades (p &LT; .03) and having more subjects with antisaccade performance in the impaired range (p &LT; .04). Methylphenidate significantly improved motor planning and response inhibition in both subtypes. Conclusions. ADHD-combined but not ADHD-inattentive boys showed impairments on motor planning and response inhibition. These deficits might be mediated by brain structures implicated specifically in the hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Methylphenidate, improved oculomotor performance in both subtypes, thus, it was effective even when initial performance was not impaired.

In addition, the study tested certain predictions of the "suppression deficit" and "coarse semantic coding" hypotheses that have been proposed to account for the linguistic deficits typically observed after RH damage. Homonymous, metonymous, and metaphorical words were used as primes followed after a short (100 ms) or a long (1000 ms) inter-stimulus interval (ISI) by dominant-meaning-related, subordinate-meaning-related or unrelated target words. No significant group effects were found, and for both ISIs, dominant- and subordinate-related targets were facilitated relative to unrelated control targets for the homonymy and metonymy conditions. In contrast, for the metaphor condition, only targets related to the dominant meaning were facilitated. These findings provide only partial support for the "suppression deficit" hypothesis and no support for the "coarse semantic coding" hypothesis (as interpreted herein) indicating that patients with focal LH or RH damage can access the multiple meanings of ambiguous words and exhibit processing abilities comparable to those of older normal control subjects, at least at the single-word level.

Recent evidence shows that the biophysical properties of &alpha;-motoneurones are plastic and adapt to both increases and decreases in chronic activation. The nature of the adaptations-in resting membrane potential, spike threshold, afterhyper-polarization amplitude, and rate of depolarization during spike generation-point to involvement of density, type, location, and/or metabolic modulation of ion conductance channels in the motoneuronal membrane. These changes will have significant effects on how motoneurones respond when activated during the generation of movements, and on the effort required to sustain activation during prolonged exercise. Since the adaptations most likely involve structural changes in the motoneurones and changes in protein synthesis, and change the output response of the cells to input, they are considered to be learning responses. Future research directions for examining this issue are outlined.

Methods: Tremor was recorded prior to, and 7 days post-surgery using a laser displacement sensor. In addition, tremor was recorded in 10 age-matched patients with PD showing low amplitude tremor (named PD controls) and in 10 age-matched control subjects. Tremor recordings in patients were performed after a 12 It withdrawal from anti-Parkinsonian drugs. Tremor characteristics such as amplitude, median power frequency (MPF) and power dispersion (a measure of concentration of power in the frequency domain) were assessed for all groups (i.e. controls, PD controls, pre-surgery and post-surgery). Results: All tremor characteristics were similar between controls and PD controls. Tremor amplitude was significantly reduced post-surgery, to become statistically similar to that of controls and PD controls. However, MPF and power dispersion remained lower post-surgery, indicating that although there was normalization of tremor amplitude, tremor showed systematically slower oscillations after the surgical procedure. In order to eliminate amplitude as a possible confounding factor, epochs of post-surgical tremor (5 s in duration) were paired for equal amplitude with 5 s tremor epochs from matched controls. Results show once again that MPF and power dispersion were lower post-surgery compared to controls. In addition, when amplitude of power was compared within specific frequency bands (0-3.5, 3.5-7.5, 7.5-12.5. 12.5-16.5. 16.5-30 and 30-45), power regained normal values at frequencies below 7.5 Hz. Power within higher frequency bands was systematically lower, indicating that the surgical procedure had an impact on high-frequency components of tremor. Conclusions: Results from the present study showed that VL thalamotomy reduced trernor amplitude by selectively targeting centrally driven components of PD tremor. The high-frequency component of physiological tremor failed to emerge after amplitude normalization. Significance: The thalamus should then be considered as an important component of the generation and/or propagation of high-frequency components of physiological tremor.

Background: Both tic and habit disorders are hypothesized to involve states of heightened activation, which could impede initiation and the control of complex motor actions. Method: The electrophysiological signal was recorded from 4 electrodes (Fz, C3, C4, Pz) during a fixed 4-second foreperiod reaction time task. Results: During automated responses, controls showed a shorter RP peak onset, and during controlled responses a longer MAP peak onset, compared with both clinical groups. The controls were the only group who showed a consistent linear relationship between RP and RT. Conclusions: Patients with chronic tic as well as habit disorder may not modulate cortical activation optimally in planning and executing both automated and controlled responses.

Questions about how task sets are engaged, maintained, and shifted have recently become a major focus of research on executive control processes. We employed dense-array (128-channel) event-related potential (ER-P) methodology to examine the dynamics of brain systems engaged during the preparation and implementation of task switching. The EEG was recorded While participants performed letter and digit judgments to pseudorandomly-ordered, univalent (#3, A %) and bivalent (G5) stimulus trials, with the appropriate task cued by a colored rectangle presented 450 ms before target onset. Results revealed spatial and temporal variations in brain activity that could be related to preparatory processes common to both switch and repeat trials, switch-specific control processes engaged to reconfigure and maintain task set under conflict, and visual priming benefits of task repetition. Despite extensive practice and improvement, both behavioral and ERP results indicated that subjects maintained high levels of executive control processing with extended task engagement. The patterns of ERP activity obtained in the present study fit well with functional neuroanatomical models of self-regulation of action. The frontopolar and right-lateralized frontal switch effects obtained in the present study are consistent with the role of these regions in adapting to changing contextual contingencies. In contrast, the centroparietal P3b and N384 effects related to the contextual ambiguity of bivalent trials are consistent with the context monitoring and updating functions associated with the posterior cingulate learning circuit.

Recent findings A current debate is where and what initiates the neuroinflammatory reaction that characterizes the acute multiple sclerosis lesion. Immune sensitization to neural antigens could develop within the systemic compartment consequent to exposure to cross-reacting, possibly viral derived, peptides (molecular mimicry). Although CD4 T cells are considered central to initiating central nervous system inflammation, the actual extent and specificity of tissue injury reflects the array of adaptive (CD8 T cells and antibody) and innate (microglia/macrophages) immune constituents present in the lesions. Neuropathologic studies indicate that lethal changes in neural cells (oligodendrocytes) could also be the initiating event, reflecting as yet unidentified acquired insults (e.g. exogenous virus or reactivated endogenous retrovirus) or intrinsic abnormalities ('neurodegenerative' hypothesis). Recurrence or persistence of the disease process can reflect events occurring at multiple sites including expansion of the immune repertoire in response to neural antigens transported to regional lymph nodes (determinant spreading), especially if immune regulatory mechanisms are defective; alterations in blood-brain barrier properties consequent to initial cellular transmigration; and participation of endogenous (microglia, astrocytes) or long lived infiltrating cells (macrophages, B cells in ectopic germinal centers) in regulating and effecting immune functions within the central nervous system. Accumulating neurologic deficit reflects the balance between injury and repair; the latter also being negatively or positively (trophic support and clearance of tissue debris) impacted by inflammatory processes. Summary Understanding the full spectrum of multiple sclerosis presents a continuing challenge for both immunology and neurobiology.

To gain further insight into the role of Pax2 in mid-hindbrain patterning, we searched for novel Pax2-regulated genes by cDNA microarray analysis of FACS-sorted GFP(+) mid-hindbrain cells from wild-type and Pax2(-/-) embryos carrying a Pax2(GFP) BAC transgene. Here, we report the identification of five genes that depend on Pax2 function for their expression in the mid-hindbrain boundary region. These genes code for the transcription factors En2 and Brn1 (Pou3f3), the intracellular signaling modifiers Sef and Tapp1, and the non-coding RNA Ncrms. The Brn1 gene was further identified as a direct target of Pax2, as two functional Pax2-binding sites in the promoter and in an upstream regulatory element of Brn1 were essential for lacZ transgene expression at the mid-hindbrain boundary. Moreover, ectopic expression of a dominant-negative Brn1 protein in chick embryos implicated Brn1 in Fgf8 gene regulation. Together, these data defined novel functions of Pax2 in the establishment of distinct transcriptional programs and in the control of intracellular signaling during mid-hindbrain development.

Very little is known about how the differentiation of these cell types is regulated in chick. Here, we report the cloning of the chick homolog of Otp. Moreover, we have systematically compared the expression of Sim1, Sim2, Brn2, and Otp with that of the markers of terminal differentiation TRH, SS, CRH, vasotocin, and mesotocin during development of chick embryos. We have found that the cell types studied generally develop in domains expressing these transcriptional regulators but that the pattern of neuronal differentiation and the spatial distribution of some regulators were not the same as in mice. Our results provide a framework useful for the functional analysis of hypothalamus development in chick. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

As basic research progresses, more is being understood about the mechanisms that underlie chronic pain. Understanding such physiology and how it changes in response to nerve injury, for example, enables the identification of potential targets for analgesic therapy. This review discusses one such target: the T-type calcium channel. There are a variety of other calcium channels, such as N-, P/Q- and L-type channels. To date, research on calcium channels has proved fruitful; for example, ziconotide (Prialt); which acts on N-type calcium channels, a target identified using animal pain models, is now available for the treatment of chronic pain.

The importance of GC excess on the central nervous system is highlighted by the high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and cognitive impairment in patients who have CS. In addition, there is a high incidence of apparent diffuse loss of brain volume in patients who have CS. Recent studies indicate at least partial reversibility of these abnormalities following correction of hypercortisolism.

Methods: We quantified vulnerable interneurons in stratum oriens-alveus (O/A) by using immunohistochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), parvalbumin (PV), and somatostatin (SS) after KA injections in rats, and then compared in normal slices the effects of KA on interneurons either in O/A (vulnerable to KA) or in strata radiatum and lacunosummoleculare (R/LM) (resistant to KA) by using whole-cell recording and calcium imaging. Results: GAD-, PV- and SS-positive cells in O/A were decreased after KA treatment in P20 and P30 rats. Both short (1-min) and long (10-min) applications of KA produced similar tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive membrane depolarization and decrease in input resistance in O/A and R/LM interneurons. KA responses were antagonized by CNQX and GYKI52466, suggesting AMPA receptor activation. KA also generated a similar increase in intracellular Ca2+ in O/A and R/LM interneurons, which was antagonized by CNQX and GYKI52466. Conclusions: The selective vulnerability of GAD-, PV-, and SS-immunopositive O/A interneurons in the KA model may not arise from cell-specific short-term membrane effects or calcium responses induced by KA, but from other glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxic processes.

In primates, this function involves the anterior cingulate cortex. However, whether anterior cingulate error-related activity indicates occurrence of inappropriate responses or results from other computations is debated. Here we have tested whether reward-related parameters modulate error-related activity of anterior cingulate neurons. Recordings in monkeys performing stimulus-reward associations and preliminary data obtained with a problem-solving task revealed major properties of error-related unit activity: (i) their amplitude varies with the amount of predicted reward or the proximity to reward delivery; (ii) they appear both after execution and performance errors; (iii) they do not indicate which error occurred or which correction to make; and (iv), importantly, the activity of these neurons also increases following an external signal indicating the necessity to shift response. Hence, we conclude that anterior cingulate 'error' activity might represent a negative deviation from a predicted goal, and does not only reflect error detection but signals events interrupting potentially rewarded actions.

The activity of muscles and forces required for movements emerge depending on the difference between the actual and referent body configurations. We identified the referent arm configurations specified by the nervous system to bring the arm to the target position both in healthy individuals and in those with arm motor paresis due to stroke. From an initial position of the right arm, subjects matched a force equivalent to 30% of their maximal voluntary force in that position. The external force, produced at the handle of a double-joint manipulandum by two torque motors, pulled the hand to the left (165 degrees) or pushed it to the right (0 degrees). For both the initial conditions, three directions of the final force (0 degrees, +20 degrees, and -20 degrees) with respect to the direction of the initial force were used. Subjects were instructed not to intervene when the load was unexpectedly partially or completely removed. Both groups of subjects produced similar responses to unloading of the double-joint arm system. Partial removal of the load resulted in distinct final hand positions associated with unique shoulder-elbow configurations and joint torques. The net static torque at each joint before and after unloading was represented as a function of the two joint angles describing a planar surface or invariant characteristic in 3D torque/angle coordinates. For each initial condition, the referent arm configuration was identified as the combination of elbow and shoulder angles at which the net torques at the two joints were zero. These configurations were different for different initial conditions. The identification of the referent configuration was possible for all healthy participants and for most individuals with hemiparesis suggesting that they preserved the ability to adapt their central commands-the referent arm configurations-to accommodate changes in external load conditions. Despite the preservation of the basic response patterns, individuals with stroke damage had a more restricted range of hand trajectories following unloading, an increased instability around the final endpoint position, altered patterns of elbow and shoulder muscle coactivation, and differences in the dispersion of referent configurations in elbow-shoulder joint space compared to healthy individuals. Moreover, 4 out of 12 individuals with hemiparesis were unable to specify referent configurations of the arm in a consistent way. It is suggested that problems in the specification of the referent configuration may be responsible for the inability of some individuals with stroke to produce coordinated multijoint movements. The present work adds three findings to the motor control literature concerning stroke: non-significant torque/angle relationships in some subjects, narrower range of referent arm configurations, and instability about the final position. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility of the concept of the referent configuration for the double-joint muscle-reflex system and the ability of some individuals with stroke to produce task-specific adjustments of this configuration.

Altered central serotonergic neuro-transmission may be involved in its pathogenesis. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial evaluated the efficacy of ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor subtype antagonist, for treating fatigue in PBC. A crossover design was chosen, allowing subjects to serve as their own controls-appropriate to evaluate fatigue, a subjective symptom. Sixty patients with clinically stable PBC, a Fatigue Severity Score (FSS) > 4, and no other identifiable cause for fatigue were enrolled. Subjects were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 mg) or placebo orally 3 times daily for 4 weeks (period 1). Subjects then crossed over, after a minimum 1-week washout period, for a further 4 weeks of ondansetron or placebo (period 2). Fatigue was measured at the beginning and end of each period by using the FSS and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS). Six patients withdrew; the remaining 54 subjects had a mean baseline FSS of 5.55 (+/- 0.1). Response to study medication in period 1 versus period 2 was not uniform; thus, it was necessary to analyze the trial periods separately. In period 1, there was no significant additional fatigue reduction on ondansetron over placebo. During period 2, FSS and FIS decreased significantly on ondansetron versus placebo (P =.001). However, period 2 results were invalidated because drug side effects unblinded subjects (constipation affected 63.0% of patients taking ondansetron, versus 13.3% on placebo). In conclusion, ondansetron administration did not confer clinically significant fatigue reduction when compared with placebo in our study population.

Here, a symmetric (bilateral) controller is used as a model for the oculomotor control system (OCS) to drive two cameras on a robotic head. It relies, as in biology, on internal switching in shared premotor circuits to alternate automatically between the two types of movements comprising nystagmus. The symmetric structural concept is gaining acceptance as evidence points to sharing of both fast phase and slow phase control in brainstem structures previously thought to be solely involved in one mode alone. This bilateral OCS model is a parsimonious design that is at once biomimetic and analytically simple. We extend prior results by incorporating more biological clues from floccular projections to establish rudimentary prediction mechanisms for both slow and fast phases; prediction is achieved by using retinal slip, which contains target velocity information. This provides a more accurate, replication of the difference between fast phase and slow phase dynamics, and considers neural activity profiles in the superior colliculus to refine the controller performance. The resulting controller eliminates the need for saccades in steady state for low frequency inputs, and each saccade now has better accuracy, despite visual delays.

Marked improvements in thresholds taking place over several hours were observed during the frequency- and ear-specific training period. Comparisons between pre- and posttraining thresholds showed large improvements at the trained frequency, but also at other frequencies. The improvements were initially slightly-but significantly-larger at the trained frequency than at untrained frequencies. However, this trained-frequency advantage disappeared rapidly during the course of the two-hour multifrequency posttraining session, suggesting rapid relearning or learning generalization across frequencies. In contrast, no significant ear specificity was found, not even at early stages of the posttraining session. These findings add to earlier results suggesting that, in humans, frequency discrimination learning is only weakly frequency-specific, and they reveal that a complete generalization across frequencies can occur rapidly with little retraining at the initially untrained frequencies. Implications regarding underlying mechanisms are discussed.

Over the last several years, functional neuroimaging has risen in prominence relative to the lesion studies that formed the historical core of work in this field. These two methods have different strengths and weaknesses. Among these is a crucial difference in the nature of evidence each can provide. Lesion studies can provide evidence for necessity claims, whereas functional neuroimaging studies do not. We hypothesized that lesion studies will continue to have greater scientific impact even as the relative proportion of such studies in the cognitive neuroscience literature declines. Using methods drawn from systematic literature review. we identified a set of original cognitive neuroscience articles that employed either functional imaging or lesion techniques, published at one of two time points in the 1990s, and assessed the effect of the method used on each article's impact across the decade. Functional neuro-imaging studies were cited three times more often than lesion studies throughout the time span we examined. This effect was in large part clue to differences in the influence of the journals publishing the two methods; functional neuroimaging studies appeared disproportionately more often in higher impact journals. There were also differences in the degree to which articles using one method cited articles using the other method. Functional neuroimaging articles were less likely to include Such cross-method citations.

A large number of factors oversees productivity and cost estimation processes for piles, which creates many problems for the time and cost estimators of such process. Therefore, current study is designed to diagnose these problems and assess productivity, cycle time, and cost for pile construction using the artificial neural network (ANN). Data were collected for this study through designated questionnaires, site interviews, and telephone calls to experts in different construction companies. Many variables have been considered to manage the piling construction process. Three-layer, feed forward, and fully connected ANNs were trained with an architecture of seven input neurons, five output neurons, and different hidden layer neurons. The ANN models were validated and proved their robustness in output assessments. Three sets of charts have been developed to assess productivity, cycle time, and cost. This research is relevant to both industry practitioners and researchers. It provides sets of charts for practitioners' usage to schedule and price out pile construction projects. In addition, it provides researchers with a methodology of applying ANN to pile construction process, its limitation, and future suggestions.

An output re-definition strategy is first introduced to guarantee stable zero dynamics. This output redefinition scheme is applicable to a class of open-loop stable nonlinear systems whose input-output maps contain nonlinear terms in the output and linear terms in the input. No explicit knowledge about the nonlinearities of the system is required. The nonlinearities of the system are identified by a neural network. The identified neural network model is then used in modifying the zero dynamics of the system. A stable/anti-stable factorization is performed on the zero dynamics of the system. The new output is re-defined using the neural identifier and the stable part of the zero dynamics. A controller is then designed based on the new output whose zero dynamics are stable and can be inverted. An experimental setup of a single-link flexible manipulator is considered as a practical case study of a nonlinear nonminimum phase system. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the advantages and improved performance of the proposed tracking controller over both linear and nonlinear conventional controllers in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations.

Methods After a placebo run-in, 57 patients were included in a prospective randomized open-label design protocol for therapy with amlodipine (5 mg for 4 weeks followed by 10 mg for 4 weeks, n = 22), or ramipril (2.5 mg for 1 week, 5.0 mg for 3 weeks and 10 mg for 4 weeks, n = 17) or telmisartan (80 mg for 8 weeks, n = 18). Autonomic functions were assessed by norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), as well as by the spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Results The 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, plasma NE and HRV demonstrated the characteristic day-night circadian rhythm in hypertensives. Higher values for SBP and DBP and for NE levels, as well as for spectral analysis components - low frequency band (LF) and low frequency/ high frequency (LF/HF) ratio - were found during the day, whereas the HF was higher during the night. In patients treated with amlodipine, the HF decreased significantly during the night, while the LF and the LF/HF ratio increased during the day in association with the rise in NE. The therapy with telmisartan did increase the HF during the night and the day, while ramipril did not influence all HRV components during the night but significantly increased the HF, and decreased the LF/HF ratio during the day. No changes were observed in plasma NE with telmisartan or ramipril, but a 50% increase in NE levels throughout the 24-h period was found in amlodipine-treated patients. Conclusion These data suggest a sympathetic activation during the day and a decrease in parasympathetic activity during the night after therapy with amlodipine, correlated with increases in plasma NE. In contrast, the therapy with telmisartan significantly increased parasympathetic activity without changes in NE during the night and day. The therapy with ramipril increased the parasympathetic activity only during the day. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The striking differences between the phenotype of mice in which either the ciliary neurotropilic factor or its receptor are inactivated suggest that the cardiotrophin-like cytokine/cytokine-like factor-1 complex could be the developmentally important ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor ligand. Cardiotrophin-like cytokine is also produced in the immune system and has been reported to activate B cells in vivo and in vitro. B cells do not express the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor suggesting the existence of an alternative receptor. We produced the cardiotrophin-like cytokine/cytokine-like factor-1 complex tagged with a Bir A biotin ligase AviTag peptide substrate. This cytokine could be efficiently biotinylated in vitro with Bir A. It was subsequently validated as a sensitive tool for ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor detection by flow cytometry and for magnetic-activated cell sorting. It was also shown to allow the detection of a specific receptor by activated B cells. Whereas binding to cells expressing the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor could be prevented by competition with ciliary neurotrophic factor, binding to B cells was not. The biotinylated cardiotrophin-like cytokine/cytokine-like factor-1 complex therefore represents a new reagent to study ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-like cytokine receptor expression and for the identification of the putative cardiotrophin-like cytokine B cell receptor. It further validates the use of biotin ligase catalysed biotinylation for the detection of cytokine receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, its role in the central nervous system is mostly unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of neurotrophic factors on nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1. We showed that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and nerve growth factor (NGF) potently induced the nuclear exclusion of FoxO1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) while neurotrophin (NT)-3 and NT-4 were much weaker and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) failed to induce FoxO1 translocation in PC12 cells. FoxO1 translocation was inhibited by LY294002, a well-established PI3K/Akt kinase inhibitor. Moreover, FoxO1 was phosphorylated at Thr24 and Ser256 residues by the above neurotrophic factors, with the exception of BDNF. Triple mutant FoxO1, in which three Akt/PKB phosphorylation sites (Thr24, Ser256 and Ser319) were mutated to alanine, resulted in the complete nuclear targeting of the expressed FoxO1-GFP fusion protein in the presence of the above neurotrophic factors in both PC12 cells and cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that neurotrophic factors are able to regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1 via the PI3K/Akt pathway in neuronal cells.

J	Chan, WWP; Galiana, HL				Chan, WWP; Galiana, HL			Integrator function in the oculomotor system is dependent on sensory context	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; NEURAL INTEGRATOR; EYE-MOVEMENTS; CAT; NYSTAGMUS; DISCHARGE; POSITION; VELOCITY; LESIONS; COMPLEX	The oculomotor integrator is usually defined by the characteristics of decay in gaze after saccades to flashed targets or after spontaneous gaze shifts in the dark. This property is then presumed fixed and accessed by other ocular reflexes, such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) or pursuit, to shape motoneural signals. An alternate view of this integrator proposes that it relies on a distributed network, which should change its properties with sensory-motor context. Here we demonstrate in 10 normal subjects that the function of integration can vary in an individual with the imposed test. The value of the time constant for the decay of gaze holding in the dark can be significantly different from the effective integration time constant estimated from VOR responses. Hence analytical tools for the study of dynamics in ocular reflexes must allow for nonideal and labile integrator function. The mechanisms underlying such labile integration remain to be explored and may be different in various ocular reflexes ( e. g., visual versus vestibular).

For the purpose of biodistribution studies by fluorescence techniques, [Dmt(1)]DALDA analogues containing various fluorescent labels [dansyl, anthraniloyl (atn), fluorescein, or 6-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl] in several different locations of the peptide were synthesized and characterized in vitro in the guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens assays, and in &mu;-, &delta;- and &kappa;-opioid receptor-binding assays. The analogues showed various degrees of &mu; receptor-binding selectivity, but all of them were less &mu;-selective than the [Dmt(1)]DALDA parent peptide. Most analogues retained potent, full &mu;-agonist activity, except for one with fluorescein attached at the C-terminus (3a) (partial &mu;-agonist) and one containing &beta;-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine (aladan) in place of Phe(3) (4) (&mu;- and &kappa;-antagonist). The obtained data indicate that the receptor-binding affinity, receptor selectivity and intrinsic efficacy of the prepared analogues vary very significantly, depending on the type of fluorescent label used and on its location in the peptide. The results suggest that the biological activity profile of fluorescence-labeled peptide analogues should always be carefully determined prior to their use in biodistribution studies or other studies. One of the analogues containing the atn group (2a) proved highly useful in a study of cellular uptake and intracellular distribution by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published between 1966 and March 2005 searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Eight studies were identified (six case-control, one cohort, and one cross-sectional). We found that dietary intake of vitamin E protects against PD. This protective influence was seen with both moderate intake (relative risk 0 (.) 81, 95% CI 0(.)67-0(.)98) and high intake (0(.)78, 0(.)57-1(.)06) of vitamin E, although the possible benefit associated with high intake of vitamin E was not significant. The studies did not suggest any protective effects associated with vitamin C or P carotene. We conclude that dietary vitamin E may have a neuroprotective effect attenuating the risk of PD. These results require confirmation in randomised controlled trials.

We previously demonstrated, and confirmed in this study, that inhibition of NGF binding to both TrkA and p75(NTR) inhibited kindling and decreased kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting. We now report specific inhibition of TrkA center dot NGF binding, but not p75(NTR) center dot NGF binding, retarded perforant path kindling progression. However, mossy fiber sprouting was inhibited by either selective TrkA center dot NGF or p75(NTR) NGF antagonists. Our results suggest that TrkA, but not p75(NTR), plays a role in kindling, while both receptors modulate kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting. This implicates different mechanisms of neurotrophin action on kindling (mediated by TrkA) and neuronal sprouting (mediated by both TrkA and p75(NTR)) and suggests that sprouting involves kindling-independent neurotrophin action via p75(NTR).

The netrin receptor, DCC ( deleted in colorectal cancer), is highly expressed by dopaminergic (DA) neurons. DCC may therefore participate in the organization of DA circuitry during development and also influence DA function in the adult. Here we show that adult dcc heterozygous mice exhibit a blunted behavioral response to the indirect DA agonist amphetamine and do not develop sensitization to its effects when treated repeatedly. These behavioral alterations are associated with profound changes in DA function. In the medial prefrontal cortex, dcc heterozygotes exhibit increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels and dramatic increases in basal concentrations of DA and DA metabolites. In contrast, in the nucleus accumbens, dcc heterozygotes show no changes in either TH or DA levels, but exhibit decreased concentrations of DA metabolites, suggesting reduced DA activity. In addition, dcc heterozygous mice exhibit a small, but significant reduction in total number of TH-positive neurons in midbrain DA cell body regions. These results demonstrate for the first time that alterations in dcc expression lead to selective changes in DA function and, in turn, to differences in DA-related behaviors in adulthood. These findings raise the possibility that changes in dcc function early in life are implicated in the development of DA dysregulation observed in certain psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, or following chronic use of drugs of abuse.

In keeping with this clinical evidence, we have reported that repetitive electrical stimuli delivered at approximately 1 Hz in mouse hippocampus-entorhinal cortex (EC) slices depress the EC ability to generate ictal activity induced by the application of 4-aminopyridine (4AP) or Mg2+-free medium (Barbarosie, M., Avoli, M., 1997. CA3-driven hippocampal-entorhinal loop controls rather than sustains in vitro limbic seizures. J. Neurosci. 17, 9308-9314.). Here, we confirmed a similar control mechanism in rat brain slices analyzed with field potential recordings during 4AP (50 mu M) treatment. In addition, we used intrinsic optical signal (IOS) recordings to quantify the intensity and spatial characteristics of this inhibitory influence. IOSs reflect the changes in light transmittance throughout the entire extent of the slice, and are thus reliable markers of limbic network epileptiform synchronization. First, we found that in the presence of 4AP, the IOS increases, induced by a train of electrical stimuli (10 Hz for 1 s) or by recurrent, single-shock stimulation delivered at 0.05 Hz in the deep EC layers, are reduced in intensity and area size by low-frequency (I Hz), repetitive stimulation of the subiculum; these effects were observed in all limbic areas contained in the slice. Second, by testing the effects induced by repetitive subicular stimulation at 0.2-10 Hz, we identified maximal efficacy when repetitive stimuli are delivered at I Hz. Finally, we discovered that similar, but slightly less pronounced, inhibitory effects occur when repetitive stimuli at I Hz are delivered in the EC, suggesting that the reduction of IOSs seen during repetitive stimulation is pathway dependent as well as activity dependent. Thus, the activation of limbic networks at low frequency reduces the intensity and spatial extent of the IOS changes that accompany ictal synchronization in an in vitro slice preparation.

J	Zhan, CA; Ledgeway, T; Baker, CL				Zhan, CA; Ledgeway, T; Baker, CL			Contrast response in visual cortex: Quantitative assessment with intrinsic optical signal imaging and neural firing	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						contrast response function; orientation selectivity; direction selectivity; visual cortex; cortical map; optical imaging	3-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE-TOPOGRAPHY; ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT INCREASES; RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; BLOOD-FLOW; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; SENSORY STIMULATION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; ORIENTATION MAPS	While previous studies showed that intrinsic optical signals spatially correspond with electro physiological responses in mammalian visual cortex, the quantitative correspondence of their response strengths is open to question. Measurement of both signals' strength as functions of visual stimulus contrast provides an opportunity for quantitative comparison. Towards that end, the spatial and temporal properties of the optical signal impose important constraints upon quantification of its strength. We used intrinsic optical signal imaging and single unit recording to measure responses to drifting gratings at contrasts ranging from 10-80% in cat area 18. We calculated the average difference images for pairs of oppositely moving, or orthogonally oriented, gratings at each contrast and evaluated three different methods for quantifying optical signal strength. After about 2.5 s, the spatial patterns of optical images and the time course of their strength were contrast-invariant. This "space-time-contrast separability" for optical response implies a spatial uniformity of the optical contrast response functions, provides an objective basis to guide temporal averaging of optical signals, and validates a scalar metric of optical signal strength. Optically measured contrast response functions increase monotonically and saturate at high contrasts, qualitatively resembling those from single units. However, quantitative comparison reveals a nonlinear relationship with neural firing, such that the optical response reaches half of its maximum when the neural response has reached only around 20% of its maximum. This relationship suggests that intrinsic optical signals are relatively more sensitive to weak signals than neural firing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Voxel-based morphometric analyses of gray- and white-matter densities, and event-related potentials in response to a visual-attention task were determined in 47 male drinkers (current alcohol intake 20 drinks per week, lifetime alcohol intake 240 kg) and 44 female drinkers (current alcohol intake 15 drinks per week, lifetime alcohol intake 170 kg). All participants had a negative personal and family history of alcohol dependence to reduce possible confounding by genetic factors related to alcohol dependence. In males, mean lifetime alcohol intake was negatively associated with gray-matter density and positively associated with white-matter density in the right frontal gyrus (BA 6) and the right parietal region (BA 40). Right frontal (but not right parietal) gray and white matter in males correlated with the P3 amplitude of the event-related potentials elicited in a visual-attention task. In females, mean lifetime alcohol intake was not associated with gray- or white-matter density. Current alcohol intake was unrelated to gray or white matter ill both males and females. In conclusion, lifetime alcohol intake is associated with focal gray-matter decreases and white-matter increases in the right frontal and right parietal brain regions in non-alcohol-dependent males, but not in females. These alcohol-related differences in focal brain matter in males are associated with differences in brain function related to visual attention. As the confounding effects of genetic factors were reduced, the present results may selectively relate to the effects of alcohol intake on focal brain matter. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Worsley, KJ				Worsley, KJ			Spatial smoothing of autocorrelations to control the degrees of freedom in fMRI analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; spatial smoothing; autocorrelations; degrees of freedom	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; INFERENCE	In the statistical analysis of fMRI data, the parameter of primary interest is the effect of a contrast; of secondary interest is its standard error, and of tertiary interest is the standard error of this standard error, or equivalently, the degrees of freedom (df). In a ReML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) analysis, we show how spatial smoothing of temporal autocorrelations increases the effective df (but not the smoothness of primary or secondary parameter estimates), so that the amount of smoothing can be chosen in advance to achieve a target df, typically 100. This has already been done at the second level of a hierarchical analysis by smoothing the ratio of random to fixed effects variances (Worsley, K.J., Liao, C., Aston, J.A.D., Petre, V., Duncan, G.H., Morales, F., Evans, A.C., 2002. A general statistical analysis for fMRI data. NeuroImage, 15:1-15); we now show how to do it at the first level, by smoothing autocorrelation parameters. The proposed method is extremely fast and it does not require any image processing. It can be used in conjunction with other regularization methods (Gautama, T., Van Hulle, M.M., in press. Optimal spatial regularisation of autocorrelation estimates in fMRI analysis. NeuroImage.) to avoid unnecessary smoothing beyond 100 df. Our results on a typical 6-min, TR = 3, 1.5-T fMRI data set show that 8.5-mm smoothing is needed to achieve 100 df, and this results in roughly a doubling of detected activations.

Converging evidence points to the involvement of central cholinergic system in this neuropsychiatric disorder, and our previous studies have suggested that cholinergic neurotransmission may be altered in post-pubertal NVH lesioned rats. We investigated here muscarinic receptor reactivity in NVH lesioned animals by measuring the effects of the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine on physiological responses known to be modulated by these receptors such as body temperature, salivation, tremor, pain, and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI). Quantitative receptor autoradiography revealed that post-pubertal NVH lesioned animals display increased levels of [H-3] pirenzepine/M-1-like and [H-3] AFDX-384/M-2-like receptor binding sites in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and in subareas of the dorsal hippocampus. Moreover, in response to the systemic administration of oxotremorine (0.25 mg/kg), post-pubertal NVH lesioned rats exhibited increases in salivation and tremor, and a greater reduction in body temperature compared to sham control animals. Increases in the hot-plate latency were also observed suggesting enhanced antinociceptive effects of oxotremorine in postpubertal NVH lesioned animals. Finally, oxotremorine (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg) disrupted PPI in post-pubertal sham control rats while the muscarinic receptor antagonist biperiden (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) normalized this behavior in NVH lesioned rats. Taken together, these findings reveal that post-pubertal NVH lesioned rats display enhanced muscarinic receptor responsiveness, which may relate to some behavioral abnormalities reported in this animal model.

In research and clinical domains, an effort is done to objectify or quantify the qualitative aspects of a movement (pattern of movement) in predicting neurological problems. This study aimed to standardize quantitative motor measures initially developed for adults and adopted to the evaluation of preschoolers. The sample consisted of 110 healthy children aged 4-6. The following quantitative neuromotor tests were selected: alternating movements and pointing movements (DOCO Microsystemes Inc., Montreal, Canada), postural tremor, postural sway and simple reaction time (Danish Product Development Ltd., Snekkersten, Denmark). Validation measures included global motor tasks and a neurological examination. Results indicate adequate test-retest reliability and complementarities amongst the selected voluntary and involuntary measures. Both the feasibility and relevance of quantitative neuromotor tests in preschool aged children were established. Results also provide a representation of intra-individual and inter-individual variability within this population. Lastly, the results highlight the importance of developmental factors, behavioral factors and testing conditions in the neuromotor evaluation of young children. The proposed tests could help in the early detection of children at risk for motor dysfunctions following neurotoxic exposure. The tests can also be used for the follow up of various conditions relating to motor functions (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, preterm infants) and in the evaluation of the effects of medication.

From April 2000, to March 2002, 82% (1,886/2,300) of all Canadian paediatricians reported possible new cases of D+ HUS or SP+ HUS. Diagnosis was validated with a second questionnaire. There were a total of 136 children with D+ HUS (epidemic, n=15; endemic, n=121), corresponding to an annual incidence rate of 1.11 cases per 100,000 children under 16 years of age. Excluding incomplete forms, the annual incidence rate among endemic cases was 0.74 cases per 100,000. The provinces of Ontario (40%), Quebec (31%), and Alberta (18%) accounted for 89% of cases. Evidence of E. coli O157 or O157:H7 were found in 94% (79/84) of children who had positive stool cultures. The mortality rate was 4% (n=5) and 34% (n=41) of children underwent dialysis for a median of 12 days (2-60 days). SP-HUS was diagnosed in four children with pneumonia and pleural effusion (n=2) or meningitis (n=2) who survived. One child with positive direct Coombs testing had definitive evidence of SP+ HUS. The remaining three were considered possible cases. We conclude that SP+ HUS is rare in Canada. Over the last 15 years, the incidence of childhood D+ HUS in Canadian children may have decreased.

ANP regulates a variety of physiological parameters by interacting with its receptors present on the plasma membrane. These are of three subtypes NPR-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C. NPR-A and NPR-B are guanylyl cyclase receptors, whereas NPR-C is non-guanylyl cyclase receptor and is coupled to adenylyl cyclase inhibition or phospholipase C activation through inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gi). ANP, BNP, CNP. as well as C-ANP(4) (23). a ring deleted peptide that specifically interacts with NPR-C receptor inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity through Gi protein. Unlike other G-protein-coupled receptors. NPR-C receptors have a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain of 37 amino acids, which has a structural specificity like those of other single transmembrane domain receptors. A 37 amino acid cytoplasmic peptide is sufficient to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity with art apparent Ki similar to that of ANP(99, 126) or C-ANP(4-23). In addition, C-ANP(4-23) also stimulates phosphatidyl inositol (PI) turnover in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) which is attenuated by dbcAMP and cAMP-stimulatory agonists, suggesting that NPR-C receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and resultant decreased levels of cAMP may be responsible for NPR-C-mediated stimulation of PI turnover. Furthermore, the activation of NPR-C receptor by C-ANP4-23 and CNP inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase activity stimulated by endothelin-3, platelet-derived growth factor, phorbol-12 myristate 13-acetate. suggesting that NPR-C receptor might also be coupled to other signal transduction system or that there may be an interaction of the NPR-C receptor and some other signaling pathways, In this review article. NPR-C receptor coupling to different signaling pathways and their regulation will be discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, ZG; Jen, CK; Yan, J; Chen, MY				Sun, ZG; Jen, CK; Yan, J; Chen, MY			Application of ultrasound and neural networks in the determination of filler dispersion during polymer extrusion processes	POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article							RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION; CARBON-BLACK; STATE	Mineral filler dispersion is important information for the production of mineral-charged polymers. In order to achieve timely control of product quality, a technique capable of providing real-time information on filler dispersion is highly desirable. In this work, ultrasound, temperature, and pressure sensors as well as an amperemeter of the extruder motor drive were used to monitor the extrusion of mineral-filled polymers under various experimental conditions in terms of filler type, filler concentration, feeding rate, screw rotation speed, and barrel temperature. Then, neural network relationships were established among the filler dispersion index and three categories of variables, namely, control variables of the extruder, extruder-dependent measured variables, and extruder-independent measured variables (based on ultrasonic measurement). Of the three categories of variables, the process control variables and extruder-independent ultrasonically measured variables performed best in inferring the dispersion index through a neural network model. While the neural network model based on control variables could help determine the optimal experimental conditions to achieve a dispersion index, the extruder-independent network model based on ultrasonic measurement is suitable for in-line measurement of the quality of dispersion. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using ultrasound and neural networks for in-line monitoring of dispersion during extrusion processes of mineral-charged polymers.

To study the effects of chronic administration of citalopram on serotonin (5-HT) synthesis rates. Serotonin synthesis was evaluated using the &alpha;[C-14]methyl-L-tryptophan (&alpha;-MTrp) autoradiographic method in OBX rats. Citalopram was administered continuously (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 14 days using a subcutaneous osmotic minipump. The OBX rats treated with citalopram (OBX-CTP) have the same 5-HT synthesis rates as the sham-operated rats treated with citalopram (Sham-CTP). The OBX-CTP rats, relative to the OBX rats treated with saline (OBX-SAL), showed a reduction in the majority of the terminal brain structures, suggesting a normalization of 5-HT synthesis in the OBX-CTP rats following treatment. The OBX-SAL rats have significantly greater synthesis than the Sham-SAL rats in a majority of the terminal structures, but lower rates in the dorsal raphe. A few structures in the OBX-CTP group have lower synthesis than in the Sham-SAL group (e.g., dorsal raphe, hippocampus, amygdala). The data suggest that receptors in some brain areas are likely still responsive to the elevated levels of the extracellular 5-HT produced by citalopram. There is no significant global or individual structure difference in the synthesis between the Sham-CTP and OBX-CTP groups. The similarity in the synthesis between the OBX-CTP, Sham-CTP and Sham-SAL groups is likely a result of changes in the sensitivity of the receptors through which 5-HT synthesis is controlled. Because of some of the differences in the synthesis between the Sham-CTP and Sham-SAL groups, the data suggest that receptors throughout the brain are not fully desensitized.

Despite convergence from multiple areas of research supporting the notion that multiple frontal-subcortical circuits regulate motor and limbic behavior, the precise relationship between motor abnormalities and psychopathology has not been elucidated. The goals of this study were to examine the prevalence of extrapyramidal signs (EPS) in first-episode schizophrenia patients and their relationships to three psychopathological dimensions (positive psychosis syndrome, negative syndrome, and disorganization). We assessed EPS using traditional observer-based as well as quantitative instrumental measures in 39 neuroleptic-naive first-episode schizophrenia subjects. Subjects were followed for 6 months after initiating antipsychotic treatment to examine the stability of motor-limbic relationships. Four main findings emerged from this study. First, depending on the measure used the prevalence of dyskinesia prior to treatment ranged from 13% to 20%. The prevalence of parkinsonism ranged from 18% to 28%. Second, severity of dyskinesia was associated with the positive psychotic syndrome; whereas parkinsonism was associated with the positive psychosis, negative syndrome and disorganization. Third, psychopathology improved significantly across all symptom dimensions following antipsychotic treatment, while EPS remained stable. This suggests that some motor abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect trait characteristics. Fourth, abnormalities on the pre-treatment instrumental measure of parkinsonism predicted greater improvement on positive psychosis symptoms following treatment (p=0.008). Our findings support the notion that neuromotor disturbances may be a core feature of schizophrenia in a substantial proportion of patients and implicate multiple fronto-striatal circuits regulating limbic and neuromotor behavior in schizophrenia.

In this study we report the isolation, expansion, and characterization of a similar precursor cell from neonatal human foreskin tissue. Like their rodent counterparts, human SKPs grew in suspension as spheres in the presence of the mitogens fibroblast growth factor 2 and epidermal growth factor and expressed nestin, fibronectin, vimentin, and characteristic embryonic transcription factors. Human SKPs could be maintained in culture for long periods of time and would still differentiate into neurons, glia., and smooth muscle cells, including cells with the phenotype of peripheral neurons and Schwann cells. Clonal analysis indicated that single SKP cells were multipotent and could give rise to all of these progeny. Moreover, human SKPs apparently derive from an endogenous precursor within human foreskin; a subpopulation of dissociated primary foreskin cells could differentiate into neurons, a cell type never seen in skin, and the initial spheres to develop from skin expressed the same markers and had the same potential as do passaged SKPs. Together, these data indicate that SKPs are an endogenous multipotent precursor cell present in human skin that can be isolated and expanded and differentiate into both neural and mesodermal cell types.

To perform a retrospective analysis of the long-term results of our experience with neuromodulation. Our center has been involved in the early studies leading to approval of the NeuroStim system of neuromodulation for the treatment of patients presenting with refractory lower urinary symptoms of urgency/frequency with or without incontinence and chronic urinary retention. Methods. A total of 52 patients have undergone implantation at our center since 1990 using very rigid criteria, including temporary percutaneous nerve evaluation for up to 7 days and a requirement of 50% improvement before consideration for implantation. Patients were followed up closely and a telephone questionnaire was conducted for those patients not seen in the previous 6 months. Of the 52 patients, 11 were not available for evaluation. Of the 41 remaining patients, 22 had urgency/frequency syndrome, 6 had urgency incontinence, 9 had urinary retention, and 4 had interstitial cystitis with intractable pelvic pain. Results. Of the 41 patients, 5 required explantation. These 5 patients were offered reimplantation but declined. Of the 22 patients in the urgency/frequency group, 10 (45%) had persistent improvement. In the urgency incontinence group, 3 of the 6 patients required explantation, and 1 (17%) reported improvement in the frequency of incontinence episodes. Of the 9 patients in the chronic urinary retention group, 7 (78%) had improvement. Conclusions. The long-term (up to 13 years) results of neuromodulation in patients presenting with urgency/ frequency with and without urge incontinence and urinary retention were reviewed. The long-term results in the first two groups were not maintained over time. The patients with chronic urinary retention, although a small sample, fared better.

We often ask whether there is a cause and effect in such interregional interactions. This paper proposes that we can infer causality in functional connectivity by employing a 'perturb and measure' approach. In the human brain, this has been achieved by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging or electroencephalography. Here, I will illustrate this approach by reviewing some of our TMS/PET work, and will conclude by discussing a few methodological and theoretical challenges facing those studying neural connectivity using a perturbation.

This alarming news and controversial declarations by scientific organizations and general media have made necessary a systematic evaluation of the epidemiologic evidence. Objective To examine the association between personal use of hair dyes and relative risk of cancer. Data Sources We retrieved studies published in any language by systematically searching the MEDLINE (1966-January 2005), EMBASE, LILACS, and ISI Proceedings computerized databases and by manually examining the references of the original articles, reviews, and monographs retrieved. Study Selection We included cohort and case-control studies reporting relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (or data to calculate them) of personal hair dye use and cancer. We excluded studies that dealt with occupational exposure. We carried out separate analyses for bladder, breast, and hematopoietic cancers and cancers of other sites. Seventy-nine studies were included of 210 articles identified in the search. Data Extraction Data were extracted independently by 2 investigators. We used a standardized questionnaire to record information on study design, sample size, type of controls, year of publication, adjustment factors, and relative risks of cancer among ever users of hair dyes. When possible, we extracted association measures on use of permanent dyes and extensive use (>200 lifetime episodes of dye use). Data Synthesis Study-specific relative risks were weighted by the inverse of their variance to obtain fixed- and random-effects pooled estimates. The pooled relative risk for ever users of hair dyes was 1.06 (95% Cl, 0.95-1.18) for breast cancer (14 studies), 1.01 (95% Cl, 0.89-1.14) for bladder cancer (10 studies), and 1.15 (95% Cl, 1.05-1.27) for hematopoietic cancers (40 studies). Other cancers were examined by only 1 or 2 studies, of which the pooled or single relative risk was elevated for brain cancer, ovarian cancer, and cancer of the salivary glands. No effect was observed for use of permanent dyes or for extensive use. Conclusions We did not find strong evidence of a marked increase in the risk of cancer among personal hair dye users. Some aspects related to hematopoietic cancer and other cancers that have shown evidence of increased risk in 1 or 2 studies should be investigated further.

The 1973 study of a French Canadian family led to the definition of HSAN2. Objectives: To demonstrate that the apparent higher prevalence of HSAN2 in Quebec is due to the presence of two HSN2 mutations and that carriers of different mutations appear to have a similar phenotype. Methods: Through attending physicians, the authors recruited French Canadian patients with HSAN2. Exclusion of linkage to the known HSAN loci and linkage to the HSAN2 was performed using standard methods. Sequencing of the HSN2 gene was used to uncover the causal mutations. Results: A large cluster of HSAN2 patients comprising 16 affected individuals belonging to 13 families was identified. The mode of inheritance is clearly autosomal recessive. All patients originated from southern Quebec, and 75% are from the Lanaudiere region. Whereas linkage to the HSAN1, 3, and 4 loci was excluded, linkage to the 12p13.33 HSAN2 locus was confirmed. Sequencing of the HSN2 gene uncovered two French Canadian mutations and a novel nonsense mutation in a patient of Lebanese origin, all predicted to lead to truncations of the HSN2 protein. The comparison of clinical variables between patients with different genotypes does not suggest any difference in phenotype. Conclusions: Two founder mutations are responsible for the apparently higher prevalence of HSAN2 in French Canadians. Genotype-phenotype correlation does not suggest any significant clinical variability.

The length of ChAT-immunostained axons was measured and the number of ChAT-immunostained varicosities counted, in each layer of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus, at postnatal ages P8, P16, and P32. At P8, an elaborate network of varicose ChAT-immunostained axons was already visible. At P16, the laminar distribution of this network resembled that in the adult, but adult densities were reached only by P32. Between P8 and P32, the mean densities for the three regions increased from 8.4 to 14 meters of axons and 2.3 to 5.7 million varicosities per cubic millimeter of tissue. At the three postnatal ages, the ultrastructural features of ChAT-immunostained axon varicosities from the strata pyramidale and radiatum of CA1 were similar between layers and comparable to those in adult, except for an increasing frequency of mitochondria (up to 41% at P32). The proportion of these profiles displaying a synaptic junction was equally low at all ages, indicating an average synaptic incidence of 7% for whole varicosities, as previously found in adult. The observed junctions were small, usually symmetrical, and made mostly with dendritic branches. These results demonstrate the precocious and rapid maturation of the hippocampal cholinergic innervation and reveal its largely asynaptic nature as soon as it is formed. They emphasize the remarkable growth capacities of individual ACh neurons and substantiate a role for diffuse transmission by ACh during hippocampal development. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Patients and Methods We performed a phase II study with patients stratified as follows: stratum 2 >= 25 % bone marrow blasts in first relapse; stratum 2 >= 25 % bone marrow blasts in ! second relapse; stratum 3: positive CSF; stratum 4: extramedullary (non-CNS) relapse. The initial nelarabine dose was 1.2 g/m(2) daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. There were two dose de-escalations due to neurotoxicity on this or other studies. The final dose was 650 mg/m(2)/d for strata 1 and two patients and 400 mg/m(2)/d for strata 3 and four patients. Results We enrolled 121 patients (106 assessable for response) at the final dose levels. Complete plus partial response rates at the final dose levels were: 55 % in stratum 1; 27 % in stratum 2; 33 % in stratum 3; and 14 % in stratum 4. There were 31 episodes of >= grade 3 neurologic adverse events in 27 patients (18 % of patients). Conclusion Nelarabine is active as a single agent in recurrent T-cell leukemia, with a response rate more than 50 % in first bone marrow relapse. The most significant adverse events associated with nelarabine administration are neurologic. Further studies are planned to determine whether the addition of nelarabine to front-line therapy for T-cell leukemia in children will improve survival.

We hypothesized that transplantation of umbilical-cord blood from unrelated donors before the development of symptoms would favorably alter the natural history of the disease among newborns in whom the disease was diagnosed because of a family history. We compared the outcomes among these newborns with the outcomes among infants who underwent transplantation after the development of symptoms and with the outcomes in an untreated cohort of affected children. METHODS: Eleven asymptomatic newborns (age range, 12 to 44 days) and 14 symptomatic infants (age range, 142 to 352 days) with infantile Krabbe's disease underwent transplantation of umbilical-cord blood from unrelated donors after myeloablative chemotherapy. Engraftment, survival, and neurodevelopmental function were evaluated longitudinally for four months to six years. RESULTS: The rates of donor-cell engraftment and survival were 100 percent and 100 percent, respectively, among the asymptomatic newborns (median follow-up, 3.0 years) and 100 percent and 43 percent, respectively, among the symptomatic infants (median follow-up, 3.4 years). Surviving patients showed durable engraftment of donor-derived hematopoietic cells with restoration of normal blood galactocerebrosidase levels. Infants who underwent transplantation before the development of symptoms showed progressive central myelination and continued gains in developmental skills, and most had age-appropriate cognitive function and receptive language skills, but a few had mild-to-moderate delays in expressive language and mild-to-severe delays in gross motor function. Children who underwent transplantation after the onset of symptoms had minimal neurologic improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of umbilical-cord blood from unrelated donors in newborns with infantile Krabbe's disease favorably altered the natural history of the disease. Transplantation in babies after symptoms had developed did not result in substantive neurologic improvement.

We hypothesized that the diaphragms of such patients might generate greater levels of oxidants than those neutralized by antioxidants. Objectives: To assess the levels of both oxidative and nitrosative stress and different antioxidants in the diaphragms of those patients, and to analyze potential relationships with lung and respiratory muscle dysfunctions. Methods and Measurements: We conducted a case-control study in which reactive carbonyl groups, hydroxynonenal-protein adducts, antioxidant enzyme levels, nitric oxide synthases, and 3-nitrotyrosine formation were detected using immunoblotting and immunhistochemistry in diaphragm specimens (thoracotomy) obtained from six patients with severe COPD, six patients with moderate COPD, and seven control subjects. Main Results: Diaphragms of patients with severe COPD showed both higher protein carbonyl groups and hydroxynonenalprotein adducts than control subjects. When only considering patients with COPD, negative correlations were found between carbonyl groups and airway obstruction, and between hydroxynonenal-protein adducts and respiratory muscle strength. Although diaphragmatic neuronal nitric oxide synthase did not differ among the three groups and no inducible nitric oxide synthase was detected in any muscle, muscle endothelial nitric oxide synthase was lower in patients with severe COPD than in control subjects. Muscle nitrotyrosine levels were similar in both patients with severe COPD and control subjects. Conclusions: This study shows that oxidative stress rather than nitric oxide is likely to be involved in the respiratory muscle dysfunction in severe COPD.

In vitro assays have previously demonstrated that these receptors are heterodimers assembled from two homologous subunits, GBR1 and GBR2, neither of which is capable of producing functional GBR on their own. We have used co-immunoprecipitation in combination with bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer approaches in living cells to assess directly the interaction between GBR subunits and determine their subcellular localization. The results show that, in addition to forming heterodimers, GBR1 and GBR2 can associate as stable homodimers. Confocal microscopy indicates that, while GBR1/GBR1 homodimers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, both GBR2/GBR2 homodimers and GBR1/GBR2 heterodimers are present at the plasma membrane. Although these observations shed new light on the assembly of GBR complexes, they raise questions about the potential functional roles of GBR1 and GBR2 homodimers.

With the advent of modern neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the potential for investigating neural mechanisms of speech motor control, speech motor disorders, and speech motor development has increased. However, a practical issue has limited the application of fMRI to issues in spoken language production and other related behaviors (singing, swallowing). Producing these behaviors during volume acquisition introduces motion-induced signal changes that confound the activation signals of interest. A number of approaches, ranging from signal processing to using silent or covert speech, have attempted to remove or prevent the effects of motion-induced artefact. However, these approaches are flawed for a variety of reasons. An alternative approach, that has only recently been applied to study single-word production, uses pauses in volume acquisition during the production of natural speech motion. Here we present some representative data illustrating the problems associated with motion artefacts and some qualitative results acquired from subjects producing short sentences and orofacial nonspeech movements in the scanner. Using pauses or silent intervals in volume acquisition and block designs, results from individual subjects result in robust activation without motion-induced signal artefact. This approach is an efficient method for studying the neural basis of spoken language production and the effects of speech and language disorders using fMRI. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In a previous study, the comparison of patients with high vs. low reality distortion using event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded in a recognition memory task for unfamiliar faces identified neural and cognitive anomalies specifically related to the expression of these symptoms. As a follow-up, this study investigated the ERP correlates of sensation seeking in schizophrenia using the same recognition memory protocol. ERPs have been recorded in controls (N=21) and schizophrenia patients separated into high (HSS; N=13) and low (LSS; N=17) scorers according to Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale. The results show a reduced P2a that was found unrelated to reality distortion in the previous study of reality distortion. It identifies interference inhibition impairment as being specifically related to sensation seeking. On the other hand, HSS scorers display enhanced fronto-central and normal P600 effects also found in high reality distortion patients. These results indicate inappropriate context processing and mnemonic binding common to sensation seeking and reality distortion. LSS scorers also display a reduced temporal N300 similar to that found in low reality distortion patients. This anomaly could reflect the lower reactivity to emotionally significant stimuli that underlies anhedonia symptoms. Finally, the N400 effect and a late frontal effect are found in both HSS and LSS. Since they were unrelated to reality distortion, these indices have been related to basic aspects of schizophrenia, e.g., deficient knowledge integration, or other mechanisms, e.g. anxiety or impulsivity. In summary, the present study examines the strategy of investigating variables, such as temperamental characteristics, in addition to symptoms, to show how discrete impairments may contribute to the expression of the illness.

Using 7- and 14-day-old (P7, P14) and adult conscious rats, we first established, using whole body plethysmography, the fentanyl dose that decreased minute ventilation by 50% (ED50) at each age. ED50 increased with postnatal age (40, 60 and 120 &mu; g/kg sc, respectively), indicating a high sensitivity to fentanyl in the youngest rats that decreased with maturation. In separate rat groups of the 3 ages, we injected each ED50 dose, once a day, for several consecutive days, until tolerance was established. Tolerance was defined as a reduction in respiratory depression from 50% to 75% of baseline. All age groups reached tolerance in minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, tidal volume and instantaneous flow (equivalent to respiratory drive). The P 14 rat pups attained tolerance more rapidly (at 2.6 days) than did either the younger (5.1 days) or the adult rats (4.4 days). These results indicate that respiratory sensitivity and tolerance to fentanyl in rat vary in a distinct manner during maturation. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the prostate carcinoma PC-3 cell model, the action of the gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) analog, bombesin (BN), on the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and invasiveness suggests that this kinase might favor metastasis. Given that components of the FAK signalling pathway are also Lip regulated in prostate cancer, the aim of the present investigation was to test if FAK function is required for BN-induced motility in PC-3 cells. In wound assays designed to investigate the fate of FAK in cells undergoing BN-induced motility, it was observed that BN treatment resulted in relocalization of FAK in focal contacts concomitantly with its tyrosine phosphorylation on residue 397 (FAK [pY(397)]) and with the formation of actin lamellipodia. Moreover, BN-induced cell motility was significantly reduced in the presence of FAK inhibitors (either anti-FAK [pY(397)] antibody or FRNK, the FAK-related non-kinase). Altogether, these observations point towards a critical role for FAK in the action of BN on PC-3 cell motility. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It comprises physiologically distinct cell types that process information in fundamentally different ways: tonic neurons fire repetitively during stimulation and display prolonged EPSPs, suggesting operation as integrators, whereas single- spike neurons act like coincidence detectors. Using whole- cell recordings from a rat spinal slice preparation, we set out to determine the basis for prolonged EPSPs in tonic cells and the implications for signal processing. Kinetics of synaptic currents could not explain differences in EPSP kinetics. Instead, tonic neurons were found to express a persistent sodium current, I-Na,I- P, that amplified and prolonged depolarization in response to brief stimulation. Tonic neurons also expressed a persistent calcium current, I-Ca,I-P, that contributed to prolongation but not to amplification. Simulations using NEURON software demonstrated that I-Na,I- P was necessary and sufficient to explain amplification, whereas I-Na,I-P and I-Ca,I-P acted synergistically to prolong depolarization: initial activation of the slower current ( I-Ca,I-P) depended on the faster current ( I-Na,I-P) but maintained activation of the faster current likewise depended on the slower current. Additional investigation revealed that I-Na,I-P and I-Ca,I-P could dramatically increase integration time ( > 30 x) and thereby encourage temporal summation but at the expense of spike time precision. Thus, by prolonging subthreshold depolarization, intrinsic inward currents allow tonic neurons in spinal lamina I to specialize as integrators that are optimally suited to encode stimulus intensity.

However, the extent to which genetic factors control homocysteine levels in healthy individuals is unclear. Laboratory mice are valuable models for dissecting the genetic and environmental controls of total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. We assessed the inheritance of tHcy levels in two inbred strains, A/J and C57BL/6J (B6), under controlled physiological conditions and assessed the relative importance of genetic, diet, gender, and parental effects. Diet affected mean tHcy levels, whereas gender affected both the mean and variance of tHcy levels. Moreover, gender of the parents influenced mean tHcy levels in reciprocal F1 hybrids, suggesting maternal effects. Finally, gene-diet interactions affected heritability of mean tHcy levels. These studies showed that each of these factors contributes to tHcy levels and provided important clues to understanding homocysteine homeostasis in humans.

To identify proteins that interact with dystroglycan in the brain we have used immunoaffinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) and found that the GTPase dynamin 1 is a novel dystroglycan-associated protein. The beta-dystroglycandynamin 1 complex also included alpha-dystroglycan and Grb2. Overlay assays indicated that dynamin interacts directly with dystroglycan, and immunodepletion showed that only a pool of dynamin is associated with dystroglycan. Dystroglycan was associated and colocalized immunohistochemically with dynamin 1 in the central nervous system in the outer plexiform layer of retina where photoreceptor terminals are found. Endocytosis in neurons is both constitutive, as in non-neural cells, and regulated by neural activity. To assess the function of dystroglycan in the former, we have assayed transferrin uptake in fibroblastic cells differentiated from embryonic stem cells null for both dystroglycan alleles. In wild-type cells, dystroglycan formed a complex with dynamin and codistributed with cortactin at membrane ruffles, which are organelles implicated in endocytosis. Dystroglycan-null cells had a significantly greater transferrin uptake, a process well known to require dynamin. Expression of dystroglycan in null cells by infection with an adenovirus containing dystroglycan reduced transferrin uptake to levels seen in wildtype embryonic stem cells. These data suggest that dystroglycan regulates endocytosis possibly as a result of its interaction with dynamin.

In the general context of perfusion pattern modeling from single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) data, the purpose of this study is to characterize interindividual functional variability and functional connectivity between anatomic structures in a set of SPECT data acquired from a homogeneous population of subjects. Materials and Methods. From volume of interest (VOI)-perfusion measurements performed on anatomically standardized SPECT data, we proposed to use correspondence analysis (CA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) to explore the structure of statistical dependencies among these measurements. The method was applied to study the perfusion pattern in two populations of subjects; namely, SPECT data from 27 healthy subjects and ictal SPECT data from 10 patients with mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Results. For healthy subjects, anatomic structures showing statistically dependent perfusion patterns were classified into four groups; namely, temporomesial structures, internal structures, posterior structures, and remaining cortex. For patients with MTLE, they were classified as temporomesial structures, surrounding temporal structures, internal structures, and remaining cortex. Anatomic structures of each group showed similar perfusion behavior so that they may be functionally connected and may belong to the same network. Our main result is that the temporal pole and lenticular nucleus seemed to be highly relevant to characterize ictal perfusion in patients with MTLE. This exploratory analysis suggests that a network involving temporal structures, lenticular nucleus, brainstem, and cerebellum seems to be involved during MTLE seizures. Conclusion. CA followed by HC is a promising approach to explore brain perfusion patterns from SPECT VOI measurements. &COPY; AUR, 2005.

Methods Thirty-three patients with congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association II or III symptoms, and left ventricular ejection fraction 25.5% +/- 7.2% treated with an ACE inhibitor and a p-blocker were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to receive irbesartan 150 mg per day (n = 22) or a placebo (n = 11) for 6 months. Maximal exercise capacity was assessed using a ramp protocol. Submaximal exercise duration was assessed using a constant load protocol, and plasma norepinephrine and angiotensin II (A-II) were measured in resting state, at 6 minutes, and at peak exercise. Results Patients treated with irbesartan presented a 26% increase in submaximal exercise time (+281 seconds, P = .018) whereas exercise duration increased by only 7% in patients treated with a placebo (+128 seconds, P = NS irbesartan vs placebo). Norepinephrine levels increased to a similar extent in both groups, whereas A-II levels did not increase or change in response to therapy. Conclusions Dual A-II suppression with an ACE inhibitor plus irbesartan provides a small but a significant increase in submaximal exercise capacity. This beneficial effect is observed despite no significant changes in maximal exercise capacity, and in resting or exercise-induced increase in neurohumoral activation.

In several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment, self-aggregates, and forms neurofibrillary tangles. A fragmentation of the neuronal Golgi apparatus (GA) was also observed in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we examined the effect of overexpressing; human tau on the organization of the neuronal GA in rat hippocampal cultures and in JNPL3 mice expressing tau mutant P301L. GA fragmentation was noted in a significantly higher percentage of hippocampal. neurons overexpressing wild-type human tau than in control neurons overexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone. Most importantly, in neurons overexpressing mutant forms of human tau (P301L, V337M, or R406W), the percentage of neurons with a fragmented GA was 10% higher than that of neurons overexpressing wild-type human tau. In JNPL3 mice, a significantly higher percentage of motor neurons presented a fragmented GA compared to control mice. interestingly, fragmentation of the GA was more frequent in neurons containing an accumulation and aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the cell body than in neurons without these features. in both primary hippocampal neurons and JNPL3 mice, the tau-induced GA fragmentation was not caused by apoptosis. The present results implicate tau in GA fragmentation and show that this event occurs before the formation of neurofibrillary tangles.

Eleven healthy individuals breathed through a circuit (18 cm H2O/L/second inspiratory resistance at 1 L/second flow; 0.5-1.0 L/second expiratory flow limitation) connected to a modified ventilator. Subjects breathed for 6-minute periods at rest and during 20 and 40 W of bicycle exercise, with and without target drive ventilation (the target was set to 60% of the increase in diaphragm electrical activity observed between rest and 20 W of unassisted exercise). With target drive ventilation during exercise, the level of pressure-support ventilation was automatically increased, reaching 13.3 +/- 4.0 and 20.3 +/- 2.8 cm H2O during 20- and 40-W exercise, respectively, whereas diaphragm electrical activity was reduced to a level within the target range. Both diaphragmatic pressure-time product and end-tidal CO2 were significantly reduced with target drive ventilation at the end of the 20- (p < 0.01) and 40-W (p < 0.001) exercise periods. Minute ventilation was not altered. These results demonstrate that target drive ventilation can automatically adjust pressure-support ventilation, maintaining a constant neural drive and compensating for changes in respiratory demand.

Levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau(231) vary across patients with Alzheimer disease. We hypothesized that these variations partially reflect differences in the degree of neuronal damage and therefore may be used to predict structural disease progression. Objective: To investigate whether CSF p-tau(231) levels correlate with rates of hippocampal atrophy as an in vivo marker of regional neuronal loss. Design and Patients: We measured hippocampal volumes on the basis of serial magnetic resonance image examinations in 22 patients with Alzheimer disease. In addition, we determined CSF p-tau(231) levels at baseline. Results: Levels of CSF p-tau(231) were significantly correlated with baseline hippocampal volumes (P<.001) and rates of hippocampal atrophy (left hippocampus, P<.001; right hippocampus, P=.02), independent of disease duration and severity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that variations in p-tau(231) levels may be used to predict progression of brain atrophy in patients with Alzheimer disease.

In order to establish whether sleep disorders truly belong to the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype, we conducted a subjective and objective study of sleep in a group of high-functioning adults with ASD but without sleep complaints, psychiatric disorders or neurological comorbidity. We compared the subjective data of 27 ASD participants with those of 78 healthy controls matched for chronological age and gender. Subjective measures of sleep in the clinical group were compatible with insomnia and/or a tolerable phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle. Subjective data were confirmed by objective laboratory sleep recordings in a subset of 16 patients and 16 controls. Persons with autism presented with a longer sleep latency (P < 0.04), more frequent nocturnal awakenings (P < 0.03), lower sleep efficiency (P < 0.03), increased duration of stage 1 sleep (P < 0.02), decreased non-REM sleep (stages 2 + 3 + 4, P < 0.04) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 + 4, P < 0.05), fewer stage 2 EEG sleep spindles (P < 0.004), and a lower number of rapid eye movements during REM sleep (P < 0.006) than did control participants. On clinical scales, the scores of persons with ASD on the Beck Depression Inventory were similar to those of persons without, but their trait anxiety scores on the Spielberger Anxiety Scale were higher (P < 0.02). The state anxiety scores of the Spielberger scale and cortisol levels were the same in the two groups. Objective total sleep time correlated negatively with the Social (-0.52, P < 0.05) and Communication (-0.54, P < 0.02) scales of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. The sleep of clinical subgroups (10 with high-functioning autism, six with Asperger syndrome) did not differ, except for the presence of fewer EEG sleep spindles in the Asperger syndrome subgroup (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these findings indicate that atypicalities of sleep constitute a salient feature of the adult ASD phenotype and this should be further investigated in younger patients. Moreover, the results are consistent with an atypical organization of neural networks subserving the macro- and microstructure of sleep in ASD. We are furthering this research with quantified analysis of sleep EEG.

Executive function in activities of daily living (ADL) were investigated in 10 patients with excised frontal lobe tumours. Method. The patients with frontal lesions were compared to 10 normal controls with a neuropsychological test battery, a script generation task and a realistic implementation of complex multi-task ADL (planning and preparing a meal). Results. The patients manifested numerous basic executive deficits on the paper-pencil tests, were unimpaired on the script generation task despite an aberrant semantic structure and manifested marked anomalies in the meal preparation task. Conclusion. Frontal lobe deficits in lengthy complex multi-task ADL can be explained by impairment of several executive functions, generalized slowness of performance and paucity of behaviour.

Material and methods: Three hundred and forty-eight TBI patients were assessed. The following data were collected for each patient: age, level of education, duration of post-traumatic amnesia, Galveston Orientation Amnesia Test score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, results of cerebral imaging, Neurobehavioral Rating Scale score, the Functional Independence Measure cognitive score and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score. Results: The clinical profile of the population revealed a mean age of 40.2 (18.7) and a mean of 11.5 (+/- 3.6) years of education. Most patients presented with frontal (57.6%) and temporal (40%) lesions. Sixty-two percent had post-traumatic amnesia of less than 24 hours. Seventy percent presented with mild TBI, 14% with moderate and 15% with severe TBI. The cognitive deficits most frequently observed on the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale were in the areas of attention, memory and mental flexibility as well as slowness and mental fatigability. Most patients had good cognitive outcome on the Functional Independence Measure and scores of 2 and 3 were frequent on the GOS. Forty-five percent of the patients returned home after discharge, 51.7% were referred to in or out patient rehabilitation and 3.2% were transferred to long-term care facilities. Conclusion: Because of the specialized mandate of acute care institutions, the information provided here concerning characteristics of our TBI population is essential for more efficient decision-making and planning/programming with regards to care and service delivery.

Methods: We reviewed 987 charts of pediatric patients with a presumptive diagnosis of NF-1 who were evaluated at Ste-Justine hospital from January 1, 1991 to July 31, 2002. Patients who presented with two or more cardinal criteria were diagnosed with NF-1. Clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively collected, including: demographics, neuroimaging and presence or absence of associated symptoms or signs of NF-1. Results: A total of 279 patients were diagnosed with NF-1. The mean age at diagnosis was 3.4 years. Ninety-nine percent of the patients had cafe an lait spots and 47% had a first degree relative with NF-1. Almost 60 percent (59.6%) of those seen by an ophthalmologist had Lisch nodules. Optic glioma was found in in 14.7%, cutaneous neurofibromas in 38.4%, plexiform neurofibromas in 24.7%, neurofibrosarcoma in 1.8%, learning disabilities in 39%, attention deficit disorder in 40.5%, osseous dysplasias in 7.2%, pseudoarthrosis in 3.6%, precocious puberty in 3.2% and short stature in 17.9%. Magnetic resonance, when performed, showed hyperintense T2 lesions in 87.1% of cases. The mean period of follow-up was 7.4 years. Conclusion: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a multisystemic disorder associated with increased risk of malignancy. It can be diagnosed at a very young age and clinical follow-up is advised. To our knowledge, this is the largest single center study of NF-1 in a pediatric population.

Most reported data of chemo radiotherapy protocols for the treatment of medulloblastoma describe children who were treated in the first decade of life. To consider the feasibility of this approach in adolescents, the authors studied their clinical course with specific emphasis on toxicity, tolerability, and prognosis. METHODS. in this retrospective study, the authors examined the toxicity profiles and outcomes of children age 10-20 years with medulloblastoma who were treated at centers throughout Canada between 1986 and 2003. Detailed toxicity data from 2 chemotherapy protocols were collected for teenagers and were compared with data from a group of control patients age 5-10 years. RESULTS. In total, 72 teenagers were analyzed. Grade : 2 ototoxicity and neurotoxicity occurred in 45% and 71% of chemotherapy-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3-4 hematotoxicty occurred in 95% of patients. Toxicity resulted in delay of treatment for 73% of patients and dose modification in 75% of patients, including protocol discontinuation in 25% of patients. Weight loss > 10% was encountered in 73% of patients and required intervention in 45% of patients. Teenagers had significantly more hematotoxicity and neurotoxicity compared with controls on both chemotherapeutic protocols. Ototoxicity was similar in both age groups. Toxicity resulted in significantly more treatment delays and dose modifications in teenager patients compared with controls. The 5-year overall and event-free survival rates (+/- standard deviation) were 78% +/- 6% and 70% +/- 6%, respectively. The mean time (+/- standard deviation) to disease recurrence was 3.2 +/- 2.2 years. CONCLUSIONS. The increased toxicity rate and high incidence of treatment modifications in this study suggested that current pediatric protocols may require modifications for teenagers with medulloblastoma. The results highlighted several issues that should be addressed in future prospective trials. (c) 2005 American Cancer Society.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideally suited to probe fine structures in mice. This technology is three-dimensional, non-destructive and rapid compared to histopathology; hence MRI scientists have been able to create detailed three-dimensional images of 60 mu m resolution or better. The data is digital which lends itself to sophisticated image processing algorithms. Here we show a variational MRI atlas constructed from nine excised brains of 8 week old 129S1/SvImJ male mice. This new type of atlas is comprised of an unbiased average brain - created from alignment of the individual brains - and the mathematical descriptors of anatomical variation across the individuals. We found that the majority of internal points in the individuals never varied more than 117 mu m from equivalent points in the atlas. A three-dimensional annotation of the average image was performed and used to estimate the mean and standard deviation of volumes in a variety of structures across the individual brains; these volumes never differed by more than 5%. Our results indicate that variational atlases of inbred strains represent a well-defined basis against which mutant outliers can be readily compared.

The clinical use of atypical neuroleptics (ie, dual serotonin-dopamine antagonists) to treat both conditions sheds a new light on them. We report the first two cases of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) induced by quetiapine in schizophrenia patients. A case of successful augmentation by quetiapine in refractory OCD is also presented. A review of the literature on OCS induced by atypical neuroleptics follows. This paradoxically induced OCD symptomology in schizophrenia patients administered atypical neuroleptics is discussed from pew pathophysiological and clinical perspectives. The discussion emphasizes the prognostic implications of OCS in schizophrenia and available therapies for this comorbidity.

This study investigated the clinical usefulness of a new visual rating scale, the Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS), in detecting cognitive dysfunction. Methods: Forty clinically definite MS patients underwent a brain MRI. Based on the CHIPS, cholinergic pathway hyperintensities were rated in 10 regions on four axial slices. Computerized hyperintenselesion volumes were also obtained. For cognitive testing, The Neuropsychological Screening Battery for Multiple Sclerosis was used. "Low" and "High" lesion score groups were computed based on the mean of the total CHIPS score. Optimal sensitivity and specificity of the total CHIPS score in detecting cognitive impairment were determined using a receiver operator characteristic curve. Results: Despite a similar demographic profile, subjects with a "High" lesion score performed significantly worse than the "Low" lesion score group on verbal (P = .007) and visuospatial (P = .02) memory, and on a global index of cognitive functioning (P = .001). Optimal sensitivity (82%) and specificity (83%) were reached with a threshold total CHIPS score of 18 points. Total CHIPS score and total hyperintense lesion load were correlated (sigma = 0.82, P < .0001). Conclusion: CHIPS is helpful in clinically predicting cognitive impairment in MS.

Participants' sensitivity to emotional expressions was comprehensively assessed in tasks of discrimination, identification, and rating of five basic emotions: happiness, (pleasant) surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness. Subjects also discriminated and identified faces according to underlying phonemic ("facial speech") cues and completed a neuropsychological test battery. Results uncovered limited evidence that the processing of emotional faces differed between the two groups in our various conditions, adding to recent arguments that these skills are frequently intact in non-demented adults with PD [R. Adolphs, R. Schul, D. Tranel, Intact recognition of facial emotion in Parkinson's disease, Neuropsychology 12 (1998) 253-258]. Patients could also accurately interpret facial speech cues and discriminate the identity of unfamiliar faces in a normal manner. There were some indications that basal ganglia pathology in PD contributed to selective difficulties recognizing facial expressions of disgust, consistent with a growing literature on this topic. Collectively, findings argue that abnormalities for face processing are not a consistent or generalized feature of medicated adults with mild-moderate PD, prompting discussion of issues that may be contributing to heterogeneity within this literature. Our results imply a more limited role for the basal ganglia in the processing of emotion from static faces relative to speech prosody, for which the same PD patients exhibited pronounced deficits in a parallel set of tasks [M.D. Pell, C. Leonard, Processing emotional tone from speech in Parkinson's disease: a role for the basal ganglia, Cogn. Affect. Behav. Neurosci. 3 (2003) 275-288]. These diverging patterns allow for the possibility that basal ganglia mechanisms are more engaged by temporally-encoded social information derived from cue sequences over time. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Ammotic membrane transplantation (AMT) was performed in 33 eyes from 32 patients for corneal ulcers refractive to conventional treatment. Fourteen ulcers were perforated and received fibrin glue and amniotic membrane. Ulcers were divided into 3 groups: neurotrophic or exposure, autoimmune, and other etiology. Results: Overall success was observed in 80% (27/33 eyes) of the cases, with success rates of 87.5% (14/16 eyes), 70% (7/10 eyes), 85.7% (6/7 eyes) in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The ulcers healed in a mean time of 3.6 +/- 1.6 weeks and the follow-up was 14.8 +/- 9.9 months. Failure was noted in 6 eyes with severe neurotrophic keratitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and Acanthamoeba keratitis. Grafts with fibrin sealant showed a success rate of 92.9% (13/14 eyes) compared to 73.7% (14/19 eyes) for amniotic grafts alone. In patients with severe limbal damage, a success rate of only 20% (115) was observed. Conclusions: AMT is a viable option in the treatment of nonhealing corneal ulcers of various depth and etiologies. Perforations up to 3 mm can be safely managed by fibrin glue and AMT. These techniques lead to rapid reconstruction of the corneal surface and can give a good final functional result or allow keratoplasty to be done in more favorable conditions.

Complete TWO knockdown resulted in defects in heart formation, including hypoplasia of the outflow tract and right ventricle, which derive from the anterior heart field (AHF), and decreased expression of Nkx2-5 and Mef2c, transcription factors required for AHF formation. A mild knockdown led to persistent truncus arteriosus (unseptated outflow tract) and hypoplastic right ventricle, entities similar to human congenital heart defects, and demonstrated a critical requirement for Tbx20 in valve formation. Finally, an intermediate knockdown revealed a role for TWO in motoneuron development, specifically in the regulation of the transcription factors Isl2 and Hb9, which are important for terminal differentiation of motoneurons. Tbx20 could activate promoters/enhancers of several genes in cultured cells, including the Mef2c AHF enhancer and the Nkx2-5 cardiac enhancer. The Mef2c AHF enhancer relies on Isl1- and Gata-binding sites. We identified a similar Isl1 binding site in the Nkx2-5 AHF enhancer, which in transgenic mouse embryos was essential for activity in a large part of the heart, including the outflow tract. Tbx20 synergized with Isl1 and Gata4 to activate both the Mef2c and Nkx2-5 enhancers, thus providing a unifying mechanism for gene activation by Tbx20 in the AHF. We conclude that Tbx20 is positioned at a critical node in transcription factor networks required for heart and motoneuron development where it dose-dependently regulates gene expression.

Moreover, certain women appear to be vulnerable to a depressive episode after a reproductive event characterized by a drastic decrease in estrogen levels such as occurs during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, during the postpartum period, and during perimenopause. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is currently the treatment of choice for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Studies that have tested the efficacy of estrogen treatment of postpartum affective disorders are mostly uncontrolled, and there is currently insufficient evidence for its efficacy. Although several randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of estrogen for the treatment of perimenopausal women with mild to moderate depression have found it to be significantly more effective than placebo, only the mood symptoms and not the entire depressive syndrome were alleviated by estrogen in those studies. Therefore, at the present time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend estrogen as a first-line treatment of reproduction-related affective disorders. The idea that estrogen may be useful as adjunctive treatment to an antidepressant for peri- and postmenopausal women who respond only partially to the antidepressant alone is promising but requires further study.

A recent study on environmental Mn exposure showed an Mn x age interaction for several neurobehavioral functions. The objective of the present study was to examine the neurobehavioral test results in relation to age and Mn exposure, using an existing data set on 74 workers from an Mn alloy production plant and referents pair-matched for age (&PLUSMN; 3 years), educational level (&PLUSMN; 2 years), number of children, and smoking status. The pair differences between Mn-exposed workers and referents increased significantly with age for scores on Delayed Word Recall, Trail Making B, Cancellation H, Nine-Hole Hand Steadiness Test, and Vibratometer. These results suggest that for certain neurobehavioral functions, and in particular for information processing, Mn-related deficits increase with age. This outcome could not be explained by higher cumulative Mn exposure. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BPP patients are therefore often labeled as severely retarded, but a detailed neuropsychological profile has not been reported to date. In a series of 14 patients, we demonstrated that only a minority had extremely low intelligence, and that some aspects of cognitive function correlated with the extent of the cortical disorganization. Early age at seizure onset correlated positively with Performance IQ scores (P < 0.05) and negatively with the extent of the lesion (P < 0.01), reflecting that patients with more severe BPP are more likely to have early seizure onset, resulting in greater interference with ongoing cognitive development. Receptive and expressive language skills were found to be equally poor. Frontal lobe function and memory abilities were relatively well preserved, suggesting that the observed cognitive profiles were related, at least in part, to specific areas of cortical dysfunction and not only to global dysfunction.

Phenytoin block is enhanced at depolarized membrane potentials and during high frequency channel activation. These properties, which are important for the clinical efficacy of the drug, depend on voltage-dependent channel gating. In this study, we examined the action of phenytoin on sodium channels, comprising a mutant auxiliary RI subunit (mutation C121W beta 1), which causes the inherited epilepsy syndrome, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Whole cell sodium currents in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells coexpressing human Na-v 1.3 sodium channels and C121 W beta 1 exhibited altered gating properties, compared to currents in cells coexpressing Na-v 1.3 and wild type beta 1. In addition mutant channels were less sensitive to inhibition by phenytoin, showing reduced tonic block at -70 mV (EC50 = 26 mu M for C121W beta 1 versus 11 mu M for wild type beta 1) and less frequency-dependent inhibition in response to a 20 Hz pulse train (similar to 40% inhibition for C121W beta 1 versus similar to 70% inhibition for wild type beta 1, with 50 mu M phenytoin). Mutant and wild type channels did not differ in inactivated state affinity for phenytoin, suggesting that their pharmacological differences were secondary to their differences in voltage-dependent gating, rather than being caused by direct effects of the mutation on the drug receptor. Together, these data show that a sodium channel mutation responsible for epilepsy can also alter channel response to antiepileptic drugs. (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We used a bilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the mental nerve (MN), a branch of the trigeminal nerve. In this model, we also studied the accompanying changes in peptidergic [calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive] sensory fibres, as well as in trkA receptor immunoreactivity in the sensory nerves. Autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) fibre sprouting was first observed 1 week post-injury with a peak in the number of sprouted fibres occurring at 4 and 6 weeks post-CCI. CGRP-IR fibres almost disappeared at 2 weeks post-CCI, but quickly sprouted, leading to a significant peak above sham levels 4 weeks post-injury. trkA receptor expression was found to be up-regulated in small cutaneous nerves 4 weeks post-CCI, returning to sham levels by 8 weeks post-CCI. There was no sympathetic fibre sprouting in the trigeminal ganglion following CCI. At 4 weeks post-CCI, rats displayed spontaneous, directed grooming to the area innervated by the MN that was not seen in sham animals, which we interpreted as a sign of spontaneous pain or dysesthesiae. Collectively, our findings indicate that as a result of autonomic sprouting due to CCI of the MN, remaining intact nociceptive fibres may potentially develop sensitivity to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation, which may have a role in the generation of abnormal pain following nerve injury.

In the present study in rats, we tested whether they express c-Fos differently after total sleep deprivation (SD) vs. sleep recovery (SR). Whereas c-Fos expression was increased in Orx neurons after SD, it was increased in MCH neurons after SR. We reasoned that Orx and MCH neurons could be differently modulated by noradrenaline (NA) and accordingly bear different adrenergic receptors (ARs). Of all Orx neurons (estimated at approximate to 6700), substantial numbers were immunostained for the alpha(1A)-AR, including cells expressing c-Fos after SD. Yet, substantial numbers were also immunostained for the alpha(2A)-AR, also including cells expressing c-Fos after SD. Of all MCH neurons (estimated at approximate to 12 300), rare neurons were immunostained for the alpha(1A)-AR, whereas significant numbers were immunostained for the alpha(2A)-AR, including cells expressing c-Fos after SR. We conclude that Orx neurons may act to sustain waking during sleep deprivation, whereas MCH neurons may act to promote sleep following sustained waking. Some Orx neurons would participate in the maintenance of waking during deprivation when excited by NA through alpha(1)-ARs, whereas MCH neurons would participate in sleep recovery after deprivation when released from inhibition by NA through alpha(2)-ARs. On the other hand, under certain conditions, Orx neurons may also be submitted to an inhibitory influence by NA through alpha(2)-ARs.

Cortical cell populations were labelled immunohistochemically using a glucose oxidase-diaminobenzidine-nickel combined revelation method. Quantitative analysis revealed significant differences between V1 and A1 in the density and distribution of their neuronal population. CBir cells exhibited several typologies in both cortical regions. Most cells were multipolar even though many of them had bitufted or bipolar morphologies. These cells were distributed in layers II/III and in layer V of both A1 and V1, but were more numerous in layer V of V1. CRir cells were of the fusiform type with long bipolar dendritic arbours. These were similarly distributed in both cortices with a peak in superficial layers II/III. PVir cells were also found in both cortices and had round or oval-shaped somata with multipolar processes. They were mostly located in layer V for V1 and in layers III/IV for A1. Visual and auditory primary cortices can thus be differentiated on the basis of their immunoreactivity to specific calcium binding proteins.

Most of these changes have been documented following endurance exercise training programmes. In this study, the effect of rat soleus muscle overload produced by tenotomy plus voluntary wheel-cage activity on neuromuscular transmission efficacy was investigated. The overload protocol increased miniature endplate potential (MEPP) and endplate potential (EPP) amplitudes by 17 and 19%, respectively (both P < 0.01), and increased MEPP frequency by 86% (P < 0.01). EPP amplitude rundown during continuous trains of activation was attenuated by similar to 10% in the overloaded group (P < 0.01). Also, during intermittent activation, the overload protocol attenuated EPP amplitude rundown, mainly by enhancing EPP amplitude recovery by similar to 10% during the quiescent periods (P < 0.01). Although the present results show that both the degree and direction of adaptation are similar to what has been observed at rat soleus neuromuscular junctions following an endurance training protocol, there are important nuances between the results, suggesting different mechanisms through which these changes may occur.

Such shifts of attention can be generated at will (endogenously) or be triggered automatically, i.e., generated in response to exogenous stimuli including socially relevant cues such as someone else's gaze. What are the common and distinct brain mechanisms involved in these processes? To address this question, we carried out a quantitative effect-location meta-analysis of 59 brain-imaging experiments whose results were published using standardized coordinates. For each condition of interest, namely voluntary and visually triggered eye movements, voluntary and visually triggered (covert) shifts of attention, and perception of someone else's gaze, we computed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) maps. Those maps represent at each voxel of the brain the probability of reporting a signal change related to the condition of interest. For eye movements, this analysis confirmed the spatial location of the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, and parietal saccade-related regions. The map of covert shifts of attention demonstrated highest similarity with the map of saccadic eve movements. Gaze perception showed common activation likelihood with the other conditions in the right intraparietal sulcus and in the lateral precentral gyrus. It demonstrated more similarity with the reflexive than with the voluntary saccades and shifts of attention. We propose that a core network of frontoparietal and temporal brain regions is recruited when we shift the focus of our attention with or without eye movements in response to the appearance of a visual target, as well as when we see someone else shift his or her gaze.

To classify and detect single as well as multiple faults, measurements were made of supply air temperature, OA-damper position, supply fan pressure, indoor temperature and airflow rate in a variable air volume heating ventilating and air conditioning test facility. Experimental results show that three types of patterns emerge in the analysis of multi-fault problems. To solve the multi-fault problem, a new strategy based on pattern classification and the use of residual ratios is presented. It is shown that the residual ratio can be used to diagnose and accurately identify and detect multiple-faults occurring in HVAC systems. Copyright &COPY; 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, the mechanisms that underlie the targeting and regulation of NHE7 are unknown. To gain insight into these processes, yeast two-hybrid methodology was used to screen a human brain cDNA library for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic C-terminus of NHE7. One binding partner we identified was SCAMP2, a member of the secretory carrier membrane protein (SCAMP) gene family. Direct association of these two proteins was further supported by co-immunolocalization and co-immunoprecipitation analyses using transfected cells, by their co-sedimentation in membrane fractions resolved on sucrose density gradients, and by in vitro protein binding assays. Other members of the SCAMP family, such as SCAMP1 and SCAMP5, also associated with NHE7. The majority of the NHE7-SCAMP complexes accumulated at the TGN, but a minor fraction also resided in recycling vesicles. Biochemical analyses indicated that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of NHE7 bound preferentially to a highly conserved cytoplasmic loop between the second and the third transmembrane segments (TM2-TM3 loop) of SCAMP2. A deletion mutant of SCAMP2 lacking this region (SCAMP2/Delta 184-208) bound weakly to NHE7, but caused a significant fraction of NHE7 and wild-type SCAMP2 to redistribute to a pool of scattered recycling vesicles without noticeably affecting the location of other resident TGN (syntaxin 6) or Golgi cisternae (GM130) proteins. Conversely, a GFP-tagged TM2-TM3 construct of SCAMP2 interacted with NHE7, but also led to the redistribution of NHE7 to dispersed vesicular structures. We propose a model wherein SCAMPs participate in the shuttling of NHE7 between recycling vesicles and the TGN.

Time- and temperature-dependent internalization of stimulated GH RH-R was blocked by phenyl arsi ne oxide (PAO) in both cell types. In anterior pituitary and rGHRH-R-transfected BHK cells, only filipin III and cerulenin blocked receptor-mediated internalization of Fluo-GHRH while in hGHRH-R-tmnsfected BHK cells, only hyperosmolar sucrose inhibited this process. These results suggest that hGHRH-R internalization is clathrin-dependent, while fatty acid acylation of rGHRH-R appears to be a prerequisite to caveolin-clependent internalization. Experiments in anterior pituitary using Bodipy-FL-C5 ganglioside GM1, a specific marker of lipid rafts such as caveolae, confirmed this latter pathway. Colocalization of Fluo-GHRH with LysoTracker indicated that Fluo-GHRH was directed to acidic organelles in both cell types. Finally, studies using cycloheximide and monensin showed that upon stimulation with GHRH, an optimal concentration of functional GHRH-Rwas maintained at the plasma membrane due to de novo synthesis and recycling in pituitary cells and to de novo synthesis solely in hGHRH-R-transfected BHK cells. This first study on the dynamics of the GHRH/GHRH-R complexes using fluorescence imaging in a native environment compared to cell system models, revealed that both receptor primary structure and concentration at the plasma membrane play important roles in internalization and trafficking of specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR).

SMI-32 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a non-phosphorylated epitope on the medium- and high-molecular weight subunits of neurofilament proteins. As in carnivores and primates, SMI-32 immunoreactivity in the hamster neocortex was present in cell bodies, proximal dendrites and axons of some medium and large pyramidal neurons located in cortical layers III, V and VI. A small population of labeled multipolar cells was also found in layer IV. Neurofilament protein immunoreactive neurons were found throughout isocortical areas. Very few labeled cells were encountered in supplemental motor area, insular cortex, medial portion of associative visual cortex and in parietal association cortex. Our data indicate that SMI-32 immunoreactive cells can be efficiently used to trace boundaries between neocortical areas in the hamster's brain. The regional distribution SMI-32 immunoreactivity in the hamster cortex corresponds quite closely with cortical areas as defined by their cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture. The primary sensory cortical areas contain the most intense of SMI-32 immunoreactivity and are also those with the highest density of myelinated axons. Very low SMI-32 immunoreactivity was found in orbital, insular, perirhinal, cingulate and infralimbic cortices, which are also poor in myelinated axons. This supports the association between SMI-32 immunoreactivity and myelin contents. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Melquiond, A; Boucher, G; Mousseau, N; Derreumaux, P				Melquiond, A; Boucher, G; Mousseau, N; Derreumaux, P			Following the aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides by computer simulations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article								There is experimental evidence suggesting that the toxicity of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease may result from the soluble intermediate oligomers. It is therefore important to characterize extensively the early steps of oligomer formation at atomic level. As these structures are metastable and short lived, experimental data are difficult to obtain and they must be complemented with numerical simulations. In this work, we use the activation-relaxation technique coupled with a coarse-grained energy model to study in detail the mechanisms of aggregation of four lys-phe-phe-glu (KFFE) peptides. This is the shortest peptide known to form amyloid fibrils in vitro. Our simulations indicate that four KFFE peptides adopt a variety of oligomeric states (tetramers, trimers, and dimers) with various orientations of the chains in rapid equilibrium. This conformational distribution is consistent with all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent and is sequence dependent; as seen experimentally, the lys-pro-gly-glu (KPGE) peptides adopt disordered structures in solution. Our unbiased simulations also indicate that the assembly process is much more complex than previously thought and point to intermediate structures which likely are kinetic traps for longer chains.

A frequent characteristic of the phenotype is adverse reactions to, and/or fascination with, certain sounds. Previously published reports indicate that people with WS experience hyperacusis, yet careful examination reveals that the term 'hyperacusis' has been used indiscriminately in the literature to describe quite different auditory abnormalities. Method: In an effort to clarify and document the incidence of auditory abnormalities in and among people with WS we collected data from parents of people with WS (n = 118) and comparison groups of people with Down syndrome, autism, and normal controls. Results: Our findings revealed four phenomenologically separate auditory abnormalities, all of which were significantly more prevalent in WS than the three comparison groups. Among people with WS, we found relatively few reports of true hyperacusis (lowered threshold for soft sounds) or auditory fascinations/fixations, whereas 80% reported fearfulness to idiosyncratically particular sounds, and 91% reported lowered uncomfortable loudness levels, or 'odynacusis.' Conclusions: Our results confirm anecdotal reports of an unusual auditory phenotype in WS, and provide an important foundation for understanding the nature of auditory experience and pathology in WS. We conclude by reviewing the ways in which the present findings extend and complement recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological findings on auditory function in people with WS.

In the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri, an octocorallian representative of the most basal animals with a nervous system, we investigated the role of NO in peristalsis, an activity that moves body fluids through the coelenteron (gastrovascular cavity) of the polyps across the colony. NO donors increased the amplitude of peristaltic contractions and increased tonic contractions in relaxed preparations, but caused a relaxation of basal tension in contracted preparations. The NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors L-NAME (N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) and 7-nitroindazole reduced the amplitude of peristaltic contractions and lowered basal tension. In contrast, aminoguanidine, a specific inhibitor of inducible NOS, increased the amplitude but reduced the rate of peristalsis. Zaprinast, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, decreased the amplitude of peristaltic contractions, a decrease that was amplified by dibutyryl cGMP. In contrast, the inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase ODQ (1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one) enhanced peristalsis. Putative NOS-containing neurons, revealed by NADPH-diaphorase activity and citrulline immunohistochemistry, were observed in the basiectoderm at the base of the autozooid polyp tentacles and in a nerve-net around the oral disc. Their neurites ran up the tentacles and down to the polyp body wall, crossing from the ectoderm through the mesoglea and into the endoderm musculature where musculo-epithelial cells were also reactive. These data suggest that two distinct nitrergic pathways, one of which is mediated by cGMP, regulate peristalsis and muscle tone in the sea pansy and that these pathways may involve NOS-containing ectodermal neurons and musculoepithelial cells.

Acute liver failure in experimental animals results in alterations in the expression of genes coding for astrocytic proteins including the "peripheral-type" (astrocytic) benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR), a mitochondrial complex associated with neurosteroid synthesis. To gain further insight into the mechanisms whereby hypothermia attenuates the neurological complications of acute liver failure, we investigated PTBR expression in the brains of hepatic devascularized rats under normothermic (37&DEG; C) and hypothermic (35&DEG; C) conditions. Methods: PTBR mRNA was measured using semi-quantitative RT-PCR in cerebral cortical extracts and densities of PTBR sites were measured by quantitative receptor autoradiagraphy. Brain pregnenolone content was measured by radioimmunoassay. Results: At coma stages of encephalopathy, animals with acute liver failure manifested a significant increase of PTBR mRNA levels. Brain pregnenolone content and [H-3]PK 11195 binding site densities were concomitantly increased. Mild hypothermia prevented brain edema and significantly attenuated the increased receptor expression and pregnenolone content. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an attenuation of PTBR up-regulation resulting in the prevention of increased brain neurosteroid content represents one of the mechanisms by which mild hypothermia exerts its protective effects in ALF. &COPY; 2005 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The different forms of polymicrogyria encompass a wide range of clinical, aetiological, and histological findings. Advances in imaging have improved the diagnosis and classification of the condition. The molecular basis of polymicrogyria is beginning to be elucidated with the identification of a gene, GPR56, for bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria. Functional studies of the GPR56 gene product will yield insights not only into the causes of polymicrogyria but also into the mechanisms of normal cortical development and the regional patterning of the cerebral cortex. Based on imaging studies, several other region specific patterns of polymicrogyria have been identified, and there is increasing evidence that these may also have a significant genetic component to their aetiology. This paper reviews current knowledge of the different polymicrogyria syndromes, with discussion of clinical and imaging features, patterns of inheritance, currently mapped loci, candidate genes, chromosomal abnormalities, and implications for genetic counselling.

Inflammatory responses in injured nerves are likely to be key contributing factors in the generation and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is up-regulated in invading macrophages and has been implicated in the development of neuropathic pain. We previously demonstrated that invading macrophages up-regulate cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) receptors EP1 and EP4, suggesting that PGE(2) may affect macrophage function via autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. This study was undertaken to determine whether PGE(2) is involved in the up-regulation of IL-6 in invading macrophages. Two weeks following partial sciatic nerve ligation, numerous IL-6 immunoreactive (IR) cell profiles were present in injured nerves. Colocalization of IL-6 with the invading macrophage marker ED1 or with COX2 was frequently observed. IL-6-IR, COX2-IR and ED1-IR cells were present only in cultures derived from injured nerve segments. PGE(2) and IL-6 release from cultured cells derived from injured nerves was increased significantly compared with uninjured nerves. Non-selective and selective COX2 inhibitors suppressed PGE(2) and IL-6 release. Treatment with PGE(2) further enhanced IL-6 release in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. A selective EP4 receptor antagonist L-161982 was able to suppress IL-6 release, whereas an EP1 receptor antagonist, SC19220, was ineffective. Moreover, a protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, dramatically suppressed IL-6 release, whereas a protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 and a Ca2+ chelator EGTA failed. Taken together, our data suggest that PGE(2) is involved in mediating the up-regulation of IL-6 occurring in invading macrophages. This action is mediated through an EP4 receptor and the protein kinase C signaling pathway.

The orbital rim component extends just laterally from the supraorbital foramen/notch to the frontozygomatic suture. This craniotomy obviates the need for removing the zygoma and has evolved from the authors' experience in more than 200 patients with a variety of pathological lesions, both vascular and tumorous. The osteoplastic aspect of this technique was initially evaluated in 14 cadaveric sites in seven heads dissected prior to implementing this procedure clinically. The osteoplastic bone flap minimally obstructs the surgical view and provides all the advantages of a standard OZ craniotomy. Temporalis muscle atrophy leading to temporal hollowing is avoided, a bone union to the calvaria is improved, and the possibility of bone infection is decreased. The osteoplastic component of the technique adds to the improved long-term cosmesis and warrants active consideration in the art of neurosurgery.

Approximately 15% of women have chronic dyspareunia that is poorly understood, infrequently cured, often highly problematic, and distressing. Chronic dyspareunia is an urgent health issue. Aim. To provide recommendations/guidelines concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the assessment and management of women's sexual pain disorders. Methods. An international consultation, in collaboration with the major sexual medicine associations, assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. One six-member committee focused on women's sexual pain disorders, developing recommendations over a 2-year period. Main Outcome Measure. Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. Results. There is increasing evidence for the role of neuropathic pain mechanisms in the pathophysiology of sexual pain disorders. Empirical literature has demonstrated the comorbid presence of clinical psychopathology. With regard to the pathophysiologic role of the pelvic floor and sexual pain disorders, studies reveal that (i) differentiation between vaginismus and dyspareunia using clinical tools is difficult; (ii) vaginal spasms have not been identified; (iii) physical therapists can differentiate vaginismic women from matched controls based on muscle tone/strength differences; (iv) the traditional treatment of vaginismus with vaginal "dilatation" plus psycho-education, desensitization, and so forth is not evidence-based; (v) pelvic floor muscle tone/strength measures for women suffering from vulvar vestibulitis syndrome are intermediate between those of women with vaginismus and no-pain controls; and (vi) the pelvic floor musculature is indirectly innervated by the limbic system and highly reactive to emotional stimuli and states. Pelvic floor therapies for dyspareunia may be effective. Conclusion. Recommendations include (i) revising the definitions of vaginismus and dyspareunia; (ii) integration of treatment approaches; (iii) validation of nonspecific treatment effects; (iv) controlled studies to test interventions; and (v) sexuality education to help prevent sexual pain.

TC have been studied in animal models of chemical or surgically induced pancreatic damage but their occurrence has not been reported in rodent models of spontaneous autoimmune type I diabetes. We hypothesized that TC would be increased during the active phase of islet destruction in autoimmune diabetes and could contain islet progenitor cells. We analyzed TC in pancreas of Wistar Furth (WF), control (BBc) and diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats using immunohistochemistry and morphometry. TC were observed in all rat strains during active pancreas remodeling (similar to 13 days). They increased between 60 and 93 days only in BBdp rats coincident with the increase in diabetes cases. Most TC were infiltrated with CD3(+) T-cells. Duct-like cells in the TC had low expression of the exocrine marker amylase, increased expression of epithelial cell markers, keratin and vimentin, and remarkably high cell proliferation and cell death. TC islets contained cells stained positive for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, as well as PDX-1, chromogranin, and hepatocyte-derived growth factor receptor, c-met. Transitional cells that were keratin(+)/insulin(+) and keratin(+)/amylase(+) cells were present in TC. The stem cell marker, nestin was upregulated in the TC region. Duct-like cells in TC of BBdp rats expressed markers of committed endocrine precursors: PDX-1, neurogenin 3 and protein gene product 9.5. This study demonstrates that TC are upregulated during beta-cell destruction and contain potential endocrine progenitors.

In this study we assessed the complications following an iSAH and analyzed them in relation to the perimesencephalic or diffuse distribution of the hemorrhage. Method. - Retrospective study of 1,148 consecutive patients evaluated between January 1990 and April 2001 for iSAH documented by cerebral CT-scan with normal cerebral angiographic work-up. Results. - Of the eighty-seven patients (7.6%) presenting with iSAH, 52 presented with a perimesencephalic distribution, and 35 with a diffuse distribution. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two distributions with regards to complications following the hemorrhage, such as hydrocephalus, neurological deficits due to vasospasm, systemic effects and mortality. Fisher grade III was associated with an increased risk of complications. Conclusion. - Perimesencephalic iSAH is not exempt from complications. Morbidity and mortality in this group are comparable to those observed in diffuse iSAH. The Fisher grade is a predicting factor of complications for any given hemorrhage distribution.

Manual segmentation protocols have established a volume decline in the HC in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. Furthermore, recent studies have investigated age-related changes of HC volume which show an interaction with,,ender: in earl, adulthood, volume reduction of the HC is found in men but not in women. In this paper, we investigated gender differences in normal subjects in young adulthood by employing a shape analysis of the HC using medial surfaces. For each subject, the most prominent medial manifold of the HC was extracted and flattened. The flattened sheets were then registered using both a rigid and a non-rigid alignment technique, and the medial surface radius was expressed as a height function over them. This allowed for an investigation of the association between subject variables and the local width of the HC. With regard to the effects of age and gender, it could be shown that the previously observed gender differences were mostly due to volume loss in males in the lateral areas of the HC head and tail. We suggest that the analysis of HC shape using medial surfaces might thus serve as a complimentary technique to investigate group differences to the established segmentation protocols for volume quantification in MRI. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Gaussian kernel smoothing, which weights neighboring observations according to their 3D Euclidean distance, has been widely used in 3D brain images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. When the observations fie on a convoluted brain surface, however-, it is more natural to assign the weights based on the geodesic distance along the surface. We therefore develop a framework for geodesic distance-based kernel smoothing and statistical analysis on the cortical manifolds. As an illustration, we apply our methods in detecting the regions of abnormal cortical thickness in 16 high functioning autistic children via random field based multiple comparison correction that utilizes the new smoothing technique. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Cholinergic projections from mesopontine nuclei preferentially synapse onto these GABAergic neurones, thus suggesting that ACh can regulate dopamine neurones indirectly by modulating GABAergic interneurones. Muscarinic receptors mediate excitation of these interneurones through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. Using a mesencephalic primary culture model, we show here that muscarine (10 mu M) increases intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+](i)) in GABAergic interneurones. Compatible with previous anatomical data, our pharmacological studies further suggest that the M3 receptor is the primary mediator of this increase. The rise in [Ca2+]i induced by muscarine was not activity-dependent but required influx of Ca (2+) from the extracellular medium. Consistent with the known coupling of the M3 receptor to PKC, the effect of muscarine was blocked by bisindolylmaleimide, a selective PKC antagonist. The effect of muscarine was inhibited by SKF 96365 and verapamil, drugs known to block non-selective cationic channels such as those formed by transient receptor potential (TRPC) proteins. Finally, GABAergic neurones were found to be immunopositive for TRPC1, 3, 5 and 6. Taken together, these results suggest that the Ca (2+)-dependent regulation of mesencephalic GABAergic neurones by muscarinic receptors requires activation of some receptor-operated Ca (2+) channels through a PKC-dependent mechanism.

Such findings could reflect persistent sequelae due to BN, or a vulnerability 'trait' that exists independently of active eating-disorder manifestations, We compared women with full-blown BN (BN; n = 22), BN in remission (BN-R; n = 11), and no eating or psychiatric disturbances (n=22) on measures of platelet [H-3]paroxetine binding, eating symptoms and psychopathology, The BN-R group showed normal-range scores on eating and psychopathological symptoms, but reductions in density (B-max) of binding sites for paroxetine similar to those obtained in the actively ill women. Both BN groups had substantially lower B-max than did healthy controls. Our results corroborate other findings indicating recovered BN patients to have anomalous 5-HT functioning. While such effects could represent a lasting 'injury' to the system, reported covariations between personality traits and 5-HT indices in BN encourage us to favor the argument that some alterations of 5-HT activity (in this case, consistent with reduced transporter activity) represent a 'trait' associated with the risk of developing BN and/or associated psychopathology.

Recent evidence points to the importance of the sensory component in VVS, particularly the heightened processing of tactile and pain sensation in the vulvar vestibule. The goal of the present study was to examine the neural basis of heightened sensitivity to touch (i.e. allodynia) in women with VVS. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared regions of neural activity in 14 women with VVS and 14 age- and contraceptive-matched control women in response to the application of mild and moderate pressure to the posterior portion of the vulvar vestibule. Intensity and unpleasantness ratings were recorded after each scan; these ratings were significantly higher for women with VVS than controls. All women with VVS described moderate pressure as painful and unpleasant, and 6 of the 14 women with VVS described mild pressure as painful and unpleasant. In contrast, none of the stimuli was painful for control women. Correspondingly, women with VVS showed more significant activations during pressure levels that they found to be either painful or non-painful than did controls during comparable pressure levels. During pressure described as painful by women with VVS, they had significantly higher activation levels in the insular and frontal cortical regions than did control women. These results suggest that women with VVS exhibit an augmentation of genital sensory processing, which is similar to that observed for a variety of syndromes causing hypersensitivity, including fibromyalgia, idiopathic back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and neuropathic pain. &COPY; 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

The parameter E-2 is used to characterize the rate at which stimulus dimensions (e.g., size or contrast) must increase in order to achieve foveal levels of performance. We calculated both size and contrast E-2 values for orientation discrimination using a spatial scaling procedure that involves measuring combination size and contrast thresholds for stimuli with constant size-to-contrast ratios. E-2 values for size scaling were 5.77 degrees and 5.92 degrees. These values are three to four times larger than those recovered previously using similar stimuli at contrasts well above detection threshold (Sally & Gurnsey, 2003). E-2 values for contrast scaling were 324.2 degrees and 44.3 degrees, indicating that for large stimuli little contrast scaling (.3% to 2.3% increase) was required in order to equate performance in the fovea and the largest eccentricity (100). A similar pattern of results was found using a spatial scaling method that involves measuring contrast thresholds for target identification as a function of size across eccentricities. We conclude that the size scaling for orientation discrimination at near-threshold stimulus contrasts is much larger than that required at suprathreshold contrasts. This may arise, at least in part, from contrast-dependent changes in mechanisms that subserve task performance.

Here, the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphan (DEX) was tested over a range of doses (10-200 mu g intracerebroventricularly [i.c.v.]) in male and female Swiss Webster mice in combination with 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) morphine. Males exhibited enhanced morphine analgesia following either 100 or 200 mu g DEX, but there was no evidence of DEX-mediated potentiation in females at any dose. Instead, DEX attenuated morphine analgesia in females. We also evaluated the effect of 100 mu g i.c.v. DEX with different doses of morphine (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg). Again, DEX significantly enhanced morphine analgesia in male mice and attenuated it in females. Next, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice were compared to males following 5 mg/kg i.p. morphine and 100 mu g i.c.v. DEX. Male and OVX females exhibited equivalent maximal levels of analgesia following administration of DEX. Morphine analgesia was not enhanced by DEX in sham-treated females and OVX mice with estradiol treatment (5 mu g i.p. once daily for 7 days) also did not show DEX enhancement. These experiments demonstrate that the ability of NMDA receptor antagonists to potentiate morphine analgesia is modulated by an estrogen-sensitive mechanism and suggest that sex differences may play a critical role toward a more general understanding of the potentiation of opioid-induced analgesia through NMDA receptor antagonists.

J	McCall, S; Lowe, EJ				McCall, S; Lowe, EJ			Indeterminist free will	PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article								The aim of the paper is to prove the consistency of libertarianism. We examine the example of Jane, who deliberates at length over whether to vacation in Colorado (C) or Hawaii (H), weighing the costs and benefits, consulting travel brochures, etc. Underlying phenomenological deliberation is an indeterministic neural process in which nonactual motor neural states n(C) and n(H) corresponding to alternatives C and H remain physically possible up until the moment of decision. The neurophysiological probabilities pr(n(C)) and pr(n(H)) evolve continuously according to the different weights Jane's judgement attaches to C and H at different times during the deliberation. The overall process is indeterministic, since Jane's exact judgemental weighting would vary slightly were the process to be repeated from the same initial conditions. The weighting is however rational, and entirely under Jane's control. This controlled, rational, indeterministic process shows that libertarianism is a consistent philosophical thesis.

Ischemic retinopathy remains a common cause of visual impairment and blindness in the industrialized world due to relatively ineffective treatment. Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is an established model of retinopathy of prematurity associated with vascular cell injury culminating in microvascular degeneration, which precedes an abnormal neovascularization. The retina is a tissue particularly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the ischemic retina becomes highly sensitive to lipid peroxidation initiated by oxygenated free radicals. Consequently, the retina constitutes an excellent model for testing the functional consequences of membrane lipid peroxidation. Retinal tissue responds to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli by the activation of phospholipases and the consequent release from membrane phospholipids of biologically active metabolites. Activation of phospholipase A(2) is the first step in the synthesis of two important classes of lipid second messengers, the eicosanoids and a membrane-derived phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF). These lipid mediators accumulate in the retina in response to injury and a physiologic role of these metabolites in retinal vasculature remains for the most part to be determined; albeit proposed roles have been suggested for some. The eicosanoids, in particular the prostanoids, thromboxane (TXA(2)) and PAF are abundantly generated following an oxidant stress and contribute to neurovascular injury. TXA(2) and PAF play an important role in the retinal microvacular degeneration of OIR by directly inducing endothelial cell death and potentially could contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathies. Despite these advances there are still a number of important questions that remain to be answered before we can confidently target pathological signals. This review focuses on mechanisms that precede the development of neovascularization, most notably regarding the role of lipid mediators that partake in microvascular degeneration. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Byrne, N; Ditto, B				Byrne, N; Ditto, B			Alexithymia, cardiovascular reactivity, and symptom reporting during blood donation	PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE			English	Article						alexithymia; symptom reporting; cardiovascular reactivity; blood donation; vasovagal reaction; pain	PSYCHIATRIC OUTPATIENTS; PANIC DISORDER; SCALE; NEUROTICISM; PREVALENCE; PATHWAYS; VALIDITY; NERVOSA; STRESS	Objective: With blood donation serving as a naturalistic stressor and a controlled medical event, the aim of this study was to examine emotional and cardiovascular reactivity, self-report of vasovagal symptoms, and perceived pain as a function of scores on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Method: Healthy young adult blood donors (N = 610) recruited at mobile blood collection clinics completed the TAS-20, pre- and postdonation measures of anxiety, postdonation measures of pain and vasovagal symptoms, and had their blood pressure and heart rate measured before and after giving blood. Results: Alexithymia score was positively associated with reported anxiety, pain, and vasovagal symptoms. Higher alexithymia was also associated with greater increases in predonation systolic blood pressure in anticipation of blood donation. In general, women and less experienced blood donors reported more vasovagal symptoms than men and more experienced donors, and this corresponded to higher rates of treatment by the nurses, more fainting, and fewer full units of blood obtained. However, despite more reports of vasovagal symptoms by alexithymic donors, alexithymia score was not related to these variables. Conclusions: The results suggest that individuals with higher alexithymia scores were more anxious in the blood donation setting and more prone to report physical symptoms in the absence of a clear difference in the medical outcome of the blood donation procedure.

To identify the conditions under which recognition memory is significantly impaired, we used a meta-analytic strategy to quantify the moderating effects of several cognitive and clinical variables. Eighty-four studies (from 1965 to July 2003) provided recognition memory data for both a schizophrenia and control group. The overall group comparison for recognition memory yielded a significant mean weighted effect size of d=0.76. Material specificity was the most significant cognitive variable found, with patients exhibiting greater impairment for figural than verbal recognition. A yes-no recognition format and auditory encoding also led to significantly greater effect sizes for recognition memory relative to forced-choice recognition tests and visual encoding, respectively. Furthermore, the effect size for recognition memory as measured by false alarm was smaller than the effect size as measured by hit rate or by d-prime and its related measures. Among clinical variables that were associated with higher effect sizes, chronicity was the most significant, but different trends linking poor performance to negative symptoms and general symptomatology were also observed. Thus, a recognition memory deficit moderated by both cognitive and clinical variables is clearly present in schizophrenia. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kingdom, FAA; Rangwala, S; Hammamji, K				Kingdom, FAA; Rangwala, S; Hammamji, K			Chromatic properties of the colour-shading effect	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						colour; depth; shape-from-shading	CONE CONTRAST SPACE; DETECTION MECHANISMS; NATURAL IMAGES; HUMAN VISION; RED-GREEN; PERCEPTION; LUMINANCE; SHAPE; PHOTOPIGMENTS; ADAPTATION	The 'colour-shading effect' describes the phenomenon whereby chromatic variations affect the magnitude of perceived shape-from-shading in luminance patterns. A previous study showed that in mixed colour-plus-luminance sine-wave plaids, impressions of depth in the luminance component were enhanced by non-aligned chromatic components, and suppressed by aligned chromatic components [Nature Neuroscience 6 (2003) 641-644]. Here we examine the chromatic determinants of these effects. Colour contrast was defined along the cardinal axes of colour space in order to isolate the L-M and S-(L + M) post-receptoral chromatic mechanisms. We found no difference in the potency of L-M-only and S-(L + M)-only gratings, either for enhancing or suppressing perceived depth. Moreover, the magnitude of depth-suppression was no different for any combination of depth-enhancing and depth-suppressing cardinal directions. Finally we tested whether the visual system carried the assumption that natural shading is tinged with blue, by measuring perceived depth in a colour-plus-luminance grating that was made to appear either bright-yellow/ dark-blue or bright-blue/dark-yellow. However there was no difference in the magnitude of depth-suppression between conditions, suggesting that the visual system does not make any assumption about the colour of natural shading. Taken together, the results suggest that while the colour-shading effect is highly sensitive to colour contrast, it is agnostic with respect to colour direction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
