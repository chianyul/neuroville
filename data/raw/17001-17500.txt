We applied this time-honored approach in early vision to the higher-level brain processes underlying face categorizations. Electroencephalograms in response to face-information samples were recorded while observers resolved two different categorizations (gender, expressive or not). Using a method with low bias and low variance, we compared, in a common space of information states, the information determining behavior (accuracy and reaction time) with the information that modulates emergent brain signals associated with early face encoding and later category decision. Our results provide a time line for face processing in which selective attention to diagnostic information for categorizing stimuli (the eyes and their second-order relationships in gender categorization; the mouth in expressive-or-not categorization) correlates with late electrophysiological (P300) activity, whereas early face-sensitive occipito-temporal (N170) activity is mainly driven by the contralateral eye, irrespective of the categorization task.

Nicotine-deprived smokers were scanned twice on separate days. In one condition, participants smoked their usual brand of cigarettes while in the scanner and in the other condition they remained nicotine abstinent. On each day, subjects monitored the hedonic properties of their experience as well as their levels of craving. Initial analyses revealed no significant differences between the conditions in [C-11]raclopride binding potential (BP) in the caudate, putamen, or ventral striatum. Because previous research suggested that drug-induced dopamine transmission is related to levels of craving and/or hedonic drug effects, the relationship between these variables and [C-11]raclopride BP was examined. Craving levels were reduced by smoking but were not systematically related to BP change. However, the hedonic response to smoking was correlated with BP reduction in the caudate (P < 0.001) and posterior putamen (P < 0.05) but not in the ventral striatum. Post hoc analyses revealed that only five of the ten smokers reported mood-elevating effects in response to the smoking procedure. In these subjects, smoking was associated with decreased [C-11]raclopride BP in the caudate. On the other hand, among subjects that reported a diminished mood response to smoking there was an increase in BP in the caudate and putamen. These results suggest that pleasurable drug experiences are associated with increased dopamine transmission in the dorsal striatum while unpleasant experiences may be related to decreased dopamine release in this region.

Combined genetic and biochemical analyses have pointed to signaling pathways where Stbm (Vang12) proteins might act, and have identified several interacting proteins that form a crucial multi-protein signaling complex at the membrane. These studies show that these proteins have a pivotal role in a signaling cascade(s) that has been highly conserved in evolution. This review will summarize recent findings documenting the involvement of Stbm (Vang12) and associated proteins in planar cell polarity, non-canonical Wnt signaling and convergent extension movements.

Recordings were obtained in traumatic brain-injured (TBI) subjects and in normal controls. We analyzed both the low-level VEPs (llVEPs) evoked by homogenous stimuli, as well as the components associated with texture segregation (tsVEP) obtained through an appropriate linear combination. Our results suggest that the tsVEP, presumably higher tip in the visual processing chain than the llVEP, is sensitive to TBI and can reveal further information as to the nature of possible information processing deficits after TBI. It could also help quantify cortical damage that is not revealed with more standard clinical tools. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Beuter, A; Lambert, G; MacGibbon, B				Beuter, A; Lambert, G; MacGibbon, B			Quantifying postural tremor in workers exposed to low levels of manganese	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						manganese exposure; Parkinson's disease; postural tremor; neurotoxicity; discriminant analysis	DOMAIN CHARACTERISTICS; PARKINSONIAN TREMORS; NEUROTOXICITY; DYSFUNCTION; SYSTEMS	The aim of this study was: (1) To determine the minimum number of characteristics necessary to discriminate between postural tremor recorded in control subjects (CO), in subjects exposed to manganese (MN), and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and (2) to examine the continuum of changes between the three groups examined. Workers previously exposed to Mn (n = 10), patients with PD (n = 10), and control subjects (CO) (n = 11) underwent a clinical examination. Blood Mn was measured at the end of exposure time for the MN group and 12 months later at the beginning of the experiment for all groups. Postural tremor with visual feedback was recorded in the index finger with a laser system. Statistical criteria were used to reduce computed tremor characteristics to a minimal set of reliable discriminating variables. Two variables were retained namely corrected wobble (CW), describing the morphology of the tremor oscillations, and variability ratio (VR), describing proportional power of tremor. Both variables had an overall correct classification rate of 77.4%. Blood Mn levels at the time of the experiment were similar for all groups and had insignificant correlation with tremor variables. However, blood Mn levels in workers which were also measured at the end of exposure time (i.e., 12 months before) showed significant correlation (Spearman's rank coefficient) with both harmonic index (p = 0.70, P = 0.03) and first maximum of the autocorrelation function (p = 0.89, P = 0.001). We conclude that (1) the tremor of workers exposed to Mn could be adequately described with only two variables; (2) a continuum of changes between tremor recorded in control subjects, in subjects exposed to Mn and in patients with PD was observed, with the MN group always found in between the control (CO) and the PD groups; (3) while blood Mn levels in workers were back at control levels at the time of the experiment, the effect of Mn on postural tremor was still detected. Thus our method has the potential to detect the effect of Mn on tremor with only two variables even after Mn level in the blood is back to normal values. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, whether this organizational deficit is generalizable to other areas of cognitive functioning has not been established. In the present study, we assessed whether adults with OCD are less likely to spontaneously generate organizational strategies during performance of an executive function test, the Self-Ordered Pointing Task (SOPT). Participants included 30 adults with OCD and 24 healthy controls. Groups did not differ with respect to the time to complete or number of errors made on the SOPT. Furthermore, group differences were not observed in the ability to generate organizational strategies or in the specific types of strategies employed to complete the SOPT. These findings indicate that a reduced use of organizational strategies in OCD is not present across all cognitive domains. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A possible peripherin involvement in ALS pathogenesis has been suggested based on studies with transgenic mouse overexpressors and with a toxic splicing variant of the mouse peripherin gene. However, the existence of peripherin gene mutations in human ALS has not yet been documented. Therefore, we screened for sequence variants of the peripherin gene (PRPH) in a cohort of ALS patients including familial and sporadic cases. We identified 18 polymorphic variants of PRPH detected in both ALS and age-matched control populations. Two additional PRPH variants were discovered in ALS cases but not in 380 control individuals. One variant consisted of a nucleotide insertion in intron 8 (PRPHIVS8-36insA), whereas the other one consisted of a 1-bp deletion within exon 1 (PRPH228delC), predicting a truncated peripherin species of 85 amino acids. Remarkably, expression of this frameshift peripherin mutant in SW13 cells resulted in disruption of neurofilament network assembly. These results suggest that PRPH mutations may be responsible for a small percentage of ALS, cases and they provide further support of the view that neurofilament disorganization may contribute to pathogenesis.

In culture, adult neurons were resistant to stimuli that caused apoptosis of their neonatal counterparts. In both adult and neonatal neurons, death stimuli induced the apoptotic c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway, but JNK activation only caused death of neonatal neurons, indicating that adult neurons have a downstream block to apoptosis. Expression of the dominant-inhibitory p53 family member, DeltaNp73, rescued JNK-induced apoptosis of neonatal neurons, suggesting that it might participate in the downstream apoptotic block in adult neurons. To test this possibility, we examined adult DRG neurons cultured from p73+/- mice. Adult p73+/- DRG neurons were more vulnerable to apoptotic stimuli than their p73+/+ counterparts, and invulnerability could be restored to the p73+/- neurons by increased expression of DeltaNp73. Moreover, although DRG neuron development was normal in p73+/- animals in vivo, axotomy caused death of adult p73+/- but not p73+/+ DRG neurons. Thus, one way adult neurons become invulnerable is to enhance endogenous survival pathways, and one critical component of these survival pathways is p73.

In the first experiment, rats were tested on a spatial-visual conditional associative task in which they had to learn to approach one of two stimuli depending on the spatial context in which the stimuli were embedded. The rats were subsequently trained on delayed forced alternation, a spatial working memory task known to be sensitive to the effects of ATNxH damage. Rats with ATNxH lesions were impaired in the acquisition of both tasks in comparison with normal control animals. The findings support the idea that the anterior thalamic nuclei and the hippocampus are critical components of an anatomical system subserving spatial memory and suggest that these brain regions work in a dependent fashion during the performance of certain spatial learning tasks.

By comparison to age-matched non-transgenic controls, 2-year-old female APP23 transgenic mice crossed more segments in the open-field and had a higher number of fast ambulatory and stereotyped movements in a photocell activity chamber. In addition, APP23 mice entered more often and spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. The acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze was impaired in APP23 transgenic mice, but not in probe and visible platform subtasks. These results indicate that hyperactivity and impaired learning abilities characterize this mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral angiopathy. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Similarly, neural activation is present during action observation in many of the same brain regions normally used for performance, including premotor cortex(6-9). Here we present behavioural evidence that monkeys also engage in mental rehearsal during the observation of sensory events associated with a well-learned motor task. Furthermore, most task-related neurons in dorsal premotor cortex exhibit the same activity patterns during observation as during performance, even during an instructed-delay period before any actual observed motion.

One interpretation of these findings is that the memory reconsolidates after use. Two alternative interpretations are that protein synthesis inhibition facilitates extinction and that postreactivation protein synthesis inhibition leads to an inability to retrieve the consolidated memory. First, using two different approaches, we report that reconsolidation cannot be reduced down to facilitated extinction. We show that the reconsolidation deficit does not show renewal after a contextual shift, whereas an extinguished auditory fear memory does under the same conditions and the deficit occurs regardless of whether the memory is reactivated with an extinction [conditioned stimulus ( CS) alone] or a reinforced trial (CS-unconditioned stimulus). To address the issue of whether postreactivation anisomycin leads to an inability to retrieve the consolidated memory, we used two traditional assays for retrieval deficits. First, we demonstrate that the amnesia induced by blockade of reconsolidation does not show any spontaneous recovery. Second, we show that application of reminder shock does not result in the reinstatement of the memory. These findings support the idea that reactivation of consolidated memories initiates a second time-dependent memory formation process.

Loss of function and haploinsufficiency have been the suggested mechanisms in mutants for which functional analysis has been reported. This paper describes a kinetic analysis of mutant T345A, recently identified in a detailed genetic analysis of a large Finnish family (Kaunisto, M. A., Harno, H., Vanmolkot, K. R., Gargus, J. J., Sun, G., Hamalainen, E., Liukkonen, E., Kallela, M., van den Maagdenberg, A. M., Frants, R. R., Farkkila, M., Palotie, A., and Wessman, M. ( 2004) Neurogenetics 5, 141 146). Introducing T345A into the conserved rat alpha2 enzyme does not alter cell growth or catalytic turnover but causes a substantial decrease in apparent K+ affinity (2-fold increase in K0.5(K+)). In view of the location of Thr-345 in the cytoplasmic stalk domain adjacent to transmembrane segment 4, the 2-fold increase in K0.5(K+) is probably due to T345A replacement altering K+ occlusion/deocclusion. Faster K+ deocclusion of the mutant via the E-2(K) + ATP --> E-1 . ATP + K+ partial reaction is evidenced in (i) a marked increase (300%) in K+ stimulation of Na-ATPase at micromolar ATP, (ii) a 4-fold decrease in K-ATP, and (iii) only a modest increase (similar to 3-fold) in I-50 for vanadate, which was used as a probe of the steady state E-1/E-2 conformational equilibrium. We suggest that the decreased apparent K+ affinity is the basis for a reduced rate of extracellular K+ removal, which delays the recovery phase of nerve impulse transmission in the central nervous system and, thereby, the clinical picture of migraine with aura. This is the first demonstration of a mutation that leads to a disease associated with a kinetically altered but fully functional Na, K-ATPase, refining the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in familial hemiplegic migraine.

Their physiological inhibitors are tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MPs are thought to be mediators of cellular infiltration in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We used real-time RT-PCR to profile the expression of all 22 known mouse MMPs, seven ADAMS, and all four known TIMPs in spinal cord from SJL/J mice and mice with adoptively transferred myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific EAE. A significant and >3-fold alteration in expression was observed for MMP-8, MMP-10, MMP-12, ADAM-12, and TIMP-1, which were up-regulated, and for MMP-15, which was down-regulated. Expression levels correlated with disease course, with all but ADAM-12 returning toward control levels in remission. To examine potential cellular sources of these strongly affected proteins in the inflamed CNS, we isolated macrophages, granulocytes, microglia, and T cells by cell sorting from the CNS of mice with EAE and analyzed their expression by real-time RT-PCR. This identified macrophages as a major source of MMP-12 and TIMP-1. Granulocytes were a major source of MMP-8. ADAM-12 was expressed primarily by T cells. Cellular localization of MMP-10, TIMP-1, and ADAM-12 in perivascular infiltrates was confirmed by immunostaining or in situ hybridization. Microglia from control mice expressed strong signal for MMP-15. Strikingly, the expression of MMP-15 by microglia was significantly down-regulated in EAE, which was confirmed by immunostaining. Our study identifies the cellular sources of key MPs in CNS inflammation.

By comparison to a non-transgenic group controlled for age and gender, 7-month-old APPswe + PS1/DeltaE9 mice spent more time in the open arms and had higher open/total entries and duration in the elevated plus-maze, indicative of disinhibitory tendencies. On the contrary, the groups did not differ in T-maze and open-field tests. Moreover, the motor coordination of the bigenic group was equivalent to that of controls in stationary beam, coat-hanger, rotorod, and grip strength tests. No mouse displayed neurological signs, such as pathological reflexes, myoclonus, or convulsions. The results in the elevated plus-maze test are akin to the loss of inhibitory control observed in some patients with Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The evoked firing of single interneurons in whole-cell recordings was sufficient to either dilate or constrict neighboring microvessels. Identification of vasomotor interneurons by single-cell RT-mPCR revealed expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP) or nitric oxide synthase ( NOS) in interneurons inducing dilatation and somatostatin (SOM) in those eliciting contraction. Constrictions appeared spatially restricted, maximal at the level of neurite apposition, and were associated with contraction of surrounding smooth muscle cells, providing the first evidence for neural regulation of vascular sphincters. Direct perfusion of VIP and NO donor onto the slices dilated microvessels, whereas neuropeptide Y (NPY) and SOM induced vasoconstriction. RT-PCR analyses revealed expression of specific subtypes of neuropeptide receptors in smooth muscle cells from intracortical microvessels, compatible with the vasomotor responses they elicited. By triple and quadruple immunofluorescence, the identified vasomotor interneurons established contacts with local microvessels and received, albeit to a different extent depending on interneuron subtypes, somatic and dendritic afferents from ACh and 5-HT pathways. Our results demonstrate the ability of specific subsets of cortical GABA interneurons to transmute neuronal signals into vascular responses and further suggest that they could act as local integrators of neurovascular coupling for subcortical vasoactive pathways.

In young rats ( 3 - 10 d of age), where GABA is excitatory, glycine (1 - 3 muM) and taurine (10 - 30 muM) increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs ( eIPSCs) and the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) but had minimal postsynaptic effects. Strychnine ( 1 muM) blocked the action of glycine; when applied alone, it reduced the amplitude of eIPSCs and the frequency of sIPSCs, indicating a tonic facilitation of GABAergic excitation by some endogenous glycine agonist(s). In medium containing no Ca2+, or with Cd2+ or tetrodotoxin added, the amplitude and especially the frequency of sIPSCs greatly diminished. In many cells, glycine had no effect on remaining miniature IPSCs, suggesting a preterminal site of glycine receptors (GlyRs). Fura-2 fluorescent imaging showed a glycine-induced increase of [Ca2+] in nerve terminals ( on DA neurons), which was suppressed by strychnine or 3 muM omega-conotoxin MVIIA. Therefore, the presynaptic GlyR-mediated facilitation of GABAergic transmission seems to be mediated by N- and/or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. In older rats (22 - 30 d of age), where GABA causes inhibition, the effect of strychnine on GABAergic IPSCs was reversed to facilitation, indicating a tonic glycinergic inhibition of GABA release. Furthermore, glycine (1 - 3 muM) reduced the amplitude of eIPSCs and the frequency of sIPSCs. Hence, the overall effect of the presynaptic action of glycine is to enhance the firing of DA cells, both in very young and older rats.

Here, we have asked whether DeltaNp73, which is the only p73 isoform expressed in sympathetic neurons, mediates this survival by p53- dependent and/ or p53-independent mechanisms. Initially, we used a genetic approach and crossed p53(+/-) and p73(+/-) mice. Quantitation of neurons in the sympathetic superior cervical ganglion during the period of naturally occurring cell death revealed that the loss of p53 partially rescued the death of neurons seen in p73(-/-) animals. Moreover, exogenous expression of DeltaNp73 in cultured p53(-/-) sympathetic neurons rescued these neurons from apoptosis after NGF withdrawal. Biochemical studies asking how DeltaNp73 inhibited NGF withdrawal-induced apoptosis in wild-type neurons demonstrated that it prevented the upregulation of the direct p53 targets p21 and Apaf-1 as well as cleavage of caspase-3. It also inhibited events at the mitochondrial apoptotic checkpoint, suppressing the induction of BimEL and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Interestingly, DeltaNp73 expression also inhibited one very early event in the apoptotic cascade, the activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), likely by binding directly to JNK. Finally, we show that neuronal cell size is decreased in p73(-/-) mice, and that this decrease is not rescued by the lack of p53, suggesting a role for p73 in regulating cell size that does not involve interactions with p53. Thus, DeltaNp73 promotes neuronal survival via p53- dependent and - independent mechanisms, and it does so at multiple points, including some of the most proximal events that occur after NGF withdrawal.

Substance P binding in the piglets' brainstem immediately after the last hypoxic episode was measured. All piglets hyperventilated during hypoxia. Weight adjusted inspired ventilation, tidal volume and instantaneous flow decreased with age. The oldest piglets uniquely displayed attenuated ventilation and tidal volume during the sixth versus first hypoxic episode with single intermittent hypoxia, and reduced inspired ventilation and tidal volume during the first hypoxic episode on the sixth daily hypoxia compared to single hypoxia. By contrast, substance P binding was greatly reduced in the solitary, hypoglossal, paraambigual and lateral reticular brainstem nuclei of both younger and older piglets following either single or recurrent intermittent hypoxia. Thus. the reduction in membrane-bound neurokinin receptors by intermittent hypoxia, presumably consequent to endogenously released substance P, does not exclusively determine whether the ventilatory response to that hypoxia will be attenuated or not.

Recent studies suggest that in addition to inducing transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, JNK also directly activates the cell death machinery. Here, we report that JNK catalyzed the phosphorylation of the BH3-only protein Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim(EL)) at serine 65, both in vitro and in vivo. The JNK-induced phosphorylation of Bim(EL) at serine 65 promoted the apoptotic effect of Bim(EL) in primary cerebellar granule neurons. We also characterized the role of the JNK-Bim(EL) signaling pathway in apoptosis that was triggered by overexpression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)). We found that activation of p75(NTR) induced the JNK-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous Bim(EL) at serine 65 in cells. The genetic knockdown of Bim(EL) by RNA interference or the expression of a dominant interfering form of Bim(EL) significantly impaired the ability of activated p75(NTR) to induce apoptosis. Together, these results suggest that JNK-induced phosphorylation of Bim(EL) at serine 65 mediates p75(NTR)-induced apoptosis. Our findings define a novel mechanism by which a death-receptor pathway directly activates the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery.

They have previously been shown to perform normally or even supra-normally in tasks involving spatial hearing in near space [1, 2], a region that, however, can be calibrated with sensory-motor feedback. Here we show that blind individuals not only properly map auditory space beyond their peri-personal environment but also demonstrate supra-normal performance when subtle acoustic cues for target location and distance must be used to carry out the task. Moreover, it is generally postulated that such abilities rest in part on cross-modal cortical reorganizations [3-6], particularly in the immature brain, where important synaptogenesis is still possible [7-9]. Nonetheless, we show for the first time that even late-onset blind subjects develop above-normal spatial abilities, suggesting that significant compensation can occur in the adult.

Method: Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the volumes of the prefrontal, premotor, sensorimotor, and occipitoparietal cortices as well as the caudate, thalamus, cerebellar vermis, and cerebrum in 20 first-episode psychosis patients and 18 healthy comparison subjects. Antisaccades were recorded by using infrared oculography. Results: Groups significantly differed in terms of antisaccade error rate and amplitude gain and tended to differ in terms of latency but not brain region volumes. Premotor cortex volume predicted antisaccade error rate among comparison subjects. In the patient group, caudate volume was related to latency and amplitude gain. Negative symptoms, independent of structural volumes, predicted error rate. Conclusions: These findings point to altered structure-function relationships in first-episode psychosis.

In some cases, these overdoses have led to death if an anaphylactoid reaction was present. A healthy 30-month-old girl allegedly ingested acetaminophen at 418 mg/kg. Because the emergency physician feared the time of ingestion might not be accurate, he decided to start the 20.5-hour intravenous N-acetylcysteine protocol 8 hours after ingestion. He mistakenly prescribed the maximum milliliter-per-kilogram volume of the dextrose 5% diluent for the milliliter-per-kilogram volume of N-acetylcysteine 20% to be administered. Five hours after the error was detected (19.5 hours postingestion), the patient started developing myoclonus on the left side of her body, with left eye deviation. This condition persisted intermittently for 3 hours despite treatment with diazepam, lorazepam, and phenytoin. A first computed tomographic scan result was normal. A few hours later, she sustained shorter recurrences of the myoclonus. At 30 hours after ingestion, she started to have irregular breathing and became unresponsive to pain. A repeated computed tomographic scan showed diffuse cerebral edema. A postmortem examination showed the presence of acute anoxic encephalopathy with marked cerebral edema and the beginning of uncal herniation that confirmed the clinical diagnosis of intracranial hypertension and brain death. A cumulative intravenous dose of 2,450 mg/kg of N-acetylcysteine was associated with status epilepticus, intracranial hypertension, and death in a child.

NB neuron survival is dependent on coexpression of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors P75(NTR) and TrkA, which bind NGF in cortical projection sites. We have shown previously a significant reduction of NB perikarya expressing p75(NTR) and TrkA protein during the early stages of AD. Whether there is a concomitant reduction in cortical levels of these receptors during the progression of AD is unknown. p75(NTR) and TrkA protein was evaluated by quantitative immunoblotting in five cortical regions (anterior cingulate, superior frontal, superior temporal, inferior parietal, and visual cortex) of individuals clinically diagnosed with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild/moderate AD, or severe AD. Cortical p75(NTR) levels were stable across the diagnostic groups. In contrast, TrkA levels were reduced approximately 50% in mild/moderate and severe AD compared with NCI and MCI in all regions except visual cortex. Mini-Mental Status Examination scores correlated with TrkA levels in anterior cingulate, superior frontal, and superior temporal cortex. The selective reduction of cortical TrkA levels relative to p75(NTR) may have important consequences for cholinergic NB function during the transition from MCI to AD.

Recently, a novel gene called HSN2 has been found to be the cause of HSAN type II in five families from Newfoundland and Quebec. Screening of this gene in an HSAN type II Lebanese family showed a 1bp deletion mutation found in a homozygous state in all affected individuals. This novel mutation supports the hypothesis that HSN2 is the causative gene for HSAN type II.

The syndrome was not recognized prior to the advent of dialysis and renal transplantation because of its rapidly fatal course if renal failure is untreated. The first and only description of AMRF was in four French Canadian patients in three families (Andermann et al., 1986). We now describe 15 individuals with AMRF from five countries, including a follow-up of the four French Canadian patients, allowing a more complete characterization of this disease. Our 15 patients with AMRF belong to nine different families. Segregation analyses were compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. In addition, our findings show that AMRF can present with either renal or neurological features. Tremor (onset 17-26 years, mean 19.8 years, median 19 years) and progressively disabling action myoclonus (onset 14-29 years, mean 21.7 years, median 21 years), with infrequent generalized seizures (onset 20-28 years, mean 22.7 years, median 22 years) and cerebellar features are characteristic. Proteinuria, detected between ages 9 and 30 years in all cases, progressed to renal failure in 12 out of 15 patients within 0-8 years after proteinuria detection. Brain autopsy in two patients revealed extraneuronal pigment accumulation. Renal biopsies showed collapsing glomerulopathy, a severe variant of focal glomerulosclerosis. This study extends the AMRF phenotype, and demonstrates a more extensive ethnic and geographic distribution of a syndrome originally believed to be confined to individuals of French Canadian ancestry. The independent progression of neurological and renal disorders in AMRF suggests a unitary molecular lesion with pleiotropic effects. Our results demonstrate that the renal lesion in AMRF is a recessive form of collapsing glomerulopathy. Genes identified for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and involved with the function of the glomerular basement membrane and related proteins are thus good candidates. Treatment can improve quality of life and extend the lifespan of these patients. Dialysis and renal transplantation are effective for the renal but not the neurological features, which continue to progress even in the presence of normalized renal function; the latter can be managed with anti-myoclonic and anti-epileptic drugs.

J	Cannizzaro, M; Harel, B; Reilly, N; Chappell, P; Snyder, PJ				Cannizzaro, M; Harel, B; Reilly, N; Chappell, P; Snyder, PJ			Voice acoustical measurement of the severity of major depression	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article							DOPAMINE RELEASE; RATING-SCALE; DISORDERS	A number of empirical studies have documented the relationship between quantifiable and objective acoustical measures of voice and speech, and clinical subjective ratings of severity of Major Depression. To further explore this relationship, speech samples were extracted from videotape recordings of structured interviews made during the administration of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; Hamilton, 1960). Pilot data were obtained from seven subjects (five males, two females) from videotapes that have been used to train expert raters on the administration and scoring of the HDRS. Several speech samples were isolated for each subject and processed to obtain the acoustic measurements. Acoustic measures were selected on the basis that they were correlated with HDRS ratings of symptom severity as seen under ideal voice recording conditions in previous studies. Our findings corroborate earlier reports that speaking rate is well correlated (negatively) with HDRS scores, with a strong correlation and nearly significant trend seen for the measure of pitch variability. A moderate pairwise correlation between percent pause time and HDRS score was also revealed, although this relationship was not statistically significant. The results from this cross-sectional study further demonstrate the ability of voice and speech signal analyses to objectively track severity of depression. In the present case, it is suggested that this relationship is robust enough to be found despite the less than ideal recording conditions and equipment used during the original videotape recording. Voice acoustical analyses may provide a powerful compliment to the standard clinical interview for depression.

In this study, phonomyography of three regions of the hand was compared to mechanomyography of the adductor pollicis. Methods: In 12 patients, phonomyography was recorded via small condenser microphones taped over the thenar mass, the hypothenar eminence, and the dorsal groove between the first and second metacarpal bones to record the acoustic signals of adductor pollicis and the hypothenar and first dorsal interosseus muscles, respectively. Mechanomyography of the adductor pollicis was recorded simultaneously using a force transducer After induction of anesthesia, the ulnar nerve was stimulated supramaximally using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 sec. Onset, maximum effect, and offset of neuromuscular block after rocuronium 0.6 mg(.)kg(-1) were measured using phonomyography and compared to mechanomyography using ANOVA and the Bland-Altman test. Results: Phonomyographic measurements of onset and maximum effect of neuromuscular blockade were not significantly different from mechanomyographic measurements. Phonomyographic measurements of offset (T25%, T75 %, TOF 0.8) of neuromuscular block at the thenar muscles and first dorsal interosseus muscles were not significantly different from mechanomyographic measurements at adductor pollicis; however, T50%, T75% and T90% phonomyographic measurements at the hypothenar muscle were significantly shorter than at any other muscle site. Conclusion: There was good agreement between mechanomyographic measurements at the adductor pollicis muscle and phonomyographic measurements at the thenar and the first dorsal interosseus muscles. Phonomyography of those two muscles could be used interchangeably with mechanomyography of adductor pollicis for clinical purposes.

Clinical features: A 69-yr-old 70-kg male underwent orthotopic heart transplant (bicaval anastomosis technique) for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Five months after transplantation, the patient underwent a transurethral bladder tumour resection under spinal anesthesia. Two millilitres of bupivacaine 0.75% (15 mg) were injected intrathecally at L3-4 and the patient remained seated for approximately 20 sec prior to assuming the lithotomy position. Subsequently, both blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) diminished gradually (BP and HR immediately pre-spinal: 1 13 mmHg (mean arterial pressure) and 92 beats(.)min(-1), respectively; nadir BP and HR: 94 mmHg (16.8% decrease) 30 min postspinal and 73 beats(.)min(-1) (20.7% decrease) 40 min postspinal, respectively). HR and mean BP were highly correlated (r = 0.9410, P < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.8854). The dermatome level of neuraxial anesthesia, determined by sensitivity to pin prick, was T, (five minutes) and T 6 (ten minutes) postinjection of spinal anesthetic. Control patients (n = 10) undergoing elective urological procedures with identical anesthesia management demonstrated very similar cardiovascular responses. Conclusions: Although cardiac transplant patients may tolerate neuraxial anesthesia admirably, a fall in HR may ensue which theoretically could have important physiological consequences. It is argued that the change in HR in the transplanted patient was mediated by mechanisms intrinsic to the transplanted heart and/or by reduced catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla. It is emphasized that HR changes observed in cardiac transplant patients do not necessarily imply reinnervation of the transplanted organ.

J	Villemure, C; Lorrain, D; Plourde, G				Villemure, C; Lorrain, D; Plourde, G			Sparing of perceptual implicit memory despite suppression of the electrophysiological word repetition effect: a study with general anesthetic isoflurane	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						implicit memory; explicit memory; event-related potential repetition effect; general anesthetics	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS PATIENTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EXPLICIT MEMORY; OLDER CONTROLS; ASSOCIATIONS; VOLUNTEERS; YOUNG	Objective: Much effort has been devoted to the search for the neurophysiological correlates of implicit memory. A commonly held view is that the early portion (250-500 ms) of the event-related potential (ERP) word repetition effect reflects processes important for perceptual implicit memory whereas the latter portion reflects processes implicated in explicit memory. It is, however, difficult to disentangle with certainty the relative contributions of each form of memory on ERPs since both forms co-exist in normal subjects. To dissociate ERP effect related to implicit and explicit memory, we used isoflurane sedation in normal subjects to suppress explicit remembering while sparing implicit memory. These ERPs were compared with those of non-medicated control subjects. Methods: Thirteen subjects performed an incidental encoding task for words presented auditorily during the inhalation of a subanesthetic dose of isoflurane. After termination of isoflurane administration, we assessed free recall and recorded ERPs during a syllable completion task (implicit memory) and during a passive listening task (ERP repetition effect). Eleven non-medicated control subjects were tested in a similar manner. Results: The controls showed robust early and late ERP repetition effect. The isoflurane group had implicit memory without free recall and showed no ERP repetition effect. Conclusions: These findings failed to show an association between any part of the repetition effect and perceptual implicit memory. The results are consistent with the view that processes linked to explicit memory contribute to the ERP repetition effect since there was a marked difference in free recall between the control and isoflurane groups. Significance: The present study shows that the reversible alterations of memory by general anesthetics can be used to study the neurophysiological correlates of memory processes.

Research in animals suggests that the cerebral cortex plays an important role in regulating the activity of the STN but this control is not known in humans. The most extensive cortical innervation of the STN originates from motor areas. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during intraoperative single-unit recordings from STN, in six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulators, to determine whether TMS of the motor cortex (MC) modulates the activity of STN and to investigate in vivo the functional organization of the corticosubthalamic circuit in the human brain. Single-pulse TMS of the MC induced an excitation in 74.9% of neurons investigated. This activation was followed by a long-lasting inhibition of the STN neuronal activity that did not correlate with PD severity. Responsive neurons to TMS of the hand area of motor cortex were located mainly in the lateral and dorsal region of the subthalamus while unresponsive cells had a prevalently medial distribution. This is the first report of TMS-induced modulation of STN neuronal activity in humans. These findings open up new avenues for in vivo studies of corticosubthalamic interactions in human brain and PD.

Complementing the valuable information generated through functional genomics with the integrative knowledge of protein expression and function should enable the development of more efficient diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents. Proteomic analyses are particularly suitable to elucidate posttranslational modifications, expression levels and protein-protein interactions of thousands of proteins at a time. In this review, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) investigations of brain tissues in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome and schizophrenia, and the construction of 2D-PAGE proteome maps of the brain are discussed. The role of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) as an international coordinating organization for proteomic efforts, as well as challenges for proteomic technologies and data analysis are also addressed. It is expected that the use of proteomic strategies will have significant impact in neuropharmacology over the coming decade. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We have previously shown that mutations in scribbler (sbb), a gene encoding two transcripts widely expressed in the nervous system, cause abnormally frequent episodes of turning in the third instar larva. Here we report that hypomorphic sbb mutant larvae display aberrant turning from the second instar stage onwards. We focus on the smaller of the two sbb transcripts and show that its pan-neural expression during early larval life, but not in later larval life, restores wild type turning behavior. To identify the classes of neurons in which this sbb transcript is involved, we carried out transgenic rescue experiments. Targeted expression of the small sbb transcript using the cha-GAL4 driver was sufficient to restore wild type turning behavior. In contrast, expression of this sbb transcript in motoneurons, sensory neurons or large numbers of unidentified interneurons was not sufficient. Our data suggest that the expression of the smaller sbb transcript may be needed in a subset of neurons for the maintenance of normal turning behavior in Drosophila larvae.

Dietary thiamine (vitamin B1) consists mainly of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is transformed into thiamine by gastrointestinal phosphatases before absorption. It is believed that TPP itself cannot be transported across plasma membranes in significant amounts. We have identified a partial loss-of-function mutation in the Coenorhabditis elegans gene (tpk-1) that encodes thiamine pyrophosphokinase, which forms TPP from thiamine at the expense of ATP inside cells. The mutation slows physiological rhythms and the phenotype it produces can be rescued by TPP but not thiamine supplementation. tpk-1 functions cell nonautonomously, as the expression of wild-type tpk-1 in one tissue can rescue the function of other tissues that express only mutant tpk-1. These observations indicate that, in contrast to expectation from previous evidence, TPP can be transported across cell membranes. We also find that thiamine supplementation partially rescues the phenotype of partial loss-of-function mutants of the Na/K ATPase, providing genetic evidence that thiamine absorption, and/or redistribution from the absorbing cells, requires the full activity of this enzyme.

The neuritic degenerative process was evaluated by the quantification of aggregated neuritic structures. Lesions were determined using antibodies against hyperphosphorylated-tau (AD2), amyloid-beta, and synaptophysin. In these conditions, we classified and quantified three pathological structures associated to the neuritic degenerative process: 1) Amyloid-beta deposits (AbetaDs), 2) Classic neuritic plaques (NPs), and 3) Dystrophic neurites clusters (DNCs) lacking amyloid-beta deposits. Reactive plasticity structures were constituted by meganeuritic clusters (MCs) and peri-neuronal sprouting in neurons of the CA4 region of the hippocampus, immunoreactive to synaptophysin (exclusively in AD brains) and GAP-43. Besides, MCs were associated to sialylated O-glycosydically linked glycans as determined by positive labeling with ALL and MRL. Considering that these lectins are specific for the synaptic sprouting process in AD, our results suggest the co-occurrence of of several areas of reactive plasticity and neuron degeneration in AD.

In addition, we cross validate the DM-DSM method with a method based on MRI-PET registration for PET brain delineation. For this, the automated image registration (AIR) algorithm is combined with the anatomical brain surface extractor (BSE) algorithm. Two radiopharmaceuticals were considered: C-11-Raclopride and F-18-FDG. The success of the two methods was quantified by measuring the similarity between the extracted and the true brain volume. Also local differences between the extracted and the true brain surfaces were measured. With FDG, the DM-DSM method yielded brain surfaces of high accuracy and they were more accurate than with the image registration based method. With Raclopride, the accuracy of the DM-DSM method was slightly lower than with FDG and, on the average, similar to the accuracy of the image registration based method. However with Raclopride, maximal local differences between true and extracted surfaces were found to be greater with DM-DSM. In addition, preliminary experiments with images containing simulated pathology were done and the performance of DM-DSM was excellent in these experiments. To summarize, we found that the DM-DSM method can reliably extract brain surfaces of high accuracy from PET images.

These trials, however, appear not to capture clinically demonstrable, but otherwise unmeasured, beneficial treatment effects. We sought to identify and categorize clinically recognizable effects of donepezil treatment in Alzheimer's disease. Methods A list of potential effects was developed using clinical trials data and the experience of an expert panel. These were incorporated in a questionnaire, which was tested with a focus group, revised and then used in a postal survey of physicians. Data were classified by cognitive domain, and reviewed by a second panel. Results Items that were most often rated as being improved were related to frontal systems function, including attentional capacity and initiative. Behavioral symptoms that were among the highest rated items were apathy, mood, and agitation. The top two other items were social interactions and involvement in domestic activities. Of the top ten symptomatic treatment effects, only four appeared to be readily identified by current standard measures. Conclusions Physicians recognize as important several treatment effects that are not well captured by current standard measures. New methods are needed to capture such effects, which also have the potential to offer insight into the neurobiology of the human cholinergic system. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Glucokinases (EC 2.7.1.2) are functionally distinct from hexokinases (EC 2.7.1.1) with respect to their narrow specificity for glucose as a substrate. While structural information is available for ADP-dependent glucokinases from Archaea, no structural information exists for the large sequence family of eubacterial ATP-dependent glucokinases. Here we report the first structure determination of a microbial ATP-dependent glucokinase, that from E. coli O157:H7. The crystal structure of E. coli glucokinase has been determined to a 2.3-Angstrom resolution (apo form) and refined to final R-work/R-free factors of 0.200/0.271 and to 2.2-Angstrom resolution (glucose complex) with final R-work/R-free factors of 0.193/0.265. E. coli GlK is a homodimer of 321 amino acid residues. Each monomer folds into two domains, a small alpha/beta domain (residues 2 to 110 and 301 to 321) and a larger alpha+beta domain (residues 111 to 300). The active site is situated in a deep cleft between the two domains. E. coli GIK is structurally similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexokinase and human brain hexokinase I but is distinct from the ADP-dependent GlKs. Bound glucose forms hydrogen bonds with the residues Asn99, Asp100, Glu157, His160, and Glu187, all of which, except His160, are structurally conserved in human hexokinase 1. Glucose binding results in a closure of the small domains, with a maximal Cot shift of similar to10 Angstrom. A catalytic mechanism is proposed that is consistent with Asp200 functioning as the general base, abstracting a proton from the O6 hydroxyl of glucose, followed by nucleophilic attack at the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP, yielding glucose-6-phosphate as the product.

We evaluated whether a reduced pulmonary ET-1 clearance could contribute to this elevation. Methods and Results: We determined pulmonary ET-I clearance in 24 patients with CHF in relation with hemodynamics, plasma ET-1, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. Pulmonary ET-1 extraction, measured by the single bolus indicator-dilution technique, was reduced to 32 +/- 14% in comparison to historic controls (47 +/- 7%). Plasma ET-1 clearance by the lungs (924 +/- 588 mL/min) was also much lower than in controls (1424 +/- 79 mL/min). Clearance correlated inversely with mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP, r = -.47, P = .017) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = -.47, P = .017) and positively with the rate of left ventricular (LV) relaxation LV -dP/dt (r = .593, P = .004). After multivariate analysis, only mean PAP and LV -dP/dt were independently correlated with ET-1 clearance (r = -.40, P = .03, and r = .55, P = .005, respectively). Plasma ET-1 levels did not correlate with clearance (r = .038, P = .86), and there was no significant arteriovenous ET-I gradient. There was a mild nonsignificant correlation between plasma ET-1 and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = .38, P = .06), but a strong correlation with right atrial pressure (r = .696, P < .0001) and NT-proBNP levels (r = .51, P = .001), which were maintained after multivariate linear regression (r = .60, P = .001, and r = .32, P = .04, respectively). Conclusion: Pulmonary ET-1 clearance is reduced in CHF in relation with the severity of pulmonary hypertension. This reduced clearance does not significantly modulate plasma ET-1 levels. Whether this is only a marker of secondary pulmonary hypertension or could modulate pulmonary vascular tone will require further studies.

It is a problem of considerable clinical relevance, and its neurobiological mechanisms differ from those of somatic nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Much progress had been made in recent years in the understanding of the functional properties of the visceral nociceptors that trigger pain states, their molecular mechanisms of activation and sensitization and on their central actions. Some molecular targets have been identified as key players in the activation and sensitization of visceral nociceptors, notably ASICs, TTX-resistant Na channels and the TRPV1 receptor. Some nonneural elements of visceral organs, such as the urothelium have been shown to play active roles in the transduction of visceral sensory events by mechanisms involving ATP release by the urothelial cells. Certain well-known neurotransmitters, such as the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, likely play an important role in the peripheral and central activation of visceral nociceptive afferents and in the generation of visceral hyperalgesia. This article reviews current evidence on the mechanisms of activation and sensitization of visceral nociceptive afferents and on their role in the triggering and maintenance of clinically relevant visceral pain states.

J	Schepens, B; Drew, T				Schepens, B; Drew, T			Independent and convergent signals from the pontomedullary reticular formation contribute to the control of posture and movement during reaching in the cat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							VOLUNTARY GAIT MODIFICATIONS; PRIMATE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; INTACT UNANESTHETIZED CAT; ARM MOVEMENTS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; SPINAL-CORD; BRAIN-STEM; CORTICORETICULAR PATHWAYS	We have addressed the nature of the postural control signals contained within the discharge activity of neurons in the pontomedullary reticular formation, including reticulospinal neurons, during a reaching task in the cat. We recorded the activity of 142 neurons during ipsilateral reaching movements that required anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) in the supporting limbs to maintain equilibrium. Discharge activity in 82/142 (58%) neurons was significantly increased before the onset of the reach. Most of these neurons discharged either in a phasic (22/82), tonic (10/82), or phasic/tonic (41/82) pattern. In each of these 3 groups, the onset of the discharge activity in some neurons was temporally related either to the GO signal or to the onset of the movement. In many neurons, one component of the discharge sequence was better related to the GO signal and another to the onset of the movement. Based on our previous behavioral study during the same task, we suggest that reticular neurons in which the discharge activity is better related to the GO signal contribute to the initiation of the APAs that precede the movement. Neurons in which the discharge activity is better related to the movement signal might contribute to the initiation of the movement and to the production of the postural responses that accompany that movement. Together our results suggest the existence of neurons that signal posture and movement independently and others that encode a convergent signal that contributes to the control of both posture and movement.

Three types of synaptic responses could be evoked by electrical stimulation of the adjacent supratrigeminal, motor, and main sensory nuclei and the intertrigeminal area: monophasic depolarizing postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), biphasic PSPs, and all or none action potentials without underlying excitatory PSPs (EPSPs). Many PSPs and spikes were abolished by bath-application of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline (DNQX) alone or combined with D, L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), suggesting that they are mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and NMDA glutamatergic receptors, while some action potentials were sensitive to bicuculline, indicating involvement of GABA A receptors. A number of cells showed spontaneous membrane potential oscillations, and stimulation of synaptic inputs increased the amplitude of the oscillations for several cycles, which often triggered repetitive firing. Furthermore, the oscillatory rhythm was reset by the stimulation. Our results show that synaptic inputs to muscle primary afferent neurons in NVmes from neighboring areas are mainly excitatory and that they cause firing. In addition, the inputs synchronize intrinsic oscillations, which may lead to sustained, synchronous firing in a subpopulation of afferents. This may be of importance during rapid biting and during the mastication of very hard or tough foods.

Identification and characterization of the protein components of synapses will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neurotransmission and plasticity. We applied multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to purified, guanidine-solubilized postsynaptic fractions to identify novel synaptically localized molecules. We identified several actin-associated proteins known to regulate actin polymerization and control cell motility in nonneural cells that have not previously been associated with CNS synaptic function. One of these is lasp-1, an actin-associated LIM and SH3 domain-containing protein. We show that lasp-1 is strongly expressed by CNS neurons and is concentrated at synaptic sites. Overall, the preponderance of actin-associated proteins in postsynaptic density fractions, and specifically those involved in actin reorganization, suggests that there are many modes by which the state of synaptic F-actin polymerization and, hence, synaptic physiology are affected.

Most reports of series on ruptured intracranial aneurysms contain information on select intraoperative complications. An understanding of all surgical complications, however, may guide us toward improved surgical procedures and enrich discussions concerning alternative management strategies, such as endovascular treatment, which are not exempt from complications and aneurysm recurrence. Methods. The study consists of a retrospective review of the charts, images, and notes from follow-up visits of 143 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who were surgically treated during a 3-year period by one neurosurgeon. A surgical complication was determined based on findings of a clinical and/or radiological study in the absence of confounding factors such as the initial SAH ictus, vasospasm, hydrocephalus, and septic status. Functional outcome was assessed between 2 and 3 months post-SAH by using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). A procedure-related surgical comlication was diagnosed in 29 (20.3%) of 143 patients studied. A brain tissue injury, including cerebral edema and hemorrhagic contusions, was diagnosed in 6.3% of patients, an unpredicted residual aneurysm neck in 5.3% of patients, and a cranial nerve deficit in 2.8% of patients. Functional outcome was good in 22 (75.9%) of the 29 patients with surgical complications. Death due to a Surgical complication occurred in one (0.7%) of 143 patients. Conclusions. Surgical complications are more prevalent than previously thought. They may have been overlooked previously because of the high percentage of good functional outcomes and low mortality rates in this group. The identification of surgical complications may encourage the search for solutions to improve surgical treatment of aneurysmal SAH.

In this article, an articulatory-to-acoustic model, integrating nonuniform vocal tract growth, is used to describe the effect of morphology in the acoustic and perceptual domains. While simulating mature control abilities of the articulators (freezing neurocognitive factors), the size and shape of the vocal apparatus are varied, to represent typical values of speakers from birth to adulthood. The results show that anatomy does not prevent even the youngest speaker from producing vowels perceived as the 10 French oral vowels /i y u e o o e ce 3 a/. However, the specific configuration of the vocal tract for the newborn seems to favor the production of those vowels perceived as low and front. An examination of the acoustic effects of articulatory variation for different growth stages led to the proposed variable sensorimotor maps for newbornlike, childlike, and adultlike vocal tracts. These maps could be used by transcribers of infant speech, to complete existing systems and to provide some hints about underlying articulatory gestures recruited during growth to reach perceptual vowel targets in French.

J	Nuthall, HN; Joachim, K; Stifani, S				Nuthall, HN; Joachim, K; Stifani, S			Phosphorylation of serine 239 of Groucho/TLE1 by protein kinase CK2 is important for inhibition of neuronal differentiation	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIATED TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION; TRANSDUCIN-LIKE-ENHANCER; DROSOPHILA GROUCHO; CASEIN KINASE-2; COREPRESSOR; INTERACTS; FAMILY; ACTS; TRANSACTIVATION; NEUROGENESIS	Transcriptional corepressors of the Groucho (Gro)/TLE family play important roles during a variety of developmental pathways, including neuronal differentiation. In particular, they act as negative regulators of neurogenesis, together with Hairy/Enhancer of split (Hes) DNA-binding proteins. The interaction with Hes1 leads to Gro/TLE hyperphosphorylation and increased transcription repression activity in mammalian cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized. We now show that Gro/TLE1 is phosphorylated in vivo by protein kinase CK2. This phosphorylation occurs at serine 239 within the conserved CcN domain present in all Gro/TLE family members. Mutation of serine 239 into alanine decreases Hes1-induced hyperphosphorylation of Gro/TLE1 and also reduces its nuclear association and transcription repression activity. We demonstrate further that Gro/TLE1 inhibits the transition of cortical neural progenitors into neurons and that its antineurogenic activity is inhibited by a serine-239-alanine mutation but not by a serine-239-glutamate mutation. These results suggest that CK2 phosphorylation of serine 239 of Gro/TLE1 is important for its function during neuronal differentiation.

The acquired brain endothelial cells phenotype results from their sustained interactions with their microenvironment. The endothelial component is involved in the development and progression of most CNS diseases such as brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, or stroke, for which efficient treatments remain to be discovered. The endothelium constitutes an attractive therapeutical target, particularly in the case of brain tumors, because of the high level of angiogenesis associated with this disease. Drug development based on targeting differential protein expression in the vasculature associated with normal tissues or with disease states holds great potential. This article highlights some of the growing body of evidence showing molecular differences between the vascular bed phenotype of normal and pathological endothelium, with a particular focus on brain tumor endothelium targets, which may play crucial roles in the development of brain cancers. Finally, an overview is presented of the emerging therapies for brain tumors that take the endothelial component into consideration.

We use the framework of the kinematic theory proposed by Plamondon (1995 and 1998) as an example of a hybrid model that allows a precise and flexible quantitative description of human movements. It is shown that the theory can be used to encompass the various types of rapid movement encountered in the field. The principal aim of this article is to highlight the fact that the notion of movement primitives should not necessarily be confined to movements with a single velocity peak, as is still often assumed in many models. The model allows, for example, a simple description of a movement primitive, which might contain up to two direction reversals.

We present in this paper an automated method for screening SPELT studies to detect diffuse disseminated abnormalities based on a computerized atlas of normal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). To generate the atlas, a set of normal brain SPELT studies are registered together. The atlas contains the intensity mean, the nonlinear displacement mean, and the variance of the activity pattern. A patient is then evaluated by registering his or her SPELT volume to the atlas and computing the nonlinear 3-D displacement of each voxel needed for the best shape fit to it. A voxel is counted as "abnormal" if the intensity difference between the atlas and the registered patient (or if the,3-D motion necessary to move the voxel to its registered position) is superior to 3 SD of normal mean. The number of abnormal voxels is used to classify studies. We validated this approach on 24 SPELT perfusion studies selected visually for having clear diffuse anomalies and 21 normal studies. A Markovian segmentation algorithm is also used to identify the white and gray matters for regional analysis. Based on the number of abnormal voxels, two supervised classifiers were tested: (1) minimum distance-to-mean and (2) Bayesian. The analysis of the intensity and displacement "abnormal" easels allow one to achieve an 80% correct classification rate for the whole brain and a 93% rate if Nee consider only voxels in the segmented gray matter region.

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a fully automated image analysis technique allowing identification of regional differences in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) between groups of subjects without a prior region of interest. The purpose of this study was to determine whole-brain GM and WM changes in TLE and to investigate the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical parameters. We studied 85 patients with pharmacologically intractable TLE and unilateral hippocampal atrophy and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The seizure focus was right sided in 40 patients and left sided in 45. Student's t test statistical maps of differences between patients' and controls' GM and WM concentrations were obtained using a general linear model. A further regression against duration of epilepsy, age of onset, presence of febrile convulsions, and secondary generalized seizures was performed with the TLE population. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that GM pathology in TLE extends beyond the hippocampus involving other limbic areas such as the cingulum and the thalamus, as well as extralimbic areas, particularly the frontal lobe. White matter reduction was found only ipsilateral to the seizure focus, including the temporopolar, entorhinal, and perirhinal areas. This pattern of structural changes is suggestive of disconnection involving preferentially frontolimbic pathways in patients with pharmacologically intractable TLE. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Components of these two developmental and cancer-associated pathways, including (Patched) PTCH, SMOH, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), beta-catenin and AXIN1 show somatic mutations in sporadic MBs. In this study we analysed SUFU (human suppressor of fused), which acts as a negative regulator of both the Shh and Wnt signalling pathways and therefore represents a putative tumour suppressor gene, to find out if it is also involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic MBs. We screened 145 primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) including 90 classic MBs, 42 of the desmoplastic variant and two medullomyoblastomas as well as 11 <smallcapitals>M</smallcapitals>B cell lines for mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing analysis. 18% of the MBs exhibited allelic losses on chromosome 10q. In contrast to a previous report, in which truncating mutations of SUFU have been identified in 9% of MBs, we were not able to identify somatic mutations of SUFU in our large tumour panel. We uncovered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 4, 8, 11 and in intron 2 in the SUFU gene. Expression analysis by competitive reverse transciption-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed no difference in SUFU mRNA levels of both MB subtypes and normal foetal or adult cerebellar tissues. Our results indicate that genetic alterations of the SUFU gene, do not contribute significantly to the molecular pathogenesis of MBs.

Although previously shown to modify nociceptive behavior in acute pain models, dietary fat has never been tested for its putative analgesic properties in chronic pain states. Here we tested the role of dietary fat, protein and fat/protein interactions in the development of tactile allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in PSL-injured rats. Male Wistar rats were fed nine different diets, comprising of three proteins (soy, casein and albumin) and three fats (corn, soy and canola) for a week preceding PSL injury and for 2 weeks thereafter. Rats' responses to tactile and noxious heat stimuli were tested before surgery and 3, 7 and 14 days afterwards. Tactile and heat sensory abnormalities following PSL injury were significantly different among the nine dietary groups. Consumption of corn and soy fats suppressed the levels of tactile and heat allodynia and hyperalgesia, whereas consumption of soy and casein proteins was associated with lower levels of heat hyperalgesia but not tactile allodynia. A significant fat/protein interaction was found for the heat but not tactile stimuli. We conclude that dietary fat is a significant independent predictor of levels of neuropathic sensory disorders in rats and that this effect is accentuated by dietary protein. The mechanisms by which fat suppresses neuropathic disorders have yet to be determined. (C) 2004 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Normal subjects and SIP patients experienced only brief stinging pain, while subsets of both sympathectomized and non-sympathectomized SMP patients (6/9 and 4/8, respectively) experienced an additional abnormal pain response accompanied by mechano-allodynia around the injection site. Both the normal and abnormal pain response after intradermal phenylephrine are similar to those observed with intradermal norepinephrine. In contrast to previous reports in the literature, we found that three sympathectomized SMP patients (who, however, had failed to experience pain relief after surgical sympathectomy despite very good relief after sympathetic blocks) also experienced abnormal pain and mechano-allodynia when phenylephrine was injected to a limb contralateral to the symptomatic sympathectomized extremity. Abnormal pain response evoked by norepinephrine or phenylephrine injection in the ipsilateral symptomatic limb of SNIP patients may be due to injury-evoked nociceptor responsiveness to catecholamines. However, such a response in contralateral asymptomatic limbs suggests an additional factor that more likely than not is of central origin and may or may not be related to sympathectomy and its success or failure to treat pain.

This peptide with structural homology to somatostatin was first isolated from the urophysis of fish and was recently found to bind to an orphan receptor in mouse and human. Initially found to have potent vasoconstrictive activities in a variety of vessels from diverse species, it has also been shown to exert vasodilatation in certain vessels in the rat and human by various endothelium-dependent mechanisms. The various vasoactive properties of UII suggest that the peptide may have a physiological role in maintaining vascular tone and therefore may have a role in the pathophysiology of a number of human diseases such as heart failure. Moreover, UII has also been implicated as a mitogen of vascular smooth muscle cells suggesting a deleterious role in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. In addition, there is evidence to demonstrate that UII has multiple metabolic effects on cholesterol metabolism, glycemic control and hypertension and therefore may be implicated in the development of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.

Yet some patients might develop resistance, while others could have toxic side effects. MTX achieves its cytotoxicity through the inhibition of folate-dependent enzymes, suggesting that the genes controlling their activity or the levels of folate cofactors can modulate drug efficacy and, thus, the sensitivity of a patient to MTX. Indeed, several studies, conducted mostly in leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis patients, have addressed the potential for tailoring MTX therapy based on a patient's genetics. Several genetic variants have been shown to have a predictive role, among which the most frequently studied are those of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase genes. The other candidates, as well as gene-gene interactions, which may be even more important for the prediction of disease outcomes than the individual gene effects, are also briefly discussed.

Depending oil the cell type, it is cytoplasmic, exported or cell surface associated. As a new receptor for heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), NRDc was recently shown to be involved in cellular migration and proliferation. Since for those processes its enzymatic activity is not required, it is now evident that nardilysin fulfills at least two distinct functions, i.e. an HB-EGF modulator and a peptidase.

It is responsible for the processing of numerous prohormones and proneuropeptides into their biologically active moieties, often following cleavage at pairs of basic residues. The determination of its three-dimensional structure, as well as the understanding of its enzymatic properties, would greatly benefit from the production and availability of large amounts of recombinant enzyme. We report herein improvements in the production of PC1/3 by expressing recombinant mutated forms in both insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda, Sf9 cells) and larvae (Trichoplusia ni commonly referred to as cabbage looper). On one hand, we deleted the last 135 COOH-terminal residues of mPC1/3 and, on the other hand, we replaced the signal peptide of mPC1/3 by the viral glycoprotein gp67 signal peptide. These modifications were shown to improve markedly (up to 125%) the secretion into the Sf9 cells medium and the amount of enzymatic activity recovered when compared to the original vector. Moreover, intracoelemic injection of the vectors into insect larvae led to the production and purification of enzymatically active enzyme at a level of 30 mug/larva in the case of mPC1/3 and to the production of a high amount of another enzymatically active convertase, PC7. The optimal viral titer for infection of larvae was determined to be 10(6) pfu/ml. Taking into account the purification protocol combined with the ease and efficiency of using larvae, it should now be possible to meet the needs for biochemical and structural studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: At brain MR imaging during general anesthesia with propofol, two FLAIR sequences were-performed in 20 children with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system grades of 3 or lower The first FLAIR sequence was performed with the child breathing 100% oxygen; the second was performed with the child breathing 30% oxygen. CSF signal intensity was quantified on a three-point ordinal scale (0 = hypointense to brain parenchyma, 1 = isointense to brain parenchyma, 2 = hyperintense to brain parenchyma) by a pediatric neuroradiologist who, was blinded to the F-IO2 level. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine if CSF hyperintensity was correlated with F-IO2. RESULTS: CSF hyperintensity was present in all 20 children (age range, 1.9-16.7 years; 12 children were boys) when the F-IO2 was 100%. The hyperintensity partially or completely disappeared in the basilar cisterns. (P<.001) and cerebral sulcal subarachnoid space (P<.001),after F-IO2 was reduced from 100% to 30%. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased arterial oxygen tension and consequently increased CSF P-O2 resulting from administration of high F-IO2 during general anesthesia are responsible for the increased CSF signal intensity noted on brain FLAIR MR images.

The nervous system is capable of adapting grip forces to a wide range of object shapes, weights and frictional properties, to provide optimal and secure handling in a variety of potentially perturbing environments. The dynamic interplay between sensory information and motor commands provides the basis for this flexibility, and recent studies supply somewhat unexpected evidence of the essential role played by cutaneous feedback in maintaining and acquiring predictive grip force control. These examples also offer new insights into the adaptive control of other voluntary movements.

In order to dissect genetic causes of the syndrome, hemizygous human wild-type SOD1 transgenic mice were compared to FVB/N non-transgenic controls at 3 months of age in the SHIRPA primary screen of neurologic function as well as in tests of motor activity and coordination. The responsiveness of SOD1/wt transgenic mice to visual and somatosensory stimuli was reduced in placing, pinna, corneal, and toe-pinch tests. In addition, SOD1/wt transgenic mice crossed fewer segments on a stationary beam. On the contrary, there was no intergroup difference for motor activity and anxiety in open-field and emergence tests and for latencies before falling on the stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod. These results indicate mild deficits in sensorimotor responsiveness in a mouse model expressing human SOD1 and that the overexpressed gene may be responsible for some Down symptoms.

J	Qanbar, R; Bouvier, M				Qanbar, R; Bouvier, M			Determination of protein-bound palmitate turnover rates using a three-compartment model that formally incorporates [H-3]palmitate recycling	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							HUMAN BETA-2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; DYNAMIC PALMITOYLATION; MEMBRANE ASSOCIATION; BRAIN PHOSPHOLIPIDS; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; SF9 CELLS; PHOSPHORYLATION; DEPALMITOYLATION; DESENSITIZATION; IDENTIFICATION	The observation that the palmitoylation state of certain proteins can be biologically modulated led to the proposal that it could, much like phosphorylation, be an important dynamic regulator of protein function. However, based on single-phase exponential decay analysis of data from [H-3]palmitate pulse/ chase experiments, the measured protein-bound palmitate turnover rates were often found to be too slow to account for rapid physiological responses. This paper reports that exponential decay does not adequately describe the results of such experiments because it fails to account for the recycling of [H-3]palmitate from cellular lipids to palmitoyl CoA. Taking this recycling into account, a three-compartment model was used to deduce the time-dependent changes of cellular [H-3]palmitoyl CoA and to infer the time course for the incorporation of [H-3]palmitate into proteins. The validity of the inferences made by the model was checked against data obtained by metabolic labeling of endogenous HEK293 cell proteins. In addition, the model could account for reported anomalies, discrepancies, and apparently paradoxical observations obtained by traditional analysis of data from pulse/chase experiments. Including the recycling of cellular palmitate in the formal description of the system offers a new tool for quantitative assessment of protein-bound palmitate turnover rates. Through the re-evaluation of these rates, the model provides a means for the reassessment of the potential physiological implications of dynamic palmitoylation. The model may also be generally applicable to other areas of research where recycling of tracer is a concern.

Outside the central nervous system (CNS), ABCA1 functions in the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), where it mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. Deficiency of ABCA1 results in lack of circulating HDL and greatly reduced levels of apoA-I. ABCA1 is also expressed in cells within the CNS, but its roles in brain lipid metabolism are not yet fully understood. In the brain, glia synthesize the apolipoproteins involved in CNS lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is required for cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and plays a key role in facilitating cholesterol efflux to apoE, which is the major apolipoprotein in the brain. In both astrocytes and microglia, ABCA1 deficiency reduces lipid efflux to exogenous apoE. The impaired ability to efflux lipids in ABCA1-/- glia results in lipid accumulation in both astrocytes and microglia under normal culture conditions. Additionally, apoE secretion is compromised in ABCA1-/- astrocytes and microglia. In vivo, deficiency of ABCA1 results in a 65% decrease in apoE levels in whole brain, and a 75-80% decrease in apoE levels in hippocampus and striatum. Additionally, the effect of ABCA1 on apoE is selective, as apoJ levels are unchanged in brains of ABCA1-/- mice. Taken together, these results show that glial ABCA1 is a key influence on apoE metabolism in the CNS.

These cells are found not only in major regenerative tissues, such as the epithelia, blood and testes, but also in 'static tissues', such as the nervous system and liver, where they play a central role in tissue growth and maintenance. The mechanism by which stem cells maintain populations of highly differentiated, short-lived cells seems to involve a critical balance between alternate fates: daughter cells either maintain stem cell identity or initiate differentiation. Recent studies in lower organisms have unveiled the regulatory mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell divisions. In these models, the surrounding environment likely provides key instructive signals for the cells to choose one fate over another. Our understanding now extends to the intrinsic mechanisms of cell polarity that influence asymmetrical stem cell divisions. This article focuses on the genetic determinants of asymmetric stem cell divisions in lower organisms as a model for studying the process of self-renewal of mammalian hematopoietic stem cells.

A severe deficiency of MTHFR results in hyperhomocysteinaemia and homocystinuria. Betaine supplementation has proven effective in ameliorating the biochemical abnormalities and the clinical course in patients with this deficiency. Mice with a complete knockout of MTHFR serve as a good animal model for homocystinuria; early postnatal death of these mice is common, as with some neonates with low residual MTHFR activity. We attempted to rescue Mthfr-/- mice from postnatal death by betaine supplementation to their mothers throughout pregnancy and lactation. Betaine decreased the mortality of Mthfr-/- mice from 83 % to 26 % and significantly improved somatic development from postnatal day 1, compared with Mthfr-/- mice from unsupplemented dams. Biochemical evaluations demonstrated higher availability of betaine in suckling pups, decreased accumulation of homocysteine, and decreased flux through the trans-sulphuration pathway in liver and brain of Mthfr-/- pups from betaine-supplemented dams. We observed disturbances in proliferation and differentiation in the cerebellum and hippocampus in the knockout mice; these changes were ameliorated by betaine supplementation. The dramatic effects of betaine on survival and growth, and the partial reversibility of the biochemical and developmental anomalies in the brains of MTHFR-deficient mice, emphasize an important role for choline and betaine depletion in the pathogenesis of homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency.

Ex vivo D3 was defined as a selective, partial TrkA agonist. Here, the in vivo efficacy of D3 as a potential therapeutic for cholinergic neurons was tested in cognitively impaired aged rats, and we compared the consequence of partial TrkA activation ( D3) versus full TrkA/p75 activation (NGF). We show that in vivo D3 binds to TrkA receptors and affords a significant and long-lived phenotypic rescue of the cholinergic phenotype both in the cortex and in the nucleus basalis. The cholinergic rescue was selective and correlates with a significant improvement of memory/learning in cognitively impaired aged rats. The effects of the synthetic ligand D3 and the natural ligand NGF were comparable. Small, proteolytically stable ligands with selective agonistic activity at a growth factor receptor may have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders.

The gene is essential for normal development and has been suggested for its role in the development of basal ganglia. To understand its normal function during growth and development, we determined the expression patterns for the gene responsible for HD (IT 15) mRNA by Northern blot analysis in the developing and adult rat brain. In adult rat brains, IT 15 transcripts exist as two isoforms of 10 and 12.5 kb each, which display distinct expression patterns. IT 15 mRNA expression is already highly expressed within I day of birth. Expression signals for IT15 were first detected at embryonic day 16 or 17 during prenatal development. IT15 transcript peaks leveled around day 20 postnatally and thereafter decreased to levels typically found in adults. In the adult rat brain, mRNA expression was highest in the cerebellum followed by the cortex, striatum, hippocampus and olfactory lobe. In the medulla and the spinal cord, IT 15 was weakly expressed in comparison to the other regions studied. Thus, the distinct expression patterns provide a basis for its functional significance during development. These results also suggest that the degree of IT15 mRNA expression is related to the neuronal population in different brain regions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We recorded from single MT neurons while monkeys performed a motion detection task under two attentional states. Using 0% coherent random dot motion, we estimated the optimal linear transfer function ( or kernel) between the global motion and the neuronal response. This linear kernel filtered the random dot motion across direction, speed, and time. Slightly less than one-half of the neurons produced reasonably well defined kernels that also tended to account for both the directional selectivity and responses to coherent motion of different strengths. This subpopulation of cells had faster, more transient, and more robust responses to visual stimuli than neurons with kernels that did not contain well defined regions of integration. For those neurons that had large attentional modulation and produced well defined kernels, we found attention scaled the temporal profile of the transfer function with no appreciable shift in time or change in shape. Thus, for MT neurons described by a linear transfer function, attention produced a multiplicative scaling of the temporal integration window.

In neurogenesis, their action modulates cell migration, neuritogenesis, and synaptogenesis. Murine P19 embryonal stem cells differentiate to neurons upon aggregation in the presence of retinoic acid, and we previously showed that RhoA and Cdc42 RhoGTPases are sequentially up-regulated during neuroinduction, suggesting a role at this very early developmental stage. In this work, incubation of differentiating P19 cells with C3 toxin resulted in decreased aggregate cohesion and cadherin protein level. In contrast, C3 effects were not observed in cells overexpressing recombinant dominant active RhoA. On the other hand, C3 did not affect cadherin in uninduced cells and their postmitotic neuronal derivatives, respectively expressing E- and Ncadherin. RhoA is thus influential on cell aggregation and cadherin expression during a sensitive time window that corresponds to the switch of E- to N-cadherin. Cell treatment with Y27632 inhibitor of Rho-associated-kinase ROCK, or advanced overexpression of Cdc42 by gene transfer of a constitutively active form of the protein reproduced C3 effects. RhoA-antisense RNA also reduced cadherin level and the size of cell aggregates, and increased the generation of fibroblast-like cells relative to neurons following neuroinduction. Colchicin, a microtubule disrupter, but not cytochalasin B actin poison, importantly decreased cadherin in neurodifferentiating cells. Overall, our results indicate that the RhoA/ROCK pathway regulates cadherin protein level and cell-cell interactions during neurodetermination, with an impact on the efficiency of the process. The effect on cadherin seems to involve microtubules. The importance of correct timing of RhoA and Cdc42 functional expression in neurogenesis is also raised. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To test whether this regulation changes in disease, we used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with parametric mapping to measure the effect of levodopa on the net clearance of [F-18]fluorodopa to brain (K, ml/g/min). Methods - Five patients with early Parkinson's disease with pause of medication for 3 days and six age-matched healthy volunteers were studied in a baseline condition and after levodopa challenge. Results - Levodopa (200 mg as Sinemet) increased the magnitude of the net clearance K in the left and right putamen of the healthy volunteers by 11% relative to the baseline condition. In contrast, resumption of medication with levodopa did not significantly alter the magnitude of K in putamen of the Parkinson's disease patients. Compartmental analysis was used to probe the physiological basis of the activation of K: levodopa treatment increased by 15% the apparent distribution volume of [F-18]fluorodopa in cerebellum (V-e(D), ml/g) of both patients and control subjects, without significantly altering the unidirectional blood-brain clearance (K-1(D), ml/g/min) or the relative activity of DOPA decarboxylase (k(3)(D), min(-1)) in putamen. Conclusion - We conclude that levodopa treatment increases the distribution volume of [F-18]fluorodopa in brain, increasing its availability for utilization in dopamine terminals. We speculate that levodopa act as a direct beta-adrenergic agonist at receptors regulating the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to levodopa. However, the PET analytical method was without sufficient power to detect the consequent increase in magnitude of K in brain of only five Parkinson's disease subjects.

The method accurately duplicates their geometry to provide computer simulations of their blood flow. METHODS: Initial images were obtained by using any medical imaging technique, such as MR angiography, CT angiography, or 3D digital subtraction angiography. The data were collected in DICOM format and converted by a DICOM reader into a 3D gray-scale raster image. The image was then processed by using commercial visualization and mesh generation software, which allowed extraction of the luminal surface of the blood vessel (by using the isosurfacing technique). The subsequent final output was an unstructured tetrahedral grid that can be directly used for detailed analysis of cerebral vascular geometry for patient-specific simulations of blood flow. RESULTS: Four examples of grid reconstruction and blood How simulation for patients with ruptured aneurysms were validated with angiographic and operative findings. The ruptured areas were correlated with areas of high fluid-induced wall-shear stress. CONCLUSION: This approach promises to be a practical tool for planning treatment and follow-up of patients after neurosurgical or endovascular interventions with 3D angiography. The proposed commercial packages or conceptually similar ones seem to be relatively simple and suitable for direct use by neurosurgeons or neuroradiologists.

We hypothesized that inflammatory and denervation changes also involve the muscular layer of the pharynx in OSA. Morphometric analysis was performed on UA tissue from non-snoring control subjects (n = 7) and patients with OSA (n = 11) following palatal surgery. As compared with control subjects, inflammatory cells were increased in the muscular layer of patients with OSA, with CD4+ and activated CD25+ T cells (both increased similar to threefold) predominating. Inflammation was also present in UA mucosa, but with a different pattern consisting of CD8+ (2.8-fold increase) and activated CD25+ (3.2-fold increase) T cell predominance. As ascertained by immunoreactivity for the panneuronal marker PGP9.5, there was a dramatic (5.7-fold) increase in intramuscular nerve fibers in OSA patients compared with control subjects, as well as direct evidence of denervation based on positive immunostaining of the muscle fiber sarcolemmal membrane for the neural cell adhesion molecule in patients with OSA. These data suggest that inflammatory cell infiltration and denervation changes affect not only the mucosa, but also the UA muscle of patients with OSA. This may have important implications for the ability to generate adequate muscular dilating forces during sleep.

A simple approach to quantitation that is commonly used is to quantify the resonance intensity of NAA with respect to creatine (Cr). In patients with ALS, NAA/Cr density is decreased in areas of the brain that contribute significantly to the corticospinal tract. Since MRS is non-invasive, it can be easily used to monitor the evolution of regional changes in NAA/Cr over time. The: changes in NAA/Cr over a period of months are small, however, and challenge the precision of the method.

Half of the subjects performed successively the Interference Stroop task, the two control tasks and the Reverse Stroop task, and half performed the Reverse Stroop task, the control tasks and finally the Interference Stroop task. This experimental design allowed to assess inhibitory deficits by measuring classical interference effects but also by measuring the ability to shift between tasks instructions. Results confirmed AD patients' difficulty in suppressing the automatic response of reading in the Interference Stroop task. Moreover, AD patients presented worsened performances in the Interference task when administered after the Reverse task, and a Reverse Stroop effect was found in the patients revealing their difficulty in suppressing a previously relevant rule in order to learn a new one.

The data from 46 healthy subjects and 29 subjects with disabilities due to stroke or diabetic peripheral neuropathy were analyzed. The biomechanical variable COP-COM was determined using two force platforms and an optoelectric system. Three systems were considered as possible predictors of the COP-COM amplitude: sensory (somatosensory and vision), musculoskeletal and central processor. A confirmatory analysis was done using structural equation modeling. Strength explained 23.74% of the COP-COM amplitude in the antero-posterior (A/P) with eyes open (EO) condition, and in the medio-lateral (M/L) direction strength explained 40.73 and 28.75% in the EO and eyes closed (EC) respectively. In the A/P direction with EC, 51.75% of the COP-COM amplitude variance was explained mainly by the somatosensory system. This study highlight the role of peripheral somatosensory input and muscle strength in the maintenance of postural stability during quiet stance in the elderly. The indirect action of the different systems on the COP-COM amplitude supports the systems theory.

Aims To delineate regional brain dysfunctions that remain stable and those that fluctuate during the course of schizophrenia. Method A cohort of patients with first episode schizophrenia and a matched group of control participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on two occasions 6-8 weeks apart during performance of a working memory task. The patients' disease was in partial remission at the second scan. Results Relative to control participants, the function of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left thalamus and right cerebellum remained disturbed in the people with schizophrenia, whereas the dysfunction of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right thalamus, left cerebellum and cingulate gyrus normalised, with significant reduction in symptoms. Conclusions These results suggest that dysfunction of the left fronto-thalamo-cerebellar circuitry is a relatively stable characteristic of schizophrenia, whereas disturbance of the right circuitry and cingulate gyrus is predominantly a state-related phenomenon.

However, it seems that bpV (phen) does not effect c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. In addition, bpV (phen) induces mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression. We found that ERK activation could be completely abolished if RINm5F cells were incubated with both bpV (phen) and PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of upstream ERK kinase MEK1. On the other hand, this combined treatment up-regulated activation of stress kinases, JNK and p38 MAPK, significantly suppressed MKP-1 expression and induced cell death. Thus, our results suggest that the mechanism underlying bpV (phen) survival-enhancing effect could be associated with induced ERK activation and MKP-1 expression.

Participants were neuropsychologically tested at baseline and again after 3 years. Thirty-seven subjects (mean age 72.5 years) who showed a decline in cognitive test performance at follow-up were compared with 38 individually matched control subjects (mean age 71.8 years) whose performance did not change over time. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired at follow-up and individual differences in regional gray matter density were examined with VBM. The largest age effects were found in various regions in the prefrontal cortex, the (medial) temporal lobes and the striate cortex. Longitudinal cognitive decline was associated with decreased gray matter density in prefrontal areas, the (medial) temporal lobes and the posterior parietal cortex. These findings suggest that prefrontal and temporal cortical regions are of particular relevance both in aging and age-related cognitive decline in healthy elderly individuals.

On the one hand, recent neuroimaging studies show that quantity and order coding activate the same areas in the parietal and prefrontal cortices. On the other hand, evidence from developmental and neuropsychological studies suggest dissociated mechanisms for processing quantity and order information. To clarify this issue, the present study investigated the spatio-temporal course of quantity and order coding operations using event-related potentials (ERPs). Twenty-four subjects performed a quantity task (classifying numbers as smaller or larger than 15) and an order task on the same material (classifying numbers as coming before or after 15), as well as a control order task on letters (classifying letters as coming before or after M). Behavioral results showed a classical distance effect (decreasing reaction times [RTs] with increasing distance from the standard) for all tasks. In agreement with previous electrophysiological evidence, this effect was significant on a P2 parietal component for numerical material. However, the difference between processing numbers close or far from the target appeared earlier and was larger on the left hemisphere for quantity processing, while it was delayed and bilateral for order processing. There was also a significant distance effect in all tasks on parietal sites for the following P3 component elicited by numbers, but this effect was larger on prefrontal areas for the order judgment. In conclusion, both quantity and order show similar behavioral effects, but they are associated with different spatio-temporal courses in parietal and prefrontal cortices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To clarify the implication of apelin in the regulation of water balance, we sought to determine whether apelin colocalized with arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the rat SON and PVN. We also investigated the effects of water deprivation on the levels of apelin within these two nuclei by comparison with those of AVP. Using dual immunolabeling confocal microscopy, we found that a large proportion of apelin-immunoreactive neurons colocalized AVP within both the SON and PVN, but that the two peptides were segregated within distinct subcellular compartments inside these cells. Both the number and labeling intensity of magnocellular apelin-immunoreactive cells increased significantly after 24- or 48-h dehydration, whereas the number and labeling density of AVP-immunoreactive neurons significantly decreased. The dehydration-induced increase in apelin. immunoreactivity was markedly diminished by central injection: of a selective vasopressin-1 receptor antagonist. Conversely, the effect of dehydration was mimicked by a 16-min intracerebroventricular infusion of AVP, again in a vasopressin-1 receptor antagonist-reversible manner. These results provide additional evidence for the involvement of the neuropeptide apelin in the control of body fluid homeostasis. They further suggest that the dehydration-induced release of AVP from magnocellular hypothalamic neurons may be responsible for the observed increase in immunoreactive apelin levels within the same neurons and thus that the release of one peptide may block that of another peptide synthesized in the same cells.

The DAT system is modeled as a SISO (single input single output) system. The architecture of the real time neuro-PID controller and simulation results obtained under realistic operating conditions are presented. The neural network assisted PID tuning method is simple to implement. Results show that the network assisted PID controller is able to track both constant and variable set point trajectories efficiently in the presence of disturbances acting on the DAT system.

A gene for FPEVF was mapped to chromosome 22q12 in two distantly related French-Canadian families. Methods: We describe the clinical features and performed a linkage analysis in a Spanish kindred and in a third French-Canadian family distantly related to the original pedigrees. Results: Onset of seizures was typically in middle childhood, and attacks were usually easy to control. Seizure semiology varied among family members but was constant for each individual. In some, a pattern of nocturnal frontal lobe seizures led to consideration of the diagnosis of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). The Spanish family was mapped to chromosome 22q (multipoint lod score, 3.4), and the new French-Canadian family had a multipoint lod score of 2.97 and shared the haplotype of the original French-Canadian families. Conclusions: Identification of the various forms of familial partial epilepsy is challenging, particularly in small families, in which insufficient individuals exist to identify a specific pattern. We provide clinical guidelines for this task, which will eventually be supplanted by specific molecular diagnosis. We confirmed linkage of FPEVF to chromosome 22q 12 and redefined the region to a 5.2-Mb segment of DNA.

The offspring of mothers that exhibit increased levels of pup licking/grooming (high-LG mothers) show increased hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subunit mRNA expression, enhanced synaptogenesis and improved hippocampal-dependent spatial learning in comparison with animals reared by low-LG mothers. The effects of reduced maternal care on cognitive function are reversed with peripubertal environmental enrichment; however, the neural mechanisms mediating this effect are not known. In these studies we exposed the offspring of high- and low-LG mothers to environmental enrichment from days 22 to 70 of life, and measured the expression of genes encoding for glutamate receptor subunits and synaptophysin expression as a measure of synaptic density. Environmental enrichment reversed the effects of maternal care on synaptic density and this effect was, in turn, associated with a reversal of the effect of maternal care on the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor, as well as effects on (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits. Finally, direct infusion of an NR2B-specific NMIDA receptor antagonist into the hippocampus eliminated the effects of maternal care on spatial learning/memory in the Morris water maze. These findings suggest that: (1) the effects of maternal care are mediated by changes in NR2B gene expression; and (2) that environmental enrichment reverses the effects of reduced maternal care through the same genomic target, the NR2B gene, and possibly effects on other subunits of the NMIDA and AMPA receptors.

An analysis of their VIth nucleus neurons and lateral rectus muscles revealed the following. Twenty-two percent of the large neurons (approximate to30 mum in diameter), on average, were missing and extensive neuropil disruption and gliosis was evident in the experimental side abducens nuclei as compared with the control side in each animal. While the lateral rectus muscles showed small, but inconsistent, changes in total fiber number, the muscle fiber diameters were altered, leading to a more homogenous muscle and making the typical orbital and global subdivisions of the muscle less distinct. Eye movement records from before and after the electrophysiological studies were comparable. We discuss how the complex architecture of the extraocular muscles as well as the possibility of polyneuronal innervation of single muscle fibers could explain our results.

In the present study, we investigated the contextual modulation of synchronization to random dot patterns. Coherent motion of random dots evoked well synchronized responses in area 17 of anaesthetized cats when the stimulus was presented in the compound receptive field of recorded sites. Gradually changing the directional coherence of random dots in the surround while maintaining fully coherent motion of the stimulus in the receptive field significantly suppressed synchronization of neuronal activity for some stimulus conditions. However, usually one or two peaks of increased synchronization were found in the surround coherence tuning curves with low (8-12%) and/or moderate (25-50%) coherence in the surround. At the population level, synchronization was significantly depressed with incoherent motion in the receptive field and when both the surround and the receptive field were jointly stimulated with 0% coherence. The intriguing finding was the discovery of two distinct groups of cells with opposite synchronization changes dependent on the presence or absence of significant synchronization in their spontaneous activity. The latter group of neurons showed peaks of increased synchronization with lower surround coherence, thus probably being more sensitive to the direction of the surround motion. Overall, our findings support the notion that binding of stimulus properties can be achieved by synchronized activity of cortical cells. However, our findings go further than the original hypothesis of feature binding by synchrony to show that synchronization of cortical activity may be directly related to the decision making processes, which in turn are related to the threshold of perception of coherent motion.

Here we show that exposure to a 2-week escalating-dose regimen of amphetamine prevents behavioral asymmetries of forelimb use and spontaneous (drug-independent) turning behavior following unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway made 7-14 days after termination of amphetamine treatment (Experiments 1-3). Exposure to three nonescalating injections of amphetamine 7 days before 6-OHDA lesions had no effect (Experiment 2). Prelesion amphetamine treatment led to normalization of basal extracellular levels of striatal DA as measured by microdialysis on days 11-14 and 25-28 after lesioning (Experiment 3). However, there were no significant differences between treatment groups in postmortem tissue levels of DA and its metabolites, indicating a dissociation between the DA depletion and the extracellular levels of DA as measured by microdialysis. Finally, rats exposed to the escalating amphetamine regimen had reduced lesion-induced loss of TH-IR cells in the ipsilateral DA cell body regions (Experiment 3). Thus, prelesion exposure to the escalating doses of amphetamine may render the cells resistant to the consequences of damage after subsequent 6-OHDA lesions, possibly by accelerating the development of compensatory changes in the DA neurons that typically accompany behavioral recovery. The potential role of amphetamine-induced endogenous neurotrophic factors in the behavioral sparing and normalization of basal extracellular DA levels observed after subsequent 6-OHDA lesions is discussed.

The ability of INGAP peptide in vitro to enhance nerve growth from sensory ganglia suggests its potential utility in peripheral nerve disorders. In this study, INGAP peptide was administered alone or in combination with insulin to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice exhibiting signs of peripheral neuropathy. Following a 2-wk treatment period, thermal hypoalgesia in diabetic mice was significantly improved in groups that received INGAP peptide, without development of hyperalgesia. Explanted dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from these groups showed enhanced nerve outgrowth and evidence of increased mitochondrial activity. Western blotting experiments revealed attenuation of neurofilament hyperphosphorylation, up-regulation of alpha-tubulin and actin, and increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 in DRG. These findings suggest that INGAP peptide can activate some of the signaling pathways implicated in nerve regeneration in sensory ganglia, thereby providing a means of improvement of nociceptive dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system.

A cross-sectional study with 24 subjects was carried out to examine upper extremity aptitudes in ARSACS by comparing scores between two age groups (<40 and greater than or equal to40) and with reference values. Upper extremity aptitude measures included coordination, gross and fine dexterity, upper extremity strength, muscle tone, kinaesthetic sensitivity and global upper extremity performance. Functional aptitudes were evaluated with part of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and social participation was measured with the Assessment of Life Habits. Data showed significant differences between younger and older participants for coordination, gross and fine finger dexterity, pinch strength and global performance. Even the younger group had lower scores when compared with reference values. Functional aptitudes and social participation also showed differences between the two groups but the younger group had near normal performance as compared with reference values. This study demonstrated that upper extremity aptitudes related to coordination are affected early in the course of the disease. Functional independence and social participation showed a decrease performance later on and a high level of variability. (C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

Most retinal disease genes are preferentially expressed in photoreceptors, the light-sensitive cells involved in phototransduction. In addition, some of the genes linked to retinal diseases are essential for normal retinal development. The goal of this study was to identify new transcripts enriched in photoreceptors involved in retinal development or diseases. METHODS. To isolate uncharacterized retinal transcripts, the bioinformatic method Digital Differential Display (DDD) was used. RNA in situ hybridization was used to characterize gene-expression patterns. RESULTS. Twenty-seven mouse ESTs highly represented in retinal libraries were identified. Eight ESTs were predominantly expressed in photoreceptors and/or in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), whereas transcripts for other ESTs were detected more ubiquitously in the retinal cells or abundantly in ganglion cells and/or the inner nuclear layer. Mapping of the corresponding human orthologues of the photoreceptor/RPE enriched genes revealed that two of them are candidate disease genes for retinitis pigmentosa, loci RP22 and RP28. Both of these are predominantly expressed in rod photoreceptors. The candidate RP22 gene codes for a putative transmembrane protein showing homology to Cln8 ( ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal 8), in which gene mutations are associated with photoreceptors degeneration in mice. Also identified were two genes expressed in photoreceptors that are candidate disease genes for recessive Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 3 (BBS3) and recessive ataxia with RP (AXPC1). CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates how bioinformatic analysis can be used to identify novel tissue-specific genes relevant to development and diseases.

The past decade has witnessed an explosion of research that has begun to unravel the condition at its various levels: from the genetic and brain levels to the cognitive level, and then to the environmental and behavioural levels. Our aim in this review is to attempt to integrate some of the extensive body of knowledge to move the research a step closer to understanding how the dynamics of atypical development can influence the specific cognitive and behavioural end-states frequently observed in children and adolescents with fragile X syndrome. Methods: We conducted a review of the current neuropsychological. and neuropsychiatric approaches that have attempted to delineate the pattern of 'spared' and 'impaired' functions associated with the phenotype. Results: The profile of findings suggests that fragile X syndrome should not be viewed merely as a catalogue of spared and impaired 'Cognitive functions or modules. Instead, there appears to be a process of almost gradual modularisation whereby cognitive mechanisms become domain specific as a function of development itself (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992). The results of a decade of intense research point towards an early weakness in one or more components of executive control rather than single, static higher-level deficits (e.g., spatial cognition, speech processing). This weakness affects both the development of more complex functions and current performance. Conclusions: The prevailing tendency to interpret developmental disorders in terms of fixed damage to distinct modular functions needs to be reconsidered. We offer this review as an example of an alternative approach, attempting to identify an initial deficit and its consequences for the course of development. Through better definition of the cognitive and behavioural. phenotype, in combination with current progress in brain imaging techniques and molecular studies, the next decade should continue to hold exciting promise for fragile X syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

One proposition has been that dominant physical characteristics of objects ( structure, motility) are determining factors. A positron emission tomography experiment using the (H2O)-O-15 bolus method was performed to test this hypothesis by contrasting activation for concrete and abstract concepts. Unlike previous studies that considered this question, the task required explicit word meaning judgments, and blocks of trials were designed to be of equal difficulty for the two word classes. The task required elderly participants to read aloud the pair of words that was closer in meaning (e.g., spade-shovel vs. spade-carpet). Subtraction analyses that compared the semantic judgment tasks with a baseline condition indicated that both abstract and concrete concepts activated the left lateral temporal cortex. A direct comparison of abstract versus concrete scans indicated differences in the lateralization of fusiform activation. We conclude that although concreteness might be a critical factor in the fusiform cortex, it is not dominant in the lateral temporal cortex. A multistudy overview suggests that tasks that focus on one concept per trial activate areas posterior to y=-40, whereas those that invoke several concepts, as in the present study, activate areas anterior to this. Increased processing complexity may proceed in a posterior anterior direction in the lateral temporal cortex.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Pediatric trauma center. Participants: Thirty-eight children aged 7 to 16 years in each group. Children with mTBI had a mean Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14.8 and were considered normal on a neurological assessment carried out at the time of hospital discharge. Noninjured children were friends of those with mTBI. Intervention: Assessments of response time were conducted at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after mTBI and at corresponding time intervals for the control children. Main Outcome Measures: The response speed subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP); reaction and movement time for upper and lower extremities, for simple, choice, and reversed choice response time paradigms. Results: Over the assessment period, children with mTBI performed worse than the control group only on the response speed subtest of the BOTMP. The mTBI children however tended to have slower movement times 1 week postinjury for the reversed choice response time paradigm for the lower extremities.

The retention of long-term facilitation is blocked by rapamycin, an inhibitor of a specific translational pathway. One possible rapamycin-sensitive target is the increased translation of 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs. These transcripts encode components of the translational machinery and have been proposed to be important for retention of long-term facilitation. We have cloned the 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine mRNA encoding eukaryotic elongation factor 2 and shown that serotonin increased its translation in synaptosomes. Another possible rapamycin-sensitive target is the inactivation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2, blocking translational elongation. Serotonin application decreased eukaryotic elongation factor 2 phosphorylation in synaptosomes and in isolated neurites, and this was blocked by rapamycin. We propose a role for the rapamycin-sensitive pathway in neurons. Stimulation blocks translation by inducing calcium entry and phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2. This block is reversed through activation of the rapamycin-sensitive system and dephosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2.

A visual primed lexical decision experiment was employed to probe the role of aspect, semantic transparency, and root status (free vs. bound) in the recognition patterns obtained. Controls' results showed aspect and transparency effects. The patient demonstrated facilitation for verb forms featuring bound roots, while showing inhibition on transparent forms with free-standing roots, pointing to difficulties with decomposition, but not with accessing stored forms. These results suggest that the patient had a problem at the level of morphological decomposition-based mechanisms. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In addition, the predictability of the length of coma from the selected anatomical volumes was examined. Method: High spatial resolution T1 weighted MRI scans of the brain (1 mm(3)) and neuropsychological evaluations with standardised tests were performed at least 3 months after trauma in 19 patients. Results: In comparison with control subjects matched in terms of gender and age, volume reduction in the hippocampus, fornix, and corpus callosum of the nmTBI patients was quantitatively significant. The length of coma correlated with the volume reduction in the corpus callosum. Immediate free recall of word lists correlated with the volume of the fornix and the corpus callosum. Delayed recall of word lists and immediate recall of the Rey figure both correlated with the volume of the fornix. Delayed recall of the Rey figure correlated with the volume of the fornix and the right hippocampus. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that in severe nmTBI without obvious neuroradiological lesions there is a clear hippocampal, fornix, and callosal volume reduction. The length of coma predicts the callosal volume reduction, which could be considered a marker of the severity of axonal loss. A few memory test scores correlated with the volumes of the selected anatomical structures. This relationship with memory performance may reflect the diffuse nature of the damage, leading to the disruption of neural circuits at multiple levels and the progressive neural degeneration occurring in TBI.

Using a murine model of focal cerebral ischemia, we found no evidence for induction of IFNgamma mRNA after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. In addition, we found that mice deficient in IFNgamma or IFNgamma receptors developed neocortical infarcts similar in size to those in wild type. In contrast, MBP promoter-IFN-gamma-transgenic mice consistently developed significantly larger infarcts than non-transgenic mice. Because IFNgamma is a potent activator of microglia-macrophages, we investigated the involvement of microglial-macrophage-derived TNT in the larger infarcts. Numbers of TNF mRNA-expressing microglia-macrophages and levels of TNF mRNA and TNF in IFNgamma-transgenic and non-transgenic mice were similar. Furthermore, the ischemic brain damage in IFNgamma-transgenic mice was unaffected by recombinant soluble TNF receptor 1. Taken together, the data argues against a role for IFNgamma in cerebral ischemia under normal conditions. However, when present, IFNgamma significantly exacerbates ischemia-induced brain damage by mechanisms that appear to be independent of TNF or synergistic neurotoxic interactions of IFNgamma and TNF. Irrespective of the mechanism(s) involved, this enhancing effect of IFNgamma on ischemia-induced neurotoxicity may need to be considered in diseases where immune IFNgamma is involved, such as multiple sclerosis.

To understand the neural mechanisms underlying such coordination, tonic protraction/retraction of one shoulder or tonic flexion/extension of one elbow was applied during fictive locomotion in high decerebrate and paralyzed cats. We studied bilateral changes in the timing and amplitude characteristics of electroneurographic (ENG) muscle nerve bursts of cleidobrachialis (ClB, elbow flexor and shoulder protractor) and the two heads of triceps (long, TriLo, elbow extensor and shoulder retractor and lateral, TriLa, elbow extensor). Perturbations induced bilateral changes in amplitude and timing of ENG bursts that were anchored on certain critical points in the cycle. These critical points could correspond to morphological characteristics within the bursts or to bilateral onsets or offsets of ENG bursts. For instance, in response to shoulder and elbow perturbations, burst changes occur in relation to a fixed point, labeled point C, occurring at about mid-extensor burst and corresponding to a simultaneous abrupt increase in TriLa amplitude and a decrease in amplitude of contralateral ClB. At a point labeled B, corresponding to about mid-flexor burst, ClB amplitude increases above control with elbow extension or starts decreasing with shoulder protraction. Although cycle reorganization is specific for each type of tonic perturbation, a common feature is that the changes in burst duration are achieved through discrete shifts between consecutive critical points. It is postulated that coordination may be based on a discrete temporal cycle structure along which critical points delimiting burst components are shifted.

J	Saltiel, P; Rossignol, S				Saltiel, P; Rossignol, S			Critical points in the forelimb fictive locomotor cycle and motor coordination: Effects of phasic retractions and protractions of the shoulder in the cat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							GROUP-I AFFERENTS; HINDLIMB FLEXOR; NEURAL CONTROL; WALKING CATS; STEP CYCLE; DECEREBRATE; STIMULATION; MOTONEURONS; GENERATION; MODULATION	This study investigates the responses to phasic shoulder retractions or protractions given at different times in the fictive locomotor cycle of the forelimbs of decerebrate cats. Generally, the responses in flexor and extensor muscles acting at the shoulder or elbow were bilaterally coordinated according to a negative feedback scheme. Perturbations in the direction of the movements that would have taken place if the animal had not been paralyzed tended to shorten the duration of the burst of activity of the muscles active during that phase and vice versa in the opposite phase. Changes in response patterns took place around critical points corresponding to the critical points B-D described in the companion paper using tonic perturbations of the limb. Past point C, at 58% of the ipsilateral extensor burst, protractions no longer prolonged the burst and no longer delayed onset of the contralateral extensor. At point B, occurring at 41% of the contralateral extensor burst, ipsilateral protractions maximally shortened the ipsilateral flexor phase, advancing ipsilateral extensor onset (point D) to point C of the contralateral extensor burst. During a critical period from the end of the ipsilateral flexor (point D) until the contralateral flexor onset, retractions elicited two alternative responses. Either the contralateral extensor activity was abolished and the contralateral flexor turned on, or it persisted for another cycle. We argue that the critical points found here correspond to critical biomechanical events in real locomotion and may underlie a phase-dependent motor coordination.

Under muscarinic influence, these neurons also develop changes in excitability that result in activity-dependent induction of delayed firing and bursting activity. To identify the membrane processes underlying these phenomena, we examined whether I-NCM may undergo activity-dependent regulation. Our voltage-clamp experiments revealed that appropriate depolarizing protocols increased the basal level of inward current activated during muscarinic stimulation and suggested that this effect was due to I-NCM upregulation. In the presence of low buffering for intracellular Ca2+, this upregulation was transient, and its decay could be followed by a phase of I-NCM downregulation. Both up- and downregulation were elicited by depolarizing stimuli able to activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC); both were sensitive to increasing concentrations of intracellular Ca2+-chelating agents with downregulation being abolished at lower Ca2+-buffering capacities; both were reduced or suppressed by VGCC block or in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. These data indicate that relatively small increases in [Ca2+](i) driven by firing activity can induce upregulation of a basal muscarinic depolarizing-current level, whereas more pronounced [Ca2+](i) elevations can result in I-NCM downregulation. We propose that the interaction of activity-dependent positive and negative feedback mechanisms on I-NCM allows entorhinal cortex layer II neurons to exhibit emergent properties, such as delayed firing and enhanced or suppressed responses to repeated stimuli, that may be of importance in the memory functions of the temporal lobe and in the pathophysiology of epilepsy.

The sAHP was isolated from other afterpotentials by blocking the depolarizing afterpotential (DAP) with Cs+ and the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) with apamin. The sAHP amplitude increased logarithmically with activity (similar to3 mV per e-fold increase in number of impulses) and, when firing stopped, decayed exponentially with a time constant of 2 sec. The sAHP was associated with increased membrane conductance, and its amplitude varied linearly with voltage, reversing at the K+ equilibrium potential. The sAHP was blocked by Cd2+ but not by charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin, blockers of intermediate- and big-conductance-type Ca2+-dependent K+ (K-Ca) channels. The sAHP was reversibly inhibited by muscarine, an effect antagonized by atropine, indicating involvement of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Muscarine did not affect Ca2+-dependent features of action potentials, DAPs, or the mAHP in MNCs, indicating selective modulation of K-Ca channels causing the sAHP. Muscarinic inhibition of the sAHP enhanced plateau potentials and increased the mean firing rate and duration of afterdischarges that followed spike trains evoked from voltages near threshold. Similarly, the frequency and duration of the spontaneous phasic bursts that characterize physiologically activated vasopressin-releasing MNCs were enhanced by muscarine. MNCs thus express apamin- and voltage-insensitive K-Ca channels that mediate an sAHP. The activity dependence and kinetics of the sAHP cause it to mask DAPs in a manner that attenuates the amplitude of plateau potentials. Muscarinic inhibition of the sAHP provides an effective mechanism for promoting phasic firing in MNCs.

Netrin-1 is expressed at similar levels in the adult rat spinal cord and the embryonic CNS, suggesting that it contributes to adult CNS function. Here we show that the netrin receptors dcc, neogenin, unc5h1, unc5h2, and unc5h3 are also expressed in the adult rat spinal cord. Lower levels of DCC and neogenin were detected in the adult relative to the embryonic CNS. Conversely, the adult spinal cord contains increased levels of UNC-5 homologues in comparison with the embryo. Multiple mRNA transcripts detected by Northern blot analysis suggested that netrin receptors might be encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs. We have identified a novel alternatively spliced mRNA encoding UNC5H1, UNC5H1DeltaTSP1, which lacks the first of the two extracellular thrombospondin domains. This novel splice variant is the major transcript detected in the early embryonic CNS, although both splice variants are expressed in the adult. Previously identified alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding DCC and neogenin were also detected. Dcc, neogenin, unc5h1, unc5h2, and unc5h3 are expressed by subsets of neurons. Robust expression of unc5h2 was found in glia. These findings suggest that unc-5 homologues constitute a major mode of netrin-1 signal transduction in the adult spinal cord and may be involved in phenomena analogous to axon repulsion, such as inhibiting process extension and collateral sprouting.

In some cases diagnosis is far from easy. Common causes of orofacial neuropathic pain are reviewed here, with a focus on the 2 most common: postherpetic neuralgia and posttraumatic painful peripheral neuropathy. In addition, the discussion includes idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), a neuropathic pain syndrome that is nearly unique to the trigeminal distribution (very rarely, it has also been reported in the glossopharyngeal region). Brief summaries of major research problems and successes are also provided.

Mechanism-based discovery underlies key approaches toward reduction of peripheral and central hyper-excitability. These include a number of poorly validated molecular targets, such as ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, purinergic receptors, and chemokine receptors, as well as downstream regulators of protein phosphorylation. Improvement in translating these approaches into the development of drugs for use in the pain clinic remains a significant but surmountable challenge.

The research described here focuses on the reciprocal nature of this dyad in rodents and humans, with respect to the regulation of responsiveness to stress in both mother and offspring. Dietary influences are critical not only to regulate infant growth but also to modulate the response of the neuroendocrine system to stress and, possibly, to influence some aspects of brain development. In particular, we discuss the role of leptin, a protein produced in the adipose tissue and present in maternal milk, that reduces responses to stress in the infant. We suggest that leptin acts on both central (hypothalamus and hippocampus) and peripheral (pituitary, adrenal gland) targets in the infant to reduce exposure to glucocorticoids and enhance hippocampal development during a sensitive period of brain development. There is also evidence to support the reverse regulatory influence, in which maternal state is profoundly affected by stimulation from the young. During the period of lactation, mothers exhibit lower neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to several types of stressors, except possibly those representing a threat to the infant. This ability to "filter" relevant from irrelevant stimuli while caring for their young might be viewed as adaptive for the mother-infant dyad, and the inability to filter adequately stressful stimuli could at least in part be associated with the development of postpartum depression.

This has led to the hypothesis that the disorder is characterized by abnormality of procedural memory. However, evidence for either procedural or declarative memory disturbance has been mixed, and few Studies have directly assessed both of these forms of memory in the same patient group. In the present study, we assessed encoding and retrieval in declarative memory using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), and procedural memory using the Pursuit Rotor Task, in 27 adults with OCD and 29 matched healthy controls. Groups did not differ with respect to salient demographic characteristics or memory on the RAVLT. In contrast, patients with OCD performed significantly better than controls during the early, but not later trial blocks of the Pursuit Rotor Task. This pattern of results indicates intact encoding and retrieval in declarative memory, but abnormally enhanced procedural memory during the early course of learning in OCD. These findings may be consistent with striatal overactivation observed in neuroimaging studies of OCD, as well as the prominent role of the striatum during early stages of procedural memory.

Isoforms expressing either two or four alternatively spliced Ig-like domains in mice have been found in a number of epithelial, endothelial, or hematopoietic tissues. CEACAM1a functions as an intercellular adhesion molecule, an angiogenic factor, and a tumor cell growth inhibitor. Moreover, the mouse and human CEACAM1a proteins are targets of viral or bacterial pathogens, respectively, including the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis, as well as Moraxella catarrhalis in humans. We have shown that targeted disruption of the Ceacam1a (MHVR) gene resulting in a partial ablation of the protein in mice (p/p mice) led to reduced susceptibility to MHV-A59 infection of the modified mice in the BALB/c background. We have now engineered and produced a Ceacam1a(-/-) mouse that exhibits complete ablation of the CEACAM1a protein in every tissue where it is normally expressed. We report that 3-week-old Ceacam1a(-/-) mice in the C57BL/6 genetic background are fully resistant to MHV-A59 infection by both intranasal and intracerebral routes. Whereas virus-inoculated wildtype +/+ C57BL/6 mice showed profound liver damage and spinal cord demyelination under these conditions, Ceacam1a(-/-) mice displayed normal livers and spinal cords. Virus was recovered from liver and spinal cord tissues of +/+ mice but not of -/- mice. These results indicate that CEACAM1a is the sole receptor for MHV-A59 in both liver and brain and that its deletion from the mouse renders the mouse completely resistant to infection by this virus.

These descriptors, which have been introduced more than a decade ago, are invariant relatively to rotations, translations and scale and can be computed for any topology. A rapid insight into the derivation of these invariants is proposed first. Then, their potential to characterize shapes is shown from a principal component analysis of the 12 first invariants computed for 12 different deep brain structures manually drawn for 7 different brains. Finally, these invariants are used to find some correlates of handedness and sex among the shapes of 116 different cortical sulci automatically identified in each of 142 brains of the ICBM database.

A wide range of 2D surface and 3D image deformation algorithms have been developed, all of which involve design choices that are subject to debate. Moreover, most have numerical parameters whose value must be specified by the user. This paper proposes a principled method for evaluating design choices and choosing parameter values. This method can also be used to compare competing spatial normalization algorithms. We demonstrate the method through a performance analysis of a nonaffine registration algorithm for 3D images and a registration algorithm for 2D cortical surfaces. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to detect chromatin changes at the Hoxd4 locus during neurogenesis in P19 cells and embryonic day 8.0 (E8.0) and E10.5 mouse embryos. During Hoxd4 induction in both systems, we observed that histone modifications typical of transcriptionally active chromatin occurred first at the 3' neural enhancer and then at the promoter. Moreover, the sequential distribution of histone modifications between E8.0 and E10.5 was consistent with a spreading of open chromatin, starting with the enhancer, followed by successively more 5' intervening sequences, and culminating at the promoter. Neither RNA polymerase II (Pol II) nor CBP associated with the inactive gene. During Hoxd4 induction, CBP and RNA Pol H were recruited first to the enhancer and then to the promoter. Whereas the CBP association was transient, RNA Pol II remained associated with both regulatory regions. Histone modification and transcription factor recruitment occurred in posterior, Hox-expressing embryonic tissues, but never in anterior tissues, where such genes are inactive. Together, our observations demonstrate that the direction of histone modifications at Hoxd4 mirrors colinear gene activation across Hox clusters and that the establishment of anterior and posterior compartments is accompanied by the imposition of distinct chromatin states.

Here, we provide direct and functional evidence that htt is involved in fast axonal trafficking in mammals. Moreover, expression of full-length mutant htt (mhtt) impairs vesicular and mitochondrial trafficking in mammalian neurons in vitro and in whole animals in vivo. Particularly, mitochondria become progressively immobilized and stop more frequently in neurons from transgenic animals. These defects occurred early in development prior to the onset of measurable neurological or mitochondrial abnormalities. Consistent with a progressive loss of function, wild-type htt, trafficking motors, and mitochondrial components were selectively sequestered by mhtt in human Huntington's disease-affected brain. Data provide a model for how loss of htt function causes toxicity; mhtt-mediated aggregation sequesters htt and components of trafficking machinery leading to loss of mitochondrial motility and eventual mitochondrial dysfunction.

We combined nonsense-mediated RNA decay microarrays(1) and array-based comparative genomic hybridization(2,3) for the genome-wide identification of genes with biallelic inactivation involving nonsense mutations and loss of the wild-type allele. This approach enabled us to identify previously unknown mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene EPHB2. The DU 145 prostate cancer cell line, originating from a brain metastasis, carries a truncating mutation of EPHB2 and a deletion of the remaining allele. Additional frameshift, splice site, missense and nonsense mutations are present in clinical prostate cancer samples. Transfection of DU 145 cells, which lack functional EphB2, with wild-type EPHB2 suppresses clonogenic growth. Taken together with studies indicating that EphB2 may have an essential role in cell migration and maintenance of normal tissue architecture, our findings suggest that mutational inactivation of EPHB2 may be important in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer.

Partial volume estimation, that is, the estimation of the amount of each tissue type within each voxel, has received considerable interest in recent years. Much of this work has been focused on the mixel model, a statistical model of PVE. We propose a novel trimmed minimum covariance determinant (TMCD) method for the estimation of the parameters of the mixel PVE model. In this method, each voxel is first labeled according to the most dominant tissue type. Voxels that are prone to PVE are removed from this labeled set, following which robust location estimators with high breakdown points are used to estimate the mean and the covariance of each tissue class. Comparisons between different methods for parameter estimation based on classified images as well as expectation-maximization-like (EM-like) procedure for simultaneous parameter and partial volume estimation are reported. The robust estimators based on a pruned classification as presented here are shown to perform well even if the initial classification is of poor quality. The results obtained are comparable to those obtained using the EM-like procedure, but require considerably less computation time. Segmentation results of real data based on partial volume estimation are also reported. In addition to considering the parameter estimation problem, we discuss' differences between different approximations to the complete mixel model. In summary, the proposed TMCD method allows for the accurate, robust, and efficient estimation of partial volume model parameters, which is crucial to a variety of brain MRI data analysis procedures such as the accurate estimation of tissue volumes and the accurate delineation of the cortical surface.

To standardize the Spanish version of the 7 Minute screening neurocognitive battery (7MS) in a population sample of elderly over 70 years. Methods. We examined 416 persons, living at home, participating in elderly the longitudinal study <<Aging in Leganes>>, aged 71 to 99 years old (mean age: 79 +/- 9.2 years; 51.7 % women; 10.6 illiterate, 25 % without formal education). In order to do so, we used an extensive clinical survey, general and neurological exam and extensive neuropsychological battery with several cognitive scales, attention, language, memory, visuomotor skill and reasoning tests, Jorm's IQCODE questionnaire, CES-D depression questionnaire and the 7MS including the Benton Orientation Test, Clock Drawing Test, Free and Cued Learning Test and Categorial Verbal Fluency. Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria but independently of the 7MS scores. Several methods to obtain the total score of the 7MS were analyzed and the normative parameters of the test were obtained in the subgroup of non-demented subjects. Results. The easiest and most efficient method to obtain the total score of the 7MS was the sum of the z-scores of the four subtests. We present the mean values, -1 and -1.5 standard deviations, range and percentiles of the partial and total scores of the 7MS stratified by age (71-75, 76-80, 81-85 and greater than or equal to 86 years) and education (less than primary education and primary education or greater) in the subgroup of non-demented subjects. Conclusions. The normative data of the 7MS obtained in a representative sample of the general elderly population support its rigorous use in the Spanish clinical setting.

In the present study, we used a transgenic mouse completely deprived of functional d5 receptor (d5-/-) to confirm the role and elucidate the possible function of the d5 receptor subtype on hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission. ACh release was measured using in vivo microdialysis in the mouse dorsal hippocampus of 4 months old homozygous ( d5-/-), heterozygous ( d5+/-), and the wild-type ( d5+/+) littermates. Using the no net flux technique, a significant reduction in basal hippocampal ACh level was found in the d5 -/- compared to d5+/- and d5+/+ mice. Moreover, the administration of SKF 38393, a D-1-like receptor agonist, systemically (2.0 and 10.0 mg/kg ip), or locally through the dialysis probe ( 10 and 50 muM), produced a dose-dependent enhancement of ACh release in the d5+/+, a moderate stimulation in the d5+/- but had no effect in the d5 -/- mice. Quantitative receptor autoradiography revealed significant increases in M-1-like but not in M-2-like muscarinic receptor binding sites in the hippocampal formation. These results confirm and extend the role of the d5 receptor in the modulation of hippocampal ACh release and provide evidence for long-term alteration of hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission resulting from the absence of the d5 receptors including chronically reduced ACh release and change in M-1-like receptor levels.

We have speculated that preferential occupancy may be clinically important for the purported actions of pindolol in accelerating the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this study, we have examined the preferential occupancy by pindolol of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, following three different pindolol regimes (10 mg single dose, 2.5 mg t.i.d., and 5 mg t.i.d., in 15 depressed patients on SSRIs. In addition, seven healthy volunteers were examined following a single 10 mg dose of pindolol. We found a preferential occupancy of 22.6 +/- 7.7% following a single dose of 10 mg of pindolol, in the healthy volunteers, which was attenuated in depressed patients on the same dose of pindolol to 2.9 +/- 10.8% ( Student's t = 3.94, df = 12, p = 0.002). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between the degree of preferential occupancy and the severity of depression as assessed by the Hamilton depression rating score ( HAM-D), Spearman's rho = - 0.728, N = 14, p = 0.003, in the depressed sample. A possible mechanism underlying preferential occupancy and the attenuation of this phenomenon in depressed patients on SSRIs may include changes in the proportion of high affinity 5-HT1A sites in the autoreceptor region of the midbrain raphe. Speculatively, the degree of preferential occupancy may serve as a surrogate marker for depression, or the pharmacological effects of antidepressants.

It has been proposed that oxidative stress and abnormal metal homeostasis contribute to death of motor neurons in this disease. Also, inability of motor neurons to upregulate protective proteins under stress may contribute to their preferential vulnerability to toxicity Metallothioneins (MT) are low molecular weight, metal-binding proteins with established antioxidant capabilities. This study investigated the ability of motor neurons to upregulate MT isoforms in response to expression of mutant SOD1(G93A) or exposure to other neurotoxicants, and the ability of MT-I gene transfer to protect motor neurons from these stresses. MT isoform-I and -II were expressed constitutively in astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells of dissociated spinal cord cultures, but not in motor neurons. MT-I/II was upregulated in astrocytes, but not motor neurons, following treatment with ZnCl2 or excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate. MT-III expression was restricted to neurons and was unaffected by treatment with ZnCl2, paraquat, or glutamate. Overexpression of MT-I in motor neurons by gene transfer reduced the toxicity of ZuCl(2) and paraquat, but failed to protect them against glutamate or SOD1(G93A). These data are evidence against metal-catalyzed, oxidative stress being the primary mechanisms of toxicity conferred by disease-causing mutations in SOD1. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Little is known about the effects of prenatal stress on intellectual and language development in humans because it is difficult to identify sufficiently large samples of pregnant women who have been exposed to an independent stressor. We took advantage of a natural disaster (January 1998 ice storm in Quebec, Canada) to determine the effect of the objective severity of pregnant women's stress exposure on general intellectual and language development of their children. Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores and parent-reported language abilities of 58 toddlers of mothers who were exposed to varying levels of prenatal stress were obtained at 2 y of age. The hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that the toddlers' birth weight and age at testing accounted for 12.0% and 14.8% of the variance in the Bayley MDI scores and in productive language abilities, respectively. More importantly, the level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for an additional 11.4% and 12.1% of the variance in the toddlers' Bayley MDI and productive language abilities and uniquely accounted for 17.3% of the variance of their receptive language abilities. The more severe the level of prenatal stress exposure, the poorer the toddlers' abilities. The level of prenatal stress exposure accounted for a Significant proportion of the variance in the three dependent variables above and beyond that already accounted for by non-ice storm-related factors. We suspect that high levels of prenatal stress exposure, particularly early in the pregnancy, may negatively affect the brain development of the fetus, reflected in the lower general intellectual and language abilities in the toddlers.

The target shared its constituent parts, the spatial organization of its parts, or both with the distractors displayed with it. Sharing of parts and sharing of spatial organization both negatively affected visual search performance, and these effects were strictly additive. These findings support theories of complex visual object perception that assume a parsing of the stimulus into its higher-order constituents (volumetric parts or visible surfaces). The additivity of the effects demonstrates that information on parts and information on spatial organization are processed independently in visual search.

In this transgenic rat model, there is central overexpression of prepro-NPY mRNA and NPY peptide in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and decreased Y, binding sites within the hippocampus. These molecular and neurochemical events led to altered anxiety profile and learning abilities in NPY-overexpressing rats. In the present study, anxiety and learning/memory related behaviors were examined in one-year-old NPY-transgenic rats in order to assess any behavioral changes that may have occurred during the aging process. As observed in 5-month-old overexpressing rats, aged NPY-transgenic animals are resistant to acute physical restraint stress measured by the elevated-plus maze and demonstrate anxiolytic-like activity in the open field. However, in contrast to data in young rats, there was no significant difference between aged wildtype and NPY-transgenic animals in relation to spatial and non-spatial memory as indicated by the (allo- and ego-centric) Morris water maze and object recognition test. It would thus appear that the anxiolytic-like profile observed in young NPY-overexpressing rats is maintained in older animals providing further evidence for a role for NPY in anxious behaviors. However, the cognitive deficits observed in young rats do not appear to occur in older animals suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms leading to a reversal of the learning deficits noted in younger animals. These results also provide additional evidence for the mechanistic dissociation between anxiety and cognition-related behaviors modulated by NPY. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of mutations in the NEU1 gene, the inherited deficiency of Neu1 in humans causes the severe multisystemic neurodegenerative disorder sialidosis. Galactosialidosis, a clinically similar disorder, is caused by the secondary Neu1 deficiency because of genetic defects in cathepsin A that form a complex with Neu1 and activate it. In this study we describe a novel lysosomal lumen sialidase encoded by the NEU4 gene on human chromosome 2. We demonstrate that Neu4 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has broad substrate specificity by being active against sialylated oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and gangliosides. In contrast to Neu1, Neu4 is targeted to lysosomes by the mannose 6-phospate receptor and does not require association with other proteins for enzymatic activity. Expression of Neu4 in the cells of sialidosis and galactosialidosis patients results in clearance of storage materials from lysosomes suggesting that Neu4 may be useful for developing new therapies for these conditions.

We have investigated this problem using a recently developed in vitro astrocyte model of TD. Measurement of cell volume using the 3-O-methylglucose uptake method revealed a dose-dependent swelling of astrocytes during exposure to TD conditions. Time course studies indicated a progressive volume increase up to a maximum of 93% above controls after 4 days of treatment. This swelling then partially resolved, and remained stable for up to 10 days following commencement of TD treatment. Measurement of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) levels showed a 44% loss after 10 days and a temporal profile consistent with an important role for this water channel protein in astrocyte cell volume changes during TD. Our findings of astrocyte swelling in TD are consistent with previous reports of focal brain edema in cases of WE, and indicate that AQP-4 may be an important target for ameliorating some of the clinical problems associated with this disorder.

Radioimmunoassay (RIA) of dissected hypothalamic tissue revealed that ANP rose from 167 +/- 50 pg/mg protein immediately after birth to 516 +/- 78 pg/mg protein in the next 24 h and to 928 +/- 100 pg/mg protein by postnatal day (PD) 5. A second increment of ANP in the hypothalamus was noted between PD 10 and PD 20 (from 780 +/- 110 to 2650 +/- 136 pg/mg protein). These changes were not gender-related and consistent with a rise of ANP mRNA. Diethylstilbestrol treatment of immature rats increased hypothalamic ANP concentration from 2.11 +/- 0.24 to 2.97 +/- 0.44 ng/mg protein (P < 0.001), but equine chorionic gonadotropin had no effect, indicating that estrogen is a potential stimulus of ANP only at supra-physiological concentrations. CNP, the most abundant natriuretic peptide in the brain, gradually increased in the developing hypothalamus, but did not plateau at PD 20. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of ANP receptor mRNA demonstrated higher guanylyl cyclase (GC) A, no changes in GCB, and lower C-receptor levels in adult compared to newborn rats. In conclusion, we have shown that hypothalamic ANP undergoes a dramatic rise after birth, and progresses further until the 3rd postnatal week. ANP and CNP changes in the developing hypothalamus can influence brain maturation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Northern blots showed that the LRPPRC mRNA levels seen in skeletal muscle > heart > placenta > kidney > liver > lung = brain were proportionally almost opposite in strength to the severity of the enzymic cytochrome oxidase defect. The levels of COX (cytochrome c oxidase) I and COX III mRNA visible on Northern blots were reduced in LSFC patients due to the common (A354V, Ala(354) --> Val) founder mutation. The amount of LRPPRC protein found in both fibroblast and liver mitochondria from LSFC patients was consistently reduced to < 30 % of control levels. Import of [S-35]methionine LRPPRC into rat liver mitochondria was slower for the mutant (A354V) protein. A titre of LRPPRC protein was also found in nuclear fractions that could not be easily accounted for by mitochondrial contamination. [S-35]Methionine labelling of mitochondrial translation products showed that the translation of COX I, and perhaps COX III, was specifically reduced in the presence of the mutation. These results suggest that the gene product of LRPPRC, like PET 309p, has a role in the translation or stability of the mRNA for mitochondrially encoded COX subunits. A more diffuse distribution of LRPPRC in LSFC cells compared with controls was evident when viewed by immunofluorescence microscopy, with less LRPPRC present in peripheral mitochondria.

Glial cells, called perisynaptic Schwann cells, surround nerve terminals at the NMJ. Transmitter release induced by repetitive nerve stimulation, elicit a frequency-dependent activation of G-protein-coupled receptors on perisynaptic Schwann cells and the release of calcium from internal stores. In return, perisynaptic Schwann cells modulate synaptic activity during and following high-frequency stimulation through short-term plasticity. In the present review, we discuss evidence of glial involvement in the short-term plasticity at the NMJ and the potential impact of such modulation on synaptic efficacy. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Herniation of a calcified C3-C4 disc into the left foramen transversarium in a child is reported. Objective. To discuss the natural history and management of a calcified disc herniation into the foramen transversarium. Summary of Background Data. Cervical disc calcification in children usually follows a benign course. Herniation of the calcified disc into the spinal canal has already been described. However, herniation into the foramen transversarium has never been reported. Methods. An 8-year-old girl presented with progressive neck pain and torticollis. Her neurologic examination was normal. She was treated using a head halter traction, analgesics, and muscle relaxants for 3 days, followed by the use of a soft cervical collar for 2 weeks. Results. Computed tomography scan showed a calcified C3-C4 disc with herniation into the C3 left foramen transversarium. Her symptoms subsided and she rapidly regained full range of motion of her neck after 3 days of conservative treatment. Magnetic resonance angiography done after 2 months did not show any residual compression of the left vertebral artery. After 3 months, the herniation had completely disappeared, whereas only a small central calcification remained in the C3-C4 disc space. Conclusion. The natural history of cervical disc calcification is usually benign. A computed tomography scan can be performed for patients in whom a calcified disc herniation is suspected on the plain films. In this case of herniation into the foramen transversarium, magnetic resonance angiography was useful to evaluate the integrity of the vertebral arteries. Spontaneous resolution of the herniated disc and return to normal function can be expected with conservative treatment.

We report here that this deacetylase is unusually unstable, with a half-life of less than 8 h. Consistent with the instability of HDAC4 protein, its mRNA was also highly unstable ( with a half-life of less than 4 h). The degradation of HDAC4 could be accelerated by exposure of cells to ultraviolet irradiation. HDAC4 degradation was not dependent on proteasome or CRM1-mediated export activity but instead was caspase-dependent and was detectable in diverse human cancer lines. Of two potential caspase consensus motifs in HDAC4, both lying within a region containing proline-,glutamic acid-, serine, and threonine-rich ( PEST) sequences, we identified, by site-directed mutagenesis, Asp-289 as the prime cleavage site. Notably, this residue is not conserved among other class IIa members, HDAC5, - 7, and - 9. Finally, the induced expression of caspase-cleavable HDAC4 led to markedly increased apoptosis. These results therefore unexpectedly link the regulation of HDAC4 protein stability to caspases, enzymes that are important for controlling cell death and differentiation.

ROS induce dissociation of cytochrome c from cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and cytochrome c may then be released via mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)dependent or MPT-independent mechanisms. We have developed peptide antioxidants that target the IMM, and we used them to investigate the role of ROS and MPT in cell death caused by t-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP) and 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP). The structural motif of these peptides centers on alternating aromatic and basic amino acid residues, with dimethyltyrosine providing scavenging properties. These peptide antioxidants are cell-permeable and concentrate 1000-fold in the IMM. They potently reduced intracellular ROS and cell death caused by tBHP in neuronal N(2)A cells (EC50 in nM range). They also decreased mitochondrial ROS production, inhibited MPT and swelling, and prevented cytochrome c release induced by Ca2+ in isolated mitochondria. In addition, they inhibited 3NP-induced MPT in isolated mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial depolarization in cells treated with 3NP. ROS and MPT have been implicated in myocardial stunning associated with reperfusion in ischemic hearts, and these peptide antioxidants potently improved contractile force in an ex vivo heart model. It is noteworthy that peptide analogs without dimethyltyrosine did not inhibit mitochondrial ROS generation or swelling and failed to prevent myocardial stunning. These results clearly demonstrate that overproduction of ROS underlies the cellular toxicity of tBHP and 3NP, and ROS mediate cytochrome c release via MPT. These IMM-targeted antioxidants may be very beneficial in the treatment of aging and diseases associated with oxidative stress.

Cloning of AMFR identified a seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor ubiquitin E3 ligase whose identity as AMFR was based on prior expression cloning with the 3F3A mAb that generated a truncated sequence. We show here that the gp78/AMFR gene product is indeed recognized by the 3F3A mAb. The FLAG-tagged AMFR immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody was recognized by the 3F3A mAb in Western blot analysis and cells transfected with AMFR exhibit increased labeling with the 3F3A mAb. The 3F3A mAb does not however recognize higher molecular weight isoforms of AMFR. 3F3A labeling colocalizes with tagged AMFR in a peripheral ER network but does not recognize FLAG- or GFP-tagged AMFR localized to a perinuclear ER domain that likely corresponds to misfolded forms of the protein retained in the ER. These data indicate that 3F3A antibody binding is highly specific for a subpopulation of AMFR localized to an ER subdomain. Coexpression of AMFR-GFP and a lumenal ER-targeted RFP presented extensive colocalization in living cells and AMFR-GFP is concentrated in a basal ER network morphologically similar to that labeled by the 3F3A mAb in fixed cells. The 3F3A anti-AMFR mAb therefore selectively recognizes a subpopulation of expressed AMFR localized to a subdomain of the ER. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J Biol Chem 1999, 274:23426-23436 and Zhang Y. Goodyer C, LeBlanc A: Selective and protracted apoptosis in human primary neurons microinjected with active caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8. J Neurosci 2000, 20:8384-8389). Here, we show with neoepitope antibodies that the p20 subunit of active caspase-6 increases twofold to threefold in the affected temporal and frontal cortex but not in the unaffected cerebellum of Alzheimer's disease brains and is present in neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and the neuritic plaques. Furthermore, a neoepitope antibody to caspase-6-cleaved Tau strongly detects intracellular tangles. extracellular tangles, pretangles, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques. Immunoreactivity with both antibodies in pretangles indicates that the caspase-6 is active early in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to the nuclear and cytosolic localization of active caspase-6 in apoptotic neurons of fetal and adult ischemic brains, the active caspase-6 in Alzheimer's disease brains is sequestered into the tangles or neurites. The localization of active caspase-6 may strongly jeopardize the structural integrity of the neuronal cytoskeletal system leading to inescapable neuronal dysfunction and eventual cell death in Alzheimer's disease neurons. Our results suggest that active caspase-6 is strongly implicated in human neuronal degeneration and apoptosis.

Its peripheral and central neurons are in constant communication with one another such that, for the most part, it behaves as a stochastic control system. Neurons distributed throughout this hierarchy interconnect via specific linkages such that each neuronal cell station is involved in temporally dependent cardio-cardiac reflexes that control overlapping, spatially organized cardiac regions. Its function depends primarily, but not exclusively, on inputs arising from afferent neurons transducing the cardiovascular milieu to directly or indirectly (via interconnecting neurons) modify cardiac motor neurons coordinating regional cardiac behavior. As the function of the whole is greater than that of its individual parts, stable cardiac control occurs most of the time in the absence of direct cause and effect. During altered cardiac status, its redundancy normally represents a stabilizing feature. However, in the presence of regional myocardial ischemia, components within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system undergo pathological change. That, along with any consequent remodeling of the cardiac neuronal hierarchy, alters its spatially and temporally organized reflexes such that populations of neurons, acting in isolation, may destabilize efferent neuronal control of regional cardiac electrical and/or mechanical events.

To further elucidate the mechanisms employed in depressing translation, we surveyed key eukaryotic initiation factors [eIF2, eIF4B, eIF4E, eIF4GI and -II, and 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), -2, and -3] for their availability and phosphorylation status in the livers of golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) across the hibernation cycle. Western blot analyses indicated only one significant locus for regulation of translational initiation in ground squirrel liver: control of eIF4E. We found seasonal variation in a potent regulator of eIF4E activity, 4E-BP1. Summer squirrels lack 4E-BP1 and apparently control eIF4E activity through direct phosphorylation. In winter, eIF4E is regulated through binding with 4E-BP1. During the euthermic periods that separate bouts of torpor (interbout arousal), 4E-BP1 is hyperphosphorylated to promote initiation. However, during torpor, 4E-BP1 is hypophosphorylated and cap-dependent initiation of translation is restricted. The regulation of cap-dependent initiation of translation may allow for the differential expression of proteins directed toward enhancing survivorship.

In this study we assessed the effect of moderately deep propofol sedation on the ICP of patients undergoing stereotactic brain tumor biopsy under regional anesthesia. Thirty patients were randomized into 2 groups to receive propofol titrated to a level of 2 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation Scale or no sedation. ICP was measured via the biopsy needle. Preoperative data were similar in both groups. During surgery, patients receiving propofol had a higher arterial Pco(2) (48 +/- 8 mm Hg versus 41 +/- 3 mm Hg; P = 0.005) (95% confidence interval, 43-53 mm Hg and 39-43 mm Hg, respectively), resulting in a lower arterial pH (P = 0.002) than patients in the no-sedation group. The median ICP (95% confidence interval) for both groups was similar-13 mm Hg (8.2-16.2 mm Hg) and 15 mm Hg (8.3-21.7 mm Hg)-for the propofol and no-sedation groups, respectively (P = 0.66). Cerebral perfusion pressure was lower in the propofol group (76 +/- 18 mm Hg versus 89 +/- 18 mm Hg; P = 0.003). Moderately deep propofol sedation does not result in a higher ICP than no sedation in patients undergoing stereotactic brain tumor biopsy. Further studies are needed to assess the effect on ICP of other sedative medications.

The NARC-1 gene, PCSK9, has been identified recently as the third locus implicated in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH). The 2 other known genes implicated in ADH encode the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein B. As an approach toward the elucidation of the physiological role(s) of NARC-1, we studied its transcriptional regulation. Methods and Results-Using quantitative RT-PCR, we assessed NARC-1 regulation under conditions known to regulate genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in HepG2 cells and in human primary hepatocytes. We found that NARC-1 expression was strongly induced by statins in a dose-dependent manner and that this induction was efficiently reversed by mevalonate. NARC-1 mRNA level was increased by cholesterol depletion but insensitive to liver X receptor activation. Human, mouse, and rat PCSK9 promoters contain 2 typical conserved motifs for cholesterol regulation: a sterol regulatory element (SRE) and an Sp1 site. Conclusions-PCSK9 regulation is typical of that of the genes implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. In vivo, PCSK9 is probably a target of SRE-binding protein (SREBP)-2.

We discuss how the P&S hypothesis shares different aspects of the weak central coherence account of autism from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Specifically, we believe that neither those persons with autism nor those with schizophrenia integrate visuo-perceptual information efficiently, resulting in incongruous internal representations of their external world. However, although NMDA-hypofunction may be responsible for perceptual impairments in schizophrenia and possibly autism, we suggest that it is highly unlikely that NMDA-hypofunction is specifically responsible for the autistic behavioral symptomology, as described by P&S in their target article.

We suggest that this model may also be applicable to non-pathological (or normal) aging given the compelling evidence of NMDA-receptor involvement during the aging process that results in age-related change in higher-level perceptual performance. Given that such deficits are present in other neurological disorders such as autism, an argument for a systematic assessment of perceptual functioning in these conditions may be posited.

To investigate which cognitive and affective features contribute most to responder/non-responder group separation during a switching trial with atypical antipsychotic. Design. A prospective open trial with an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine). Patients. One hundred and thirty-four patients meeting diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder began an 8-week open-label olanzapine treatment at a dose of 5 mg/day which was increased to 10 mg/day after one week. Interventions. Olanzapine during 8 weeks. Patients were considered as responders if their BPRS score decreased of at least 20% (n = 96) and non-responders if it did not (n = 38). Neuropsychological assessments were carried out at baseline, at four and at eight weeks. Results. Neurocognitive measures were analyzed for discriminate factors between responder and non-responder groups. A regression analysis was applied to explain the effects of depression on each cognitive variable. Depression was found to be a weak discriminant factor, however this finding could not firmly establish that depression is a potential factor in explaining deficits and improvements in cognition.

Moxonidine, an imidazoline antihypertensive compound that preferentially activates imidazoline receptors in brainstem rostroventrolateral medulla, suppresses sympathetic activation and reverses LVH. We have identified imidazoline receptors in the heart atria and ventricles, and shown that atrial I-1-receptors are up-regulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and ventricular I-1-receptors are up-regulated in hamster and human heart failure. Furthermore, cardiac I-1-receptor binding decreased after chronic in vivo exposure to moxonidine. These studies implied that cardiac I-1-receptors are involved in cardiovascular regulation. The presence of I-1-receptors in the heart, the primary site of production of natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac hormones implicated in blood pressure control and cardioprotection, led us to propose that ANP may be involved in the actions of moxonidine. In fact, acute iv administration of moxonidine (50 to 150 mug/rat) dose-dependently decreased blood pressure, stimulated diuresis and natriuresis and increased plasma ANP and its second messenger, cGMP. Chronic SHR treatment with moxonidine (0, 60 and 120 mug kg(-1) h(-1), sc for 4 weeks) dose-dependently decreased blood pressure, resulted in reversal of LVH and decreased ventricular interleukin 1beta concentration after 4 weeks of treatment. These effects were associated with a further increase in already elevated ANP and BNP synthesis and release (after 1 week), and normalization by 4 weeks. In conclusion, cardiac imidazoline receptors and natriuretic peptides may be involved in the acute and chronic effects of moxonidine.

J	Roy, JJ; Varin, F				Roy, JJ; Varin, F			Physicochemical properties of neuromuscular blocking agents and their impact on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						neuromuscular block, agents; pharmacokinetics, potency; protein, binding; solubility, lipid	ANESTHETIZED PATIENTS; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; MOLAR POTENCY; ONSET TIME; ATRACURIUM; SPEED; DRUGS; CISATRACURIUM; ROCURONIUM	Background. Among the factors influencing the onset of action of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), the potency (EC50) and the rate of equilibration between blood and the effect compartment (k(e0)) have been highlighted. Although these descriptors are intrinsically influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of the drug, the impact of lipid solubility, molecular weight and protein binding on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) descriptors has not been established for most NMBA. Methods. The octanol/phosphate buffer distribution coefficients (logD) of various NMBA (vecuronium, rocuronium, mivacurium isomers (cis-cis, cis-trans and trans-trans), doxacurium, cisatracurium, atracurium, succinylcholine) were determined. The free fraction for each drug was measured using an ultrafiltration technique. PK-PD descriptors were obtained from selected clinical studies. Correlations between physicochemical parameters (including molecular weight) and PK-PD descriptors were assessed by linear or multiple linear regression. Results. A wide range of log D (-4.15 for succinylcholine to 0.75 for vecuronium) and free fraction (from 31% for vecuronium to 80% for succinylcholine) is observed for NMBA. Molecular weight combined with either lipid solubility (r(2)=0.70; P=0.001) or free fraction (r(2)=0.84; P<0.001) were highly correlated with potency, while for k(e0) a greater degree of correlation was obtained when both lipid solubility and free fraction (r(2)=0.74; P=0.002) were included. Conclusions. The basic characteristics of NMBAs, namely, molecular weight, lipid solubility and protein binding, are strongly associated with the kinetics of the drug response.

This study examined the influence of neuromuscular blockade on the incidence and severity of pharyngolaryngeal discomfort after positive pressure ventilation using a LMA. Methods: 130 patients were included in this prospective, double-blind, randomized two-centre study, Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil and propofol and maintained using remifentanil and sevoflurane in 30% oxygen and 70% air. Patients were mechanically ventilated at 15 breaths(.)min(-1) with tidal volumes to maintain PETCO2 30-40 mmHg. Patients were randomly assigned to receive no neuromuscular blocking agent (NOBLOCK group) or cisatracurium prior to LMA insertion (BLOCK group). Prior to the end of surgery, morphine 3 to 5 mg iv were injected. The ease of insertion of the LMA, cuff pressure, and inspiratory pressure were recorded. Patients were asked immediately after two hours, and 24 hr after surgery to rate sore throat, dysphonia, or dysphagia as absent, minimal, moderate or severe. Continuous and categorical data were compared using t test and Chi-squared test, respectively. Results: 68 and 62 patients were randomized to the NOBLOCK and BLOCK groups, respectively. Successful insertion on first attempt were 89% and 92% in the NOBLOCK and BLOCK groups, respectively. Mean intracuff and inspiratory pressures were 85 +/- 35 mmHg and 13 +/- 3 mmHg for the NOBLOCK group, and 96 +/- 34 mmHg and 15 +/- 2 mmHg for the BLOCK group. The immediate, two and 24 hr postoperative incidences and severity of sore throat, dysphonia, and dysphagia did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion: Neuromuscular blockade does not influence the ease or rate of success of LMA insertion nor the incidence and severity of pharyngolaryngeal discomfort after positive pressure ventilation using a LMA.

Missense and splice site mutations in the TAU gene have been identified in approximately 15% of all frontotemporal dementia cases. In this study, we evaluated the involvement of mutations in the TAU gene in development of frontotemporal dementia phenotype in patients of French or English Canadian origins. Methods: Fourteen patients with frontotemporal dementia phenotype and 98 normal controls were recruited for the study. The TAU gene was screened by sequencing and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. Results: No mutations, except some new polymorphisms, were detected in the TAU gene of these patients. One polymorphism, however, may play a role in pathogenesis. Conclusion: Our results agree with previous work suggesting that mutations in this gene are not a frequent cause of the frontotemporal dementia phenotype in Canadian patients.

J	Massie, R				Massie, R			Charcot and Babinski: beyond a simple teacher-student relationship.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			French	Article								Jean-Martin Charcot (18251893) is now considered to be the father of clinical neurology in France. He trained a generation of eminent neurologists, among them Joseph Babinski, with whom he had a special relationship. Babinski was undoubtedly Charcot's favorite pupil and they enjoyed an excellent collaboration at la Salpetriere. Even though both men felt tremendous respect for each other, it is sad that this relationship may, in one instance, have been detrimental to Babinski. This is probably the reason why Bouchard denied him full professorship, a decision with eventual consequences for both men. In spite of this, the neurologist of Polish origin held his master in tremendous admiration, even as he pursued Charcot's research on hysteria after his death. Even though Babinski eventually contradicted his master on many fundamental issues, it did not affect his devotion to him. The relationship between the two men can be considered as more than a simple relationship between a teacher and his pupil and may be compared to a father-son relationship, which is a reminder of the original model of Hippocratic teaching.

Mechanisms controlling reflex modulation (e.g., phase- and task-dependent modulation, and reflex reversal) during leg movements have been ascribed to the activity of spinal central pattern generating (CPG) networks and peripheral feedback. Our working hypothesis has been that neural mechanisms (i.e., CPGs) controlling rhythmic movement are conserved between the human lumbar and cervical spinal cord. Thus reflex modulation during rhythmic arm movement should be similar to that for rhythmic leg movement. This hypothesis has been tested by studying the regulation of reflexes in arm muscles during rhythmic arm cycling and treadmill walking. This paper reviews recent studies that have revealed that reflexes in arm muscles show modulation within the movement cycle (e.g., phase-dependency and reflex reversal) and between static and rhythmic motor tasks (e.g., task-dependency). It is concluded that reflexes are modulated similarly during rhythmic movement of the upper and lower limbs, suggesting similar motor control mechanisms. One notable exception to this pattern is a failure of contralateral arm movement to modulate reflex amplitude, which contrasts directly with observations from the leg. Overall, the data support the hypothesis that CPG activity contributes to the neural control of rhythmic arm movement.

From the results obtained after lesions of the ventral/ventrolateral pathways or the dorsal/dorsolateral pathways, we conclude that with extensive but partial spinal lesions, cats can regain voluntary quadrupedal locomotion on a treadmill. Although tract-specific deficits remain after such lesions, intact descending tracts can compensate for the lesioned tracts and access the spinal network to generate voluntary locomotion. Such neuroplasticity of locomotor control mechanisms is also demonstrated after peripheral nerve lesions in cats with intact or lesioned spinal cords. Some models have shown that recovery from such peripheral nerve lesions probably involves changes at the supraspinal and spinal levels. In the case of somesthesic denervation of the hindpaws, we demonstrated that cats with a complete spinal section need some cutaneous inputs to walk with a plantigrade locomotion, and that even in this spinal state, cats can adapt their locomotion to partial cutaneous denervation. Altogether, these results suggest that there is significant plasticity in spinal and supraspinal locomotor controls to justify the beneficial effects of early proactive and sustained locomotor training after central (Rossignol and Barbeau 1995; Barbeau et al. 1998) or peripheral lesions.

We hypothesized that changes in EDA precede any change in blood pressure (BP) or cerebral blood velocity (CBV) observed at syncope. Data from 70 patients referred for recurrent syncope were retrospectively analyzed. 400Hz continuous waveforms were recorded of BP (Finapres), CBV (transcranial Doppler), expired CO2 (PCO2) and ECG at rest and during 80 head-up tilt (HUT). Two independent investigators determined the onset and termination of EDA in relation to syncope using the raw and a low pass filtered ECG trace. Of the 53 patients who experienced syncope during HUT, 33(62%) increased EDA 257 +/- 357 s prior to syncope that continued for 75 +/- 73 s following syncope. Seven patients (13%) had EDA only after syncope for 208 +/- 213s. In 13 patients (25%), EDA was not detectable. In most cases, EDA preceded any change in BP, PCO2 or CBV and persisted past the hemodynamic recovery following syncope. Although variable, EDA may be an objective correlate to the clinical observation that patients' symptoms precede any measurable change in cerebral perfusion. The actual relationship between EDA and symptoms of presyncope requires further investigation.

Experimental Design: As part of a Pediatric Oncology Group Phase I study, 120 mg/m(2) Of O(6)BG was administered i.v. over 1 h, before 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea administration in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors. Serial blood samples for plasma pharmacokinetic studies were obtained. Concentrations of O(6)BG and its active metabolite O-6-benzyl-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-O(6)BG) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. A pharmacokinetic model and additional first-order elimination rate constants for each compound were developed. Results: O(6)BG concentration versus time data were evaluated for 25 patients. The peak concentration of O(6)BG (mean +/- SD) was 11 +/- 4 muM, and the peak concentration of its active metabolite, 8-oxo-O(6)BG, was 35 +/- 10 muM. O(6)BG was rapidly eliminated with a half-life of 85 +/- 140 min, area under the curve of 795 +/- 320 muM (.) min and clearance of 760 +/- 400 ml/min/m(2). The area under the curve of 8-oxo-O(6)BG when extrapolated to infinity was 22,700 +/- 11,800 muM (.) min. The clearance and terminal half-life of 8-oxo-O(6)BG were 30 +/- 15 ml/min/m(2) and 360 +/- 220 min, respectively. Conclusions: There is rapid elimination of O(6)BG after i.v. administration over 1 h. In contrast, the terminal half-life for the active metabolite, 8-oxo-O(6)BG, is 4-fold longer. The pharmacokinetic parameters for O(6)BG and 8-oxo-O(6)BG are similar to those reported previously in adults.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - In the Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics (DIAD) study, 1,123 patients With type 2 diabetes, aged 50-75 years, with no known or suspected coronary artery disease, were randomly assigned to either stress testing and 5-year clinical follow-up or to follow-up only. The prevalence of ischemia in 522 patients randomized to stress testing was assessed by adenosine technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission-computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging. RESULTS - A total of 113 patients (22%) had silent ischemia, including 83 with regional myocardial perfusion abnormalities and 30 with normal perfusion but other abnormalities (i.e., adenosine-induced ST-segment depression, ventricular dilation, or rest ventricular dysfunction). Moderate or large perfusion defects were present in 33 patients. The Strongest predictors for abnormal tests were abnormal Valsalva (odds ratio [OR] 5.6), mate sex (2.5), and diabetes duration (5.2). Other traditional cardiac risk factors or inflammatory and prothrombotic markets were not predictive. Ischemic adenosine-induced ST-segment depression with normal perfusion (n = 21) was associated with women (OR 3.4). Selecting only patients who met American Diabetes Association guidelines would have failed to identify 41% of patients with silent ischemia. CONCLUSIONS - Silent myocardial ischemia occurs in greater than one in live asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes. Traditional and emerging cardiac risk factors were not associated with abnormal stress tests, although cardiac autonomic dysfunction was a strong predictor of ischemia.

Since this effect is limited to trials with relatively long reaction times (RTs), Hommel (1996b) proposed that if the response does not occur shortly after stimulus detection, then the spatial code of the stimulus can interfere with that of the response. A series of experiments is reported showing that (a) spatial compatibility in SRT to lateralized stimuli is not an alternative, but rather a complementary, explanation to interhemispheric transfer time (contrary to what Hommel surmised), and (b) the spatial compatibility component is essentially limited to the first trial after shifting response preparation from one-half of the visual fields to the other, suggesting a mechanism akin to an orienting response.

This increase influences cell survival, reactive gliosis and inflammatory responses. Since prior work has focused primarily on peripheral nerve and brain, little is known about the role of LIF in the spinal cord injury response. We address this issue by examining the effects of injury in the LIF knockout (KO) mouse, as well as using an adenoviral vector to over-express LIF in the spinal cord of adult mice. We find that LIF over-expression results in a dramatic rise in cell proliferation, primarily in microglia/macrophages. Astrocytes are not stimulated to proliferate but are activated by the elevated LIF. LIF over-expression also causes the development of severe hindlimb motor dysfunction, an effect mediated by the enhanced activation of microglia/macrophages, as inhibiting microglial activation with minocycline attenuates these motor deficits. Conversely, proliferation is significantly diminished and the microglial/macrophage response to spinal cord injury is much less in the LIF KO compared to wild type (WT). Thus, LIF is a potent pro-inflammatory factor in the adult spinal cord and represents a potential target for the manipulation of inflammatory reactions after spinal cord injury.

Because central and peripheral neurons, including intrinsic cardiac neurons located on the surface of the mammalian heart, express both BuChE and AChE, we studied spontaneously active intrinsic cardiac neurons in the pig as a model to assess the effects of inhibition of AChE compared to BuChE. Neuroanatomical experiments showed that some porcine intrinsic cardiac neurons expressed AChE and/or BuChE. Enzyme kinetic experiments with cholinesterase inhibitors, namely, donepezil, galantamine, (+/-) huperzine A, metrifortate, rivastigmine, and tetrahydroaminoacridine, demonstrated that these compounds differentially inhibited porcine AChE and BuChE. Donepezil and (+/-) huperzine A were better reversible inhibitors of AChE, and galantamine equally inhibited both the enzymes. Tetrahydroaminoacridine was a better reversible inhibitor of BuChE. Rivastigmine caused more rapid inactivation of BuChE as compared to AChE. Neurophysiological studies showed that acetylcholine and butyrylcholine increase or decrease the spontaneous activity of the intrinsic cardiac neurons. Donepezil, galantamine, (+/-) huperzine A, and tetrahydroaminoacridine changed spontaneous neuronal activity by about 30-35 impulses per minute, while rivastigmine changed it by approximately 100 impulses per minute. It is concluded that (i) inhibition of AChE and BuChE directly affects the porcine intrinsic cardiac nervous system, (ii) the intrinsic cardiac nervous system represents a suitable model for examining the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors on mammalian neurons in vivo, and (iii) the activity of intrinsic cardiac neurons may be affected by pharmacological agents that inhibit cholinesterases.

Isoprostanes (IsoPs) are bioactive products of lipid peroxidation abundantly generated during hypoxic-ischemic injuries. Because loss of oligodendrocytes (OLs) occurs early in PVL, we hypothesized that IsoPs could induce progenitor OL death. 15-E-2t-IsoP but not 15-F-2t-IsoP elicited a concentration-dependent death of progenitor OLs by oncosis and not by apoptosis, but exerted minimal effects on mature OLs. 15-E-2t-IsoP-induced cytotoxicity could not be explained by its conversion into cyclopentenones, because PGA(2) was hardly cytotoxic. On the other hand, thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) synthase inhibitor CGS12970 and cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen attenuated 15-E-2t-IsoP-induced cytotoxicity. Susceptibility of progenitor OLs was independent of TxA2 receptor (TP) expression, which was far less in progenitor than in mature OLs. However, TxA2 synthase was detected in precursor but not in mature OLs, and TxA2 mimetic U46619 induced hydroperoxides generation and progenitor OL death. The glutathione synthesis enhancer N-acetylcysteine prevented 15-E-2t-IsoP-induced progenitor cell death. Depletion of glutathione in mature OLs with buthionine sulfoximine rendered them susceptible to cytotoxicity of 15-E-2t-IsoP. These novel data implicate 15-E-2t-IsoP as a product of oxidative stress that may contribute in the genesis of PVL. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

GAL80 blocks GAL4 activity by binding to its transcriptional activation domain. We screened GAL80 enhancer-traps for repression of GAL4-induced green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the intact larval nervous system. We selected one line that repressed GFP in a large set of cholinergic neurons. This line was used to refine GFP expression from a set of over 200 neurons to a subset of 20 neurons in a preselected GAL4 line. Expression of tetanus neurotoxin, a potent blocker of neurotransmitter release, in these 20 neurons reproduced an aberrant larval turning behavior previously assigned to the parental set of 200 neurons. Our results suggest that targeted GAL80 expression could become a useful means of spatially refining transgene expression in Drosophila. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This encodes the protein ataxin-3, of unknown function. The mouse Mjd gene has a structure similar to that of its human counterpart and it also contains a TATA-less promoter. Its 5' flanking region contains conserved putative binding regions for transcription factors Sp1, USF, Amt, Max, E47, and MyoD. Upon differentiation of P 19 cells, the Mjd gene promoter is preferentially activated in endodermal and mesodermal derivatives, including cardiac and skeletal myocytes; and less so in neuronal precursors. Mouse ataxin-3 is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and in the adult, with strong expression in regions of the CNS affected in MJD. It is particularly abundant in all types of muscle and in ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting that it may be associated with the cytoskeleton and may have an important function in cell structure and/or motility.

This complex is also expressed in regions of the central nervous system where it is localized to both neuronal and glial cells. DG and the inwardly rectifying potassium channels, Kir4.1, are concentrated at the interface of astroglia and small blood vessels. These channels are involved in siphoning potassium released into the extracellular space after neuronal excitation. This raises the possibility that DG may be involved in targeting Kir4.1 channels to specific domains of astroglia. To address this question, we used mixed hippocampal cultures to investigate the distribution of DG, syntrophin, dystrobrevin, and Kir4.1 channels, as well as aquaporin-permeable water channels, AQP4. These proteins exhibit a similar distribution pattern and form aggregates in astrocytes cultured on laminin. Both DG and syntrophin colocalize with Kir4.1 channel aggregates in astrocytes. Similarly, DG colocalizes with AQP4 channel aggregates. Quantitative studies show a significant increase of Kir4.1 and AQP4 channel aggregates in astrocytes cultured in the presence of laminin when compared with those in the absence of laminin. These findings show that laminin has a role in Kir4.1 and AQP4 channel aggregation and suggest that this may be mediated via a dystroglycan-containing complex. This study reveals a novel functional role for DG in brain including K+ buffering and water homeostasis. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this paper, we describe an alternative object-based strategy dedicated to the cortex. This strategy relies on an artificial neuroanatomist performing automatic recognition of the main cortical sulci and parcellation of the cortical surface into gyral patches. A set of shape descriptors, which can be compared across subjects, is then attached to the sulcus and gyrus related objects segmented by this process. The framework is used to perform a study of 142 brains of the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) database. This study reveals some correlates of handedness on the size of the sulci located in motor areas, which was not detected previously using standard voxel based morphometry.

J	Karwatsky, P; Overbury, O; Faubert, J				Karwatsky, P; Overbury, O; Faubert, J			Red-green chromatic mechanisms in normal aging and glaucomatous observers	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; GANGLION-CELL LOSS; VISUAL-FIELD LOSS; BLUE-ON-YELLOW; LATERAL GENICULATE; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; OCULAR HYPERTENSION; AUTOMATED PERIMETRY; HUMAN RETINA; COLOR	Purpose. This study was designed to determine whether normal aging and glaucoma are associated with red-green (R/G) chromatic processing abnormalities, a function that is primarily performed by the parvocellular visual pathway. Methods. Chromatic processing mechanisms were examined in 98 glaucomatous observers ( between the ages of 49 and 93 years; mean age, 70.8+/-9.4 [SD]) and 67 normal observers (between the ages of 49 and 88; mean age, 70.6+/-10.6 years) with the use of the minimum-motion and motion-nulling paradigms. Phakic glaucomatous (n=60; mean age, 68.7+/-8.9 years) and normal (n=32; mean age, 69.8+/-10.6 years) and pseudophakic glaucomatous (n=38; mean age, 74+/-9.4 years) and normal (n=35; mean age, 71.4+/-10.6 years) subjects were tested to evaluate the effects of lenticular aging on color perception. Results. Phakic observers (normal or glaucomatous) displayed significantly different minimum-motion values than did both their younger counterparts and all the pseudophakic subjects. These results suggest that normal aging with the presence of a natural lens is accompanied by a significant decrease in green-light sensitivity, an effect that is not exacerbated by glaucoma and is primarily related to optical factors. The data also revealed no differences in color motion perception between groups, indicating that the higher cortical mechanisms of the parvocellular pathway implicated in the analysis of information about the middle and long wavelengths of the visible spectrum are not selectively affected by the disease process and normal aging. Conclusions. Normal aging and glaucoma do not produce significant R/G chromatic processing deficits at retinal and postretinal levels when optical factors are excluded. The authors propose the hypothesis that glaucoma-related effects on motion perception and blue-on-yellow perimetry should be viewed as evidence of loss of ganglion cells that necessitates integration of information over larger retinal areas and more receptor cells than in the R/G chromatic system. Ganglion cells with large receptive fields involve more neural connections and are less numerous than those that respond to R/G information. The functional consequence of this could be that the loss of a single ganglion cell with a larger receptive field would have a greater impact on visual function than the loss of a ganglion cell with a smaller receptive field, such as the ones that process R/G information. The authors believe that glaucoma-induced functional loss is best viewed as related to receptive field structure and function rather than to anatomic cell-type damage.

In a double mutant transgenic rat model (AbetaPP and PSI mutations, UKUR25). stably expressing intracellular human Abeta fragments in an environment devoid of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, we investigated the impact of iAbeta burden on both he incidence and relative cross sectional areas of the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and lipofuscin bodies. Pyramidal cells within the hippocampus and neocortex of both transgenic and non-transgenic age matched controls were compared. This comparison revealed a significant increase in both the proportional area occupied by Golgi apparatus elements as well as in the mean individual cross sectional area of Golgi compartments in the hippocampus of transgenic rats as compared to controls. Elevated lysosome and lipofuscin elements in the hippocampi of transgenic rats were observed, as was an increase in the mean individual, cross sectional area of lipofuscin bodies in the cortex of transgenic rats as compared to controls. These findings support the hypothesis that intracellular Abeta accumulation not only has an impact on subcellular compartments but also potentially contributes to he neuronal cell pathology observed in AD.

This paper reports the results of a longitudinal single-case study on the patterns of lateralization for lexical semantic processing during the recovery from aphasia. The experimental protocol included a lateralized lexical decision task (LDT), an attentional task and a language test. There was no presentation site effect on the LDT, and the performance was jointly influenced by attentional and language factors. These findings suggest that the recovery of lexical semantic processing may be sustained by both cerebral hemispheres, and highlights the importance of experimental protocols that allow examining both language and attentional factors modulating the recovery from aphasia.

We have identified a novel receptor tyrosine kinase, neurite outgrowth regulating kinase (nork) from Aplysia californica. A fragment of this kinase was also identified in another mollusk, Lymnaea. The kinase domain is equally homologous to the Ret (rearranged during transformation) and fibroblast growth factor receptor families, but the extracellular domain is entirely novel, suggesting that it binds a nonconserved ligand. Overexpression of neurite outgrowth regulating kinase, but not a kinase dead form, causes a reduction in neurite outgrowth of Aplysia sensory neurons. Thus, we have identified a novel receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in regulating neurite outgrowth. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A/J microglia showed moderate morphological changes upon stimulation with IFN-gamma alone or with Abeta(1-42). Conversely, C57BL/6 microglia showed major changes in their cellular morphology, which were accompanied by a decrease in NO release and a marked increase in TNF-alpha production. These results indicate that the magnitude of the microglial inflammatory response to Abeta is strongly influenced by genetic factors. Individual differences in the regulation of the microglial response may be a key player in the rate of development of the neuropathology of AD. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Whether and how sensory inputs to reticulospinal neurons are modulated remains to be determined. We showed recently that cholinergic inputs onto reticulospinal neurons play a key role in the initiation of locomotion elicited by stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region in semi intact lampreys. Here, we examined the possible role of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in modulating trigeminal inputs to reticulospinal neurons. A local application of muscarinic agonists onto an intracellularly recorded reticulospinal cell depressed the disynaptic responses to trigeminal stimulation. A depression was also observed when muscarinic agonists were pressure ejected over the brain stem region containing second-order neurons relaying trigeminal inputs to reticulospinal neurons. Conversely, muscarinic antagonists increased the trigeminal-evoked responses, suggesting that a muscarinic depression of sensory inputs to RS neurons is exerted tonically. The muscarinic modulation affected predominantly the N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) component of the trigeminal-evoked responses. Moreover, atropine perfusion facilitated the occurrence of sustained depolarizations induced by stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, and it revealed NMDA-induced intrinsic oscillations in reticulospinal neurons. The functional significance of a muscarinic modulation of a sensory transmission to reticulospinal neurons is discussed.

These signals differ in temporal structure as well as in carrier frequency. We show that ON1's temporal coding properties vary with carrier frequency, allowing it to encode both of these behaviorally important signals. Information-transfer functions show that coding of 4.5 kHz is limited to the range of amplitude-modulation components that occur in cricket songs (< 32 Hz), whereas coding of 30-kHz stimuli extends to the higher pulse rates that occur in bat sounds (similar to 100 Hz). Nonlinear coding contributes to the information content of ON1's spike train, particularly for 30-kHz stimuli with high intensities and large modulation depths. Phase locking to sinusoidal amplitude envelopes also extends to higher AM frequencies for ultrasound stimuli. ON1s frequency-specific behavior cannot be ascribed to differences in the shapes of information-transfer functions of low- and high-frequency-tuned receptor neurons, both of which are tuned more broadly to AM frequencies than ON1. Coding properties are nearly unaffected by contralateral deafferentation. ON1's role in auditory processing is to increase binaural contrast through contralateral inhibition. We hypothesize that its frequency-specific temporal coding properties optimize binaural contrast for sounds with both the spectral and temporal features of behaviorally relevant signals.

In an effort to determine whether these different roles may be fulfilled by different cell groups, including cholinergic and GABAergic cells, we recorded from 123 units in waking-sleeping, head-fixed rats using micropipettes to allow juxtacellular labeling. Functional sets of intermingled cell groups emerged as units whose discharge was as follows: 1) maximum in active wake (aW) and positively or not correlated with EEG gamma activity, while positively correlated with nuchal EMG activity, and thus potentially facilitatory for waking and behavioral arousal (12%); 2) maximum in SWS or SWS-PS and positively correlated with delta EEG activity, while not or negatively correlated with EMG activity, and thus potentially promotive for sleep with cortical slow wave activity and/or accompanying behavioral changes (16%); 3) maximum in PS or PS and aW and positively correlated with gamma and theta EEG activity, while negatively or not correlated with EMG activity, and thus potentially promotive for cortical activation during PS or PS and W (62%); and 4) equivalent across all states and thus not involved in state regulation ( similar to 10%). Units of each group also manifested different firing patterns typified as slow tonic (19.5%), fast tonic (32.5%), or fast phasic (48%), including rhythmic bursting (6%). Through these diverse cell groups, the basal forebrain has the capacity to modulate cortical activity, behavior, and/or related physiological processes across the sleepwaking cycle and thereby regulate the sleep-wake state of the animal.

Recordings at multiple depths in the entorhinal cortex were first used to characterize field potentials evoked by stimulation of the parasubiculum in urethan-anesthetized rats. Current source density analysis showed that a prominent surface-negative field potential component is generated by synaptic activation in layer II. The surface-negative field potential was also observed in rats with chronically implanted electrodes. The response was maintained during short stimulation trains of less than or equal to 125 Hz, suggesting that it is generated by activation of monosynaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. The piriform cortex also projects to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, and interactions between parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs were investigated using double-site stimulation tests. Simultaneous activation of parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs with high-intensity pulses resulted in smaller synaptic potentials than were expected on the basis of summing the individual responses, consistent with the termination of both pathways onto a common population of neurons. Paired-pulse tests were then used to assess the effect of parasubicular stimulation on responses to piriform cortex stimulation. Responses of the entorhinal cortex to piriform cortex inputs were inhibited when the parasubiculum was stimulated 5 ms earlier and were enhanced when the parasubiculum was stimulated 20 - 150 ms earlier. These results indicate that excitatory inputs to the entorhinal cortex from the parasubiculum may enhance the propagation of neuronal activation patterns into the hippocampal circuit by increasing the responsiveness of the entorhinal cortex to appropriately timed inputs.

In the present study, we tested regulation of cardiac I-1-receptors versus alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in response to hypertension and to chronic exposure to agonist. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 12 - 14 weeks old) received moxonidine ( 10, 60, and 120 mug/kg/hs.c.) for 1 and 4 weeks. Autoradiographic binding of I-125-paraiodoclonidine (0.5 nM, 1 h, 22 degreesC) and inhibition of binding with epinephrine (10(-10) - 10(-5) M) demonstrated the presence of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in heart atria and ventricles. Immunoblotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction identified alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor proteins and mRNA, respectively. However, compared with normotensive controls, cardiac alpha(2)-adrenoceptor kinetic parameters, receptor proteins, and mRNAs were not altered in SHR with or without moxonidine treatment. In contrast, autoradiography showed that up-regulated atrial I-1-receptors in SHR are dose-dependently normalized by 1 week, with no additional effect after 4 weeks of treatment. Moxonidine ( 120 mug/kg/h) decreased B-max in right (40.0 +/- 2.9 - 7.0 +/- 0.6 fmol/unit area; p < 0.01) and left (27.7 +/- 2.8 - 7.1 +/- 0.4 fmol/unit area; p < 0.01) atria, and decreased the 85- and 29-kDa imidazoline receptor protein bands, in right atria, to 51.8 +/- 3.0% ( p < 0.01) and 82.7 +/- 5.2% ( p < 0.03) of vehicle-treated SHR, respectively. Moxonidine-associated percentage of decrease in B-max only correlated with the 85- kDa protein (R-2 = 0.57; p < 0.006), suggesting that this protein may represent I-1-receptors. The weak but significant correlation between the two imidazoline receptor proteins (R-2 = 0.28; p < 0.03) implies that they arise from the same gene. In conclusion, the heart possesses I-1-receptors and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, but only I-1-receptors are responsive to hypertension and to chronic in vivo treatment with a selective I-1-receptor agonist.

Although many of the biological effects of NGF ( such as neuronal growth and survival) are associated with TrkA activation, p75NTR also contributes to these activities by enhancing the action of TrkA when receptors are coexpressed. The NGF antagonist PD90780 [7-(benzolylamino)-4,9-dihydro-4-methyl- 9-oxo-pyrazolo[5,1-b] quinazoline-2-carboxlic acid] interacts with NGF, preventing its binding to p75NTR. In this study, the actions of this compound are further explored, and it is found that PD90780 is not able to inhibit the binding of either brain-derived neurotrophic factor or neurotrophin-3 to p75(NTR), consistent with the direct interactions of the antagonist with NGF. In addition, we demonstrate that the ability of PD90780 to inhibit NGF-p75(NTR) interactions is lower when receptors are coexpressed, compared with when p75(NTR) is the only neurotrophin receptor expressed. These results suggest that the interaction between NGF and the p75(NTR) receptor is altered when TrkA is coexpressed. This alteration can be exploited in the development of antagonists that will selectively inhibit the pro-apoptotic actions of p75(NTR) when expressed in the absence of TrkA, although having less effect on the pro-survival effects of p75(NTR) mediated by enhanced TrkA activation.

OPC has previously been shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression. This project set out to determine the effect of OPC on serotonergic neurotransmission and to shed light on its mechanism( s) of action. In an electrophysiological model of in vivo extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats, a 2-day treatment ( 1 mg/kg/day) with OPC induced a significant increase in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) putative 5- HT neurons' firing activity. This increase was blocked by the coadministration of NE-100 [N,N-dipropyl-2-(4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy) phenyl)-thylamine], a selective sigma(1) antagonist ( 10 mg/kg/day). Furthermore, after 2-day treatments with OPC, the 5- HT1A autoreceptor response was altered, as demonstrated by the dramatically reduced response to an increase of endogenous 5- HT induced by the acute administration of paroxetine ( 500 mug/kg, i.v.). However, the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(dinpropylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) ( 4 mug/kg, i.v.) maintained its ability to decrease 5-HT firing activity, an effect that was reversible by the subsequent administration of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 [N-[2-(4-[2-methoxyphenyl]-1-piperazinyl) ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide] (100 mug/kg, i.v.). As 8-OH-DPAT has been shown to act preferentially through postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, our data suggests that this effect of OPC is mediated primarily by the 5-HT1A autoreceptor. The decreased response of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor to paroxetine was not blocked by the coadministration of NE-100 indicating that sigma(1) receptors are not involved in this effect. Thus, both sigma and 5-HT1A receptors play a role in the "antidepressant-like" effects produced by OPC, which is in keeping with previously published behavioral data. In addition, the current series of experiments suggest that OPC might have potential as an antidepressant with a rapid onset of action compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatments, which initially suppress the firing activity of putative 5-HT neurons and require at least 2 to 3 weeks to restore the firing activity to baseline neuronal firing activity through a desensitization of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor.

In this study, we report that the endo-exonuclease, a protein involved in the recombination repair process of the DNA double-stranded break pathway, is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells and could represent an effective target for developing anticancer drugs. We identify a dicationic diarylfuran, pentamidine, which has been used clinically to treat opportunistic infections and is an inhibitor of the endo-exonuclease as determined by enzyme kinetic assay. In clonogenic and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays as well as in the in vivo Lewis lung carcinoma mouse tumor model, pentamidine is shown to possess the ability to selectively kill cancer cells. The LD50 Of pentamidine on cancer cells maintained in vitro is correlated with the endo-exonuclease enzyme activity. Tumor cell that has been treated with pentamidine is reduced in the endo-exonuclease as compared with the untreated control. Furthermore, pentamidine synergistically potentiates the cytotoxic effect of DNA strand break and crosslink-inducing agents such as mitomycin C, etoposide, and cisplatin. In addition, we used the small interfering RNA for the mouse homologue of the endo-exonuclease to downregulate the level of endo-exonuclease in the mouse myeloma cell line B16F10. Down-regulation of the endoexonuclease sensitizes the cell to 5-fluorouracil. These studies suggested the endo-exonuclease enzyme as a novel potential therapeutic target for cancer.

Subjects performed two movement components simultaneously and without visual feedback: touching the nose with the finger while leaning the trunk forward. Subjects wore a harness connected to an electromagnet, which was attached to a wall. The trunk movement was mechanically blocked in randomly selected trials by engaging the electromagnet. While healthy subjects performed the task equally well in both conditions, PD subjects' hand movements significantly deteriorated in trunk-perturbed compared to trunk-free trials. Deteriorated hand movements were characterized by segmented hand paths, unsmooth velocity profiles, and prolonged movement times. This finding indicated that the relatively local trunk perturbation had a global effect on the hand movement of PD subjects, necessitating them to reinitiate, after some delay, their arm movement in perturbed trials. Thus, the basal ganglia may be a critical node in brain networks mediating the flexibility of responses to altered motor states. (C) 2004 Movement Disorder Society.

Other neuropathological features that accompany progression of the disease include a decrease in synaptic density, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites, inflammation, and neuronal cell loss. In this study, we report the early kinetics of brain amyloid deposition and its associated inflammation in an early onset transgenic mouse model of AD (TgCRND8) harboring the human amyloid precursor protein gene with the Indiana and Swedish mutations. Both diffuse and compact plaques were detected as early as 9-10 weeks of age. Abeta-immunoreactive (Abeta-IR) plaques (4G8-positive) appeared first in the neocortex and amygdala, then in the hippocampal formation, and lastly in the thalamus. Compact plaques (ThioS-positive) with an amyloid core were observed as early as diffuse plaques were detected, but in lower numbers. Amyloid deposition increased progressively with age. The formation of plaques was concurrent with the appearance of activated microglial cells and shortly followed by the clustering of activated astrocytes around plaques at 13-14 weeks of age. This TgCRND8 mouse model allows for a rapid, time-dependent study of the relationship between the fibrillogenic process and the inflammatory response during the brain amyloidogenic process.

An account of this phenomenon, labeled the Self Reference Effect (SRE), is that the self promotes elaboration and organization of encoded information, Although a few neuroimaging studies associated self-referential encoding with activations of the medial prefrontal cortex, no previous study has investigated the neural correlates of remembering emotional words encoded in an SIZE paradigm. The main goal of this study was to define with fMRI the neural correlates of the successful retrieval of negative and positive personality traits encoded in a self-referential mode. Functional MRI scans were acquired for 11 subjects as they recognized positive and negative emotional personality traits adjectives encoded in a self-referential condition, a semantic condition and in a phonemic condition. The correct recognition of self-encoded personality traits engaged dorso-medial prefrontal cortex and lateral prefrontal regions, premotor cortex, parietal and occipital cortex, caudate and cerebellum. The specific recognition of self-encoded negative personality traits involved greater neural activation in the right extra-striate region than the recognition of positive personality traits. Our fMRI findings suggest that specific processes may operate at both encoding and retrieval to subserve the SIZE. Unlike self-encoding, the retrieval of personality traits is modulated by the valence of the stimuli with greater activation for negative words. Our results indicate that personally relevant words may signal important emotional clues and support the notion of a widely distributed set of brain regions involved in maintaining the concepts of self.

The cell surface localization of both the Eph receptors and the ephrins enables these proteins to signal bidirectionally at sites of cell-to-cell contact, such as synapses. Eph receptors and ephrins have indeed been implicated in multiple aspects of synaptic function, including clustering and modulating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, modifying the geometry of postsynaptic terminals, and influencing long-term synaptic plasticity and memory. In this review, we discuss how Eph receptors and ephrins are integrated into the molecular machinery that supports synaptic function.

The main objective of this study was to characterize the specificity of nociceptive stimulation to trigger sleep arousal-awakening over all sleep stages. Thirteen healthy adults (e.g. without pain or sleep problems; six female and seven male of a mean age of 24.2 +/- 1.3 years) were included in the study. The responses to noxious intramuscular 5% hypertonic infusion were compared to innocuous vibrotactile and to respective control stimulations: isotonic infusion and auditory stimulations. These stimulations were applied during wakefulness and were repeated during sleep. Polygraphic signals (e.g. brain activity, heart rate) signals were recorded to score sleep arousal over all sleep stages. A subjective assessment of sleep quality was made on next morning. No overnight sensitization or habituation occurred with any of the experimental stimulations. The vibratory-auditory stimulations and the noxious hypertonic infusions triggered significantly (P < 0.05) more awakenings in sleep Stage 2 and in REM than their respective control stimulations. In sleep Stage 2, both vibratory + auditory stimulations and the noxious hypertonic infusions has the same awakening response frequency (approximate to 30%), however, with the noxious infusions the response frequency were similar in sleep Stages 3 and 4 (P < 0.05) and in REM (trend). Compared to the baseline night, sleep quality was lower following the night with noxious stimulation (90.1 +/- 2.7 and 73.3 +/- 7.4 mm, respectively; P < 0.03). These data suggest that pain during sleep could trigger a sleep awaking response over all sleep stages and not only in light sleep. (C) 2004 International Association for the Study of Pain.

To evaluate the complications associated with the image-guided insertion of gastrostomy ( G) and gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tubes in children, performed by the retrograde percutaneous route. Methods. A convenience sample of 208 charts of 840 patients recorded as having G and/or GJ tubes placed by the interventional radiology service in a 4-year period (1995-1999) at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, were selected for review. Complications were categorized as major ( including subcutaneous abscess, peritonitis, septicemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and death) or minor. Results. In total, 253 tubes ( 208 G tubes, 41 GJ tubes, 4 G and GJ tubes) were placed in the 208 patients reviewed. The median age at the time of insertion was 15 months (range: 7 days-18 years). The most common diagnostic category was neurologic disease (47%). The main indications for tube insertion were recorded as failure to thrive (57%) and risk of aspiration (47%). Major complications were seen in 5% of patients. Peritonitis was noted in 3%, and there was 1 death related to tube insertion (0.4%). Minor complications were found in 73% of patients, including tube dislodgement (37%), tube leakage (25%), and G-tube site skin infection ( 25%). GJ tubes had a higher rate than G tubes of obstruction, migration, dislodgement, leakage, and intussusception. Site infection, gastroesophageal reflux, and bleeding from the site were seen less frequently in patients with GJ tubes compared with G tubes. Conclusion. G and GJ tubes placed by the image-guided retrograde percutaneous method are associated with a wide range of complications. The majority of these are minor and are predominantly related to tube maintenance, but major complications, including death, do occur.

The transduction capability of cardiac afferent neurons, situated in and adjacent to the heart, is vital to feedback in control of cardiac function. An analysis of in situ cardiac afferent activity shows evidence of independent and exponentially distributed interspike intervals. An anatomical basis for such memoryless interspike intervals ultimately derives from the fact that each afferent neuron is associated with a field of sensory neurites, or bare nerve endings, that transduce local chemical and mechanical stimuli in a many-to-one fashion. As such, cardiac afferent neurons and their sensory neurite inputs are respectively modeled here by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations forced by "red" noise (decaying power spectrum) perturbing an otherwise constant subthreshold input. A variable barrier competition model is derived from these equations in order to address the question: How are noisy inputs being processed by sensory neurons to cause each spike? It is found that ion channels are responsible for significant input "whitening" (increased spectral power at higher frequency) through differentiation of the inputs. Such whitening is a means to distinguish low-frequency control signals from otherwise red noise fluctuations. Furthermore, spiking occurs when backward moving averages of the whitened inputs, over a window of the order of the sodium activation time scale, exceed an approximately constant barrier.

Its main development remained in the hands of Parisian chemists over the next four decades. Thereafter, interest in the subject spread slowly through the German-speaking world. The most significant advances were made by a Hessian, practicing medicine and chemistry as an emigre in London in the second half of the 19th century. Some chemists had an intrinsic interest in exploring the brain by the techniques which they bad applied to various organs of the body. However, there were others for whom social, medical, even philosophical, factors were the spur in their choice of study of the chemistry of the nervous system. This paper describes the early growth of neurochemistry as I have come to understand it during the course of historical research during the past 10 years. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Bull. 26 (2000) 119]. However, neuropsychological evaluation does not provide valuable information about how the cognitive deficits directly affect daily living, that is, which cognitive deficit affects which behavior. The present study aimed at determining whether executive dysfunction in schizophrenia could be directly measured by analyzing three activities of daily living (ADL), in addition to assessing the ecological validity of commonly used neuropsychological tests. Within specific ADL (choosing a menu, shopping the ingredients, cooking a meal), the sequences of behaviors that have been performed by 27 control subjects and 27 patients with schizophrenia were both analyzed by using a preset optimal sequence of behavior. When compared with control subjects, patients with schizophrenia showed more omissions when choosing the menu, more sequencing and repetitions errors during the shopping task, and more planning, sequencing, repetition and omission errors during the cooking task. These behavioral errors correlated significantly with negative, but not with positive symptoms of the patients. Furthermore, they also correlated with the poor performances oil executive neuropsychological tests, especially those sensitive to shifting and sequencing abilities, but not with memory tests. These results suggest that executive deficits in schizophrenia may specifically affect ADL and that such deficits can be quantitatively assessed with a behavioral scale of action sequences.

Expression of the hypoxia-inducible cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) is upregulated in the brain in both stroke patients and in animal stroke models and exerts local neuroprotective effects in the ischemic brain. Epo is also well known to stimulate red blood cell (RBC) production. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether poststroke systemic hypoxia is present in the rat model and whether it is associated with increased peripheral Epo and RBC production. Methods-Wistar rats underwent 1-hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) under mechanical ventilation, followed by reperfusion without further ventilation. Groups of MCAO and sham-operated animals were evaluated at extended times after reperfusion for assessment of arterial blood gases, plasma Epo, and complete blood count. Results-Arterial oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the infarct group between 6 and 24 hours after reperfusion (P = 0.0005), and plasma Epo levels were increased 6 hours after reperfusion (P < 0.05). RBC counts and hematocrit were transiently increased 2 to 7 days after reperfusion in animals with MCAO compared with sham. Maximal increases were seen at day 7 (22% and 16% increases of RBC count and hematocrit, respectively; P < 0.001). In contrast, the white blood cell counts in animals with MCAO decreased by >30% in the same time period. Conclusions-Plasma Epo levels, RBC counts, and hematocrit are all increased in response to systemic hypoxia after cerebral ischemia in rats.

However, morphometric and volumetric cerebellar measurements have yielded highly divergent results. The main goal of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to separately estimate the volumes of the entire vermis, the cerebellar hemispheres and three midsaggital vermian areas among 38 men with schizophrenia and 26 healthy men. Compared with the control group, persons with schizophrenia had significantly smaller volumes of the whole vermis, but not of the cerebellar hemispheres, a difference that approached significance when only the patients without a comorbid diagnosis of alcohol abuse/dependence were considered. Significant anomalies of the posterior vermian areas (lobules VI and VII) were detected in both subgroups of patients, while abnormalities of the anterior vermis (lobules I-V) were observed only among patients with a dual diagnosis of alcoholism. No difference emerged between the groups at the inferior vermian level (lobules VIII-X). Overall, these findings corroborate the hypothesized association between schizophrenia and specific posterior vermian anomalies, which might not necessarily be the consequence of alcohol abuse. However, the suggestion that schizophrenia is related to abnormal volumes of the lateral cerebellum is not supported. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This role may be fulfilled by the excitatory action that the hcrt-orx peptide exerts on multiple brainstem and forebrain systems that, in turn, promote cortical activation. Here, we examined whether hcrt-orx may also exert a postsynaptic excitatory action at the level of the cortex, where hcrt-orx fibers project. However, we found that neurons in layers 2-5 in the primary somatosensory cortex (SSp) were unresponsive to hcrt-orx. We then found that although all neurons tested in sublayer 6a were also unresponsive to hcrt-orx, all those tested in sublayer 6b were highly sensitive to the peptide. The sublayer selectivity of hcrt-orx was not restricted to the somatosensory cortex, because it was also found to be present in the primary visual cortex, the motor cortex, and the cingulate cortex. In the SSp, in which the hcrt-orx effect was investigated further, it was demonstrated to be postsynaptic, to result from an interaction with Hcrtr2-OX2 receptors and to depend on the closure of a potassium conductance. Similar to the selectivity of action in the thalamus, where hcrt-orx excites the nonspecific thalamocortical projection neurons and not the specific sensory relay neurons, here in the cortex, it excites a specific subset of cortical neurons which, through corticocortical projections, may also be involved in promoting widespread cortical activation.

In contrast to the more ubiquitously expressed Stau1, Stau2 is mainly expressed in the nervous system. In Drosophila, the third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (RBD3) of Staufen is essential for RNA interaction. When conserved amino acids within the RBD3 of Stau2 were mutated to render Stau2 defective for RNA binding, the mutant Stau2 proteins accumulate predominantly in the nucleolus. This is in contrast to wild type Stau2 that mostly localizes in the cytosol. The nuclear import is dependent on a nuclear localization signal in close proximity to the RBD3. The nuclear export of Stau2 is not dependent on CRM1 but rather on Exportin-5. We show that Exportin-5 interacts with the RBD3 of wild type Stau2 in an RNA-dependent manner in vitro but not with mutant Stau2. When Exportin-5 is down-regulated by RNA interference, only the largest isoform of Stau2 (Stau2(62)) preferentially accumulates in the nucleolus. It is tempting to speculate that Stau2(62) binds RNA in the nucleus and assembles into ribonucleoparticles, which are then exported via the Exportin-5 pathway to their final destination.

Heavy metals are known to affect calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis through perturbation of Ca2+ channels and pumps and interference with protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+ binding protein (CaBP). During pregnancy, placental Ca2+ exchange is one of the most important mechanisms for fetal survival. This ion is an essential element for healthy fetal growth and development. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of low maternal blood Pb levels on Ca2+ levels in serum and placenta and placental Ca2+ transfer. Blood samples (maternal and cord) and placental tissue were obtained at birth from 30 women residing in southwest Quebec. Total Ca2+ and Ph levels were measured in maternal and umbilical cord samples and placental tissue at term. The placentas were taken for trophoblast cell isolation and Ca2+ incorporation kinetic experiments. Data showed that Ca2+ in maternal blood did not influence Ca2+ uptake by syncytiotrophoblast. However, although maternal and cord blood Ph levels were low, maternal blood Pb concentration was significantly linked to a decrease in Ca2+ uptake by syncytiotrophoblast. This suggests that exposure to very levels of Pb significantly modifies Ca2+ transfer in syncytiotrophoblasts.

Methods and Materials: Patients >18 years old with anaplastic astrocytoma, a Karnofsky performance status score of :60, and adequate pulmonary function were eligible. All patients provided informed consent. Standard RT started within 5 weeks of diagnosis. In both arms, 150 mg/m(2) of TMZ was given on Days 1-5 of RT. In Arm 1,200 mg/m(2) of carmustine was given on Day 1 of RT. In Arm 2, 150 mg/m(2) of carmustine was given on Day 5 of RT. After RT, TMZ and carmustine were repeated for a total of six cycles. Results: A total of 15 and 14 patients were enrolled in the two pilot arms. Because of hematologic and pulmonary toxicities, dose reductions by the second cycle of therapy occurred in >70% of the patients in Arm 1 and >50% in Arm 2 despite a reduction in the carmustine dose. Conclusion: The results of these pilot studies have implications for the design of studies testing the initial treatment of brain tumors. Because of the poor tolerance of the combination, the multicooperative group Phase III study consists of two randomized arms of single-agent carmustine vs. single-agent TMZ. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It is shown here that the mammalian runt-related gene Runx1 is expressed in selected populations of postmitotic neurons of the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems. These include cholinergic branchial and visceral motor neurons in the hindbrain, restricted populations of somatic motor neurons of the median and lateral motor columns in the spinal cord, as well as nociceptive and mechanoreceptor neurons in trigeminal and vestibulocochlear ganglia. In mouse embryos lacking Runx1 activity, hindbrain branchiovisceral motor neuron precursors of the cholinergic lineage are correctly specified but then fail to progress to a more differentiated state and undergo increased cell death, resulting in a neuronal loss in the mantle layer. In contrast, the development of cholinergic somatic motor neurons is unaffected. Runx1 inactivation also leads to a loss of selected sensory neurons in trigeminal and vestibulocochlear ganglia. These findings uncover previously unrecognized roles for Runx1 in the regulation of mammalian neuronal subtype development.

Evidence in support of this unifying perspective is adduced from human neuropathological studies, experimental paradigms of ageing-associated neurological disorders, and a comprehensive model of astroglial senescence. A pivotal role for the enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in consolidating this tripartite lesion in the ageing and diseased CNS is emphasized. The data are discussed in the context of a revised 'free radical-mitochondrial-metal' theory of brain ageing, and some scientific and clinical implications of the latter are considered.

Here we show that Caribbean vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops, SK) develop cerebral Abeta plaques with aging and that these deposits are associated with gliosis and neuritic dystrophy. Five aged vervets were immunized with Abeta peptide over 10 months. Plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected periodically from the immunized vervets and five aged controls; one monkey per group expired during the study. By Day 42, immunized animals generated plasma Abeta antibodies that labeled Abeta plaques in human, AD transgenic mouse and vervet brains; bound Abeta1-7; and recognized monomeric and oligomeric Abeta but not full-length amyloid precursor protein nor its C-terminal fragments. Low anti-Abeta titers were detected in CSF. Abetax-40 levels were elevated similar to2- to 5-fold in plasma and decreased up to 64% in CSF in immunized vervets. insoluble Abetax-42 was decreased by 66% in brain homogenates of the four immunized animals compared to archival tissues from 13 age-matched control vervets. Abeta42-immunoreactive plaques were detected in frontal cortex in 11 of the 13 control animals, but not in six brain regions examined in each of the four immunized vervets. No T cell response or inflammation was observed. our study is the first to demonstrate age-related Abeta deposition in the vervet monkey as well as the lowering of cerebral Abeta by Abeta vaccination in a non-human primate. The findings further support Abeta immunotherapy as a potential prevention and treatment of AD.

Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate can be corrected, but markers of autonomic activity would be useful to predict and prevent such changes. The goal of this study was to find markers describing the changes in autonomic nervous system activity with epidural anesthesia in laboring patients. Methods: The authors analyzed heart rate variability and blood pressure variability in 13 laboring patients using wavelet transform, a time-frequency analysis that accommodates rapid changes in autonomic activity. Heart rate and blood pressure variability were obtained 5 min before and 10 min after injection of 20 ml bupivacaine, 0.125%, and 50 mug fentanyl in the epidural space. Results: Blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by epidural analgesia. However, high-frequency power of heart rate variability increased after epidural (increase in parasympathetic drive). The ratio of low-frequency:high-frequency power of heart rate variability decreased. High- and low-frequency power of blood pressure variability decreased (decrease in sympathetic outflow). Conclusions: Indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity after neuraxial blockade in laboring patients can be obtained by analysis of both heart rate variability and blood pressure variability. The analysis by wavelet transform can discern changes in autonomic activity when values of blood pressure and heart rate do not vary significantly. Whether this technique could be used to predict and prevent hemodynamic compromise after neuraxial blockade merits further studies.

J	Warrier, CM; Zatorre, RJ				Warrier, CM; Zatorre, RJ			Right temporal cortex is critical for utilization of melodic contextual cues in a pitch constancy task	BRAIN			English	Article						auditory cortex; context; pitch; spectral shape; association cortex	PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; VOLUME MEASUREMENT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TONAL CONTEXT; PERCEPTION; PATTERNS; DISCRIMINATION; SPEECH; TONES	Pitch constancy, perceiving the same pitch from tones with differing spectral shapes, requires one to extract the fundamental frequency from two sets of harmonics and compare them. We previously showed this difficult task to be easier when tonal context is present, presumably because the context creates a tonal reference point from which to judge the test tone. The present study assessed the role of the right auditory cortex in using tonal context for pitch judgements. Thirty-six patients with focal brain excisions of the right or left anterior temporal lobe (RT, LT) and 12 matched control participants (NC) made pitch judgements on complex tones that could differ in fundamental frequency and/or spectral shape. This task was performed in isolation and within a melodic context. The RT group showed impairments both on trials in which extraction of pitch from differing spectral shapes was required (different-timbre trials) and when this was not required (same-timbre trials). All groups performed poorly in the isolated condition, but improved with melodic context. Degree of improvement varied in that the LT group performed normally, whereas the RT group was not able to obtain the same amount of facilitation from the melodic context. In particular, melodic context did not facilitate the RT group's performance on different-timbre trials. Excisions within Heschl's gyrus did not affect these results, suggesting that the impairments were due to the removal of the anterior temporal cortex. The results of this study therefore implicate right anterior auditory cortical areas in making pitch judgements relative to tones that were heard previously. We propose that auditory association areas located on the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, an area with connections to frontal regions implicated in working memory, could be involved in holding and integrating tonal information.

Here, we attempted to identify the cellular and pharmacological mechanisms responsible for this epileptogenic state by using field potential and K+-selective recordings in neocortical slices obtained from epileptic patients with FCD and, for purposes of comparison, with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), an epileptic disorder that, at least in the neocortex, is not characterized by any obvious structural aberration of neuronal networks. Spontaneous epileptiform activity was induced in vitro by applying 4-aminopyridine (4AP)-containing medium. Under these conditions, we could identify in FCD slices a close temporal relationship between ictal activity onset and the occurrence of slow interictal-like events that were mainly contributed by GABA(A) receptor activation. We also found that in FCD slices, pharmacological procedures capable of decreasing or increasing GABA(A) receptor function abolished or potentiated ictal discharges, respectively. In addition, the initiation of ictal events in FCD tissue coincided with the occurrence of GABA(A) receptor-dependent interictal events leading to [K+](o) elevations that were larger than those seen during the interictal period. Finally, by testing the effects induced by baclofen on epileptiform events generated by FCD and MTLE slices, we discovered that the function of GABA(B) receptors (presumably located at presynaptic inhibitory terminals) was markedly decreased in FCD tissue. Thus, epileptiform synchronization leading to in vitro ictal activity in the human FCD tissue is initiated by a synchronizing mechanism that paradoxically relies on GABA(A) receptor activation causing sizeable increases in [K+](o). This mechanism may be facilitated by the decreased ability of GABA(B) receptors to control GABA release from interneuron terminals.

This may be due in part to difficulties in ascertaining precisely to what degree each measure deviates from its genetically and environmentally determined potential level. We attempted to surmount this problem in a paradigm involving monozygotic twin pair discordant for schizophrenia. In this paradigm, the difference score and reaction time between the unaffected member and affected member of a twin pair should represent the degree of pathologic involvement irrespective of actual level. Method. We investigated, using fMRI, the neural substrate underlying encoding and retrieval of aversive and neutral IAPS pictures. Results. An ANOVA on reaction time (RT) between schizophrenia patient (J) and normal sister (D) significant difference, (F = 5.2, p less than or equal to .02) for J had less RT than D. Conversely, the ANOVA for the correct pictures retrieved was insignificant (F = 1.8, p less than or equal to .2). When the brain activity associated with the encoding and retrieval of the aversive pictures was subtracted (J - D and D - J) from that associated with the neutral ones, significant loci of activation were found. During encoding: for J - D the right fusiform gyrus was significantly activated (P < .0001) and for D - J the orbitofrontal cortex was significantly activated (P < .05). During retrieval: for J - D the right anterior cingulate (p < .0001) was activated and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p < .002). For D - J only the cerebellum showed activation (p < .0001). Conclusion. Results indicated subtle attenuations in some aspects of memory, thus providing another evidence for cognitive markers of a genetic component in schizophrenia. New approaches in neuropsychiatry-based on genetic methodologies should further define the cerebral physiology responsible for schizophrenia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The analysis consisted of looking at the means obtained from the two aphasic patients and their individual results concerning the production of null subjects in each grammatical person on focus. The individual pattern shown by each patient indicated the relevancy of analyzing individually the performance of neuropsychological patients. In this way the hypothesis which claims that in Brazilian Portuguese the null subject has two different natures could be verified. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We also sought to identify the voice acoustical correlates of feigned sleepiness for these same subjects. Twenty-two participants were asked to speak freely about a cartoon, to count from I to 10, and to sustain an "a" sound for approximately 5 s. These exercises were completed three times (within the same testing session) with three differing sets of instructions to the participants. These three conditions were presented in pseudo-random order to control for any order effects, and all subjects were naive to the intended purpose of this study. For all three conditions, mean speaking rates and pitch ranges were calculated. A series of paired t tests showed significant differences in the speaking rates (counting numbers and free-speech exercises) between the 'normal' and feigned sleepy conditions, and between the normal and feigned depression conditions, but not between the 'sleepy' and 'depressed' conditions. The results for pitch range, for all speech exercises, were not different between the normal and either the feigned depression or feigned sleepiness conditions. These results indicate that persons feigning depression and sleepiness demonstrate some level of conscious control of their speech rate, but they did not convincingly alter their pitch ranges while feigning depression or sleepiness.

A novel neuropsychological measure of immediate- and short-term memory for visuospatial information was administered to 40 children, who were identified as cocaine-exposed, and 11 age and socioeconomic status matched controls (all children were 8-9 years old). The Groton Maze Learning Test is a computer-based hidden maze learning test that consists of a 'timed chase test' (a simple measure of visuomotor speed), 5 learning trials on a hidden maze, followed by a delayed recall trial after an 8 min delay. The specific test parameters are chosen based on the age cohort of the subjects. The cocaine-exposed group performed significantly slower on the 'timed chase test,' the last 3 learning trials, and the delayed recall trial (p less than or equal to .05 for all comparisons). Although there was a modest trend for the cocaine-exposed group to make more errors throughout the learning trials, there were no significant group differences. These results suggest that children who were exposed in utero to cocaine exhibit slowed visuomotor speed, a possible impairment in procedural learning, and diminished efficiency in accessing and using the internal spatial map that subjects create to master the maze.

Methods: COSID is a 3-year prospective study of dementia patients living in the community at the time of study registration. We assessed patients' cognition, behaviour, and functioning every 6 months, using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF), respectively. We assessed caregivers, using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Additional information included the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), patients' driving status, and clinical information including family history, dementia type, concomitant medications, and comorbid conditions. From the patient or caregiver, we collected details of inpatient and outpatient resources used by the patient and (or) caregiver. Results: We enrolled 766 patients from 31 Canadian sites. Overall mean age was 76.8 years, and mean age of onset was 73.1 years. Of the total patients, 98% were white, 54% were women, and 84% were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Mean baseline 3MS was 66.5, NPI was 9.5, and SMAF was 18.30. Of these patients, 48% reported a GDS score of 3 (that is, moderate), 16% reported a GDS score of 4 (that is, moderately severe), and the remaining 36% reported a GDS score of 1 or 2 (that is, mild or very mild). At baseline, 83% of patients received cholinesterase inhibitors, 46% received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, 39% received vitamin E, and 25% received antidepressants. Adult day care and home help were the largest cost factors in this population, with mean monthly costs of $65 and $64, respectively. We found interesting differences in the resources used among geographic regions and care settings. Conclusions: COSID is already generating valuable information about treatment patterns, outcomes, and resource use in Canadian patients with dementia. As the data mature, it will be possible to build robust models on treatment effectiveness and costs of care.

Many different experimental approaches have been used to unravel the molecular basis for cadherin-mediated adhesion. In particular, several high-resolution structures have provided models for cadherin-cadherin interactions that are illuminative in many respects yet contradictory in others. This review gives an overview of the structural studies of cadherins over the past decade while focusing on recent developments that reconcile some of the earlier findings.

Research to identify specific subtypes of OCD has focused primarily on symptom presentation. Subtype models have been proposed using factor analyses that yield dimensional systems of symptom categories, but not necessarily distinct subtypes. Other empirical work has considered the role of neuropsychological functioning and comorbidity as part of a comprehensive scheme for subtyping OCD. The identified dimensions from all of these studies have implications for the treatment of OCD. In this article, we review the research on subtypes of OCD, focusing on subtype schemes based upon overt symptom presentation and neuropsychological profiles. We also review research pertinent to alternative subtyping schemes, both conceptually and methodologically. The research is critically examined and implications for treatment are discussed. Recommendations for future investigations are offered. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methylmercury (MeHg), a well-established neurotoxicant even at low levels of exposure, bioaccumulates to differing degrees in various fish species and can have serious adverse effects on the development and functioning of the human central nervous system, especially during prenatal exposure. Most studies on MeHg exposure have focussed on high-level consumers from local fish sources, although mercury (Hg) is also present in fresh, frozen, and canned market fish. Moreover, little information exists on the temporal variation of blood and hair Hg in pregnant women, particularly in populations with low levels of Hg. The aim of the present study was to characterize the temporal variation of Hg during pregnancy and to investigate the relation between fish consumption from various sources prior to and during pregnancy and maternal cord blood and mother's hair Hg levels. We recruited 159 pregnant women from Southwest Quebec through two prenatal clinics of the Quebec Public Health System. All women completed two detailed questionnaires concerning their fish consumption (species and frequency) prior to and during pregnancy. The women also provided blood samples for all three trimesters of pregnancy and hair samples after delivery of up to 9 cm in length. Blood and hair Hg levels were analyzed by cold-vapor atomic-absorption and-fluorescence spectrometry methods, respectively. Results showed that maternal blood and hair Hg levels decreased significantly between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. However, cord blood Hg was significantly higher than maternal blood at birth. Maternal hair was correlated with Hg blood concentration and was highly predictive of the organic fraction in cord blood. A strong dose relation was observed between the frequency of fish consumption before and during pregnancy and Hg exposure in mothers and newborns. Fish consumption prior to and during pregnancy explained 26% and 20% of cord blood Hg variance, respectively. For this population, detailed multivariate analyses showed that during pregnancy market fish (fresh, canned, and frozen) were more important sources of Hg exposure than were fish from the St. Lawrence River. These results should be taken into account for future advisories and intervention strategies, which should consider Hg levels in different species from all sources in order to maximize the nutritional input from fish and minimize the toxic risk.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of all adult patients who had undergone depth electrode implantation for suspected temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) at UCLA (1993-2000) or the Montreal Neurological Institute (1991-1998) to identify patients who had (a) unilateral hippocampal atrophy, and (b) surface ictal recordings in which the majority of seizures appeared to initiate in the opposite temporal lobe, with few or none that were concordant with the hippocampal atrophy. Results: Of 109 patients with suspected TLE who underwent depth electrode study at the two centers, five patients met the aforementioned criteria. Four of these five had very severe hippocampal atrophy, whereas the fifth had mild atrophy but extensive signal change on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Depth electrode recordings in four of the five patients yielded clear ictal onset in the mesial temporal lobe ipsilateral to the imaging abnormality (contralateral to apparent scalp ictal onset) One patient had an unusual bitemporal onset pattern, which was nonetheless suggestive of onset in the sclerotic hippocampus. No patient had intracranial ictal onset contralateral to the imaging abnormality. All patients underwent resection of the structurally abnormal temporal lobe. After follow-up of >2 years, four (80%) of five patients were seizure free, while the fifth showed lesser improvement (class III). Conclusions: Some patients with severe hippocampal sclerosis (sometimes called a "burned-out hippocampus") have atypical spread of ictal discharges, resulting in apparent gross discordance between imaging and scalp ictal recordings. These patients nonetheless have excellent surgical outcomes on the whole. Whether such patients may forego intracranial recordings requires further study.

It has been evaluated for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CNTF also acts on non-neuronal cells such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, adipocytes and skeletal muscles cells. CNTF has regulatory effects on body weight and is currently in clinical trial for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. CNTF mediates its function by activating a tripartite receptor comprising the CNTF receptor a chain (CNTFRalpha), the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta chain (LIFRbeta) and gp130. Human, rat and chicken CNTF have been expressed as recombinant proteins, and most preclinical studies in murine models have been performed using rat recombinant protein. Rat and human CNTF differ in their fine specificities: in addition to CNTFR, rat CNTF has been shown to activate the LIFR (a heterodimer of LIFRbeta and gp130), whereas human CNTF can bind and activate a tripartite receptor comprising the IL-6 receptor a chain (IL-6Ralpha) and LIFR. To generate tools designed for mouse models of human diseases; we cloned and expressed in E. coli both mouse CNTF and the CNTFRalpha chain. Recombinant mouse CNTF was active and showed a high level of specificity for mouse CNTFR. It shares the arginine residue with rat CNTF which prevents binding to IL-6Ralpha. It did not activate the LIFR at all concentrations tested. Recombinant mouse CNTF is therefore specific for CNTFR and as such represents a useful tool with which to study CNTF in mouse models. It appears well suited for the comparative evaluation of CNTF and the two additional recently discovered CNTFR ligands, cardiotrophin-like cytokine/cytokine-like factor-1 and neuropoietin.

In physiological conditions, STN bursty pattern has been shown to be dependent on slow wave cortical activity. Indeed, cortical ablation abolished STN bursting activity in urethane-anaesthetized intact or dopamine depleted rats. Thus, glutamate afferents might be involved in STN bursting activity during slow wave sleep (SWS) when thalamic and cortical cells oscillate in a low-frequency range. The present work was aimed to test, on non-anaesthetized rats, if it was possible to regularize the SWS STN bursty pattern by microiontophoresis of kynurenate, a broad-spectrum glutamate ionotropic receptors antagonist. As glutamatergic effects might be masked by GABAergic inputs arriving tonically and during the entire sleep-wake cycle on STN neurons, kynurenate was also co-iontophoresed with bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptors antagonist. Kynurenate iontophoretic applications had a weak inhibitory effect on the discharge rate of STN neurons whatever the vigilance state, and did not regularize the SWS STN bursty pattern. But, the robust bursty bicuculline-induced pattern was impaired by kynurenate, which elicited the emergence of single spikes between remaining bursts. These data indicate that the bursty pattern exhibited by STN neurons specifically in SWS, does not seem to exclusively depend on glutamatergic inputs to STN cells. Furthermore, GABA(A) receptors may play a critical role in regulating the influence of excitatory inputs on STN cells.

In all brain areas presenting significant enzymatic variations, only increases in CO activity were found in SHM, particularly the central autonomic network. However, only specific regions were affected, namely the insular cortex and the hypothalamic nuclei principally involved in high-order autonomic control. Altered limbic structures included the lateral septum, various hippocampal subregions, as well as prelimbic cortex. CO activity was also elevated in several forebrain regions, including those directly connected to the limbic system, such as the nucleus accumbens, the claustrum, and dorsomedial and reticular thalamic nuclei, as well as subthalamic and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. In the brainstem, the only regions affected were the locus coeruleus, site of noradrenergic cell bodies, the trigeminal system, and four interconnected regions: the inferior colliculus, the paramedial reticular formation, the medial vestibular, and the cerebellar fastigial nuclei. These data show that specific regions modulating sympathetic nerve discharge are activated in young adult SHM, possibly due to mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity.

This study examines whether misspecification of the form of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) results in significant fMRI responses being missed in the statistical analysis. EEG-fMRI data from 31 patients with focal epilepsy were analysed with four HRFs peaking from 3 to 9 sec after each interictal event, in addition to a standard HRF that peaked after 5.4 sec. In four patients, tMRI responses were correlated with gadolinium-enhanced MR angiograms and with EEG data from intracranial electrodes. In an attempt to understand the absence of BOLD responses in a significant group of patients, the degree of signal loss occurring as a result of magnetic field inhomogeneities was compared 0 with the detected fMRI responses in ten patients with temporal lobe spikes. Using multiple HRFs resulted in an increased percentage of data sets with significant fMRI activations, from 45% when using the standard HRF alone, to 62.5%. The standard HRF was good at detecting positive BOLD responses, but less appropriate for negative BOLD responses, the majority of which were more accurately modelled by an HRF that peaked later than the standard. Co-registration of statistical maps with gadolinium-enhanced MRIs suggested that the detected fMRI responses were not in general related to large veins. Signal loss in the temporal lobes seemed to be an important factor in 7 of 12 patients who did not show fMRI activations with any of the HRFs. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

These transgenic mice develop Abeta deposits in muscles but not in brain. Cell metabolic activity was analyzed in brain regions and muscle by cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry, the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain. By comparison to age-matched controls of the C57BL/6 strain, CO activity was selectively increased in dark skeletal muscle fibers of Tg13592 mice. In addition, only increases in CO activity were obtained in those brain regions where a significant difference appeared. The CO activity of Tg13592 mice was elevated in several thalamic nuclei, including laterodorsal, ventromedial, and midline as well as submedial, intralaminar, and reticular. In contrast, the groups did,not differ in most cortical regions, except for prefrontal, secondary motor, and auditory cortices, and in most brainstem regions, except for cerebellar (fastigial and interpositus) nuclei and related areas (red and lateral vestibular nuclei). No variation in cell density and surface area appeared in conjunction with these enzymatic alterations. The overproduction of betaAPP-C99 fragments in brain without (amyloidosis did not appear to affect the metabolic activity of structures particularly vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease.

Despite its name, specific language impairment is frequently not specific. It is common to find associated impairments in motor skills, cognitive function, attention, and reading in children who meet criteria for specific language impairment. There is evidence that limitation in phonologic working memory may be a core deficit in specific language impairment. Both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to be important etiologic factors in specific language impairment. Structural neuroimaging studies suggest that atypical patterns of asymmetry of language cortex, white-matter abnormalities, and cortical dysplasia may be associated with specific language impairment. Abnormalities in the later stages of auditory processing have been demonstrated using auditory event-related potentials. Functional neuroimaging may cast further light on the neurobiology of specific language impairment and serve as a means of developing and evaluating therapy. A better understanding of the neurobiology of specific language impairment is critical for the rational development of therapeutic strategies to treat this common disorder.

This makes it possible to determine the regions of the brain showing changes in the fMRI signal in response to epileptic spikes occurring in the EEG. This article reviews the experience with this method in more than 100 studies performed over the last 4 years at the Montreal Neurological Institute. The technique is complex, and the authors review the various issues related to obtaining a good-quality EEG in the hostile environment of the magnetic resonance scanner, the statistical analysis of magnetic resonance images, in particular the issue of knowing what is the hemodynamic response function appropriate for the analysis of epileptic spikes, and the combination of EEG and fMRI results. The difficult theoretical issues raised by the interpretation of activation and deactivation, both frequently seen in response to spikes, are discussed. Finally, the authors give examples of fMRI responses seen with focal spikes and with generalized spike and wave discharges.

Patients and Methods Between 1987 and 1995, 369 children treated on two consecutive Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium protocols for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia were randomly assigned to conventionally fractionated CRT (CFX) or hyperfractionated CRT (HFX) to a total dose of 18 Gy. Neuropsychologic testing was completed for 125 of 287 children in continuous complete remission. Event-free and overall survival, as well as neuropsychologic function, were compared for the two arms of the protocol. Results Eight-year event-free survival (+/-SE) was 80% +/- 3% for children randomly assigned to CFX and 72% +/- 3% for HFX (P = .06). Overall survival was 85% +/- 3% for CFX and 78% +/- 3% for HFX (P = .06). CNS relapses occurred in 2.8% of patients receiving CFX and 2.7% receiving HFX (P = .99). Cognitive function for both groups was solidly in the average range, with no group differences in intelligence, academic achievement, visuospatial reasoning, or verbal learning. Children on the HFX arm exhibited a modest advantage for visual memory (P < .05). Conclusion HFX provides no benefit in terms of cognitive late effects and may compromise antileukemic efficacy. HFX should not be substituted for conventionally dosed CRT in children who require radiation therapy for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. (C) 2004 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Previous studies, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), showed that perceiving visual and auditory speech increased the excitability of the orofacial motor system during speech perception. Such studies, however, cannot tell us which brain regions mediate this effect. in this study, we used the technique of combining positron emission tomography with TMS to identify the brain regions that modulate the excitability of the motor system during speech perception. Our results show that during auditory speech perception, there is increased excitability of motor system underlying speech production and that this increase is significantly correlated with activity in the posterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), We propose that this area "primes" the motor system in response to heard speech even when no speech output is required and, as such, operates at the interface of perception and action.

Variable selection is an effective method to reduce the dimensionality but may discard some valuable information. This paper introduces Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), a local non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, that can statistically discover a low-dimensional representation of the chemical data. LLE is shown to create more stable representations than other non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms, and to be capable of capturing non-linearity in chemical data.

J	Zayed, TM; Halpin, DW				Zayed, TM; Halpin, DW			Process versus data oriented techniques in pile construction productivity assessment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article								A large number of problems faces the installation of pile (drilled shaft) foundations: unseen subsurface obstacles, lack of contractor experience, site planning, etc. These problems make it difficult for the estimator to assess the pile construction productivity and cost. Several techniques might be good candidates for this assessment problem. A fundamental question arises: which technique is the most appropriate to solve this assessment problem? This study focuses on answering this fundamental research question. Data were collected through designed questionnaires, site interviews, and telephone calls to experts in different construction companies. Four different techniques were listed as candidates to solve this problem: deterministic, simulation, multiple regression, and artificial neural network (ANN). They were categorized into two groups: process oriented techniques, deterministic and simulation; and data oriented techniques (DOT), regression and ANN.

J	Robichaud, M; Debonnel, G				Robichaud, M; Debonnel, G			Modulation of the firing activity of female dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic neurons by neuroactive steroids	JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							MAMMALIAN CORTICAL-NEURONS; GONADAL STATUS MODULATION; RECEPTOR COMPLEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RAT-BRAIN; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; RECOGNITION SITES; SIGMA-RECEPTORS; A RECEPTOR; SHORT-TERM	Important gender differences in mood disorders result in a greater susceptibility for women. Accumulating evidence suggests a reciprocal modulation between the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system and neuroactive steroids. Previous data from our laboratory have shown that during pregnancy, the firing activity of 5-HT neurons increases in parallel with progesterone levels. This study was undertaken to evaluate the putative modulation of the 5-HT neuronal firing activity by different neurosteroids. Female rats received i.c.v. for 7 days a dose of 50 mug/kg per day of one of the following steroids: progesterone, pregnenolone, 5beta-pregnane-3,20-dione (5beta-DHP), 5beta-pregnan-3alpha-ol,20-one, 5beta-pregnan-3beta-ol,20-one, 5alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione, 5beta-pregnan-3beta-ol,20-one (allopregnanolone, 3alpha,5alpha-THP), 5alpha-pregnane-3beta-ol,20-one and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). 5beta-DHP and DHEA were also administered for 14 and 21 days (50 mug/kg per day, i.c.v.) as well as concomitantly with the selective sigma 1 (sigma(1)) receptor antagonist NE-100. In vivo, extracellular unitary recording of 5-HT neurons performed in the dorsal raphe nucleus of these rats revealed that DHEA, 5beta-DHP and 3alpha,5alpha-THP significantly increased the firing activity of the 5-HT neurons. Interestingly, 5beta-DHP and DHEA showed different time-frames for their effects with 5beta-DHP having its greatest effect after 7 days to return to control values after 21 days, whereas DHEA demonstrated a sustained effect over the 21 day period. NE-100 prevented the effect of DHEA but not of 5beta-DHP, thus indicating that its sigma(1) receptors mediate the effect of DHEA but not that of 5beta-DHP. In conclusion, our results offer a cellular basis for potential antidepressant effects of neurosteroids, which may prove important particularly for women with affective disorders.

It is not known if chemotropism contributes to directing the invasion of brain tissue by glioma cells. A model system has been developed that allows quantification of invasive behavior using gliomas spheroids embedded in collagen gels. Here we provide evidence that glioma spheroids secrete a chemorepellent factor(s) that directs cells away from the spheroid and into the collagen matrix. The relationship between total invasion, cell number, and implantation distance suggests that glioma cells respond to a gradient of the chemorepellent cue(s) that is well established at 48 h. C6 astrocytoma cells normally invade the collagen at an angle perpendicular to the spheroid edge. In contrast, an adjacent spheroid causes cells to turn away from their normal trajectory and slow their rate of invasion. As-trocytoma cells are repelled by an adjacent glioma spheroid but rapidly infiltrate astrocyte aggregates, indicating that astrocytes do not express the repellent cue. Uniform concentrations of repellent. factor(s) in spheroid conditioned medium overwhelm endogenous gradients and render glioma cells less able to exhibit this chemotropic response. Concentration gradients of spheroid conditioned medium in cell migration assays also demonstrate the chemorepellent cue(s)'s tropic effect. Our findings indicate that glioma spheroids produce a secreted diffusible cue(s) that promotes glioma cell invasion. Identification of this factor(s) may advance current therapies that aim to limit tumor cell invasion. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While progenitor cells were more sensitive than mature oligodendrocytes to H2O2, the antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, blocked toxicity at both stages of development. Differentiated oligodendrocytes contained more glutathione than did progenitors and were less susceptible to decreases in glutathione concentration induced by H2O2 stress. As free radicals have been considered to serve as second messengers, we examined the effect of H2O2 on activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and p38. H2O2 caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in MAPK phosphorylation, an effect that was totally blocked by N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Further exploration of potential mechanisms involved in oligodendrocyte cell death showed that H2O2 treatment caused DNA condensation and fragmentation at both stages of development, whereas caspase 3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage were significantly increased only in oligodendrocyte progenitors. The pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone, blocked DNA fragmentation in progenitors and produced a small but significant level of protection from H2O2 toxicity in progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes. In contrast, inhibitors of both p38 and MEK reduced H2O2-induced death most significantly in oligodendrocytes. The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, PJ34, reduced H2O2-induced toxicity on its own but was most effective when combined with benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone or PD169316. The finding that molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to reactive oxygen species toxicity are regulated during oligodendrocyte differentiation may be of importance in designing therapies for certain neurological diseases affecting white matter.

In this investigation, eight individuals performed a single bout of high intensity exercise with one leg, the contralateral leg being the control. A significant increase in mononuclear cells staining for the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and fetal antigen 1 (FA1) were observed within the exercised human vastus lateralis muscle on days 4 and 8 post exercise. In addition, a significant increase in the concentration of the FA1 protein was determined in intramuscular dialysate samples taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of the exercising leg (day 0: 1.89 +/- 0.82 ng ml(-1); day 2: 1.68 +/- 0.37 ng ml-1; day 4: 3.26 +/- 1.29 ng ml(-1), P < 0.05 versus basal; day 8: 4.68 +/- 2.06 ng ml-1, P < 0.05 versus basal and control). No change was noted in the control leg. Despite this increase in N-CAM- and FA1-positive mononuclear cells, an increased expression of myogenin and the neonatal isoform of the myosin heavy chain (MHCn) was not observed. Interestingly, myofibre lesions resulting from extensive damage to the proteins within the myofibre, particularly desmin or dystrophin, were not observed, and hence did not appear to induce the expression of either N-CAM or FA1. We therefore propose that satellite cells can be induced to re-enter the cell growth cycle after a single bout of unaccustomed high intensity exercise. However, a single bout of exercise is not sufficient for the satellite cell to undergo terminal differentiation.

Clinical studies suggest that, in some patients with major depression, rTMS has the potential to alleviate symptoms that may be related to functional abnormalities in a frontocingulate circuit. This paper reviews the rationale for the use of rTMS in this context. The following topics are discussed: symptoms and cognition in major depression, with special emphasis on the initiation of speech; neuroimaging studies of depression; rTMS as treatment for depression; structure and function of the mid-dorsolateral frontal and anterior cingulate cortices; and combined TMS/positron emission tomography studies of frontocortical connectivity.

Although much attention has been paid to the co-release of small-molecule neurotransmitters with neuropeptides, a number of examples of co-release of 2 small-molecule neurotransmitters have now been described. It has been suggested recently that monoamine neurons use glutamate as a co-transmitter. First, both serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) neurons in culture establish functional glutamatergic synapses in addition to classic terminals that release 5-HT or DA. Second, immunocytochemical work has provided evidence for the presence of neurotransmitter pools of glutamate in DA, 5-HT and noradrenergic neurons. Third, the recent cloning of 3 vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-3) has led to the discovery that noradrenergic neurons contain VGLUT2 mRNA, whereas 5-HT neurons contain VGLUT3 mRNA. Finally, although VGLUT2 mRNA does not appear to be abundant in DA neurons in the adult brain, DA neurons cultured from neonatal animals express VGLUT2, suggesting that these neurons may have the capacity to express this protein under specific conditions. Taken together with recent work describing the capacity of neurons to change neurotransmitter phenotype during development or in an activity-dependent manner, the finding of glutamate co-transmission in monoamine neurons may lead to significant revisions of current physiologic models of monoamine neuron function. In addition, the possible role of glutamate co-release in physiopathologic models of diseases that implicate central monoamine pathways, such as schizophrenia, must now be seriously considered.

Seventy one participants already enrolled in a larger-scale study assessing the impact of TBI (i.e., the South Eastern Michigan Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems project) completed a self-report measure of African American acculturation (African American Acculturation Scale-Short Form; Landrine & Klonoff, 1995) in addition to a standardized battery of neuropsychological tests. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between level of acculturation and test performance after controlling for injury-related (initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, time since injury) and demographic variables (age, sex, years of education, and socioeconomic status). Lower levels of acculturation were associated with significantly poorer performances on the Galveston Orientation & Amnesia Test, MAE Tokens test, WAIS-R Block Design, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Symbol Digit Modalities Test. Decreased levels of acculturation were also significantly related to lower scores on a composite indicator of overall neuropsychological test performance. In addition, the examiner's ethnicity (Black or White) was related with scores on a few of the tests (i.e., Block Design, Trail Making Test), but was not significantly associated with the overall neuropsychological test performance. Overall, these findings suggest that differences in cultural experience may be an important factor in the neuropsychological assessment of African Americans following TBI, and provide additional support for the hypothesis that cultural factors may partially account for the differences among ethnic/cultural groups on neuropsychological tests.

When subsequently tested in the same closed compartment with no shock, normal rats showed an increased tendency to freeze. They also showed an increased tendency to actively avoid the compartment when given access to an adjacent neutral compartment for the first time. Amygdala inactivation with bilateral muscimol injections before training attenuated freezing and eliminated avoidance during the test. Rats trained in a normal state and given intra-amygdala muscimol injections before the test did not freeze or avoid the shock-paired compartment. This pattern of effects Suggests that amygdala inactivation during training impaired acquisition of a conditioned response (CR) due either to inactivation of a neural substrate essential for its storage or to elimination of a memory modulation effect that facilitates its storage in some other brain region(s). The elimination of both freezing and active avoidance by amygdala inactivation during testing suggests that neither of these behaviors is the CR. The possibility that the CR is a set of internal responses that produces both freezing and avoidance as well as other behavioral effects is discussed.

Although neurofilaments (NFs) constitute the main cytoskeletal network in these structures, the mechanism that underlies subunit incorporation into filaments remains a mystery. Here we report that NUDEL, a mammalian homologue of the Aspergillus nidulans nuclear distribution molecule NudE, is important for NF assembly, transport and neuronal integrity. NUDEL facilitates the polymerization of NFs through a direct interaction with the NF light subunit (NF-L). Knockdown of NUDEL by RNA interference (RNAi) in a neuroblastoma cell line, primary cortical neurons or post-natal mouse brain destabilizes NF-L and alters the homeostasis of NFs. This results in NF abnormalities and morphological changes reminiscent of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, variations in levels of NUDEL correlate with disease progression and NF defects in a mouse model of neurodegeneration. Thus, NUDEL contributes to the integrity of CNS neurons by regulating NF assembly.

Caveolin is a cholesterol-binding membrane protein involved in cellular cholesterol transport. We investigated the changes in the protein amount of hippocampal caveolin of autopsy-confirmed AD and aged-matched control subjects. Our results demonstrate that caveolin protein levels in the hippocampus and caveolin mRNA in the frontal cortex are up-regulated in AD by approximately two-fold, compared to control brains. These results suggest a relationship between caveolin-1 expression levels and a dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis at the plasma membrane of brain cells. In support of this hypothesis, a significant increase in caveolin protein levels has also been observed in hippocampal tissue from ApoE-deficient (knockout) and aged wild-type mice; two situations associated with modifications of transbilayer distribution of cholesterol in brain synaptic plasma membranes. These results indicate that caveolin over-expression is linked to alterations of cholesterol distribution in the plasma membrane of brain cells and are consistent with the notion of a deterioration of cholesterol homeostasis in AD.

Previous studies provide evidence for a role implicating nitric oxide (NO) in the pathogenesis of cell death due to thiamine deficiency. In order to ascertain the origin of increased NO in the thiamine deficient brain, expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase isoform (eNOS), was measured in the medial thalamus and in the inferior colliculus and compared to the frontal cortex (a spared region) of rats in which thiamine deficiency was induced through a feeding protocol of thiamine-deficient diet concomitant with daily administration of pyrithiamine, a central thiamine antagonist. eNOS mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased as a function of the severity of neurological impairment and the degree of neuronal cell loss in the medial thalamus and in the inferior colliculus. These findings suggest that the vascular endothelium is a major site of NO production in the brain in thiamine deficiency and that eNOS-derived NO could account for the selective damage to the thalamic structures that are observed in this particular disorder.

We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) with positron emission tomography (PET) during the encoding of nonverbal abstract auditory stimuli in a group of young healthy volunteers. The results demonstrate that the left orbitofrontal cortex, area 11 in particular, is involved in the encoding of auditory information. We suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex is a critical frontal region that can exert top-down regulation of other regions of the brain including the medial temporal structures and the lateral frontal cortex, enabling the further processing of information.

Because they normally mediate an inhibition of neuronal firing, their desensitization is a prerequisite to the delayed enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission upon treatment with monoamine oxidase (MAOI) inhibitors or specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Using beta-sensitive microprobes in vivo, we measured a significant decrease (-30%) in binding sites for the 5-HT1A PET radioligand [F-18]MPPF associated with an equivalent reduction (-34%) in the cell surface density of 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity (internalization), in the nucleus raphe dorsalis (autoreceptors), but not hippocampus (heteroreceptors), of rats given a single dose of the specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, iv). This effect was completely blocked by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635. Having ruled out that this decreased density of [F-18]MPPF binding in the nucleus raphe dorsalis of 8-OH-DPAT-treated rats resulted from a local blood flow effect, we obtained autoradiographic evidence indicating that the total amount of specific binding of [F-18]MPPF in tissue sections was unaffected by the 8-OH-DPAT treatment in either NRD or hippocampus. It was therefore concluded that the internalization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors accounted for the decreased binding in vivo of [F-18]MPPF in the nucleus raphe dorsalis of rats treated with 8-OH-DPAT. Thus, PET imaging might provide a mean to measure 5-HT1A receptor internalization in human brain and thus assess responsiveness to antidepressant treatment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Also, CVD frequently contributes to cognitive loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progress in understanding the pathogenetic mechanism involved in vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia (VaD) has resulted in promising treatments of these conditions. Cholinergic deficits in VaD are due to ischemia of basal forebrain nuclei and of cholinergic pathways and can be treated with the use of the cholinesterase inhibitors used in AD. Controlled clinical trials with donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine in VaD, as well as in patients with AD plus CVD, have demostrated improvement in cognition, behavior and activites of daily living.

By comparison to Balb/c controls, Reln(rl-orl) mutants did not alternate spontaneously in a T-maze and were deficient for visuomotor guidance in a water maze. Despite cerebellar ataxia and motor coordination impairments on stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests, the horizontal motor activity of Reln(rl-orl) mutants was not reduced in an open-field. The elevated cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity in Purkinje cells and the reduced CO activity in the roof nuclei (interpositus and dentate) of the mutants were associated with poor performance on the small stationary beam. In addition, deficient CO activity of the granular layer of the motor cortex was associated with shorter latencies before falling from the larger stationary beam and a lower number of rears in the open-field. Conversely, elevated CO activity in the polymorphic layer of primary somatosensory cortex was congruent with higher latencies before falling from the same apparatus, indicating functional compensation.

These include adenosine A(2A) receptor-dopamine D-2 receptor heteromers, which are most probably localized in the dendritic spines of the striatopallidal GABAergic neurons, where they are in a position to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission. The discovery of A(2A) receptor-dopamine D-2 receptor heteromers gives a frame for the well-known antagonistic interaction between both receptors, which is the bases for a new therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and schizoprenia. The present review deals mainly with the biochemical and molecular aspects of A(2A) receptor-dopamine D-2 receptor interactions. Recent results at the molecular level show that A(2A) receptor-dopamine D-2 receptor heteromers represent the first example of epitope-epitope electrostatic interaction underlying receptor heteromerization. Most probably A(2A) receptor-D-2 receptor heteromerization is not static, but subject to a dynamic regulation, related to the phosphorylation dependence of the A(2A) receptor epitope and to the ability of the D-2 receptor epitope to bind different partners. Finding out the mechanisms involved in this dynamic regulation can have important implications for the treatment of basal ganglia disorders, schizophrenia and drug addiction. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: The Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition in Schizophrenia (SSTICS) [Compr. Psychiatry 44 (2003) 33 1] was used to assess cognitive complaints in 73 subjects with schizophrenia. Visuo-spatial tests of the Cambridge Neuropsychologic at Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) [Cogn. Neuropsychiatry 3 (1998) 45] were administered as objective measures. Results: Cognitive complaints ill several cognitive domains were mainly correlated with a true difficulty in memory. Higher SSTICS attention scores, i.e. increased complaints, were associated with poorer CANTAB explicit visual memory and planning performances. Higher SSTICS executive functioning scores were associated with poorer CANTAB explicit visual memory scores. Conclusion: These findings suggest that outpatients with schizophrenia express some cognitive difficulties. However, the cognitive nature of these subjective complaints does not strictly correspond with objective performances. These results also suggest that theoretical constructs of cognitive functions do not always have ecological validity. Thus, subjective cognitive complaints should be taken into account in assessment of patient wellbeing, but cannot be used as a substitute to objective cognitive measures. The simultaneous use of subjective and objective measures of cognitive dysfunction may provide a more complete picture of individual rehabilitation targets in patients with schizophrenia.

In the present study, we have investigated the changes in SSTR subtypes at the cellular and molecular level in both the brain and the pancreatic islets of mice deficient in SSTR5 (SSTR5KO). Expression levels of insulin and glucagon were also determined in the pancreas of these mice. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed significant increases in the expression of SSTR2 and 3 with a corresponding reduction in SSTR4 in the brains of female SSTR5KOs, while no changes were observed in male KOs. Strikingly, SST mRNA and SST-like immunoreactivity (SST-L1) were reduced in the brain of male KO animals but not in their female counterparts. In male SSTR5KO islets, there was an increase in the number of cells immunoreactive for SSTR1-3, whereas in female islets only SSTR3 expression was increased. Pancreatic SST-L1 and SST mRNA, as well as immunoreactivity for insulin were reduced in male but not in female KO mice. These data indicate that deficiency of SSTR5 leads to subtype-selective sexually dimorphic changes in the expression of both brain and pancreatic SSTRs. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Objective: To characterize the clinical features of 19 patients with PQD and analyze the postsurgical outcome of those who underwent resection of dysplastic tissue. Methods: The extent and nature of the malformation were primarily assessed with high-resolution brain imaging. Fourteen patients underwent complete or partial temporoparieto-occipital resection or temporal resection associated with parieto-occipital disconnection. Postoperative follow-up period ranged from 8 months to 7 years. The authors used the Engel classification for postoperative outcome. Results: All patients were sporadic. Clinical features included infantile spasms, partial seizures, mental retardation, mild hemiparesis, and visual field defects. Neuroimaging localized the malformation within the posterior cerebral quadrant contralateral to the neurologic deficit and demonstrated hemihemimegalencephaly in 14 of 19 patients and multilobar cortical dysplasia in 5 of 19 patients. The authors observed class I outcome in six patients. Two patients had class II and four patients had class III outcome. Class IV outcome was seen in two patients. After surgery, two patients developed mild hemiparesis, and two developed a visual field defect. Conclusions: Widespread cortical dysplasia is more frequent in the posterior quadrant. In our series, posterior quadrantic dysplasia represents either hemi-hemimegalencephaly or multilobar cortical dysplasia. Individuals with posterior quadrantic dysplasia share a spectrum of clinical features. The intractable epilepsy in these patients may be alleviated by a large quadrantic temporoparieto-occipital resection.

Within the complex, 14-3-3 simultaneously binds to tau and GSK3beta (Agarwal-Mawal, A., Qureshi, H. Y., Cafferty, P. W., Yuan, Z., Han, D., Lin, R., and Paudel, H. K. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 12722 - 12728). The molecular mechanism by which 14-3-3 connects GSK3beta to tau within the complex is not clear. In this study, we find that GSK3beta within the tau phosphorylation complex is phosphorylated on Ser(9). From extracts of rat brain and rat primary cultured neurons, Ser(9)-phosphorylated GSK3beta precipitates with glutathione-agarose beads coated with glutathione S-transferase-14-3-3. Similarly, from rat brain extract, Ser(9)-phosphorylated GSK3beta coimmunoprecipitates with tau. In vitro, 14-3-3 binds to GSK3beta only when the kinase is phosphorylated on Ser(9). In transfected HEK-293 cells, 14-3-3 binds to Ser(9)-phosphorylated GSK3beta and does not bind to GSK3beta (S9A). Tau, on the other hand, binds to both GSK3beta (WT) and GSK3beta (S9A). Moreover, 14-3-3 enhances the binding of tau with Ser9- phosphorylated GSK3beta by similar to3-fold but not with GSK3beta (S9A). Similarly, 14-3-3 stimulates phosphorylation of tau by Ser(9)- phosphorylated GSK3beta but not by GSK3beta (S9A). In transfected HEK-293 cells, Ser9 phosphorylation suppresses GSK3beta-catalyzed tau phosphorylation in the absence of 14-3-3. In the presence of 14-3-3, however, Ser(9)- phosphorylated GSK3beta remains active and phosphorylates tau. Our data indicate that within the tau phosphorylation complex, 14-3-3 connects Ser(9)- phosphorylated GSK3beta to tau and Ser9- phosphorylated GSK3beta phosphorylates tau.

Under basal conditions, intrathecal injection of Fluo-DLT resulted in the labeling of numerous deltaOR-internalizing neurons throughout dorsal and ventral horns. The distribution and number of Fluo-DLT-labeled perikaryal profiles were consistent with that of deltaOR-expressing neurons, as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, suggesting that a large proportion of these cells was responsive to intrathecally administered deltaOR agonists. Pretreatment of rats with morphine for 48 hr resulted in a selective increase in Fluo-DLT-labeled perikaryal profiles within the dorsal horn. These changes were not accompanied by corresponding augmentations in either deltaOR mRNA or I-125-deltorphin-II binding levels, suggesting that they were attributable to higher densities of cell surface deltaOR available for internalization rather than to enhanced production of the receptor. Unilateral dorsal rhizotomy also resulted in increased Fluo-DLT internalization in the ipsilateral dorsal horn when compared with the side contralateral to the deafferentation or to non-deafferented controls, suggesting that deltaOR trafficking in dorsal horn neurons may be regulated by afferent inputs. Furthermore, morphine treatment no longer increased Fluo-DLT internalization on either side of the spinal cord after unilateral dorsal rhizotomy, indicating that muOR-induced changes in the cell surface availability of muOR depend on the integrity of primary afferent inputs. Together, these results suggest that regulation of deltaOR responsiveness through muOR activation in this region is linked to somatosensory information processing.

Peptidases of this family are type II integral-membrane proteins characterized by short cytosolic domains and large extracellular domains containing the active site. The M13 family has, at present, seven members, including ECEL1 (endothelin-converting enzyme-like 1), one of the newest members. ECEL1 is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system. It has been proposed that the enzyme has a role in the nervous regulation of the respiratory system. No physiological substrate has been identified yet. To better understand the function(s) of this enzyme, we have expressed human ECEL1 in cultured cells and monitored its biosynthesis and subcellular localization. Immunoblot and cell-surface biotinylation analysis of transfected cells expressing ECEL1 showed that only a fraction of the protein travelled to the cell surface, while most of the enzyme was present in an intracellular compartment identified by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation as the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). Pulse-chase experiments showed that ER-localized ECEL1 was stable, with a half-life of more than 3 h. Endogenous ECEL1 from mouse pituitary gland had a similar distribution between the cell surface and the ER. Finally, using domain-swapping experiments with neprilysin, another member of the M13 family, we showed that localization of ECEL1 to the ER requires both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. It thus appears that ECEL1 may have functions both at the cell surface and in the ER.

J	Brown, CH; Bourque, CW				Brown, CH; Bourque, CW			Autocrine feedback inhibition of plateau potentials terminates phasic bursts in magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the rat supraoptic nucleus	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTOR; DEPOLARIZING AFTER-POTENTIALS; NEURONS IN-VITRO; VASOPRESSIN CELLS; NEUROENDOCRINE CELLS; RELEASED PEPTIDES; ALPHA-LATROTOXIN; OXYTOCIN; HYPOTHALAMUS; MODULATION	Phasic activity in magnocellular neurosecretory cells is characterized by alternating periods of activity (bursts) and silence. During phasic bursts, action potentials are superimposed on plateau potentials that are generated by summation of depolarizing after-potentials. Dynorphin is copackaged in vasopressin neurosecretory vesicles that are exocytosed from magnocellular neurosecretory cell dendrites and terminals, and both peptides have been implicated in the generation of phasic activity. Here we show that somato-dendritic dynorphin release terminates phasic bursts by autocrine inhibition of plateau potentials in magnocellular neurosecretory cells recorded intracellularly from hypothalamic explants using sharp electrodes. Conditioning spike trains caused an activity-dependent reduction of depolarizing afterpotential amplitude that was partially reversed by alpha-latrotoxin (which depletes neurosecretory vesicles) and by nor-binaltorphimine (kappa-opioid receptor antagonist), but not by an oxytocin/vasopressin receptor antagonist or a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, indicating that activity-dependent inhibition of depolarizing after-potentials requires exocytosis of an endogenous kappa-opioid peptide. kappa-Opioid inhibition of depolarizing after-potentials was not mediated by actions on evoked after-hyperpolarizations since these were not affected by kappa-opioid receptor agonists or antagonists. Evoked bursts were prolonged by antagonism of kappa-opioid receptors with nor-binaltorphimine and by depletion of neurosecretory vesicles by alpha-latrotoxin, becoming everlasting in similar to50% of cells. Finally, spontaneously active neurones exposed to nor-binaltorphimine switched from phasic to continuous firing as plateau potentials became non-inactivating. Thus, dynorphin coreleased with vasopressin generates phasic activity through activity-dependent feedback inhibition of plateau potentials in magnocellular neurosecretory cells.

It was found that a committee of nets models the experimental data more accurately than a single model. The trained network was then applied to a low-carbon low-silicon steel in order to estimate the appropriate heat treatment process conditions. To explain variations in the mechanical properties, the material was subjected to a typical two-stages intercritical annealing and bainitic holding treatment. According to the results of model, tempering of material for a shorter time results in higher tensile strength and percentage elongation values. This behavior was later confirmed by microstructural studies and was attributed to both higher austenite volume fraction and higher martensite content in the samples tempered for a shorter bainitic holding.

Because specific binding sites for this peptide have been reported in numerous tissues including the brain, it has been suggested that a specific Ang IV receptor (AT4) might exist. Bolus injection of Ang IV in brain ventricles has been implicated in learning, memory, and localized vasodilatation. However, the functions of Ang IV in a physiological context are still unknown. In this study, we generated a transgenic (TG) mouse model that chronically releases Ang IV peptide specifically in the brain. TG mice were found to be hypertensive by the tail-cuff method as compared with control littermates. Treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had no effect on blood pressure, but surprisingly treatment with the Ang II AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan normalized the blood pressure despite the fact that the levels of Ang IV in the brains of TG mice were only 4-fold elevated over the normal endogenous level of Ang peptides. Calcium mobilization assays performed on cultured CHO cells chronically transfected with the AT1 receptor confirm that low-dose Ang IV can mobilize calcium via the AT1 receptor only in the presence of Ang II, consistent with an allosteric mechanism. These results suggest that chronic elevation of Ang IV in the brain can induce hypertension that can be treated with angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists.

U50 analgesia can be blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801 (MK), in male rodents and gonadectomized females, but not hormonally intact or estrogen-replaced fern ales, Suggesting the existence of alternate neurochemical mediation in females. We now report that MK antagonism of U50 analgesia is age-dependent in females. That is, reproductively senescent females display MK-sensitive U50 analgesia qualitatively similar to that displayed by males or hormonally deprived young females. Age-related reductions in U50 analgesic magnitude were also observed in females. Thus, age and gender are likely to alter the clinical efficacy of analgesic drugs active at kappa-opioid receptors.

Here, we investigated whether androgen and estrogen could prevent iAbeta(1-42) toxicity, because both these hormones have a wide range of neuroprotective actions. At physiological concentrations, 17-beta-estradiol, testosterone, and methyl testosterone reduce iAbeta(1-42)-induced cell death by 50% in neurons treated after the injection and by 80-90% in neurons treated 1 hr before the injection. The neuroprotective action of the hormones is mediated by receptors, because the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist tamoxifen and the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist flutamide completely block the estrogen- and androgen-mediated neuroprotection, respectively. Transcriptional activity is required for the neuroprotective action, because dominant negative forms of the receptors that block the transcriptional activity of the ER and AR prevent estrogen- and androgen-mediated neuroprotection. Proteomics followed by Western blot analyses identified increased levels of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) in testosterone- and estrogen-treated human neurons. Comicroinjection of Hsp70 with the iAbeta(1-42) blocks the toxicity of iAbeta(1-42). We conclude that estrogen and androgens protect human neurons against iAbeta(1-42) toxicity by increasing the levels of Hsp70 in the neurons.

We have demonstrated previously, using immunoelectron microscopy with specific 5-HT1A antibodies, that an internalization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors is associated with their desensitization in rats given a single dose of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin. Here, we examined the subcellular distribution of 5-HT1A receptors in dendrites from nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD)(autoreceptors) and hippocampus (heteroreceptors) after acute treatment with the antidepressant SSRI, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). In parallel experiments, the kinetics of in vivo binding of the 5-HT1A positron emission tomography radioligand 4,2-(methoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(N-2-pyridinyl)-p-fluorobenzamido] ethylpiperazine ([F-18] MPPF) was measured in these two brain regions by means of stereotaxically implanted beta microprobes. One hour after treatment, there was a 36% decrease in 5-HT1A immunogold labeling of the plasma membrane of NRD dendrites, and a concomitant increase in their cytoplasmic labeling, without any change in hippocampal dendrites. In vivo binding of [F-18] MPPF was reduced by 35% in NRD and unchanged in hippocampus. Both effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide) (1 mg/kg, i.p.). In brain sections of NRD and hippocampus, [F-18] MPPF autoradiographic labeling did not differ between fluoxetine- and saline-treated rats. These immunocytochemical results confirmed that internalization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors may account for their desensitization, and the microprobe results suggest that this prerequisite for antidepressant treatment efficacy could be amenable to brain imaging in humans.

The duration of imagined and executed movements of the arm and leg was compared. Both executed and imagined movements took longer with the affected limbs than with the unaffected limbs. For both tasks, the duration of movements with the unaffected limbs was longer in the imagined than in the executed conditions, indicating a lack of temporal congruence on that side. Because the temporal uncoupling was found in the limbs contralateral to the intact hemisphere, we propose that this reflects a general slowing in motor imagery that is an indirect consequence of the lesion, rather than a deficit in movement representation within the unaffected hemisphere per se.

In Experiment 1 freezing was elevated during a period immediately following shock in rats that remained in the shock context, but not in rats that were moved to a different, neutral context. The two groups showed equally elevated c-Fos levels in both the central (CeA) and lateral (LA) nuclei. In Experiment 2 rats were shocked in one compartment (paired) and not shocked in another, distinct compartment (unpaired). Rats re-exposed to the paired compartment 24 h later froze more than rats exposed to the unpaired compartment, and rats in both groups froze more than un-shocked rats. c-Fos protein expression in CeA, LA and basolateral (BLA) nucleus was elevated in the rats exposed to the paired compartment but not in rats exposed to the unpaired compartment. Thus, c-Fos expression was induced by exposure to both unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, although it is unclear if the same cell population was activated in both cases. Neither case of c-Fos expression coincided with the occurrence of freezing. c-Fos expression may represent neural activity in LA and CeA produced by exposure to unconditioned cues and activity in BLA, LA and CeA produced by conditioned cues. This activity may contribute to an aversive affective state (or "fear"). Behaviors promoted by this state, such as freezing, may be mediated in other brain areas, or by other neurons in the amygdala.

Results show that a total of 64% of the cells were sensitive to phase disparities and had large tuning profiles. Similarly, a large proportion (75%) of those tested with position offsets showed one of the four classic disparity profiles, those of the tuned cells being rather coarse. When tested with both position and phase disparities, 54% of the cells showed sensitivity profiles to the two types of stimuli. The overall results suggest that the superior colliculus is involved in the analysis of coarse stereopsis and/or the planning and initiation of saccades during vergence eye movements and/or the control of fine adjustments to maintain fixation as the stimulus moves in depth.

In the present investigation, we tested the possibility that these differences between the two strains might be attributable to differential regulation of hippocampal alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors by calcium-dependent mechanisms. Using in vitro receptor autoradiography, we found that calcium treatment of C57 mice sections resulted in a marked increase of H-3-AMPA binding in areas CA(3) and CA(1) of the hippocampus and in the dentate gyrus. However, we discovered that the ability of calcium to upregulate H-3-AMPA binding in the DBA strain was much lower than in corresponding regions from the C57 strain. Western blot and immunohistochemical experiments indicated that truncation of AMPA receptor subunits by calcium-dependent mechanisms was possibly not responsible for the binding differences, as no significant variations in glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluR 1) and GluR2/3 immunoreactivity were observed between the two strains after calcium treatment. Interestingly, we found that strain-related variations in the regulation of H-3-AMPA binding by calcium were totally eliminated when brain sections were preincubated with preferential inhibitors of lipoxygenase (LO) pathways of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. Taken together, these results suggest that calcium-induced regulation of AMPA receptors varies between the two strains and that this variation might be linked to the production of specific AA metabolites.

In this study, we used PMG to compare NMB at the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) and the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle (LCA) in humans. Twelve patients were included in this study. Endotracheal intubation was performed without aid of neuromuscular blocking drugs. One small condenser microphone was inserted beside the vocal cords into the muscular process at the base of the arytenoid cartilage to record acoustic responses of the LCA (vocal cord adduction), and a second microphone was placed behind the larynx to measure NMB of the PCA (vocal cord abduction). Stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was performed using superficial electrodes placed at the neck (midline between jugular notch and cricoid cartilage) using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 s. After supramaximal stimulation, mivacurium 0.1 mg/kg was injected and onset, peak effect, and offset of NMB measured and compared using t-test (P < 0.05). The data are presented as mean (SD). Peak effect, onset time, and early recovery to 25% of control twitch height were not significantly different between PCA and LCA at 86% (13) versus 78% (16),2.3 min (0.45) versus 2.3 min (1.0), and 9.55 min (3.05) versus 8.5 min (4.7), respectively. However, recovery to 75%, 90% of control twitch height, and recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.8 were significantly longer at the PCA than at the LCA at 14 min (4) versus 11 min (5),17 min (5) versus 11.8 min (5.6), and 17.5 min (5.6) versus 12.3 min (5.5), respectively. The authors conclude that recovery of NMB at the PCA takes longer than at the LCA in humans after mivacurium.

Reduced synthesis of serotonin in the brain pathways mediating the expression of mood (ie, the limbic cortex) is a plausible candidate mechanism. Objectives: To measure and compare, using the alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan/positron emission tomography method, the brain trapping constant of alpha-[C-11] methyl-L-tryptophan (K*, milliliters per gram per minute), an index of serotonin synthesis, in brain areas involved in the regulation of mood in patients with major depression (MD) and age- and sex-matched controls. Design: Between-group comparison. Setting: Department of Psychiatry and Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University. Participants: Seventeen medication-free outpatients with a current episode of MD (9 women: mean +/- SD age, 41 +/- 11 years; 8 men: mean +/- SD age, 41 +/- 11 years) and 17 controls (9 women: mean +/- SD age, 37 +/- 15 years; 8 men: mean +/- SD age, 32.5 +/- 9.9 years). Main Outcome Measure: Normalized K*, normalized to the global mean, was measured in the dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and mesial temporal cortices; the thalamus; and the caudate nucleus. Results: Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, normalized K* was significantly decreased bilaterally in female patients with MD in the anterior cingulate cortex, in the left anterior cingulate cortex in male patients with MD, and in the left mesial temporal cortex in male and female patients with MD (P < .001 for all). Exploratory analyses identified additional patient-control differences for normalized K* (eg, inferior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule), most of which, once corrected for 38 multiple comparisons, lost their significance. Morphometric measurements of the cingulate cortex divisions confirmed that the reduction of normalized K* in depressed patients was not attributable to a reduction in gray matter volume. Normalized K* in the anterior cingulate cortex did not correlate with ratings of depression severity collected at the time of scan. Conclusions: Reduction of normalized K*, an index of serotonin synthesis, in parts of the limbic and paralimbic cortices may contribute to the biochemical alterations associated with MD.

Design: Single case-control study. Setting: A referred care center and university setting. Participants: Two men with spinal cord injury (SCI) and 2 control subjects. Intervention: Subjects were asked to self-stimulate with a Ferticare vibrator to induce ejaculation over 5 to 8 independent sessions. Main Outcome Measures: Penile tumescence, blood pressure, heart rate, electromyographic activity of the bulbocavernosus muscles, abdominal muscles, soleus H-reflex, and occurrence of ejaculation. Results: Changes on all measures were observed, with penile tumescence being more stable in control subjects. Blood pressure increased in both groups, whereas tachycardia was observed in controls and bradycardia in subjects with SCI. H-reflex dropped slightly in controls but increased in subjects with SCI. Muscular patterns differed on ejaculatory success or failure. Conclusions: Physiologic changes on all measures can be observed in men with SCI as a function of ejaculation. Changes include hypertension and bradycardia, characteristic of hyper-reflexia, and tachycardia in controls. The neural mechanisms underlying these patterns are discussed.

Neurocognitive accounts of antisocial behaviors are extended beyond the OFC. Several methodological shortcomings specific to this neuroscience approach to antisocial behavior are identified. A developmental approach is advocated to chart the developmental sequences of impaired brain development and of the various comorbid states typically seen in antisocial disorders.

The experiment described here is a follow-up study of previous visual lexical decision experiments (Tsapkini, Kehayia, & Jarema, 2002) that also addressed the regular-irregular distinction in Greek. In the present experiment, we investigated the effect of input modality in lexical processing and compared different types of regular and irregular verbs. In contrast to our previous intra-modal (visual-visual) priming experiments, in this cross-modal (auditory-visual) priming study, we found that regular verbs with an orthographically salient morphemic aspectual marker elicited the same facilitation as those without an orthographically salient marker. However, irregular verbs did not exhibit a different priming pattern with respect to modality. We interpret these results in the framework of a two-level lexical processing approach with modality-specific access representations at a surface level and modality-independent morphemic representations at a deeper level.

Objectives: Using a retrospective chart review, we compared 30 schizophrenia patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) with 30 schizophrenia patients, matched for age and sex, with no DM. We compared prevalence and severity of parkinsonism, akathisia, TD, dystonia, and antipsychotic type (that is, typical vs atypical). Results: We found no statistically significant differences between the DM group and the non-DM group prevalence and severity of EPS, including TD. Conclusion: We did not find DM and TD association to be significant in the era of atypical antipsychotics, possibly because of their antidyskinetic effect.

Methods: The EEG recordings of 9 persons with ASD and 8 control participants were recorded using a 12-electrode montage. Spectral analysis (0.75-19.75 Hz) was performed on EEG activity recorded upon two activated states: REM sleep and wakefulness. Results: During REM sleep, persons with ASD showed a selective, significantly lower absolute beta (13.0-19.75 Hz) spectral amplitude over the primary (O-1, O-2) and associative (T-5, T-6) cortical visual areas compared to controls. Persons with ASD showed significantly higher absolute theta (4.0-7.75 Hz) spectral amplitude over the left frontal pole region (Fp1) compared to controls during evening wakefulness, but not during morning wakefulness. Significance: The results of waking EEG are consistent with previously reported observations of neuropsychological signs of frontal atypicalities in ASD; results from REM sleep are the first EEG evidence to support the hypothesis of abnormal visuoperceptual functioning in ASD. Altogether, these results point toward atypical thalamo-cortical mechanisms subserving the neural processing of information in ASD. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In the present study, unconscious modulation of corticospinal excitability following presentation of self-images was probed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP) were collected from the contralateral first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle while subjects viewed masked pictures of their own face. MEP amplitudes were compared to those obtained when pictures of strangers were masked. Masked self-images induced a relative increase in corticospinal excitability when TMS was applied to the right primary motor cortex. These results demonstrate the utility of TMS to probe unconscious processing and support the notion of hemispheric asymmetry in the processing of self-images. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Higher demand during pregnancy leads to increased blood levels. Previous studies have suggested that environmental factors may influence blood Mn levels. As part of a community-based survey of potentially toxic environmental contaminants among pregnant women, the objective of this exploratory study was to examine the Mn status in pregnant women and their newborns with respect to sociodemographic and environmental variables. Pregnant women from Southwest Quebec were recruited in the first or second trimester through the public health prenatal program Mn was analyzed in mother's blood at entry into the study, in the second trimester (for those who entered during the first trimester), and-at delivery, as well as in umbilical cord blood and in placental tissue. Sociodemographic data and information about pregnancy were obtained by two questionnaires; the first was administered at study entry and the second a few weeks following birth. Results showed that mothers' Mn blood levels increased significantly during pregnancy and cord blood Mn levels were significantly higher than those for mothers' blood. There was no relation to age. Smokers had significantly lower Mn blood levels compared to nonsmokers at the second trimester. Those who lived in urban and/or agricultural areas had significantly higher levels compared to those who lived in small villages. Those who reported pesticide spraying less than I kin from their house likewise had significantly higher levels compared to the others. These findings suggest that lifestyle and environmental factors may interfere with the delicate balance and homeostatic mechanisms required to maintain Mn at optimal levels for physiological changes during pregnancy.

Methods: A right sensorimotor cortex freeze lesion was induced in postnatal day 1 (P1) rat pups, and HSs were provoked at P10 under continuous monitoring of core temperatures EEGs were recorded from the right amygdala during and after hyperthermia. Controls included both sham-operated at PI and naive rats. Results: HSs began with jaw myoclonus, followed by hindlimb clonus and generalized convulsions (GCs), and terminated by a period of posthyperthermia depression. The threshold temperature and latency of jaw myoclonus were similar across the groups. However, both the threshold temperature and latency of GCs were significantly lower in lesioned pups than in controls (40.5 +/- 0.5degreesC, n = 24, vs. 42.0 +/- 0.2degreesC, n = 2 1; p < 0.001; 6.7 &PLUSMN; 0.6 min, n = 20, vs. 8.4 &PLUSMN; 0.6 min, n = 22; p < 0.05). In lesioned pups, the threshold and latencies for jaw myoclonus and hindlimb clonus were similar, whereas in controls, the progression from one to the other was marked by significant differences in both parameters. Posthyperthermia depression was longer in lesioned (13.3 +/- 1.2 min, n = 21) than in control (8.0 +/- 0.8 min, n = 20; p < 0.0001) pups. Ictal EEG activity was recorded during both behavioral seizures and posthyperthermia depression. Conclusions: An HS in rats with a localized freeze lesion results in lower threshold GC and prolonged ictal manifestations, thus supporting a pathophysiologic link between focal cortical dysplasia and atypical febrile seizures, conditions that have a high prevalence in children with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

However, when seizures are unilateral occipital resections are now, occasionally, considered. When bilateral seizures and visual field defects exist, occipital resection can not be carried out. When predominantly lateralized, temporal seizure onset can be shown in such patients, palliative temporal resection may be justified. Methods: We report two patients with medically refractory, bilateral occipital lobe seizures. Clinical and electrophysiological patterns suggested consistent spread of the ictal discharge to temporal lobe structures. Long-term EEG video monitoring was followed by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) to assess involvement of temporal and occipital regions symmetrically. Results: Both patients had non-lateralized, elementary visual aura followed by loss of contact, automatisms, frequent falls and occasionally secondary generalization. Brain MR imaging revealed bilateral parieto-occipital ischemic lesions without concomitant temporal volumetric abnormalities. They had bilateral or unilateral visual field defects. Scalp EEGs showed bilateral temporal or temporo-parieto-occipital interictal and ictal epileptic abnormalities. Intracranial SEEG recordings confirmed the presence of multifocal, temporo-occipital epileptic abnormalities. In both however, disabling seizures originated in, or rapidly spread to the right hippocampus. Since occipital resections were inadvisable, both patients underwent selective, right amygdalo-hippocampectomy. Seizures continued in both (two-year follow-up), but were much less severe, not associated with falling or secondary generalization, not followed by fatigue or headache and with faster recovery. Conclusion: When occipital resection is inadvisable because of bilateral or diffuse visual problems, palliative temporal resection may be considered in patients with lesional, bilateral occipital lobe epilepsy, and rapid seizure spread to mesial temporal structures.

J	Brown, CH; Bull, PM; Bourque, CW				Brown, CH; Bull, PM; Bourque, CW			Phasic bursts in rat magnocellular neurosecretory cells are not intrinsically regenerative in vivo	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrophysiology; rat; supraoptic nucleus; vasopressin	SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; VASOPRESSIN NEURONS; OSMOTIC STIMULATION; NEUROENDOCRINE CELLS; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; RELEASE; INVITRO; HYPOTHALAMUS; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES	Vasopressinergic hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory cells fire in phasic bursts. Burst initiation involves summation of postsynaptic potentials to generate action potentials. Action potentials are each followed by a nonsynaptic depolarizing after-potential that summates temporally to generate a plateau potential and so sustain activity throughout the burst. It is unknown whether this plateau potential exceeds spike threshold in vivo to cause intrinsic regenerative firing or simply approaches threshold to increase the probability that excitatory postsynaptic potentials will trigger further action potentials. Here we show that pharmacological blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic transmission by microdialysis application of kynurenic acid into the supraoptic nucleus of anaesthetized rats prevents spontaneous bursts and bursts (after-discharge) evoked by short trains of antidromically stimulated action potentials in magnocellular neurosecretory cells. Even during prolonged depolarization induced by 1 M NaCl infusion, kynurenic acid microdialysis application still blocked after-discharge. The ability of kynurenic acid to block after-discharge during osmotic stimulation was not caused by an unmasking of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials as kynurenic acid was equally effective in the presence of the ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist, bicuculline, nor did it result from inhibition of plateau potential amplitude as this was unaffected by kynurenic acid and bicuculline in vitro, as was after-discharge evoked in vitro. We conclude that phasic bursts are nonregenerative in vivo but rather require continued excitatory synaptic input activity superimposed upon a subthreshold plateau potential to sustain burst activity.

The GDB algorithm is an adaptive blind beam forming algorithm and can be used to extract signals with cyclostationarity under a complex signal environment. Although the GDB algorithm suffers from slow convergence, it has a low computational complexity. Two more algorithms, called the boosted GDB and the beta GDB algorithms have been defined based on the GDB algorithm. All the algorithms have been simulated and compared. The boosted GDB and beta GDB algorithms are shown capable of providing fast convergence and satisfactory signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) performance, and can be used for implementation in real-time systems.

J	Ma, L; Khorasani, K				Ma, L; Khorasani, K			Facial expression recognition using constructive feedforward neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						constructive neural networks; facial recognition; generalization; pruning strategies; two-dimensional (2-D) discrete cosine transform	ALGORITHMS	A new technique for facial expression recognition is proposed, which uses the two-dimensional (2-D) discrete cosine transform (DCT) over the entire face image as a feature detector and a constructive one-hidden-layer feedforward neural network as a facial expression classifier. An input-side pruning technique, proposed previously by the authors, is also incorporated into the constructive learning process to reduce the network size without sacrificing the performance of the resulting network. The proposed technique is applied to a database consisting of images of 60 men, each having five facial expression images (neutral, smile, anger, sadness, and surprise). Images of 40 men are used for network training, and the remaining images of 20 men are used for generalization and testing. Confusion matrices calculated in both network training and generalization for four facial expressions (smile, anger, sadness, and surprise) are used to evaluate the performance of the trained network. It is demonstrated that the best recognition rates are 100% and 93.75% (without rejection), for the training and generalizing images, respectively. Furthermore, the input-side weights of the constructed network are reduced by approximately 30% using our pruning method. In comparison with the fixed structure back propagation-based recognition methods in the literature, the proposed technique constructs one-hidden-layer feedforward neural network with dfewer number of hidden units and weights, while simultaneously provide improved generalization and recognition performance capabilities.

In these Tg rats, the AbetaPP and PS1 transgene expression was largely restricted to the hippocampus and neocortex. The PS1 transgenic rats did not produce visible changes in Abeta immunoreactivity. The AbetaPP transgenic rats (both the single Tg UKUR28, and double Tg UKUR25) generated a phenotype of intra-neuronal Abeta accumulation without plaque formation and with no increased immunoreactivity for AbetaPP amino and carboxyl-terminal epitopes. This phenotype was apparent as early as 6 months of age in the transgenic rat lines carrying the human AbetaPP transgene. No senile plaques of aggregated Abeta were observed in any of the transgenic lines generated, up to 24 months of age. The hAbetaPP single homozygous Tg line (UKUR28) showed an increase in ERK2, without changes in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity. A preliminary protein analysis of the hippocampus of the double transgenic rat (UKUR25) by mass spectrometry showed differences in the protein profile between this transgenic line and controls.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of lactate infusion on muscle fatigue during prolonged indirect stimulation in situ. For this purpose, the plantaris muscle was electrically stimulated (50 Hz, for 200 ms, every 2.7 s, 5 V) in situ through the sciatic nerve to perform concentric contractions for 60 min while either saline or lactate was infused intravenously (8 rats/group). Lactate infusion (lactate concentration similar to12 mM) attenuated the reduction in submaximal dynamic force (-49 vs. -68% in rats infused with saline; P < 0.05). Maximum dynamic and isometric forces at the end of the period of stimulation were also higher (P < 0.05) in rats infused with lactate (3.8 +/- 0.3 and 4.4 +/- 0.3 N) compared with saline (3.1 +/- 0.2 and 3.6 +/- 0.2 N). The beneficial effect of lactate infusion on muscle force during prolonged stimulation was associated with a better maintenance of M-wave characteristics compared with control. In contrast, lactate infusion was not associated with any reduction in muscle glycogen utilization or with any reduction of fatigue at the neuromuscular junction (as assessed through maximal direct muscle stimulation: 200 Hz, 200 ms, 150 V).

Across populations, findings associate impulsivity, behavioral disinhibition, or hostility with reduced central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) activity and increased likelihood of childhood abuse. Inconsistently, findings associate compulsivity, behavioral inhibition, or anxiousness with elevated 5-HT neurotransmission. We explored relationships among measures of 5-HT system functioning, behavioral inhibition/disinhibition, and childhood abuse in women with bulimia-spectrum eating syndromes. Method: In 73 bulimic (body mass index [kg/m(2)] under 30, binge eating at least once weekly) and 50 normal-eater control women, we obtained indices of platelet paroxetine binding and 5-HT agonist (m-CPP)-stimulated neuroendocrine responses. Cluster analysis was used to classify the bulimic women according to 5-HT "profiles." Resulting groups were then compared on symptom and trait measures. Results: Measures of paroxetine-binding density (B-max) and affinity (K-d) contributed significantly (p < .001 and p < .02, respectively) to a classification of bulimic women into groups with "low density/high affinity" (N = 52) or "high density/low affinity" (N = 21) binding. The 5-HT based classification did not predict eating-symptom severity. However, the "high density" pattern was associated with increased perfectionism and compulsivity, reduced risk of childhood sexual abuse, and (to some extent) reduced probability of borderline personality disorder. Discussion: In women with bulimic syndromes, serotonergic factors, personality-trait variations, and developmental typologies converge in principled fashion. Our findings corroborate (with neurobiological evidence) the concept of underregulated and overregulated subtypes within the bulimic population.

Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells and the presence of hypertrophic nerve trunks in the distal bowel. There have been three reports of patients with X-linked hydrocephalus and HSCR with a mutation in the L1CAM gene. We report three more patients with similar conditions. We suspect that decreased L1CAM may be a modifying factor in the development of HSCR.

The present study demonstrated impaired proteasomal function in the lumbar spinal cord of transgenic mice expressing human SOD-1 with the ALS-causing mutation G93A (SOD-1(G93A)) compared to non-transgenic littermates (LM) and SOD-1(WT) transgenic mice. Chymotrypsin-like activity was decreased as early as 45 days of age. By 75 days, chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and caspase-like activities of the proteasome were impaired, at about 50% of control activity in lumbar spinal cord, but unchanged in thoracic spinal cord and liver. Both total and specific activities of the proteasome were reduced to a similar extent, indicating that a change in proteasome function, rather than a decrease in proteasome levels, had occurred. Similar decreases of total and specific activities of the proteasome were observed in NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing fALS mutants SOD-1(G93A) and SOD-1(G41S), but not in SOD-1(WT) controls. Although overall levels of proteasome were maintained in spinal cord of SOD-1(G93A) transgenic mice, the level of 20S proteasome was substantially reduced in lumbar spinal motor neurons relative to the surrounding neuropil. It is concluded that impairment of the proteasome is an early event and contributes to ALS pathogenesis.

We measured levels of key antioxidant defences [reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, six major GSH system enzymes, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), uric acid] that are often altered after exposure to oxidative stress, in autopsied brain of human methamphetamine users and matched controls. Changes in the total (n = 20) methamphetamine group were limited to the dopamine-rich caudate (the striatal subdivision with the most severe dopamine loss) in which only activity of CuZnSOD (+ 14%) and GSSG levels (+ 58%) were changed. In the six methamphetamine users with severe (- 72 to - 97%) caudate dopamine loss, caudate CuZnSOD activity (+ 20%) and uric acid levels (+ 63%) were increased with a trend for decreased (- 35%) GSH concentration. Our data suggest that brain levels of many antioxidant systems are preserved in methamphetamine users and that GSH depletion, commonly observed during severe oxidative stress, might occur only with severe dopamine loss. Increased CuZnSOD and uric acid might reflect compensatory responses to oxidative stress. Future studies are necessary to establish whether these changes are associated with oxidative brain damage in human methamphetamine users.

For each worker's evaluation, two raters were preselected among five trained raters. One of the raters administered the PWPE while the other functioned as a silent rater. A convenience sample of 40 workers disabled due to back pain and referred to an occupational rehabilitation center was used. In general, the reliability was "substantial" (0.61 less than or equal to kappa less than or equal to 0.80) to "almost perfect" (0.81 less than or equal to kappa less than or equal to 1.00) for most of the 21 tasks and three sections of the PWPE evaluated with the exception of three tasks in the Mobility section ( ladder climbing (kappa = 0.47), repetitive trunk rotation - standing (kappa = 0.54), and repetitive trunk rotation sitting (kappa = 0.37)) task and the Mobility section itself (kappa = 0.54). Several reasons could explain the lower agreement on the observation of the physical signs associated with these tasks. Since these tasks involve rotation movements or complex neuromuscular integration, it seemed difficult for the raters to define what are the normal physical signs and when physical signs of maximal functional capacity are present. The criteria for establishing the presence of the physical signs in the PWPE should be improved.

Flux refers to variability about an individual's mean score on an interpersonal dimension and was examined for the 4 poles of the interpersonal circumplex. Pulse and spin refer to variability about an individual's mean extremity and mean angular coordinate on the interpersonal circumplex. These constructs were measured using event-contingent recording. Latent state-trait analyses indicated high stability of flux in submissive, agreeable, and quarrelsome behaviors and some stability in the flux of dominance. Further analyses indicated moderate to high stability in pulse and spin. Neuroticism predicted greater pulse, spin, and submissive behavior flux. Extraversion predicted greater flux in agreeable behavior. In contrast, Agreeableness predicted reduced spin and quarrelsome behavior flux. Social environmental variables predicted greater flux in dominant behavior. Flux, pulse, and spin provide reliable and distinctive additions to the vocabulary for describing individual differences.

Slow axonal degeneration, rather than acute inflammation, is considered the cause of chronic disability in MS. The signs of acute axonal damage and loss have been shown to occur early in the lesion development of patients with chronic MS and often correlate with demyelination and inflammation. While immune activity in the central nervous system has traditionally been considered to be a detrimental event in MS, recent studies have found that autoimmune T cells may play an important role in protecting neurons from the ongoing spreading damage. Neuro protection in MS is a new and evolving concept, and many questions remain with regard to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Preliminary studies, both in animals and in humans, have suggested that glatiramer acetate (GA) may confer neuro protective activity in addition to bystander suppression. Additional research is needed to determine if these promising neuroprotective effects correlate with the long-term effect of GA in MS.

Methods: Spatially normalized images of FDOPA influx rate constant (Ki) values and relative regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rrCMRglc) were created. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) scores and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were used to determine the patients' cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Multiple correlation analyses between the FDOPA and FDG images and the cognitive and motor scores were performed for each voxel. Results: RCPM score was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the left hippocampus and with the rrCMRglc in the left middle frontal gyrus and right retrosplenial cortex. Motor function was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the bilateral striatum and with the rrCMRglc in association areas and primary visual cortex. The level of motor function was significantly inversely correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the anterior cingulate gyrus and with the rrCMRgle in bilateral primary motor cortex and right putamen. Conclusions: Changes of striatal FDOPA uptake and rrCMRglc in the primary motor cortex likely represent dysfunction in the motor system involving the corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Change of FDOPA uptake in the anterior cingulate gyrus may be related to up-regulation of dopamine synthesis in surviving dopamine neurons. The regions where correlation with cognitive function was observed belong to a cognitive frontoparietal-hippocampal network. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, when images are nonstationary, the cluster-size distribution varies depending on local smoothness. Clusters tend to be large in smooth regions, resulting in increased false positives, while in rough regions, clusters tend to be small, resulting in decrease sensitivity. Worsley et al. proposed a random field theory (RFT) method that adjusts cluster sizes according to local roughness of images [Worsley, K.J., 2002. Nonstationary FWHM and its effect on statistical inference of fMRI data. Presented at the 8th International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 2-6, 2002, Sendai, Japan. Available on CD-ROM in NeuroImage 16 (2) 779-780; Hum. Brain Mapp. 8 (1999) 98]. In this paper, we implement this method in a permutation test framework, which requires very few assumptions, is known to be exact [J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7] and is robust [Neurolmage 20 (2003) 2343]. We compared our method to stationary permutation, stationary RIFT, and nonstationary R methods. Using simulated data, we found that our permutation test performs well under;my setting examined, whereas the nonstationary RFT test performs well only for smooth images under high df. We also found that the stationary RFT test becomes anticonservative under nonstationarity, while both nonstationary RIFT and permutation tests remain valid under nonstationarity. On a real PET data set we found that, though the nonstationary tests have reduced sensitivity due to smoothness estimation variability, these tests have better sensitivity for clusters in rough regions compared to stationary cluster-size tests. We include a detailed and consolidated description of Worsley nonstationary RIFT cluster-size lest. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Eight healthy volunteers performed a periodic right-hand pinch grip every second using 5% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), a paradigm previously shown to produce robust ipsilateral neuronal inhibition. To simultaneously quantify CBF and BOLD signals, an interleaved multislice pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) and T-2*-weighted gradient echo sequence was employed. The CMRO2 was calculated using the deoxyhemoglobin dilution model, calibrated by data measured during graded hypercapnia. In all subjects, BOLD, CBF and CMRO2 signals increased in the contralateral and decreased in the ipsilateral primary motor (M1) cortex. The relative changes in CMRO2 and CBF were linearly related, with a slope of similar to0.4. The coupling ratio thus established for both positive and negative CMRO2 and CBF changes is in close agreement with the ones observed by earlier studies investigating All perfusion and oxygen consumption increases. These findings characterize the hemodynamic and metabolic downregulation accompanying neuronal inhibition and thereby establish the sustained negative BOLD response as a marker of neuronal deactivation.

Because symptoms are usually present from 6 to 24 months before a diagnosis is made, aetiological agents are believed to be active well before symptoms appear. It is proposed that neuropsychological deficits in various cognitive domains preexist and underlie the aetiology of ED. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature relevant to neuropsychological deficits in ED patients and explores the relationship between cognitive deficits, psychosocial development, and the development of ED. Although the role of neuropsychological deficits in the evolution of ED requires further research, the proposed association has significant implications for clinical practice.

In Experiment 1, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with a speech task to examine rTMS-induced changes in paralinguistic aspects of speech production, an affect-relevant behavior strongly linked to the ACC. In Experiment 2, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with positron emission tomography (PET) and used partial least squares (PLS) to identify a pattern of brain regions whose connectivity with the site of stimulation varied as a function of rTMS. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that following stimulation of the left MDLFC, subjects reported having less positive affect and vitality and displayed more monotonous speech. In Experiment 2, results revealed that 10-Hz rTMS influenced the covariation between blood flow at the site of stimulation (ie the left MDLFC) and blood flow in a number of affect-relevant brain regions including the perigenual anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, and caudate nucleus. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in affect and affect-relevant behaviour following 10-Hz rTMS applied over the left MDLFC may be related to changes in neural activity in brain regions widely implicated in affective states, including a frontocingulate circuit.

In rats treated for 4 days with 50 mg/kg MnCl2 (intraperitoneally, i.p.), the concentration of C-13-labeled lactate increased to 154% compared to control rats. Changes in the absolute amounts of lactate were much less, resulting in increased fractional C-13-enrichments in lactate (indicating relative changes of de novo synthesis from glucose via the glycolytic pathway) to 143% of control values (P < 0.001). Analysis of samples obtained from blood plasma and peripheral organs demonstrate a selective increase of lactate synthesis from [1-C-13]glucose in the brain, which is released into the circulation. In parallel, manganese treatment resulted. in stimulation of flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), leading to accumulation of [4-C-13]glutamate, [4-C-13]glutamine and [2-C-13]GABA to 168, 247 and 144% of control, respectively. The relative flux of glucose through astrocytic pyruvate carboxylase (PC), on the other hand, was impaired by manganese, as evident from a decreased ratio of [2-C-13]/[4-C-13]glutamate or [2-C-13]/[4-C-13]glutamine. Consistent with stimulated glucose oxidative metabolism, the firactional C-13-enrichment in [2-C-13]acetyl-CoA entering the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and contributing to glutamate and glutamine synthesis increased to 138 and 156% of control, respectively (P < 0.001). In parallel, the TCA cycling ratio increased to 134% compared to control rats, prior to the label ending up in glutamate. In contrast, glutamine is synthesized mainly during the first TCA cycle turn. The present data provide new evidence in support of changes in brain energy metabolism playing an important role in manganese neurotoxicity. In particular, increased glycolytic flux and lactate synthesis may contribute to the deleterious effects of manganese in the brain. Furthermore, stimulated astrocytic glucose oxidation and glutamine synthesis may be associated with astrocytic pathology and altered astrocytic-neuronal metabolic trafficking in manganese neurotoxicity.

To determine whether deltaOR trafficking induced by chronic inflammation was dependent on the activation of muOR, we investigated by immunogold cytochemistry the effects of intraplantar CFA injection on the plasma membrane density of deltaOR in muOR knockout (KO) mice. In untreated wild-type (WT) mice, only a small proportion of deltaOR was associated with neuronal plasma membranes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The CFA-induced inflammation produced a significantly higher ratio of plasma membrane to intracellular receptors, as well as a 75% increase in the membrane density of immunoreactive deltaOR, in dendrites of the ipsilateral dorsal horn as compared to untreated mice. This increase in the membrane density of deltaOR was likely due to a recruitment of receptors from intracellular stores since no difference in the overall deltaOR immunolabeling density was evident between CFA-treated and untreated mice. Most importantly, the CFA-induced changes in deltaOR plasma membrane insertion seen in WT animals were not present in the spinal cord of muOR KO mice. These results demonstrate that the integrity of muOR is necessary for CFA-induced changes in deltaOR trafficking to occur and suggest that these changes could be elicited by stimulation of muOR by endogenous opioids released in response to chronic inflammatory pain.

The current study was undertaken to investigate whether arterial baroreflex and blood pressure variability are altered in a model of in utero programming of hypertension secondary to isocaloric protein deprivation and whether activation of the RAS plays a role in this alteration. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed a normal-protein (18%) or low-protein (9%) diet during gestation, which had no effect on litter size, birth weight, or pup survival. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP; 126 +/- 3 mm Hg 9% versus 108 +/- 4 rum Hg 18%; p < 0.05) and blood pressure variability were significantly greater in the adult offspring of the 9% protein-fed mothers. Arterial baroreflex control of heart rate, generated by graded i.v. infusion of phenylephrine and nitroprusside, was significantly shifted toward higher pressure; i.v. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor normalized MABP and shifted the arterial baroreflex curve of the 9% offspring toward lower pressure without affecting the 18% offspring. For examining whether brain RAS is also involved in programming of hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and losartan (specific AT(1) receptor antagonist) were administered intracerebroventricularly; both significantly reduced MABP of the 9% but not the 18% offspring. Autoradiographic receptor binding studies demonstrated an increase in brain AT(1) expression in the subfornical organ and the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis in the 9% offspring.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis (programmed cell death or cell suicide) are two counterparts that share the responsibility for maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. Evidence has been accumulating from fundamental studies indicating that tumour cells possess various types of K+ channels, and that these K+ channels play important roles in regulating tumour cell proliferation and apoptosis, i.e. facilitating unlimited growth and promoting apoptotic death of tumour cells. The potential implications of K+ channels as a pharmacological target for cancer therapy and a biomarker for diagnosis of carcinogenesis are attracting increasing interest. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current status of research on K+ channels/currents in tumour cells. Focus is placed on the roles of K+ channels/currents in regulating tumour cell proliferation and apoptosis. The possible mechanisms by which K+ channels affect tumour cell growth and death are discussed. Speculations are also made on the potential implications of regulation of tumour cell proliferation and apoptosis by K+ channels.

J	Bunge, M				Bunge, M			How does it work? The search for explanatory mechanisms	PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						explanation; function; mechanism; process; system; systemism	COOPERATION; THINKING	This article addresses the following problems: What is a mechanism, how can it be discovered, and what is the role of the knowledge of mechanisms in scientific explanation and technological control? The proposed answers are these. A mechanism is one of the processes in a concrete system that makes it what it is for example, metabolism in cells, interneuronal connections in brains, work in factories and offices, research in laboratories, and litigation in courts of law. Because mechanisms are largely or totally imperceptible, they must be conjectured. Once hypothesized they help explain, because a deep scientific explanation is an answer to a question of the form, "How does it work, that is, what makes it tick-what are its mechanisms?" Thus, by contrast with the subsumption of particulars under a generalization, an explanation proper consists in unveiling some lawful mechanism, as when political stability is explained by either coercion, public opinion manipulation, or democratic participation. Finding mechanisms satisfies not only the yearning for understanding, but also the need for control.

J	Lippe, S; Lassonde, M				Lippe, S; Lassonde, M			Neuropsychological profile of intractable partial epilepsies.	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			French	Article; Proceedings Paper	Consensus Conference on Management of Patients with Drug-Resistant Partial Epilepsy	MAR 03-04, 2004	Paris, FRANCE	French Federat Neurol		focal epilepsy; cognition; adaptation; child; adult	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; MEMORY; CHILDREN; CARBAMAZEPINE; DYSFUNCTION; VALIDATION; POPULATION; COGNITION; SURGERY	The neuropsychological assessment is an essential part of the clinical work-up of patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. The aim of the present article is to give an: overview of the assessment with regard to the functions tested, the techniques employed and the factors influencing the interpretation of the results. In the first part of the article, the role of the neuropsychological evaluation is discussed in relation to other methods of clinical investigation, such as EEG, brain imaging techniques and sodium amytal exploration, all of which intend to identify the localization (region and laterality) of the epileptogenic focus. This is particularly important for patients slated for epilepsy surgery. In addition, the neuropsychological exam aims to determine the extent of the deficits in various cognitive and sensori-motor domains by taking into account the structural and/or functional reorganization that may have taken place and the compensatory mechanisms that are available to the patient. In this context the effect of various factors influencing the mental and emotional functioning of the patient, such as the age at onset and duration of the epilepsy, the presence of a structural lesion, the type and number of anticonvulsant drugs, the personality and the adaptability of the patient must be considered. In children, the effect of recurrent seizures may be more devastating since these risk to interfere with normal brain development. On the other hand, the greater plasticity of the immature brain provides a larger window in which compensation can take place. Evidence suggests that attentional processes are affected in all types of epilepsy. Furthermore, the antiepileptic medication may have a deleterious effect on the cognitive and emotional status of the patient, particularly in patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy who are usually taking a combination of anticonvulsant drugs. The second part of the article presents localization-specific neuropsychological impairments and the tests most suited to reveal these deficits. Thus, in temporal lobe epilepsy, memory functions are more affected than in other types of partial epilepsy, whereas intellectual functions are usually preserved. However, recent studies cast some doubt on the prevailing view that left-hemisphere foci are associated with vernal memory deficits only and that right-hemisphere foci solely affect visuo-spatial memory. The dichotomy appears to be more subtle, especially in patients with a long-standing seizure history. Frontal foci produce deficits in motor coordination, attention, working memory and executive functions. These deficits appear to be more pronounced in children than in adults. Few studies have explored the neuropsychological consequences of parieto-occipital foci given that this type of epilepsy is relatively rare. The neuropsychological profile of the patient should guide healthcare providers to implement. the necessary remedial measures to facilitate the patients social integration and to improve his quality of life.

From Conditioning to Conscious Recollection: Memory Systems of the Brain. Oxford Univ. Press]. Here we investigate TI in schizophrenia (SZ), a neurocognitive disorder associated with explicit but not implicit memory dysfunction. SZ patients and healthy controls were trained on a series of learned discriminations that were hierarchically organized (A>B, B>C, C>D, and D>E). They were then tested on each training pair and two novel "inference" pairs: AE, which can be evaluated without consideration of hierarchical relations, and BD, which can only be evaluated by hierarchical relations. SZ patients and controls successfully learned the training pairs and correctly responded to the nonrelational AE pairs. However, SZ patients were less accurate than controls in responding to the relational BD pairs, consistent with the hypothesis that higher-level memory processes associated with relational memory organization are impaired in SZ. The results are discussed with respect to the relational memory model and candidate neuro-cognitive mechanisms of TI. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There have been recent developments in several of these conditions, in particular restless legs syndrome (RLS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). RLS is one of the major causes of insomnia. Familial aggregation of RLS has been demonstrated by several groups, and molecular genetics studies have suggested the presence of susceptibility genes on chromosomes 12q and 14q. Pharmacologic and brain imaging studies suggest the involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in RLS, but recent work has focused on brain iron metabolism. Studies indicate that RBD patients may eventually develop Parkinson's disease (PD). Conversely, RBD has been found in patients already diagnosed with PD. Single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography studies have shown a decrease in binding to presynaptic dopamine transporter in both idiopathic RBD and PD. Patients with RBD (associated or unassociated with PD) also have neuropsychological deficits. RBD may therefore represent the prodrome of a neurodegenerative disease leading to multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of abnormal sleep motor behaviors may prove useful in the management of insomnia. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sullivan, RM				Sullivan, RM			Hemispheric asymmetry in stress processing in rat prefrontal cortex and the role of mesocortical dopamine	STRESS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON THE BIOLOGY OF STRESS			English	Review						autonomic; cerebral laterality; emotion; early handling; infralimbic; neuroendocrine	ELEVATED-PLUS-MAZE; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; PITUITARY-ADRENAL RESPONSES; INDUCED LASTING INCREASES; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; PROBE BURYING TESTS; CONDITIONED FEAR; CORTICAL DOPAMINE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES	The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to play an important role not only in the regulation of emotion, but in the integration of affective states with appropriate modulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine stress regulatory systems. The present review highlights findings in the rat which helps to elucidate the complex nature of prefrontal involvement in emotion and stress regulation. The medial PFC is particularly important in this regard and while dorsomedial regions appear to play a suppressive role in such regulation, the ventromedial (particularly infralimbic) region appears to activate behavioral, neuroendocrine and sympathetic autonomic systems in response to stressful situations. This may be especially true of spontaneous stress-related behavior or physiological responses to relatively acute stressors. The role of the medial PFC is somewhat more complex in conditions involving learned adjustments to stressful situations, such as the extinction of conditioned fear responses, but it is clear that the medial PFC is important in incorporating stressful experience for future adaptive behavior. It is also suggested that mesocortical dopamine plays an important adaptive role in this region by preventing excessive behavioral and physiological stress reactivity. The rat brain shows substantial hemispheric specialization in many respects, and while the right PFC is normally dominant in the activation of stress-related systems, the left may play a role in countering this activation through processes of interhemispheric inhibition. This proposed basic template for the lateralization of stress regulatory systems is suggested to be associated with efficient stress and emotional self-regulation, and also to be shaped by both early postnatal experience and gender differences.

We aimed to assess whether stereotactic radiosurgery provided any therapeutic benefit in a randomised multi-institutional trial directed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). Methods Patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases were randomly allocated either whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or WBRT followed by stereotactic radiosurgery boost. Patients were stratified by number of metastases and status of extracranial disease. Primary outcome was survival; secondary outcomes were tumour response and local rates, overall intracranial recurrence rates, cause of death, and performance measurements. Findings From January, 1996, to June, 2001, we enrolled 333 patients from 55 participating RTOG institutions-167 were assigned WBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery and 164 were allocated WBRT alone. Univariate analysis showed that there was a survival advantage in the WBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery group for patients with a single brain metastasis (median survival time 6.5 vs 4.9 months, p=0.0393). Patients in the stereotactic surgery group were more likely to have a stable or improved Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score at 6 months' follow-up than were patients allocated WBRT alone (43% vs 27%, respectively; p=0.03). By multivariate analysis, survival improved in patients with an RPA class 1 (p<0.0001) or a favourable histological status (p=0.0121). Interpretation WBRT and stereotactic boost treatment improved functional autonomy (KPS) for all patients and survival for patients with a single unresectable brain metastasis. WBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery should, therefore, be standard treatment for patients with a single unresectable brain metastasis and considered for patients with two or three brain metastases.

The primary cell surface receptor for HA is CD44, a membrane glycoprotein that is functionally regulated by a membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Both CD44 and MT1-MMP are partially located in Triton X-100-insoluble domains, but no functional link has yet been established between them. In the present study, we studied the regulation of HA cell surface binding in U-87 glioma cells. We show that an MMP-dependent mechanism regulates the intrinsic cell surface binding of HA as ilomastat, a broad MMP inhibitor, increased HA binding to glioma cells. HA binding was also rapidly and specifically up-regulated by 3-fold by type I collagen in U-87 cells, which also induced a significant morphological reorganization associated with the activation of a latent form of MMP-2 through a MT1-MMP-mediated mechanism. Interestingly, caveolae depletion with a cell surface cholesterol-depleting agent beta-cyclodextrin triggered an additional increase (9-fold) in the binding of HA, in synergy with type I collagen. On the other hand, HA cell surface binding was diminished by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and by the overexpression of a recombinant, wild type MT1-MMP, whereas its cytoplasmic-deleted form had no effect. Taken together, our results suggest that MT1-MMP regulates, through its cytoplasmic domain, the cell surface functions of CD44 in a collagen-rich pericellular environment. Additionally, we describe a new molecular mechanism regulating the invasive potential of glioma cells involving a MT1-MMP/CD44/caveolin interaction, which could represent a potential target for anti-cancer therapies.

MRPI localized primarily to the plasma membrane of the MLS-9 cells. [C-14]Saquinavir efflux by MLS-9 monolayers was inhibited by well-established MRPI inhibitors.

Although no specific susceptibility genes have been identified for TS, cytogenetic studies in selected cases suggest the existence of a predisposing gene located in the 7q31 chromosomal region. In order to test the hypothesis of a possible relationship between this region and TS at the population level, we undertook a family based association study in a sample of French Canadian patients from Quebec. For this purpose, markers D7S522, D7S523, and D7S1516 were tested using the extended transmission disequilibrium test (e-TDT). Marker D7S522 showed a biased transmission of alleles from heterozygote parents to their TS offsprings (allele-wise TDT X-2 = 12.61, 4 df, P=0.013, genotype-wise TDT X-2 = 15.49, 7 df, P = 0.030). When the analysis was restricted to patients without ADHD or OCD comorbidity, similar results were observed both allele and genotype-wise (X-2 = 10.68, 4 df, P = 0.03 and 2 X-2 = 12.55, 5 df, P = 0.028, respectively). In addition, marker D7S523 was also associ-ated (allele-wise TDT X-2 = 18.37, 7 df, P = 0.01 and genotype-wise TDT X-2 = 46.26, 17 df, P=0.00016), and showed a tendency for association in the comorbidity-free subgroup (genotype-wise TDT X-2 = 18.7, 10 df, P=0.044). Finally, marker D7S1516, contained in the inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase 2 like (IMMP2L) gene, also showed a tendency for association (genotype-wise TDT X-2 = 32.87,21 df, P = 0.048). These results may reflect the proximity of markers D7S522, D7S523, and possibly D7S1516 to a gene or re-gulatoryregion. relevant to TS predisposition. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Like PAF, VEGF-A(165) promotes translocation of P-selectin to the endothelial cell (EC) surface. However, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. By treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with VEGF analogs, we show that activation of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 or both induced a rapid and transient translocation of endothelial P-selectin and neutrophil adhesion to activated ECs. The effects mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(165) (VEGFR-1/VEGFR-2 agonists) were blocked by a selective VEGFR-2 inhibitor, SU1498. VEGF-A(165) was twice as potent as VEGF-A(121), which can be explained by the binding capacity of VEGF-A(165) to its coreceptor neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Indeed, treatment with NRP-1 antagonist (GST-Ex7) reduced the effect of VEGF-A(165) to the levels observed upon stimulation with VEGF-A(121). Finally, the use of selective PAF receptor antagonists reduced VEGFA(165)-mediated P-selectin translocation. Together, these data show that maximal P-selectin translocation and subsequent neutrophil adhesion was mediated by VEGF-A(165) on the activation of VEGFR-2/ NRP-1 complex and required PAF synthesis.

Polyps of male colonies produce substantially more sperm follicles than female colonies do egg follicles, and significantly more sperm follicles are expelled than egg follicles during the summer spawning season. Spawning is accompanied by strong peristaltic contractions across the colony. Serotonin, a positive modulator of peristalsis in the sea pansy, induced spawning of either sperm or egg follicles, increasing both the proportion of spawning colonies and the number of expelled gamete follicles per colony in a dose-dependent manner. The serotonin antagonist 1-(1)naphthylpiperazine greatly reduced both spontaneous and serotonin-induced spawning. Antho-RFamide, a neuropeptide found in ciliated neurons within follicle epithelia, induced the exfoliation of the follicle epithelium from spawned follicles. Exposure of follicles to light enhanced the potency of Antho-RFamide. The actin-binding toxin phalloidin substantially reduced the incidence of Antho-RFamide-induced exfoliation and phalloidin-FITC staining was localized in the muscle feet of follicle epithelial cells. These results provide the first experimental evidence of neuroendocrine functions involved in cnidarian spawning. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous event-related potential studies have documented error negativity or error-related negativity after incorrect responses, with a suggested source in the anterior cingulate cortex or supplementary motor area. We compared activation elicited by correct and incorrect trials using auditory and visual choice-reaction time tasks. Source areas showing different activation patterns in correct and error conditions were mainly located in sensorimotor areas, both ipsi- and contralateral to the response, suggesting that activation of sensorimotor circuits accompanies error processing. Additional activation at various other locations suggests a distributed network of brain regions active during error-related processing. Activation specific to incorrect trials tended to occur later in MEG than EEG data, possibly indicating that EEG and MEG detect different neural networks involved in error-related processes.

Here we investigate an in vitro model of cerebellar neuronal death. We report that cerebellar Purkinje neurons, deprived of trophic factors, die by a form of programmed cell death distinct from the apoptotic death of neighboring granule neurons. Purkinje neuron death was characterized by excessive autophagic-lysosomal vacuolation. Autophagy and death of Purkinje neurons were inhibited by nerve growth factor (NGF) and were activated by NGF-neutralizing antibodies. Although treatment with antisense oligonucleotides to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75ntr) decreased basal survival of cultured cerebellar neurons, p75ntr-antisense decreased autophagy and completely inhibited death of Purkinje neurons induced by trophic factor withdrawal. Moreover, adenoviral expression of a p75ntr mutant lacking the ligand-binding domain induced vacuolation and death of Purkinje neurons. These results suggest that p75ntr is required for Purkinje neuron survival in the presence of trophic support; however, during trophic factor withdrawal, p75ntr contributes to Purkinje neuron autophagy and death. The autophagic morphology resembles that found in neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting a potential role for this pathway in neurological disease.

Methods: Patients with LScs were evaluated by high-resolution MRI and CT. The authors performed three-dimensional reconstructions of MRI and CT scans to evaluate brain and bone structures. Results: Nine patients with LScs were evaluated (five women), with ages ranging from 6 to 53 years (mean, 30.7 years). Brain CT showed bone deformities with thinning of the skull under the skin lesions in six patients. MRI scans showed focal atrophy and blurring of the gray-white matter interface localized under the skin lesion in all patients. In three patients it was associated with hyperintense signal on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) and T2-weighted images. Follow-up MRI showed extension of the brain lesion in one patient; in the remaining patients, the lesion did not progress. Four of the nine patients had partial epilepsy. One had surgery for management of refractory seizures, and pathologic findings indicated a focal inflammatory process. Conclusion: Localized scleroderma en coup de sabre is associated with focal, and in some progressive, brain lesions underlying the skin atrophy. Epilepsy, when present, is related to these brain lesions. Imaging findings and histopathology indicated that the process, most likely focal inflammatory, may be progressive.

Here we report that the "death" phenotypes of CGN after potassium withdrawal are heterogeneous, allowing the distinction between plasma membrane (PM)-, DNA-, and PM/DNA-damaged populations. These damaged neurons display nuclear condensation that precedes PM or DNA damage. Inhibition of ERK activation either by U0126 or by dominant-negative mitogen-activated protein kinase/ ERK kinase (MEK) overexpression results in a dramatic reduction of PM damaged neurons and nuclear condensation. In contrast, overexpression of constitutively active MEK potentiates PM damage and nuclear condensation. ERK-promoted cellular damage is independent of caspase-3. Persistent active ERK translocates, to the nucleus, whereas caspase-3 remains in the cytoplasm. Antioxidants that reduced ERK activation and PM damage showed no effect on caspase-3 activation or DNA damage. These data identify ERK as an important executor of neuronal damage involving a caspase-3-independent mechanism.

Behav. 24 (1999) 537], which had established a psychosocial profile associated with psychological distress in benzodiazepine (BZD) use. Forty-one participants with anxiety or insomnia, receiving maintenance therapy of BZD for at least 8 weeks, participated in a 20-week, tapered discontinuation protocol with physician counselling. Drug type and use was monitored throughout. Questionnaire measures of anxiety, behavioural inhibition, neuroticism, withdrawal complaints, social support, psychological distress, self-efficacy in coping without BZD, quality of life, positive and negative life events, were completed at baseline, postdiscontinuation, and at 3-month follow-up. Measures of baseline psychological distress and anxiety inhibition were consistently associated with both discontinuation and the emergence of withdrawal complaints. Successful withdrawal was characterized by low baseline neuroticism, low behavioural inhibition, higher number of positive events, and higher level of social support satisfaction. Higher dosage (in diazepam equivalent dose) was associated with both poorer outcome and the emergence of withdrawal symptoms. Self-efficacy in coping was negatively associated with relapse but not with outcome. Psychosocial factors play a role at different stages of the BZD withdrawal process and could be targeted in treatment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We identified two large pedigrees segregating the disorder in an isolated population living in Newfoundland and performed a 5-cM genome scan. Linkage analysis identified a locus mapping to 12p13.33 with a maximum LOD score of 8.4. Haplotype sharing defined a candidate interval of 1.06 Mb containing all or part of seven annotated genes, sequencing of which failed to detect causative mutations. Comparative genomics revealed a conserved ORF corresponding to a novel gene in which we found three different truncating mutations among five families including patients from rural Quebec and Nova Scotia. This gene, termed "HSN2," consists of a single exon located within intron 8 of the PRKWNK1 gene and is transcribed from the same strand. The HSN2 protein may play a role in the development and/or maintenance of peripheral sensory neurons or their supporting Schwann cells.

The affinity of ziprasidone for these receptors in vivo in patients was examined in a positron emission tomography (PET) study. method: The authors conducted a PET study to evaluate D-2 occupancy (using [C-11]raclopride) and 5-HT2 occupancy (using [F-18]setoperone) in brain regions of interest in 16 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomly assigned to receive 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/ day of ziprasidone, which reflected the recommended dose range. PET scanning was done after 3 weeks of administration and at trough plasma levels, i.e., 12-16 hours after the last dose. Results: The mean 5-HT2 receptor occupancy was significantly higher than the mean D-2 receptor occupancy (mean=76%, SD=15%, and mean=56%, SD=18%, respectively). The estimated plasma ziprasidone concentration associated with 50% maximal 5-HT2 receptor occupancy was almost four times lower than that for D-2 receptor occupancy. Conclusions: These data affirm that ziprasidone is similar to other novel antipsychotics in having greater 5-HT2 than D-2 receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses and suggest that the optimal effective dose of ziprasidlone is closer to 120 mg/day than to the lower doses suggested by previous PET studies. The relatively high D2 receptor occupancy, even at trough plasma levels, suggests that ziprasidone is more similar to risperidone and olanzapine in receptor occupancy profile than to clozapine and quetiapine. Since ziprasidone plasma levels show significant (more than twofold) variation within a single dose cycle, studies that are aimed at peak plasma levels (6 hours after the last dose) and that examine extrastriatal regions are required to fully characterize the in vivo occupancy profile of ziprasidone.

They usually involve autoimmunity and are associated with choreatic disorders such as Sydenham chorea, lupus, and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Patient: A 48-year-old woman was initially seen with a I-year history of progressive changes in personality and attention. There were minor associated involuntary movements. Negative routine investigation results, including regular autoimmune serologies and magnetic resonance imaging, led to the diagnosis of a frontal dementia. Positron emission tomographic results demonstrated hypermetabolism in the left striatum. Western blot technique results demonstrated plasma antistriatal antibodies. Treatment with corticosteroids induced a resolution of her attentional deficits and a return of her personality to its premorbid state. The repeated positron emission tomographic scan results were near normal, and the titer of antistriatal antibodies was significantly reduced. Conclusion: Autoimmune striatal dysfunction can initially appear with a clinical picture suggestive of a degenerative dementia. Recognition of the underlying etiology and treatment was possible because of abnormalities uncovered on positron emission tomographic images.

Methods: Retrospective and prospective data collection included medical record review and examination, including pubertal, dietary, and activity assessment. Lumbar spine and total body BMD were measured by means of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Patients were routinely observed by the endocrinology department, and hormone deficiencies were corrected promptly. A subset of patients received calcium and vitamin D supplementation and underwent repeat BMD measurement I year later. Results: Of 24 patients aged 4 to 20 years, 11 of whom were mate, recruited from 1996 through 1999, 19 had medulloblastoma. All 19 underwent craniospinal radiotherapy plus a boost to the posterior fossa (mean +/- SD of 5410 +/- 130 rad [54.1 +/- 1.3 Gy] to the posterior fossa, mean +/- SD of 3470 +/- 460 rad [34.7 +/- 4.6 Gy] to the whole brain and spinal axis), and 8 of 19 under-went chemotherapy. The remaining 5 patients had ependymoma and underwent irradiation to the posterior fossa only (mean SD of 5680 +/- 720 rad [ 56.8 +/- 7.2 Gy]). Therefore, there were 3 treatment groups: craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapy, only craniospinal irradiation, and only posterior fossa irradiation. Bone mineral studies were performed a mean +/- SD of 5.42 +/- 3.23 years after therapy. Our patients had lower total body BMD (mean z score, -0.47; 95% confidence interval, -0.85 to -0.09) and lumbar spine BMD (mean z score, -1.27; 95% confidence interval, -1.81 to -0.73) as compared with those of the the general population. There was no significant difference in mean lumbar spine BMD between patients in the 3 groups. Our patients consumed a diet deficient in vitamin D and calcium (mean +/- SD 53.6% +/- 24.1% and 70.0% +/- 37.4% of the amount recommended, respectively). Of 7 patients who underwent measurements 1 year later, 5 had in increase in BMD that was parallel to normal curves, with no compensatory increase. Four patients were hypothyroid, 6 were growth hormone deficient, and 6 were both. All hormones were replaced, with the exception of growth hormone in 1 patient. By using regression analysis, the factors that affected lumbar spine BMD, protectively in both cases, were calcium intake (beta = 0.015, 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.029) and female sex (beta = 1.422, 95% confidence interval, 0.456-2.388). Conclusions: Children who have undergone irradiation for posterior fossa tumors have diminished total body and lumbar spine BMD, as compared with those of the general population. This reduction was similar within all 3 treatment groups, which suggests that chemotherapy did not play a major role and that localized irradiation may have systemic effects. This population often has balance and gait problems, so the risk of falling, coupled with osteopenia, may place them at considerably increased risk of fractures.

Lower omega-3 levels are associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), increases in cardiac events in CAD patients, and depression. We sought to examine relationships between depression and serum levels of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs in patients recovering from acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Methods., We carried out a case-control study of serum PUFA levels and current major depression in 54 age- and sex-matched pairs approximately 2 months following ACS! Results. Depressed patients bad significantly lower concentrations of total omega-3 and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and higher ratios of arachidonic acid (AA) to DHA, AA to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and n-3 to n-6 than controls. There were no baseline differences in any potential risk or protective factors for depression. Conclusions. Results are consistent with previous reports in depressed patients without CAD, and with literature concerning omega-3 levels and risk of CAD events. Dietary, genetic, and hormonal factors may all play a role in both depression and CAD. Both prospective studies and randomized trials are needed to help clarify the interrelationships.

Participants were to listen carefully to the sentences and to perform a rehearsal task. Passive listening to flattened speech compared to normal speech produced strong brain responses in right cortical areas, particularly in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). Passive listening to degraded speech compared to either normal or flattened speech particularly involved fronto-opercular and subcortical (Putamen, Caudate Nucleus) regions bilaterally. Additionally the Rolandic operculum (premotor cortex) in the right hemisphere subserved processing of neat sentence intonation. As a function of explicit rehearsing sentence intonation we found several activation foci in the left inferior frontal gyros (Broca's area), the left inferior precentral sulcus, and the left Rolandic fissure. The data allow several suggestions: First, both flattened and degraded speech evoked differential brain responses in the pSTG, particularly in the planum temporale (PT) bilaterally indicating that this region mediates integration of slowly and rapidly changing acoustic cues during comprehension of spoken language. Second, the bilateral circuit active whilst participants receive degraded speech reflects general effort allocation. Third, the differential finding for passive perception and explicit rehearsal of intonation contour Suggests a right fronto-lateral network for processing and a left fronto-lateral network for producing prosodic information. Finally, it appears that brain areas which subserve speech (frontal operculum) and premotor functions (Rolandic operculum) coincidently support the processing of intonation contour in spoken sentence comprehension.

Quantitative in vitro autoradiographic studies were also performed on the brain of both strains with specific radioligands for B-2 receptors [I-125]HPP-Hoe 140 and B-1 receptors [I-125]HPP-des-Arg(10) and Hoe140. 2 MAP increased linearly with doses of BK (81-8100 pmol) and the amplitudes were significantly greater in SHR, particularly at 16 weeks. While BK evoked a negative linear trend on HR (bradycardia) in WKY, a positive one (tachycardia) was observed in adult SHR. In both strains, BK-induced pressor response was blocked by equimolar doses of B-2 receptor antagonist, D-Arg-[Hyp(3) Thi(5), D-Tic(7), Oic(8)]-BK (Hoe 140), but not by B-1 receptor antagonist, AcLys[D-betaNal(7), Ile(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK (R-715). 3 B-1 receptor agonists (Sar-[D-Phe(8)]-des-Arg(9)-BK, des-Arg(9)-BK, des-Arg(10)-Kallidin) and antagonist (R-715 alone or with Hoe 140) had no or marginal effect on MAP and HR at doses up to 8100 pmol in SHR and WKY. 4 Higher densities of specific [I-125]HPP-Hoe 140 labelling were found in discrete brain areas of SHR, especially in regions associated with cardiovascular function. Low levels of [I-121]HPP-[des-Arg(10)]-Hoe140 binding sites were seen in WKY and SHR, yet densities were significantly greater in midbrain and cortical regions of SHR aged of 16 weeks. Contrary to SHR, ageing caused a downregulation of B-2 and B-1 receptor binding sites in specific brain nuclei in WKY. 5 It is concluded that the hypersensitivity of the pressor response to i.c.v. BK in SHR occurs during both the early and established phases of hypertension in parallel with the enhancement of B-2 receptor binding sites in various cardiovascular brain centres. In contrast, brain B-1 receptors do not seem to participate in the central pressor effects of kinins nor in the maintenance of hypertension in SHR.

Aims: Using improved imaging techniques, previously inaccessible brain regions were examined in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy volunteers with 4.0 T P-31-MRS. Method: Brain spectra were collected in vivo from 15 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 15 healthy volunteers from 15 cm(3) effective voxels in the thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, anterior/posterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex and parieto-occipital cortex. Results: People with first-episode schizophrenia showed increased levels of glycerophosphocholine in the anterior cingulate. Inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate concentrations were also increased in the anterior cingulate in this group. Conclusions: The increased phosphodiester and high-energy phosphate levels in the anterior cingulate of brains of people with first-episode schizophrenia may indicate neural overactivity in this region during the early stages of the illness, resulting in increased excitotoxic neural membrane breakdown.

Methods: Using a multicentre international study protocol, 103 patients were randomized to receive either sevoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anesthesia during interventional neuroradiology procedures. After a standardized induction of anesthesia with propofol, 53 patients received sevoflurane 1 to 3% with 60% nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxygen (O-2), and 50 patients received propofol 4 to 10 mg(.)kg(-1.)hr(-1) with 60% N2O in O-2. Maintenance agents were titrated against systemic arterial blood pressure (baseline mean arterial pressure +/- 20%). Recovery times, changes in sedation, pain, nausea and vomiting and psychomotor function during recovery and use of rescue medication were recorded. Results: The group receiving sevoflurane had a more rapid recovery to spontaneous ventilation, extubation, eye opening and orientation compared to the group receiving propofol (3 vs 4 min, P = 0.01; 5 vs 6 min, P = 0.015; 7 vs 10 min, P < 0.001; 13 vs 17 min, P = 0.028; respectively). Sedation, pain, nausea and vomiting, and psychomotor function scores were similar in the two groups. Use of opioid boluses and vasopressors were similar. Conclusion: The use of sevoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia for prolonged neuroradiological procedures is associated with more rapid early recovery than propofol and is associated with similar side effects. Sevoflurane and propofol can both be recommended for these procedures. The clinical benefit of the more rapid recovery with sevoflurane is unknown.

Methods: We used magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether differences in disability in cohorts of multiple sclerosis patients with similar T2-weighted lesion volume and disease duration were associated with a more destructive disease process in the more disabled patients. Results: The benign and severely disabled groups had similar brain atrophy metrics and similar decreases of the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate, in the normal appearing white matter of the cerebrum on magnetic resonance spectroscopy examination in vivo. The severely disabled cohort had more spinal cord atrophy. Conclusion: The dissociation of spinal cord atrophy and cerebral atrophy between these two groups suggests that the difference between the more benign and more disabled groups cannot be explained by a more aggressive pathological process that is affecting the entire neuroaxis in a homogeneous fashion.

While botulinum toxin A, better known as Botox(TM), is universally recognised by the public as a cosmetic enhancement tool, the botulinum neurotoxins are commonly used off-label for many medical conditions in ophthalmology, neurology and dermatology. The versatility of these botulinum toxins has made Clostridium botulinum one of the most widely known bacterial pathogens in medical history. This article outlines the discovery of botulinum toxins through to their present day applications in medicine.

In this study, 37 subjects aged 52 to 80 were tested three times with an inter-assessment interval of 14 days. The battery included the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, the Stroop interference test, the Letter-Number Sequencing test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the Ruff 2 and 7 Selective Attention Test, the Tower of London, the Verbal Fluency test, and simple, choice, and sequential reaction time tests. The results showed that tasks were generally subject to a practice effect, except for those with alternate forms. In all tests, there were a number of scores demonstrating good TRR, but others, although largely used in clinical practice, failed to reach acceptable TRR standards. Usually, time derived scores were associated with the best TRR.

The levels of metallothionein-like proteins (MT), lipid peroxidation, protein-free DNA strands and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were assayed in digestive gland, gill and gonad tissues to evaluate biological effects and damage. The levels of monoamines (serotonin and dopamine) in nerve ganglia, ATP-dependent transport activity and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity were also investigated in the homogenates, synaptosomes and mitochondria, respectively. Results showed that significant amounts of sediment accumulated in cages and 82% of mussels survived the yearlong exposure period at the downstream sites. MT-like proteins were induced in all tissues with the following response intensity: gill (3-fold), digestive gland (1.4-fold) and gonad tissues (1.3-fold). Lipid peroxidation decreased (2.5-fold) in digestive gland but increased in gill (1.6-fold) and in gonad tissues (1.5-fold). GST activity was readily increased in digestive gland (2.5-fold), suggesting the presence of organic contaminants in the plume. Levels of protein-free DNA strands did not vary significantly in digestive gland and gill tissues but were significantly reduced in gonad tissues (2.5-fold) relative to the upstream site. In visceral nerve ganglia, both serotonin and ATP-dependent serotonin transport decreased 1.7-fold with a 4-fold increase of 5-hydroxyindole acetate (5-HIAA, a serotonin metabolite) level relative to the upstream site. However, MAO activity was somewhat reduced at downstream sites (0.7- to 0.9-fold of the activity at the upstream site). Dopamine levels were found to be decreased (1.5-fold), but dopamine ATP-dependent transport activity was increased 1.8-fold, suggesting reduced dopaminergic activity. These results indicate that estrogenic chemicals are likely at play, and the increased dopamine and decreased serotonin ATP-dependent transport suggest that the municipal plume was serotonergic for mussels located at the downstream sites. Mussels exposed for 1 year display a complex but characteristic pattern of responses that could lead to harmful health effects including neuroendocrine disruption of reproduction.

It was hypothesized that the two components were spatially separable and that the activity matched prior localization knowledge. Participants examined visual-auditory sentence pairs that related within a semantic hierarchy (e.g., visual: "The man is teaching in the classroom"; Auditory: "The man is in the... school/barn"). Semantic congruency was varied for the final words of the spoken sentences. Incongruent words mismatched expectation in terms of both the initial phonological features (unexpected sound) and semantic features (unexpected meaning). In addition, the category-exemplar probability of the final words was either high or low, with low probability words being more difficult to anticipate. Low probability words were predicted to selectively affect PMN activity. We found that incongruent words elicited a PMN (287 msec) and a N400 (424 msec), for both the high and low probability words. As expected, low probability congruent words elicited a small PMN but no N400. In contrast, high probability congruent words elicited neither a detectible PMN nor a N400. The primary PMN sources were in left inferior frontal and inferior parietal lobes. The primary N400 source activation occurred along the left perisylvian cortex, consistent with prior N400 source localization work. From these results, it was concluded that the PMN and N400 were localized to separate cortical language (and memory) regions and had different source activation patterns. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Biological monitoring of n-hexane (HEX) is based on the measurement of urinary 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD). In 2001, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists modified the biological exposure index (BEI) for HEX and suggested measuring free urinary 2,5-HD (without hydrolysis) (3.5 mumol/l) instead of total 2,5-HD (acid hydrolysis). This BEI value was derived from four field studies that involved worker exposures to variable concentrations of HEX and other solvents. This study was undertaken to characterize, for 5 consecutive days, the relationship between HEX exposure (25 ppm and 50 ppm) and (1) 2,5-HD urinary excretion and (2) HEX in alveolar air. Methods. Five volunteers (three women, two men) were exposed to HEX in an exposure chamber for 2 non-consecutive weeks (7 h/day). They were exposed to 50 ppm HEX, during the first week and to 25 ppm during the second week. Alveolar air and urine samples were collected at different intervals before, during and after the exposures. The concentration of unchanged HEX in alveolar air and the concentration of urinary 2,5-HD under three analytical conditions (with acid, or enzymatic hydrolysis and without hydrolysis) were measured. Results. The results show that the mean concentrations of HEX in alveolar air were 18 ppm (25 ppm) and 37 ppm (50 ppm), which indicates that approximately 73% of inspired HEX was expired unchanged in alveolar air by the volunteers. The mean (+/- SD) concentrations of urinary 2,5-HD for the last 4 h of exposure at the end of the week (day 5) following exposure to 50 ppm HEX were 30.4 mumol/l (+/-7.8 mumol/l) (acid hydrolysis); 5.8 mumol/l (+/-1.0 mumol/l) (enzymatic hydrolysis); 6.2 mumol/l (+/-0.9 mumol/l) (without hydrolysis). Following the volunteers' exposure to 25 ppm HEX, the urinary excretion concentrations were 15.2 mumol/l +/-1.9 mumol/l, 3.1 mumol/l +/-0.7 mumol/l and 3.7 mumol/l +/-0.5 mumol/l, respectively. Conclusion. Both free urinary 2,5-HD and HEX in alveolar air measurements could be used for the biological monitoring of HEX. Between these two indicators, HEX in alveolar air is less variable than 2,5-HD in urine, but the sampling time is more critical. Therefore, biological monitoring of HEX based on the measurement of free urinary 2,5-HD is preferable to HEX in alveolar air. Additionally, we believe that the 2,5-HD values reported in this study better reflect the actual levels of exposure to HEX alone than what has been previously reported in studies that involved co-exposure to other solvents, and that the current BEI value for HEX is most likely more protective than what has been believed up until now.

Brain monoamines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HE. We examined the relationship between monoamine dysfunction and the degree of portal-systemic shunting (PSS) in rats with varying degrees of PSS. Methods: Concentrations of catecholamines, serotonin, histamine, precursors and metabolites in frontal cortex of rats with varying degrees of PSS (9-99.8%) were measured by HPLC. Results: The concentrations of the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, and its metabolite, 5-HIAA were increased up to 4-fold in brains of rats with various degrees of PSS and were significantly correlated with the degree of shunting and with arterial ammonia levels. Brain levels of histamine, its precursor, L-histidine, and metabolite, tele-methylhistamine were significantly increased only following total shunting. Concentrations of catecholamines and their metabolites were not significantly correlated with degree of PSS or hyperammonemia. Conclusions: Given the established role of the serotonin system in the regulation of sleep, circadian rhythmicity and locomotion these findings suggest that selective alterations of this system could be implicated in the pathogenesis of HE. Therapeutic approaches aimed at the normalization of serotonin turnover could be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of early neuropsychiatric symptoms of HE.

While spheroids of murine and human astrocytoma cells can be prepared using spinning cultures, spheroid preparation using many cell lines is not amenable to this method. We have developed a reproducible system of creating implantable spheroids that is applicable to different cell lines, and is independent of cell line characteristics. Methods: For murine and human brain tumor cell lines, 20 mul drops containing predetermined cell concentrations were suspended from the lids of culture dishes and the resulting aggregates were transferred to culture dishes base-coated with agar. The two-dimensional aggregates formed three-dimensional spheroids on the non-permissive agar substrate, and were then implanted into three-dimensional collagen I gels and the invasive activity assessed. The invasive activity of C6 and U251 spheroids prepared by hanging drops was compared to spheroids of similar size prepared by spinner culture. Results: The hanging drop method produced implantable spheroids capable of sustained invasion using all cell lines tested. Most cell lines required initial hanging drop cell concentrations of 45 000 cells/drop, suspension times of 48, and 72 h on agar. C6 spheroids had the same invasive capacity regardless of the model utilized, however U251 spheroids produced by hanging drops had significantly increased invasion compared to those prepared by spinner culture. Only spheroids prepared by spinner culture showed histological evidence of central necrosis. Conclusions: This model represents a reproducible approach to the preparation of implantable spheroids with invasive potential that compares with those produced using spinner culture. The use of hanging drops broadens the applicability of three-dimensional in vitro assays examining brain tumor invasiveness.

Here, we show that treatment of neurons with 17beta-E2 results in a proteasomal-dependent but ubiquitin-independent degradation of endogenous and exogenous active Csp-6 in live neurons and in cell free assays, respectively. We further show that the proteasomal-dependent degradation of Csp-6 is not required for its inhibition. Using several protease inhibitors, we find that leupeptin, E-64, and ALLN prevent inhibition of recombinant active Csp-6 (R-Csp-6) in 17beta-E2-treated neuronal protein extracts. Because all three protease inhibitors have the ability to inhibit cysteine proteases, we believe that a cysteinyl protease activity may be required for 17beta-E2-mediated inhibition of active Csp-6. However, we exclude caspases, calpains, and cathepsins as potential cysteinyl proteases involved in the 17beta-E2-mediated Csp-6 inhibition. The results suggest that a proteolytic activity inhibited by leupeptin, E-64, and ALLN is needed to inhibit Csp-6 and that the inhibited Csp-6 is subsequently degraded by the proteasome. The mechanism of 17beta-E2-mediated inhibition of Csp-6 is different from the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of Csp-3 and Csp-7 by XIAP and cIAP2 but consistent with the mechanism of Baculovirus p35 inhibition of caspases.

Here, we studied the activation state of ERK1/2 in rat hippocampal slices during application of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 mum), a procedure that enhances synaptic transmission and leads to the appearance of epileptiform activity. Hippocampal slices superfused with 4AP-containing medium exhibited a marked activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation that peaked within about 20 min. These effects were not accompanied by changes in the activation state of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), another member of the MAP kinase superfamily. 4AP-induced ERK1/2 activation was inhibited by the voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 mum). We also found that application of the ERK pathway inhibitors U0126 (50 mum) or PD98059 (100 mum) markedly reduced 4AP-induced epileptiform synchronization, thus abolishing ictal discharges in the CA3 area. The effects induced by U0126 or PD98059 were not associated with changes in the amplitude and latency of the field potentials recorded in the CA3 area following electrical stimuli delivered in the dentate hylus. These data demonstrate that activation of ERK1/2 accompanies the appearance of epileptiform activity induced by 4AP and suggest a cause-effect relationship between the ERK pathway and epileptiform synchronization.

Analyses were carried out on primary cultures of astrocytes isolated from the cerebral cortex of neonatal Wistar rats and CTX TNA2, an immortalized rat astrocyte cell line. Both cell cultures display morphological features typical of type I astrocytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed mdr1a and mdr1b mRNA in primary cultures of astrocytes and in CTX TNA2 cells. Western blot analysis using the P-glycoprotein monoclonal C219 antibody detected a single band of appropriate size in both cell systems. Immunocytochemical analysis using the monoclonal antibodies C219 and MRK16 labeled P-glycoprotein along the plasma membrane, caveolae, coated vesicles and nuclear envelope. Immunoprecipitation studies using the caveolin-1 polyclonal H-97 antibody demonstrated that P-glycoprotein is physically associated with caveolin-1 in both cell culture systems. The accumulation of [H-3]digoxin (an established P-glycoprotein substrate) by the astrocyte cultures was significantly enhanced in the presence of standard P-glycoprotein inhibitors and an ATP depleting agent. These results demonstrate the cellular/subcellular location and functional expression of P-glycoprotein in rat astrocytes and suggest that this glial compartment may play an important role in the regulation of drug transport in the CNS.

These physiological events are characterized by opposing body fluid regulations. Quantitative in situ hybridization analysis showed that starting from mid-pregnancy, ANP mRNA declined in neurones of the preoptic area, periventricular area, lateral hypothalamus and endorhinal nucleus, and remained low at postpartum. By contrast, magnocellular cells in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) showed four- and 10-fold more ANP mRNA in sections from preterm and postpartum rats, respectively, compared to nonpregnant controls (P < 0.001). Oxytocin mRNA paralleled ANP mRNA expression in the SON, whereas vasopressin mRNA rose in early pregnancy and declined thereafter. High hypothalamic ANP concentration at day 21 of gestation versus nonpregnant rats (3.1 &PLUSMN; 0.5 versus 1.8 &PLUSMN; 0.4 ng/mg protein, P < 0.05) suggested that ANP transcript accumulation in the SON is associated with increased utilization of the peptide. The elevation of hypothalamic ANP (two-fold) and ANP receptors by treatment of ovariectomized rats with 17beta-oestradiol (25 mug/rat, 10 days) was abolished by coadministration of progesterone. Thus, we concluded that-elevated oestradiol at term stimulates ANP synthesis and paracrine ANP activation in the hypothalamus. Overall, we provide experimental, anatomical and molecular evidence for ANP regulation in hypothalamic neurones at preterm and after 17beta-oestradiol stimulation. Our study supports the concept that ANP expressed in the SON acts as a peptidergic neurotransmitter involved in water and salt regulation during pregnancy and postpartum.

Whereas experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is exacerbated in mice deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), inhibitor studies have suggested a pro-inflammatory role for NO. These discrepancies may reflect balance between immunoregulatory and neurocytopathologic roles for NO. We investigated selective effects of bone marrow-derived versus CNS parenchymal sources of iNOS in EAE in chimeric mice. Chimeras that selectively expressed or ablated iNOS in leukocytes both showed significant delay in disease onset, with no difference in disease severity. We conclude that bone marrow-derived and CNS parenchymal sources of iNOS-derived NO both play a regulatory role in EAE. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traditionally, it has been assumed that the vestibular system reliably encodes head-in-space motion throughout our daily activities and that subsequent processing by upstream cerebellar and cortical pathways is required to transform this information into the reference frames required for voluntary behaviors. However, recent studies have radically changed the way we view the vestibular system. In particular, the results of recent single-unit studies in head-unrestrained monkeys have shown that the vestibular system provides the CNS with more than an estimate of head motion. This review first considers how head-in-space velocity is processed at the level of the vestibular afferents and vestibular nuclei during active versus passive head movements. While vestibular information appears to be similarly processed by vestibular afferents during passive and active motion, it is differentially processed at the level of the vestibular nuclei. For example, one class of neurons in vestibular nuclei, which receives direct inputs from semicircular canal afferents, is substantially less responsive to active head movements than to passively applied head rotations. The projection patterns of these neurons strongly suggest that they are involved in generating head-stabilization responses as well as shaping vestibular information for the computation of spatial orientation. In contrast, a second class of neurons in the vestibular nuclei that mediate the vestibuloocular reflex process vestibular information in a manner that depends principally on the subject's current gaze strategy rather than whether the head movement was self-generated or externally applied. The implications of these results are then discussed in relation to the status of vestibular reflexes (i.e., the vestibuloocular, vestibulocollic, and cervicoocular reflexes) and implications for higher-level processing of vestibular information during active head movements.

In laboratory animals, they promptly attenuate the responsiveness of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) and norepinephrine (NE) neurons to agonists of their cell-body autoreceptors, as is the case for some antidepressant drugs that are currently in clinical use. Long-term, but not subacute, antagonism of NK1 receptors in rats increases 5-HT transmission in the hippocampus, a property common to all antidepressant treatments tested thus far. This enhancement seems to be mediated by a time-dependent increase in the firing rate of 5-HT neurons. Mice with the NK1 receptor deleted from their genetic code also have an increased firing rate of 5-HT neurons. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that NK1 antagonists could become a new class of antidepressant and anxiolytic agents.

Recently, a mouse NL1 protein, a novel member of the family, was identified and shown to be expressed mainly in the testis as a secreted protein. To define its physiological role(s), we used a gene targeting strategy to disrupt the endogenous murine Nl1 gene by homologous recombination and generate Nl1 mutant mice. The Nl1(-/-) mice were viable and developed normally,. suggesting that zygotic expression of Nl1 is not required for development. However, Nl1(-/-) males produced smaller litters than their wild-type siblings, indicating specific male fertility problems. Reduced fertility may be explained by two impaired processes, decreased egg fertilization and perturbed early development of fertilized eggs. These two phenotypes did not result from gross anatomical modifications of the testis or from impaired spermatogenesis. Basic sperm parameters were also normal. Thus, our findings suggest that one of the roles of NL1 in mice is related to sperm function and that NL1 modulates the processes of fertilization and early embryonic development in vivo.

It is well established that one such stimulus is strong synaptic activity. Our interest, however, is whether-weak activity generated at developing synapses also signals to the nucleus and if so, can these signals be modulated by extrinsic factors. Using cultured hippocampal neurons and a highly sensitive readout of CRE-mediated gene expression, we demonstrate that weak synaptic transmission, including non-evoked, spontaneous transmitter release, induces ongoing gene expression. These weak synaptic stimuli, acting through NMIDA receptors, signal to the nucleus through a MAPK pathway, without a significant contribution of L-type Ca2+ channels. In addition, we show that BDNF, a molecule that has clear effects on synaptic plasticity, enhances this CRE-dependent gene expression by acting upstream of NMDA receptors. On the other hand, low levels of nicotine, which also effects synaptic plasticity, suppress ongoing CRE-mediated gene expression indirectly by acting on GABAergic neurons; this indirect action on gene expression suggests an alternative mechanism for how nicotine produces long-lasting changes.

PVN and supraoptic nuclei contain five major cell types: oxytocin-, vasopressin-, CRH-, somatostatin-, and TRH-secreting neurons. Sim1, Arnt2, and Otp genes are essential for terminal differentiation of these neurons. One of their common downstream genes, Brn2, is necessary for oxytocin, vasopressin, and CRH cell differentiation. Here we show that Sim2, a paralog of Sim1, contributes to the expression of Trh and Ss genes in the dorsal preoptic area, anterior-periventricular nucleus, and PVN. Sim2 expression overlaps with Trh- and Ss-expressing cells, and Sim2 mutants contain reduced numbers of Trh and Ss cells. Genetically, Sim1 acts upstream of Sim2 and partially compensates for the loss of Sim2. Comparative expression studies at the anterior hypothalamus at early stages reveal that there are separate pools of Trh cells with distinctive molecular codes defined by Sim1 and Sim2 expression. Together with previous reports, our results demonstrate that Sim1 and Otp utilize two common downstream genes, Brn2 and Sim2, to mediate distinctive sets of neuroendocrine hormone gene expression.

J	Ma, L; Khorasani, K				Ma, L; Khorasani, K			New training strategies for constructive neural networks with application to regression problems	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						constructive neural networks; network growth; network pruning; training strategy; regression and function approximation	LEARNING ALGORITHM; SPEED-UP; FEEDFORWARD	Regression problem is an important application area for neural networks (NNs). Among a large number of existing NN architectures, the feedforward NN (FNN) paradigm is one of the most widely used structures. Although one-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (OHLFNNs) have simple Structures, they possess interesting representational and learning capabilities. In this paper, we are interested particularly in incremental constructive training of OHL-FNNs. In the proposed incremental Constructive training schemes for an OHL-FNN, input-side training and output-side training may be separated in order to reduce the training time. A new technique is proposed to scale the error signal during the constructive learning process to improve the input-side training efficiency and to obtain better generalization performance. Two pruning methods for removing the input-side redundant connections have also been applied. Numerical simulations demonstrate the potential and advantages of the proposed strategies when compared to other existing techniques in the literature. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regional brain activations associated with a working memory task were obtained from a group of concussed athletes (15 symptomatic, I asymptomatic) and eight matched control subjects, using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. The average percent signal change from baseline to working memory condition in each region of interest was computed. Symptomatic concussed athletes demonstrated task-related activations in some but not all the regions of interest, even when they performed as well as the control subjects. Furthermore, several concussed athletes had additional increases in activity outside the regions of interest, not seen in the control group. Quantitative analysis of BOLD signals within regions of interest revealed that, in general, concussed athletes had different BOLD responses compared to the control subjects. The task-related activation pattern of the one symptom-free athlete was comparable to that of the control group. We also repeated the study in one athlete whose symptoms had resolved. On the first study, when he was still symptomatic, less task-related activations were observed. On follow-up, once his symptoms had disappeared, the task-related activations became comparable to those of the control group. These results demonstrate the potential of fMRI, in conjunction with the working memory task, to identify an underlying pathology in symptomatic concussed individuals with normal structural imaging results.

Until now, statistical tests for these two situations have developed separately. This work introduces statistical tests for assessing simultaneously the significance of spatiotemporal event-related potential/event-related field (ERP/ERF) components and that of their sources. The test for detecting a component at a given time instant is provided by a Hotelling's T-2 statistic. This statistic is constructed in such a manner to be invariant to any choice of reference and is based upon a generalized version of the average reference transform of the data. As a consequence, the proposed test is a generalization of the well-known Global Field Power statistic. Consideration of tests at all time instants leads to a multiple comparison problem addressed by the use of Random Field Theory (RFT). The Union-Intersection (UI) principle is the basis for testing hypotheses about the topographic and tomographic distributions of such ERP/ERF components. The performance of the method is illustrated with actual EEG recordings obtained from a visual experiment of pattern reversal stimuli. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) agonist quinolinic acid (QUIN)-induced excitotoxicity has been implicated in neurodegeneration and mimics Huntington's disease (HD) by the loss of medium-sized spiny projection neurons while sparing medium-sized aspiny interneurons in the striatum. Previous work Suggests that somatostatin/neuropeptide Y (SST/NPY)-containing neurons are selectively preserved in HD due to the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) and the lack of NMDAR. In the present Study, the distribution of somatostatin (SST), neuropeptide Y (NPY), nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), NMDA receptor type-1 (NR1), and the enzyme NADPH-d was determined in cultured striatal neurons with the effect of QUIN and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). SST/NPY-positive neurons, which constitute similar to8-10% of striatal neurons, are selectively spared in QUIN/NMDA-treated cultures. nNOS and NADPH-d-positive neurons, comprising 3.8% of the neuronal population, also exhibit selective resistance to excitotoxicity. Most NR1-positive neurons, which constitute >80% of the total neuronal population, are lost in majority upon treatment with QUIN and NMDA. SST and NADPH-d-positive neurons also colocalize with Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD). In conclusion, our results thus demonstrate that SST/NPY/nNOS-positive neurons are selectively spared in NMDA agonist-induced excitotoxicity, which Could be attributed to the presence of Cu/Zn SOD and NADPH-d in addition to the low abundance of NMDAR on these neurons.

METHODS: The model was constructed in six domestic swine by elongating the common carotid artery using interpositional grafts. Balloon catheters (n = 3), stents (n = 2), and a snare were tested 9 to 13 days after surgery. Device performance was evaluated by angiography, macroscopic photography, and histopathological examination. RESULTS: Animals tolerated the surgical procedure well, and artificial siphons were thought to provide realistic conditions for device testing. Balloon catheters induced minimal trauma, whereas coronary stents caused severe spasm or thrombosis and extensive macroscopic changes. CONCLUSION: Construction of an in vivo siphon model is feasible and potentially useful for testing neurovascular devices.

However, paclitaxel produces peripheral neurotoxicity with patients reporting sensory abnormalities and neuropathic pain during and often persisting after paclitaxel therapy. The mechanisms underlying this dose-limiting side effect are Currently unknown and there are no validated drugs for its prevention or control. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received four intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections on alternate days of 2 mg/kg paclitaxel. Behavioural assessment using von Frey filaments and acetone showed that such paclitaxel treatment induced a pronounced mechanical and cold allodynia/hyperalgesia. Thus these studies aim to test potential analgesics on established paclitaxel-induced pain. Paclitaxel-induced pain appears to be relatively resistant to opioid therapy i.p. 4 mg/kg morphine was ineffective and i.p. 8 mg/kg morphine only elicited up to a 50% reversal of mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia. Interestingly, a maximally tolerated dose (i.p. 0.2 mg/ka) of the potent NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 produced no significant reversal of the mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia suggesting that NMDA receptors have little role in paclitaxel-induced pain. Ethosuximide (i.p. 450 mg/kg) an anti-epileptic and relatively selective T-type calcium channel blocker elicited a near complete reversal of mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia. Repetitive dosing with ethosuximide (i.p. 100 or 300 mg/kg daily for 3 days) showed a dose-related consistent reversal of mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia with no evidence of tolerance. Ethosuximide (i.p. 300 mg/kg) also reversed paclitaxel-induced cold allodynia and vincristine-induced mechanical allodynia/hyperalgesia. These data Suggest that T-type calcium channels may play a role in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and moreover identify ethosuximide as a new potential for chemotherapy-induced pain.

This study aimed to answer the following questions: does a ventilator-assisted breath 1) reduce neural inspiratory time, 2) reduce the amplitude of the diaphragm electrical activity, and 3) prolong neural expiration, within the delivered breath? In 14 infants recovering from acute respiratory failure (mean age and weight were 2.3 +/- 1.3 mo and 3.95 +/- 0.82 kg, respectively), we measured 1) the electrical activity of the diaphragm with a multiple-array esophageal electrode, and 2) airway opening pressure, while patients breathed on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (mean rate, 11.2 +/- 6.5 breaths/min). We compared neural inspiratory and expiratory times for the mandatory breaths and for the spontaneous breaths immediately preceding and following the mandatory breath. Although neural inspiratory time was not different between mandatory and spontaneous breaths, neural expiratory time was significantly increased (p < 0.001) for the mandatory breaths (953 +/- 449 ms) compared with the premandatory and postmandatory spontaneous breaths (607 +/- 268 ms and 560 +/- 227 ms, respectively). Delivery of the mandatory breath resulted in a reduction in neural respiratory frequency by 28.6 +/- 6.4% from the spontaneous premandatory frequency. The magnitude of inspiratory electrical activity of the diaphragm was similar for all three breath conditions. For the mandatory breaths, ventilatory assist persisted for 507 +/- 169 ms after the end of neural inspiratory time. Infant-ventilator asynchrony (both inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony) was present in every mandatory breath and constituted 53.4 +/- 26.2% of the total breath duration.

Congenital amusia is a lifelong disability for processing music despite normal intellectual, memory, and language skills. Here we present evidence that the disorder stems from a deficit in fine-grained pitch perception. Amusic and control adults were presented with monotonic and isochronous sequences of five tones (i.e., constant pitch and intertone interval). They were required to detect when the fourth tone was displaced in pitch or time. All amusic participants were impaired in detecting the pitch changes, and showed no sign of improvement with practice. In contrast, they detected time changes as well as control adults and exhibited similar improvements with practice. Thus, the degraded pitch perception seen in the amusic individuals cannot be ascribed to nonspecific problems with the task or to poor hearing in general. Rather, the data point to the presence of a congenital neural anomaly that selectively impairs pitch processing.

We examined whether the detrimental effects of lexical competition on word identification are exaggerated in SZ. The results showed that SZ patients were less able than controls to identify words coming from high lexical competitor environments (i.e., high density and high frequency lexical neighborhoods). They did not differ from controls, however, in identifying words coming from low lexical competitor environments (i.e., low density and low frequency lexical neighborhoods). Further, when SZ patients misidentified high competitor words, the erroneously reported words were of a significantly higher frequency than those reported by controls when they misidentified high competitor words (i.e., the HF misidentification bias). Identification accuracy for high competitor words negatively correlated with amount of thought disorder, and the HF misidentification bias positively correlated with the lifetime frequency and severity of auditory hallucinations, the latter of which serving as presumed independent measures of STL dysfunction in SZ.

Measurements and Results: Sleep-wake log documentation and wrist-activity recordings for more than 6 consecutive months confirmed the patient's tendency to live on longer-than-24-hour "days." Episodes of relative coordination to the 24-hour day were also noted, suggesting that the patient was transiently in and out of phase with environmental synchronizers too weak to fully entrain her to the geophysical environment. Interestingly, we noted a tendency to initiate sleep between 3:00 am and 5:00 am and wake up from sleep between noon and 1:00 pm. Conclusions: These results support an association between the hypernyctohemeral syndrome and the DSPS. This association may carry implications for the treatment of circadian rhythms disorders.

We present here the first three-dimensional structure of a classical cadherin prosequence, solved by NMR. The prototypic prosequence of N-cadherin consists of an Ig-like domain and an unstructured C-terminal region. The folded part of the prosequence-termed prodomain-has a striking structural resemblance to cadherin "adhesive" domains that could not have been predicted from the amino acid sequence due to low sequence similarities. Our detailed structural and evolutionary analysis revealed that prodomains are distant relatives of cadherin "adhesive" domains but lack all the features known to be important for cadherin-cadherin interactions. The presence of an additional "nonadhesive" domain seems to make it impossible to engage homophilic interactions between cadherins that are necessary to activate adhesion, thus explaining the inactive state of prodomain-bearing cadherins.

MARS uses a divide-and-conquer approach to automatically classify the training data into several groups. In each group, a regression line or hyperplane is generated. Compared to other intelligent computing technologies, MARS is fast, flexible, and capable of determining the important inputs to the model. The inputs to the model include the day of the year the maximum and minimum air temperatures, rainfall, and potential evapotranspiration. The outputs contain the soil temperatures at depths of 100, 500, and 1500 mm. The performance of MARS was compared to that of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The correlation coefficients of linear regression from both MARS and ANNs were always higher than 0.950. MARS also indicated that the day of the year is the input that is most significant to the output, followed by the minimum air temperature. The results demonstrate the potential of MARS to be used as a regression technology in agricultural applications.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to elucidate and characterize the neural architecture underlying lexico-semantic processes in criminal psychopathic individuals and in a group of matched control participants. Participants performed a lexical decision task in which blocks of linguistic stimuli alternated with a resting baseline condition. In each lexical decision block, the stimuli were either concrete words and pseudowords or abstract words and pseudowords. Consistent with our hypothesis, psychopathic individuals, relative to controls, showed poorer behavioral performance for processing abstract words. Analysis of the fMRI data for both groups indicated that processing of word stimuli, compared with the resting baseline condition, was associated with neural activation in bilateral fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate, left middle temporal gyrus, right posterior superior temporal gyrus, and left and right inferior frontal gyrus. Analyses confirmed our prediction that psychopathic individuals would fail to show the appropriate neural differentiation between abstract and concrete stimuli in the right anterior temporal gyrus and surrounding cortex. The results are consistent with other studies of semantic processing in psychopathy and support the theory that psychopathy is associated with right hemisphere abnormalities for processing conceptually abstract material.

However, these studies have lacked well matched sensorimotor control conditions, making it difficult to know what sensory, cognitive, or motor features contributed to changes in dopaminergic activity. Here we report on [C-11] raclopride PET studies in which healthy humans performed card selection tasks for monetary rewards. During separate scans, subjects completed a variable ratio (VR) reward schedule with a 25% reward rate in which they did not know the outcome of their responses in advance, a fixed ratio (FR) 25% reward schedule in which outcomes were fully predictable, and a sensorimotor control (SC) condition involving similar sensory and motor demands but no rewards. Relative to the SC condition, the FR schedule produced only modest increases in dopamine transmission and no decreases relative to the SC condition. In contrast, the VR schedule produced significant increases in dopamine transmission in the left medial caudate nucleus while simultaneously producing significant decreases in other areas of the caudate and putamen. These data indicate: (1) the feasibility of measuring alterations in dopamine transmission even after controlling for sensorimotor features and (2) the complex and regionally specific influence of VR schedules on dopamine transmission. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to conflicting models of dopaminergic functioning arising from studies using electrophysiological and microdialysis techniques in animals.

Expression of BMP-2 and BMP-4, BMPR-IA (BMP receptor subunit), BMPR-IB, and BMPR-II, and the BMP antagonists, noggin, gremlin, chordin, and follistatin was found when neurons first appear in the primordial bowel at embryonic day 12 (E12). Agonists, receptors, and antagonists were detected in separated populations of neural crest- and noncrest-derived cells. When applied to immunopurified E12 ENS precursors, BMP-2 and BMP-4 induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated Smad-1 (Sma and Mad-related protein). The number of neurons developing from these cells was increased by low concentrations and decreased by high concentrations of BMP-2 or BMP-4. BMPs induced the precocious appearance of TrkC-expressing neurons and their dependence on neurotrophin-3 for survival. BMP-4 interacted with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF) to enhance neuronal development but limited GDNF-driven expansion of the precursor pool. BMPs also promoted development of smooth muscle from mesenchymal cells immunopurified at E12. To determine the physiological significance of these observations, the BMP antagonist noggin was overexpressed in the developing ENS of transgenic mice under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. Neuronal numbers in both enteric plexuses and smooth muscle were increased throughout the postnatal small intestine. These increases were already apparent by E18. In contrast, TrkC-expressing neurons decreased in both plexuses of postnatal noggin-overexpressing animals, again an effect detectable at E18. BMP-2 and/or BMP-4 thus limit the size of the ENS but promote the development of specific subsets of enteric neurons, including those that express TrkC.

Therefore, a knowledge of the distribution of Antho-RFamide-containing neurons in this species would contribute to our understanding of the early evolution of nervous systems. Using antisera raised against RFamide and FMRFamide, we detected immunostaining in numerous neurons throughout the nervous system of the sea pansy. The antisera revealed ectodermal nerve-nets on the upper and lower sides of the colony and on the oral side of tentacles, in the oral disk, and in the pharynx of feeding polyps. Neurons were immunostained also in the mesogleal nerve-net of feeding polyps and in the through-conducting mesogleal nerve-net of the colonial mass. Varying densities of stained neurons were observed in the different compartments of the endoderm: muscular walls of the feeding and water circulation polyps, mesenteric filaments and their derived follicles containing either ovocytes or spermatophores, in the endodermal channels connecting the different compartments of the colony, and in circular muscle of the peduncle. The distribution of immunostained neurons suggests that they play important roles in feeding, reproduction, neuromuscular transmission, and in neuro-neuronal transmission coordinating the different parts of the colony.

Although prefrontal brain expansion is mentioned as responsible for the appearance of such human trait, no current knowledge exists on the role of prefrontal areas in the aesthetic perception. The visual brain consists of "several parallel multistage processing systems, each specialized in a given task such as, color or motion" [Bartels, A. & Zeki, S. (1999) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 265, 2327-2332]. Here we report the results of an experiment carried out with magnetoencephalography which shows that the prefrontal area is selectively activated in humans during the perception of objects qualified as "beautiful" by the participants. Therefore, aesthetics can be hypothetically considered as an attribute perceived by means of a particular brain processing system, in which the prefrontal cortex seems to play a key role.

GPC3 is an X-linked gene that has its peak expression during development and that is downregulated in all investigated tissues after birth. GPC3 expression could be involved in the aetiology of embryonal tumours such as NB and WT. Methylation is known to play a role in gene silencing, notably in chromosome X inactivation. Southern blot- and PCR-based methylation assays were used to assess the methylation status of the GPC3 promoter on genomic DNA from both normal and embryonal tumour cells. In normal cells, the promoter was not methylated in males and partially methylated in females. Our results suggest that DNA methylation of the promoter region is not essential for the transcriptional repression of the GPC3 gene and that the methylation observed in females is probably linked to the inactive X chromosome. In tumour samples, methylation abnormalities have been found exclusively in female NB samples (loss of methylation) and mainly in male WT samples (gain of methylation). Overall, methylation did not significantly correlate with the expression status of GPC3. Although promoter methylation is likely to affect the expression status of the gene, our results suggest that the deregulation of GPC3 transcriptional expression seen in NB and WT involves other regulatory levels.

Patients and Methods Patients received a 2-hour infusion of tirapazamine, followed by 1,500 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide, and mesna once every 3 weeks. Dose escalation of tirapazamine began at 250 mg/m(2) and was increased by 30% in subsequent cohorts. If DLT was hematologic, less-heavily pretreated patients were to be enrolled until their DLTs were encountered, and MTDs defined. Pharmacokinetic profiles were also characterized. Results Twenty-three patients were enrolled onto the study. Pharmacokinetic data were calculated for 22 patients. Prolonged neutropenia was the DLT at 420 mg/m(2) in heavily pretreated patients. Grade 3, reversible ototoxicity was the DLT in less-heavily pretreated patients at 420 mg/m(2). Two (one with neuroblastoma and one with rhabdomyosarcoma) had partial responses. One child with neuroblastoma had prolonged stable disease (10 cycles) at a dose of 250 mg/m(2). This patient had disease detectable in the bone marrow only and all evidence of bone marrow involvement resolved for 17 cycles of therapy. Four other patients had stable disease. An apparent dose-proportional increase in tirapazamine maximal concentration and area under the curve(last) was observed. Tirapazamine clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state, and terminal half-life did not appear to be dose-dependent. Conclusion The recommended dose of tirapazamine given with 1,500 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide once every 3 weeks is 325 mg/m(2). Neutropenia and ototoxicity were dose-limiting. Based on early evidence of antitumor activity, additional studies appear warranted. (C) 2004 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

J	Michel, FJ; Robillard, JM; Trudeau, LE				Michel, FJ; Robillard, JM; Trudeau, LE			Regulation of rat mesencephalic GABAergic neurones through muscarinic receptors	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS; LAYER-II NEURONS; HIGH-AFFINITY INHIBITOR; RECTIFIER K+ CHANNELS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; G-PROTEIN; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION	Central dopamine neurones are involved in regulating cognitive and motor processes. Most of these neurones are located in the ventral mesencephalon where they receive abundant intrinsic and extrinsic GABAergic input. Cholinergic neurones, originating from mesopontine nuclei, project profusely in the mesencephalon where they preferentially synapse onto local GABAergic neurones. The physiological role of this cholinergic innervation of GABAergic neurones remains to be determined, but these observations raise the hypothesis that ACh may regulate dopamine neurones indirectly through GABAergic interneurones. Using a mesencephalic primary culture model, we studied the impact of cholinergic agonists on mesencephalic GABAergic neurones. ACh increased the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (151 +/- 49%). Selective activation of muscarinic receptors increased the firing rate of isolated GABAergic neurones by 67 +/- 13%. The enhancement in firing rate was Ca2+ dependent since inclusion of BAPTA in the pipette blocked it, actually revealing a decrease in firing rate accompanied by membrane hyperpolarization. This inhibitory action was prevented by tertiapin, a blocker of GIRK-type K+ channels. In addition to its excitatory somatodendritic effect, activation of muscarinic receptors also acted presynaptically, inhibiting the amplitude of unitary GABAergic synaptic currents. Both the enhancement in spontaneous IPSC frequency and presynaptic inhibition were abolished by 4-DAMP (100 nM), a preferential M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist. The presence of M3-like receptors on mesencephalic GABAergic neurones was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mesencephalic GABAergic neurones can be regulated directly through muscarinic receptors. Our findings provide new data that should be helpful in better understanding the influence of local GABAergic neurones during cholinergic activation of mesencephalic circuits.

Large interindividual differences have been observed in neuropathic pain, both in susceptibility to its development and in its severity. Identification of genetic factors relevant to this variability would be of obvious utility. Although many animal models of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury have been developed, most involve intricate surgeries and are thus poorly suited for large-scale linkage mapping investigations in the mouse. Recently, a schedule of intraperitoneal injections of the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel (Taxol), has been shown to produce a long-lasting, bilateral neuropathy in the rat, featuring hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal and cold stimuli. We present here a survey of the responses of 10 inbred mouse strains to paclitaxel injections. Virtually all strains developed statistically significant mechanical allodynia, with one strain, DBA/2J, exhibiting especially robust changes. Strain sensitivities to paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia were similar to those obtained previously using a surgical model of neuropathic pain, supporting our contention that genetic sensitivity to mechanical allodynia is independent of the precise mode of induction. Using sensitive DBA/2 mice and a resistant strain, C57BL/6J, for comparison, we further characterized the paclitaxel model in mice by examining cold allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Both strains displayed equivalent cold allodynia but neither strain developed thermal hyperalgesia. The present data confirm a genetic component in mechanical allodynia using this model, while dissociating mechanical hypersensitivity from other pain modalities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	Zatorre, RJ; Bouffard, M; Belin, P				Zatorre, RJ; Bouffard, M; Belin, P			Sensitivity to auditory object features in human temporal neocortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory cortex; superior temporal sulcus; functional neuroimaging; auditory processing; auditory object	PRIMATE PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; RECOGNITION MEMORY; CORTICAL-NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; BLOOD-FLOW; ACTIVATION; SPEECH	This positron emission tomography study examined the hemodynamic response of the human brain to auditory object feature processing. A continuum of object feature variation was created by combining different numbers of stimuli drawn from a diverse sample of 45 environmental sounds. In each 60 sec scan condition, subjects heard either a distinct individual sound on each trial or simultaneous combinations of sounds that varied systematically in their similarity or distinctiveness across conditions. As more stimuli are combined they become more similar and less distinct from one another; the limiting case is when all 45 are added together to form a noise that is repeated on each trial. Analysis of covariation of cerebral blood flow elicited by this parametric manipulation revealed a response in the upper bank of the right anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS): when sounds were identical across trials (i.e., a noise made up of 45 sounds), activity was at a minimum; when stimuli were different from one another, activity was maximal. A right inferior frontal area was also revealed. The results are interpreted as reflecting sensitivity of this region of temporal neocortex to auditory object features, as predicted by neurophysiological and anatomical models implicating an anteroventral functional stream in object processing. The findings also fit with evidence that voice processing may involve regions within the anterior STS. The data are discussed in light of these models and are related to the concept that this functional stream is sensitive to invariant sound features that characterize individual auditory objects.

Tryptic or Glu-C digestion and MALDI-TOF MS analyses of the digests are consistent with S-thiolation of Cys111 and Cys187 of HCuZnSOD and rHCaBP, respectively, upon exposure to decomposed GSNO. GAPDH activity analysis reveals that S-glutathiolation most likely occurs on the active site Cys149, and the single free Cys34 is assumed to be the site of S-glutathiolation in BSA. The yields of S-glutathiolation of rHCaBP, GAPDH, and BSA were much higher than those of HCuZnSOD. The latter is limited by the accessibility of Cys111 to the glutathiolating reagent in the HCuZnSOD dimer. Unlike decomposed GSNO, fresh GSNO, reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) are not efficient S-glutathiolating agents for the proteins examined here. On the basis of analysis by mass spectrometry and UV-visible absorption, GSNO decomposition in the dark at room temperature yields glutathione disulfide S-oxide [GS(O)SG], glutathione disulfide S-dioxide (GSO(2)SG), and GSSG as products. GS(O)SG is the efficient protein S-glutathiolating agent in GSNO solutions, not GSNO, which does not carry out efficient S-glutathiolation of rHCaBP, HCuZnSOD, or GAPDH in vitro. A hydrolysis pathway yielding GSOH and nitroxyl (HNO/NO-) as intermediates is proposed for GSNO decomposition in the dark. This is based on inhibition of GSNO breakdown by dimedone, a reagent specific for sulfenic acids, and on nitroxyl scavenging by metmyoglobin. The results presented here are contrary to numerous reports of protein S-thiolation by low-molecular weight S-nitrosothiols.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents potentially an intermediate state between normal aging and AD. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to examine brain metabolic changes in patients with AD and MCI in the medial temporal lobes (MTLs), parietotemporal cortices (PTCs) and prefrontal cortices (PFCs). Fourteen patients with MCI, 14 patients with mild AD and 14 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. Patients with AD and MCI demonstrated significant reductions of NAA/H2O and Cho/H2O in the left MTL relative to control subjects. Patients with AD showed ml/H2O increases relative to patients with MCI and control subjects in all six regions investigated, and a statistically significant ml/H2O increase was measured in the right PTC. Patients with AD and MCI demonstrated the same metabolic pattern in the left MTL, suggesting a similar pathological process underlying memory impairment. Increased mI signal appears to be a neurochemical abnormality associated mostly with AD and the dementia process. Some interhemispheric metabolite asymmetries were increased in AD patients.

The aim of this human positron emission tomography (PET) study was to compare upregulation in a smoker and a non-smoker, both of whom had received haloperidol for the same duration of time. Method: Two subjects who had been treated for 16 years with a constant dose of haloperidol were scanned after temporary haloperidol withdrawal, using [C-11]-raclopride. Results: The non-smoker, who had received a dose of 10 mg/day, showed a D2 upregulation of 98% and developed severe and persistent symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) upon withdrawal. The chronic smoker, who had been treated with 40 mg/day, displayed a D2 upregulation of 71% and did not develop TD. Conclusion: These human observations agree with animal data which showed that nicotine can decrease neuroleptic-induced D2 receptor upregulation. This property of nicotine may play a protective role in movement disorders whose pathophysiology involves D2 receptor hypersensitivity.

Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) is an important modulator of apoptosis; however, the functional role of NO derived from inducible NO synthase ( iNOS) in sepsis-induced pulmonary apoptosis remains unknown. We measured pulmonary apoptosis in a rat model of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis in the absence and presence of the selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W. Four groups were studied 24 h after saline ( control) or LPS injection in the absence and presence of 1400W pretreatment. Apoptosis was evaluated using DNA fragmentation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining, and caspase activation. LPS administration significantly augmented pulmonary cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Pretreatment with 1400W significantly enhanced LPS-induced pulmonary apoptosis and increased caspase-3 and -7 activation. The antiapoptotic effect of iNOS was confirmed in iNOS(-/-) mice, which developed a greater degree of pulmonary apoptosis both under control conditions and in response to LPS compared with wild-type mice. By comparison, genetic deletion of the neuronal NOS had no effect on LPS-induced pulmonary apoptosis. We conclude that NO derived from iNOS plays an important protective role against sepsis-induced pulmonary apoptosis.

J	Brown, KA; Laferriere, A; Moss, IR				Brown, KA; Laferriere, A; Moss, IR			Recurrent hypoxemia in young children with obstructive sleep apnea is associated with reduced opioid requirement for analgesia	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							RESPIRATORY COMPROMISE; PULSE OXIMETRY; BRAIN-STEM; ADENOTONSILLECTOMY; MORPHINE; POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; TONSILLECTOMY; ANESTHESIA; REGIONS; SURGERY	Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is often associated with recurrent hypoxemia during sleep. in developing animals, central opioid neuropeptide content is high, and opioid receptors arc up-regulated after recurrent hypoxia. The authors hypothesized that children with recurrent hypoxemia due to OSA might have altered central opioid functionality that could affect their responsiveness to opioid drugs. Using a retrospective database, we assessed the relation of age and preoperative oxygen saturation to the cumulative postoperative morphine dose administered for analgesia in children with OSA undergoing adenotonsillectomy. Methods: Inclusion criteria were (1) adenotonsillectomy for OSA; (2) no concomitant pathology; (3) intraoperative administration of short-acting opioid drugs; (4) endotracheal extubation on awakening in the operating room; and (5) morphine as the parenteral, postoperative analgesic.. Results: Forty-six children (16 girls) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Age and preoperative arterial oxygen saturation (Sao(2)) nadir, either individually (P = 0.023, P = 0.0003, respectively) or in combination (P = 0.00009), exhibited a significant correlation to the morphine dose required for analgesia. Four of these children, aged 26.5 +/- 13.2 months, with a preoperative SaO(2) nadir of 70.3 +/- 12.9%, did not require any postoperative morphine for analgesia at all. Conclusions: The authors speculate that the reduced morphine requirement for analgesia in children displaying oxygen desaturation associated with severe OSA may be related to their young age and to an up-regulation of central opioid receptors consequent to recurrent hypoxemia. In evaluating OSA in children, preoperative determination of the SaO(2) nadir is important for predicting the postoperative opioid dosage required for analgesia.

The inhibition of NO synthase by N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) has been reported to increase arterial blood pressure. The present studies were undertaken to investigate if the increased blood pressure by L-NAME is associated with enhanced expression of Gi proteins, implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. L-NAME was administered orally into Sprague-Dawley rats for a period of 4 weeks. Control rats were given plain tap water only. The systolic blood pressure was enhanced in L-NAME-treated rats as compared with control rats; however, the heart-to-body weight ratio was not different in the two groups. The levels of Gialpha-2 and Gialpha-3 proteins and their mRNA as determined by western and northern blotting, respectively, were significantly augmented in hearts from L-NAME-treated rats, whereas the levels of Gsalpha and Gbeta were unaltered. In addition, the effect of low concentrations of GTPgammaS on forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (receptor-independent functions of Gialpha) was significantly enhanced, whereas the receptor-dependent inhibitions of adenylyl cyclase were completely attenuated in L-NAME-treated rats. Whereas cholera toxin-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was unaltered in both group of rats, the stimulatory effects of some agonists on adenylyl cyclase activity were diminished in L-NAME-treated rats. These results suggest the implication of NO in the modulation of Gi protein expression and associated adenylyl cyclase signaling.

Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) was higher with the LF and HM/LF diets than the control (P <.01) or HM (P <.05) diets, and Mthfr(-/-) mice had higher tHcy than Mthfr(+/+) mice (P <.05). With the control diet, the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio was lower in the liver and brain of Mthfr(+/-) mice than Mthf(+/+) mice (P < .05). SAM/SAH ratios decreased further in Mthfr(+/+) or Mthfr(+/-) mice fed LF or LF/HM diets (P < .05). In cerebral arterioles, endothelium-dependent dilation to 1 or 10 muM acetylcholine was markedly and selectively impaired with the HM/LF diet compared with the control diet for both Mthfr(+/+) (maximum dilation 5% +/- 2% versus 21% +/- 4%; P < .01) and Mthfr(+/-) (6% +/- 2% versus 21% +/- 3%; P < .01) mice. These findings demonstrate that the Mthfr(+/-) genotype sensitizes mice to diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and that hyperhomocysteinemia alters tissue methylation capacity and impairs endothelial function in cerebral microvessels.

Recent neuropsychological findings indicate that females with FXS present with a specific pattern of cognitive deficits and that these difficulties primarily involve skills requiring executive control. The present study is the first to examine the extent to which neural activity of females with FXS can be observed on a task that specifically taps two core deficits, namely switching and response inhibition. Brain activity was measured using both event-related electrical potentials (ERPs) and event-related functional MRI (fMRI) neuroimaging in separate studies using the same cognitive paradigm. Compared to controls, females with FXS were significantly slower and made more errors on trials that required an immediate response (Go) to stimulus onset but were comparable on trials that required a delayed response (Wait) to stimulus onset. At the brain level, several areas showed significantly greater activation for females with FXS compared with controls, including the cingulate cortex and left and right ventral prefrontal areas. In contrast. no areas were found to show significantly greater activation for controls compared with females with FXS. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent research suggests that slowness in OCD may be particularly evident on tests of executive function subserved by frontostriatal circuitry. In the present study, the speed and accuracy of responding on neuropsychological tests of executive functions and psychomotor speed were investigated in 27 non-depressed, unmedicated adults with OCD and 27 healthy controls. The only group difference was that patients took significantly longer to copy a complex geometric design than controls. This finding was unrelated to residual depression or overall OCD symptom severity. Results suggest that slowness in OCD may be most apparent on executive tests requiring self-initiated organizational strategies.. consistent with frontostriatal abnormality. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In order to do so, three types of tasks were used: (i) silent reading of very high frequency regular words (lexical task); (ii) silent reading of nonwords (sublexical task); and, (iii) silent reading of very low frequency regular words (sublexical task). All three conditions were contrasted with a visual/phonological baseline condition. The lexical condition engaged primarily an area at the border of the left angular and supramarginal gyri. Activation found in this region suggests that this area may be involved in mapping orthographic-to-phonological whole word representations. Both sublexical conditions elicited significantly greater activation in the left inferior prefrontal gyrus. This region is thought to be associated with sublexical processes in reading such as grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, phoneme assembly and underlying verbal working memory processes. Activation in the left IFG was also associated with left superior and middle temporal activation. These areas are thought to be functionally correlated with the left IFG and to contribute to a phonologically based form of reading. The results as a whole demonstrate that lexical and sublexical processes in reading activate different regions within a complex network of brain structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We make the case for a bipolar phenomenon of "psychic tonus," encompassing all these dimensions. The elated, agitated, libidinal, immunofacilitated and talkative pole is an "approach" disposition primarily activated by the normal left hemisphere-especially, though not exclusively, its frontal lobe. The dejected, lethargic, delibidinized, immunosuppressed, and mute pole is an "avoidance" disposition primarily activated by the normal right hemisphere-especially, though not exclusively, its frontal lobe. In support of this proposed model, we present new evidence, via meta-analysis of previously published single lesion case reports, of a highly significant association between right hemisphere lesions and non-aphasic hyperlalia, and between left hemisphere lesions and non-aphasic mutism.

These human studies have now begun to tease out which specific pregnancy, labor/delivery or neonatal complications might confer greatest risk for schizophrenia. Animal modeling can be a useful tool to directly ask if a particular obstetric complication can actually cause changes in brain function or behavior resembling changes in schizophrenia. This review describes currently available animal models for some of the obstetric complications with greatest effect size for schizophrenia, including maternal diabetes, preeclampsia, infection and stress during pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation and fetal/neonatal hypoxia. Where available, evidence that these types of obstetric complications in animals produce alterations in CNS function or behavior, related to features of schizophrenic pathology, is presented. Animal models might provide insights into the mechanisms by which specific obstetric complications have long-term influence on brain development leading to increased risk for schizophrenia. Factors common to several obstetric complications associated with schizophrenia may also be discerned. In this way, animal modeling may provide the framework for human studies to ask further more refined questions concerning the role of specific obstetric factors contributing to schizophrenia, and may provide clues to prevention.

J	DeMont, RG; Lephart, SM				DeMont, RG; Lephart, SM			Effect of sex on preactivation of the gastrocnemius and hamstring muscles	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT; KINETIC-CHAIN EXERCISES; KNEE-JOINT LAXITY; NEUROMUSCULAR CHARACTERISTICS; MUSCULAR TENSION; REFLEX; ANTAGONIST; FORCES; COACTIVATION; CONTRACTION	Background: The reason for the higher incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury from non-contact mechanisms in female athletes is not known. Stability of the joint from dynamic restraints occurs through proprioceptive and kinaesthetic mechanisms providing a flexion moment. Reflexive muscle activation is different between the sexes, but it is unclear if sex differences exist in the ability to dynamically stabilise joints through a neuromuscular feed forward process as measured by preactivation of the muscles. Objective: To determine if the level of preactivation of the gastrocnemius and hamstring muscles during dynamic activity is affected by sex. Methods: Thirty four healthy active subjects, evenly grouped by sex, participated in the study. Maximum voluntary contraction normalised electromyographic (EMG) activity of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius muscles was recorded during downhill walking (0.92 m/s) and running (2.08 m/s) on a 15degrees declined treadmill. Preactivation of the EMG signal was calculated by setting a mark 150 milliseconds before foot strike, as indicated by a footswitch. Multiple t tests for sex differences of preactivity mean percentage (M-EMG%) during the downhill activities were performed. Results: The female subjects had a higher M-EMG% for the medial hamstrings than the male subjects (31.73 (9.89) and 23.04 (8.59) respectively; t((2,32)) = 2.732, p = 0.01) during walking. No other muscles exhibited a sex difference in M-EMG% during either activity. Conclusion: The female subjects in this study showed higher medial hamstring preactivation. However, this may be because they were not injured, indicating their propensity for joint stabilisation. A long term prospective study is required to eliminate this potential explanation. No sex difference in gastrocnemius preactivation was seen, adding to the controversy about whether this muscle contributes to feed forward joint stability. Further research of preactivation of the musculature of the leg is required.

Furthermore, this ratio was able to distinguish these patients from groups of glaucoma suspects and subjects without glaucoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the RADAAR correlates with the diagnosis and severity of glaucoma in a large glaucomatous population. Methods: We reviewed the records of 140 randomly selected patients with open-angle, normal-tension or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma evaluated at the glaucoma service of a tertiary care centre in Philadelphia between January 1996 and April 2000. Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) disc area, rim area, cup-to-disc area ratio, pattern-standard deviation and mean deviation as well as maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) were recorded. Disc staging and visual fields determined severity of glaucoma, and fellow eyes were classified as "better" or "worse." Results: The RADAAR was significantly correlated with IOP (r = 0.23, p < 0.03), mean deviation (r = -0.22, p < 0.02), cup-to-disc area ratio (r = 0. 19, p < 0.03) and disc stage of glaucomatous optic nerve damage (r = 0. 17, p < 0.05) in "worse" eyes. RADAAR groups were also correlated with fellow-eye differences in mean deviation (p < 0.05) and cup-to-disc area ratio (p < 0.02). Interpretation:The RADAAR, a new HRT-derived measure of asymmetry in fellow eyes, is associated with the diagnosis of glaucoma and its severity.

Rats were tested for touch sensitivity prior to and 7 days following cuff implantation or sham surgeries. The lumbar spinal cord was removed on the 8th day post-surgery and the lumbar enlargement was processed for the detection of selected peptides using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Only substance P (MW 1346.74) and neurotensin (MW 1673.0) were detected in the lumbar spinal cord of animals with mechanical allodynia (P < 0.01) following innocuous tactile stimulation of the affected hind paw. Therefore, substance P and neurotensin may be target candidates for the understanding and treatment of neuropathic pain.

We confirmed that GA therapy induces a range of GA-reactive T cells defined by distinct profiles of cytokine expression. Supernatants from Th0/Th1 GA-reactive cells significantly upregulated pro-inflammatory chemokine and adhesion molecule expression in HBECs. Post-treatment Th2-polarized GA-reactive cells were significantly less proinflammatory but did not suppress the effects induced by Th1 cells. All lines migrated across a HBEC/fibronectin-based model of the BBB with similar efficiencies. We conclude that the spectrum of GA-reactive T cells induced in treated MS patients may differentially impact inflammatory responses at the BBB level. Future studies will determine whether this could contribute to variable clinical response to GA therapy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The goal of this study was to investigate the potential protective effects of nimodipine (ND), a calcium channel blocker, on the acute manifestations and long-term behavioral sequalae of experimental status epilepticus (SE). Methods. Three groups of Postnatal Day (P) 35 rats undergoing kainic acid (KA)-induced SE were injected with phenobarbital (PB) and/or NE), and were subsequently compared with rats injected with KA alone and normal control rats. Behavioral parameters were assessed by the Morris water maze, open field, and handling tests at P125-P135. Acute seizures and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were assessed by videotape techniques. Results. PB reduced the severity of SE acutely, and protected completely against subsequent long-term SRS, memory impairment, and hyperactivity, and partially against aggressivity. ND alone had no effect on acute seizure activity, but did protect against subsequent SRS and memory impairment, and partially against aggressivity. When administered together, PB and ND had effects similar to those seen with PB alone. However, in addition, and unlike the PB- and ND-alone groups, the PB-ND group was completely protected against KA-induced increased aggressivity. Conclusions. Activation of L-type calcium channels contributes to the long-term behavioral sequalae of KA-induced SE, but is not essential for the development and maintenance of SE.

J	Laudadio, MA; Psarropoulou, C				Laudadio, MA; Psarropoulou, C			The A(3) adenosine receptor agonist 2-Cl-IB-MECA facilitates epileptiform discharges in the CA(3) area of immature rat hippocampal slices	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						purinergic; development; adenosine receptors; electrophysiology; extracellular recordings; synchronous potentials; rat	INDUCED EPILEPTOGENESIS; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; A(2) RECEPTORS; UPTAKE SITES; IN-VITRO; CA3 AREA; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; MODULATION; BLOCKADE	The effects of the A(3) adenosine receptor agonist 2-Cl-IB-MECA were tested on epileptiform field potentials recorded in the CA3 area of postnatal days 10-20 immature hippocampal slices, during perfusion with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 muM). Evoked potentials: 2-Cl-IB-MECA (1-50 muM, n = 17) had consistently excitatory effects, blocked by the A3 receptor antagonist MRS 1220 (1 muM, n = 7), but not occluded in the presence of the A(1) antagonist DPCPX (1 muM, n = 12) or the A(2A) antagonist ZM-241385 (0.1 muM, n = 12). 2-Cl-IB-MECA reversed the inhibitory effects (n = 5) of the adenosine uptake blocker nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI, 50 muM), but did not increase its excitatory effects (n = 19). Spontaneous discharges: 2-Cl-113-MECA (1 muM) induced them or increased their frequency in 14/30 slices, an effect reversed by MRS 1220 (n = 3), and observed also following pre-perfusion with DPCPX (n = 11), ZM-241385 (n = 11) or both (n = 10). In the presence of the A(1) antagonist DPCPX, NBTI increased the frequency of spontaneous discharges, an effect partially reversed by MRS 1220 (n = 8), thus suggesting that a rise in endogenous adenosine during disinhibition may activate A3 receptors. In conclusion, these findings suggest strongly that activation of A3 receptors, following a rise in endogenous adenosine (i.e. during seizures, hypoxia), facilitates excitation, thus limiting the known inhibitory and/or neuroprotective effects of adenosine in immature brain.

J	St-Onge, N; Feldman, AG				St-Onge, N; Feldman, AG			Referent configuration of the body: a global factor in the control of multiple skeletal muscles	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						multiple muscle control; posture resetting; equilibrium-point hypothesis; jumping; stepping in place	MOTOR CONTROL; ARM MOVEMENTS; MULTIMUSCLE CONTROL; REFLEX PARAMETERS; STRETCH REFLEX; LIMB MOVEMENT; COORDINATION; CORTEX; TASK; MODEL	In addition to local biomechanical and reflex factors influencing muscle activation, global factors may be used by the nervous system to control all muscles in a coherent and task-specific way. It has been hypothesized that a virtual or referent (R) configuration of the body determined by muscle recruitment thresholds specified by neural control levels is such a factor. Due to the threshold nature of the R configuration, the activity of each muscle depends on the difference between the actual (Q) and the R configuration of the body. The nervous system modifies the R configuration to produce movement. One prediction of this hypothesis is that the Q and R configurations may match each other, most likely in movements with reversals in direction, resulting in a minimum in the electromyographic (EMG) activity level of muscles involved. The depth of the minima is constrained by the degree of coactivation of opposing muscle groups. Another prediction is that EMG minima in the activity of multiple muscles may occur not only when the movement is assisted but also when it is opposed by external forces (e.g., gravity). To verify these predictions, we analyzed EMG patterns of 16-21 functionally diverse muscles of the legs, trunk, and arms during jumping and stepping in place. One EMG minimum in the activity of all muscles regularly occurred near the apex of the jump. A minimum was also observed near the point of transition of the body from flexion to extension leading to a jump. During stepping in place, the activity of muscles of each side of the body was usually minimized near the beginning and near the end of the stance phase as well as during the maximum elevation of the foot. Since EMG minima occurred not only during gravity-assisted but also gravity-opposed movement reversals, it is concluded that neural factors (such as matching between the Q and R) rather than mechanical factors are responsible for minimizing the EMG activity in these movements.

In addition, these molecules are involved in signaling events, regulating such processes as cell motility, proliferation, and apoptosis. Members of the cadherin subfamily, called either classical or type 1 cadherins, contain a highly conserved sequence at their homophilic binding site consisting of the three amino acids-histidine-alanine-valine (HAV). Previous studies have shown that peptides containing the HAV motif inhibit cadherin-dependent events such as cell aggregation, compaction, and neurite outgrowth. We report here that a cyclic peptide, N-Ac-CHAVC-NH2 can perturb cadherin-mediated endothelial cell interactions, resulting in a progressive apoptotic cell death. This effect depends on cell density, as it is only observed when dense cultures are treated with the peptide. Adherens junction (AJ)-associated cadherin and catenins are differentially affected by the N-Ac-CHAVC-NH2 treatment, as judged by double immunofluorescence labeling followed by immunofluorescence-ratio imaging. However, cell-cell adhesions are largely retained during the first few hours after addition of the peptide. It was also observed that following treatment, actin filaments partially lose their plasma membrane anchorage at AJs and translocate towards the cell center. Interestingly, addition of basic fibroblast growth factor to confluent, peptide-treated, endothelial cell cultures, completely blocks apoptosis and the inhibitory peptide reduce the phosphorylation of the FGF receptor target protein FRS2, suggesting that the peptide exerts its effect by inhibiting cadherin-mediated activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling. We propose that cadherin-mediated signaling is essential for maintaining viability of confluent endothelial cells, and that its perturbation by N-Ac-CHAVC-NH2 drives these cells to apoptosis.

J	Pitcher, GM; Henry, JL				Pitcher, GM; Henry, JL			Nociceptive response to innocuous mechanical stimulation is mediated via myelinated afferents and NK-1 receptor activation in a rat model of neuropathic pain	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Review						chronic pain; contralateral; CP-99,994; CP-100,263; dorsal horn; electrophysiology; neuropathic pain; NK-1 receptor; Nociception; spinal cord; substance P; wide dynamic range neuron	DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; CHRONIC CONSTRICTION INJURY; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; EXCITATORY AMINO-ACIDS; ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; SUBSTANCE-P RECEPTOR; SPINOTHALAMIC TRACT NEURONS; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; SPINAL-CORD STIMULATION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION	Peripheral nerve injury in humans can produce a persistent pain state characterized by spontaneous pain and painful responses to normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia). Here we attempt to identify some of the neurophysiological and neurochemical mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain using an animal model of peripheral neuropathy induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by placing a 2-mm polyethylene cuff around the left sciatic nerve according to the method of Mosconi and Kruger. von Frey hair testing confirmed tactile allodynia in all cuff-implanted rats before electrophysiological testing. Rats were anesthetized and spinalized for extracellular recording from single spinal wide dynamic range neurons (L3-4). In neuropathic rats (days 11-14 and 42-52 after cuff implantation), ongoing discharge was greater and hind paw receptive field size was expanded compared to control rats. Activation of low-threshold sensory afferents by innocuous mechanical stimulation (0.2 N for 3 s) in the hind paw receptive field evoked the typical brief excitation in control rats. However, in neuropathic rats, innocuous stimulation also induced a nociceptive-like afterdischarge that persisted 2-3 min. This afterdischarge was never observed in control rats, and, in this model, is the distinguishing feature of the spinal neural correlate of tactile allodynia. Electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve at 4 and at 20 Hz each produced an initial discharge that was identical in control and in neuropathic rats. This stimulation also produced an afterdischarge that was similar at the two frequencies in control rats. However, in neuropathic rats, the afterdischarge produced by 20-Hz stimulation was greater than that produced by 4-Hz stimulation. Given that acutely spinalized rats were studied, only peripheral and/or spinal mechanisms can account for the data obtained; as synaptic responses from C fibers begin to fail above approximately 5-Hz stimulation [Pain 46 (1991) 327], the afterdischarge in response to 20-Hz stimulation suggests a change mainly in myelinated afferents and a predominant role of these fibers in eliciting this afterdischarge. These data are consistent with the suggestion that peripheral neuropathy induces phenotypic changes predominantly in myelinated afferents, the sensory neurons that normally respond to mechanical stimulation. The NK-1 receptor antagonist, CP-99,994 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.), depressed the innocuous pressure-evoked afterdischarge but not the brief initial discharge of wide dynamic range neurons, and decreased the elevated ongoing rate of discharge in neuropathic rats. These results support the concept that following peripheral neuropathy, myelinated afferents may now synthesize and release substance P. A result of this is that tonic release of substance P from the central terminals of these phenotypically altered neurons would lead to ongoing excitation of NK-1-expressing nociceptive spinal neurons. In addition, these spinal neurons would also exhibit exaggerated responses to innocuous pressure stimulation. The data in this study put forth a possible neurophysiological and neurochemical basis of neuropathic pain and identify substance P and the NK-1 receptor as potential neurochemical targets for its management.

The GPS is used as reference during the time it is available. The data from GPS and inertial navigation system (INS) are used to build a structured knowledge base consisting of behavior of the INS in some special scenarios of vehicle motion. With the same data, the proposed fuzzy system is trained to obtain the corrected navigation data. In the absence of the GPS information, the system will perform its task only with the data from INS and with the fuzzy correction algorithm. This paper shows, using Matlab simulations, that as long as the GPS unavailability time is no longer than the previous training time and for the scenarios a priori defined, the accuracy of trained ANFIS, in absence of data from a reference navigation system, is better than the accuracy of stand-alone INS. The flexibility of model is also analyzed.

Results indicate that: (1) the Event-Related Brain Potentials topographic mapping was significantly modified in post-treatment condition for the treated Learning/Disabled/ADHD group as opposed to pre-treatment baseline (P<0.001). This was mainly due to the enhanced pre-frontal and frontal N450 amplitudes along with higher P450 components over posterior regions in post-treatment condition (P<0.001); (2) for group comparisons at baseline, no significant topographic mapping differences were found between the treated Learning Disabled/ADHD group and the non-treated Learning Disabled/ADHD control group (P>0.05) and significant differences were present between the treated Leaning Disabled/ADHD and the normal control group (P<0.001); (3) 8 months later, in post-treatment condition, group comparisons revealed significant topographic mapping differences between the treated Learning Disabled/ADHD (group and the non-treated Learning Disabled/ADHD control roup (P<0.001) and none between 9 the treated Learning Disabled/ADHD group and the normal control group (P>0.05); (4) the topographic mapping of both components was similar at baseline and 8 months later in both control groups (P>0.05); (5) at baseline, school-marks and Mangina-Test performance of treated Learning Disabled/ADHD were not significantly different than those of the non-treated Learning Disabled/ADHD (P>0.05) and significantly lower than those of the normal control group (P<0.001); (6) the treated Learning Disabled/ADHD group in post-treatment condition had significantly higher school-marks and Mangina-Test performance than those of non-treated Learning Disabled/ADHD controls (P<0.001) and were similar to those of normal controls 8 months later (P>0.05); (7) school-marks and Mangina-Test performance at baseline for non-treated Learning Disabled/ADHD controls were not modified 8 months later (P>0.05) and normal controls maintained their high performance within the same time interval (P>0.05). These findings provide evidence of the impact of the psychophysiological treatment methodology on brain plasticity and regulation as reflected in significantly improved neurophysiology of pre-frontal, frontal and posterior brain regions concomitantly with higher school marks and neuropsychometric performance in the Mangina-Test.

Recent work has also suggested that the P300 component could reflect the efficacy of interhemispheric transmission (Polich & 1998). The purpose of the present study was to study the differential role of the corpus callosum (CC) and anterior commissure (AC) in the interhemispheric propagation of these two electrophysiological components. Thus, the amplitude and latency distribution of the N100 and P300 components were analyzed using high-density electrical mapping in a subject with agenesis of CC but preservation of AC, a subject with agenesis Of both CC and AC, and 10 neurologically intact Control subjects. The task consisted of a Modified visual oddball paradigm comprising one frequent and two rare stimuli, one presented on the same and the other on the opposite side of the frequent stimulus. Interhemispheric differences in latency were found for the N100 component in controls. However, in the acallosal subjects, this component was not identifiable in the indirectly stimulated hemisphere. In controls, no interhemispheric differences were observed in the distribution of the P300 latency and amplitude to rare and frequent stimuli. The distribution of the P300 amplitude in the acallosal subject with an AC was identical to that of the controls, whereas in the acallosal subject lacking the AC, the amplitude was greater in the hemisphere receiving the rare stimuli were presented. In both acallosal subjects, hemispheric differences in the P300 latency were observed, the latencies being shorter in the hemisphere directly stimulated for all categories of stimuli. These results suggest that the interhemispheric transfer of both the N100 and P300 components relies on the integrity of cortical commissures. Possible P300 generator sources are discussed.

In 1998, food in Canada was fortified nationwide with folic acid. We assessed the impact of routine folate fortification on homocysteine concentrations in our cardiac transplant population. Methods: In 18 subjects, we measured total homocysteine (tHcy), serum folate, and cobalamin concentrations in 1997 (before folate fortification) and in 1998 (after fortification). We repeated the analysis after specific multivitamin supplementation for 10 weeks. Results: We found a significant decrease in baseline tHcy concentrations between 1997 and 1998. However, we also found a decrease in serum cobalamin concentrations. We found a correlation between decreased cobalamin concentrations and the methionine synthase A2756G genotype, but not with other common polymorphisms associated with homocysteine metabolism. After multivitamin supplementation, we observed a trend toward further decrease in tHcy concentrations and a significant increase in serum folate and cobalamin concentrations. Finally, we measured serum methylmalonic acid concentrations, an index of tissue cobalamin status. We did not find a correlation between increased methylmalonic acid concentrations and decreased serum cobalamin, perhaps related to the confounding effect of altered renal status on methylmalonic acid excretion. Conclusions: National folate fortification was associated with decreased tHcy and increased folate concentrations in our cardiac transplant population. Additional administration of vitamin supplements induced a further decrease in tHcy and an increase in folate. Finally, folate fortification unveiled cobalamin deficiency in some patients, associated with the methionine synthase A2756G mutation.

Converging evidence also points to the involvement of the central cholinergic system in neuropsychiatric disorders. These two neurotransmitter systems are interlinked in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) where dopamine stimulates acetylcholine (ACh) release. In the present study, we investigated the role of dopamine in the developmental regulation of prefrontal cortical ACh release and the expression of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in pre- and post-pubertal rats with neonatal ibotenic acid-induced lesions of the ventral hippocampus (NVH). In vivo microdialysis in the PFC revealed that systemic injections of the D-1-like receptor agonist (+/-)-6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide (SKF 81297) (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p.) caused significantly higher ACh release in post-pubertal NVH-lesioned animals (250 and 300% baseline for 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively) compared with post-pubertal shams (150 and 220% baseline for 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively). Most interestingly, while prefrontal cortical perfusion of SKF 81297 (100 and 250 mum) had no significant effect on ACh release in post-pubertal sham-operated animals, it significantly stimulated ACh release to approximately 250% baseline at both doses in post-pubertal NVH-lesioned animals. Receptor autoradiography demonstrated a significant and selective increase in M-1-like receptor binding sites in the infralimbic area of the PFC in the post-pubertal NVH-lesioned animals. For all experiments, significant differences between sham and NVH-lesioned animals were observed only in post-pubertal rats. These results suggest a developmentally specific reorganization of the prefrontal cortical cholinergic system involving D-1-like receptors in the NVH model.

This isoform, synaptotagmin I C2B-beta, is generated by alternative exon usage in the C2B domain leading to nine amino acid changes in the C2B sequence from the previously characterized synaptotagmin I, now designated as synaptotagmin I C2B-alpha. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that approximately 25% of mRNA encoding synaptotagmin I contained the C2B-beta exon in the nervous system. Synaptotagmin I C2B-beta showed greater resistance to digestion by chymotrypsin in the absence of calcium than did synaptotagmin I C2B-alpha, although both isoforms required the same amount of calcium to resist chymotrypsin digestion. The source of these changes in C2B properties was mapped to a single amino acid (threonine 358). We have also cloned SNAP 25 in Aplysia and show that it binds synaptotagmin I C2B-beta with a higher affinity than synaptotagmin I C2B-alpha. These results suggest that this splicing alters biochemical properties of the C2B domain, affecting a number of its important known interactions.

So far, the regulation of the TRAIL pathway in physiologic and pathologic conditions remains unclear. Due to the implication in brain damage and the elevated expression in peripheral immune cells of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, TRAIL might play a central role in the pathology of this disease. Here, we have identified a highly polymorphic region in the TRAIL promoter. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, we found four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 111 base pairs. One of these SNPs is located, in a binding site for the transcription factor AP-1. However, the RNA and protein expression of TRAIL revealed no obvious differences in relation to the genotypes. Furthermore, investigating samples from both MS patients and healthy controls we could not detect any association of these newly described polymorphisms to the clinical disease pattern. Thus, the TRAIL promoter contains a highly polymorphic area which has, however, no impact on molecule expression, and is neither directly related to increased risk of developing MS nor associated with a certain course of this heterogeneous disease in our population.

Several authors have suggested the concomitant administration of DM and a CYP2D6 reversible inhibitor in order to enhance the exposure of DM and limit the exposure to total dextrorphan (DX). The present study proposes to determine whether or not a single dose of quinidine is sufficient to enhance the plasma concentrations of DM in rats and keep those of DX at a minimal level. Oral doses of DM (50 mg/kg) were administered with increasing dose levels of quinidine (0, 2, 20, and 50 mg/kg) to male Sprague-Dawley rats and blood samples were collected over 24 h. Plasma concentrations of DM and total DX were determined using ESI-LC/MS/MS. Quinidine coadministration resulted in a more than twofold increase in the area under the curve of DM with an ED50 of approximately 2 mg/kg whereas those of total DX were only increased by 21%. These results support the working hypothesis that a single dose of quinidine may enhance the plasma concentrations of DM relative to those of total DX and may therefore improve the treatment of neuropathic pain.

The features can be viewed as defining subsets of the instance space, and they allow CLEF to create useful non-linear functions over the input variables. The algorithm is guaranteed to find a classifier that separates the training instances, if such a separation is possible. We compare CLEF empirically to several other classification algorithms, including a well-known decision tree inducer, an artificial neural network inducer, and a support vector machine inducer. Our results show that the CLEF-induced Phi-machines and support vector machines have similar accuracy on the suite tested, and that both are significantly more accurate than the other classifiers produced. We argue that the classifiers produced by CLEF are easy to interpret, and hence may be preferred over support vector machines in certain circumstances.

Two GluCI subunits have been localized in the pharynx in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the pharynx has been implicated as a major target for avermectins in C. elegans. However, in parasitic nematodes, the pharyngeal localization of the GluCl subunits needs to be determined. The HcGhiCla gene encoding an alpha-type GluCl subunit has been cloned from Haemonchus contortus previously. To investigate the expression site of the HcGluCla gene we have isolated a 1439bp 5'-flanking region and determined the genomic organization of this gene. The HcGluCla gene is composed of 12 exons separated by 11 introns and spans approximately 7.3 kb of genomic DNA. Analysis of the 1439 bp 5'-flanking region of the HcGluCla gene revealed that it contained TATA, CCAAT boxes, and several other consensus transcriptional factor recognition sequences. The 1439 bp 5'-flanking region and the first exon and intron and part of the second exon of the HcGluCla gene were fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene and microinjected into the gonads of C. elegans. After microinjection of the construct into C elegans, four stable transformed lines were established and assayed for GFP expression. The transformed animals exhibited fluorescence in the two pairs of MC and M2 pharyngeal neurons, but no expression was detected in the muscle cells. Expression of HcGluCla in pharyngeal neurons suggests a mechanism for the effects of avermectins and milbemycins on pharyngeal function in parasitic nematodes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Expression of both factors slightly precedes that of POMC at embryonic d 12.5 of mouse pituitary development. We now report that NeuroD1( BETA2) is required for early corticotroph differentiation. In agreement with the transcriptional synergism observed between Tpit and basic helix-loop-helix dimers containing NeuroD1( BETA2), POMC expression is delayed in NeuroD1-deficient mice. However, this differentiation defect does not reflect a change of corticotroph commitment as revealed by Tpit expression. The delay of corticotroph terminal differentiation is transient and coincides with the developmental window of NeuroD1 expression in corticotrophs. In contrast to their requirement in other NeuroD1-expressing cells, the neurogenin genes do not appear to be necessary for corticotroph differentiation. Taken together with a similar requirement of Tpit for corticotroph differentiation but not for commitment, the present data indicate that the POMC promoter is a point of convergence for independent corticotroph differentiating signals.

We obtained magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain and clinical information from 769 normal Japanese subjects. We processed the MR images automatically by correcting for inter-individual differences in brain size and shape, and by segmenting the MR images into the gray matter and white matter. Volumetry of the brain revealed a significant negative correlation between the gray matter volume and age, which was not observed between white matter volume and age. Voxel-based morphometry showed that age, systolic blood pressure, and alcohol drinking correlated with the regional tissue probabilities of the gray matter and white matter. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Recent reports suggest that heterozygosity for the two common hfe mutations responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) may be a risk factor for AD, possibly by accelerating brain iron accumulation. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 213 sporadic AD, 106 MCI, and 63 normal elderly control (NEC) individuals for the H63D and C282Y hfe mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. We determined the relationship of these mutations to the demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological features of AD and MCI, and evaluated whether an interaction existed between hfe and apolipoprotein E (apoE) status in these patients. Results: We observed no significant impact of H63D or C282Y heterozygosity on age at AD symptoms onset or diagnosis, age at onset of cognitive symptoms (AD and MCI combined), rates of MCI-to-AD conversion or specific neuropsychological deficits. No interactions between hfe zygosity and apoE status were discerned. Patients homozygous for H63D exhibited trends towards accelerated MCI-to-AD conversion rates and a subset of younger individuals (aged 55-75) exhibited earlier onset of cognitive symptoms relative to wild-type hfe and H63D heterozygotes. Conclusions: Contrary to earlier reports, the results of the present study do not implicate the common hfe mutations as genetic modifiers of sporadic AD and MCI. Trends towards accelerated cognitive dysfunction in H63D homozygotes warrant further study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This particular lipase also has a role in the binding of lipoprotein particles to different cell-surface receptors. LPL has been identified in the brain but has no specific function yet. This study aimed at elucidating the role of LPL in the brain in response to injury. Mice were subjected to hippocampal deafferentation using the entorhinal cortex lesion and mRNA and protein expression were assessed over a time-course of degeneration/reinnervation. Hippocampal LPL levels peaked at 2 days post-lesion (DPL) both at the mRNA and protein levels. No change was observed for receptors of the LDL-receptor family or RAP at DPL 2 in the hippocampus but the glia-specific syndecan-4 was found to be significantly upregulated at DPL 2. These results suggest that LPL is involved in the recycling of cholesterol and lipids released from degenerating terminals after a lesion through a syndecan-4-dependent pathway.

We describe two fMRI experiments that manipulate this particular syntactic component. The sentences in each of the experiments are different, yet the structural contrast in both is syntactically identical, comparing movement and no-movement sentences. Two distinct Hebrew constructions, topicalization and wh-questions, were presented in an auditory comprehension task and compared to carefully matched baseline sentences. We show that both contrasts, presented in. an auditory comprehension task, yield comparable activations in a consistent set of brain regions, including left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left ventral precentral sulcus (vPCS), and bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Furthermore, we show that these regions are not sensitive to two other syntactic contrasts. The results, considered in the context of previous imaging and lesion studies, suggest that the processing of syntactic movement involves a consistent et of brain regions, regardless of the superficial properties of the sentences at issue, and irrespective of task.

The necessity for long-term treatment suggests that changes in genes expression are involved in the mechanism of its action. We studied effects of lithium on gene expression in lymphoblasts from BD patients, all excellent responders to lithium prophylaxis. Gene expression was analyzed using cDNA arrays that included a total of 2400 cDNAs. We found that chronic lithium treatment at a therapeutically relevant concentration decreased the expression of seven genes in lymphoblasts from lithium responders. Five of these candidate lithium-regulated genes, including alpha 1B-adrenoceptor (alpha1B-AR), acetylcholine receptor protein alpha chain precursor (ACHR), cAMP-dependent 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), substance-P receptor (SPR), and ras-related protein RAB7, were verified by Northern blotting analysis in lithium responders. None of these genes were regulated by lithium in healthy control subjects. When we compared the expression of these five genes between bipolar subjects and healthy control subjects at baseline, prior to lithium administration, we found that alpha1B-AR gene expression was higher in bipolar subjects than in healthy control subjects. Our findings indicate that alpha1B-AR may play an important role in the mechanism of action of lithium treatment.

METHODS: A cohort of all live births in the United States from 1995 to 1998, formed the source population (n = 15,627,404). The data were obtained from the National Centers for Health Statistics Linked Births and Infant Deaths File. A nested case-control study was used to examine risk factors for SIDS. From this birth cohort, all SIDS deaths (n = 12,404) were first identified (case group). From the remaining non-SIDS births, a 4-fold larger sample (n = 49,616) was randomly selected as a control group. RESULTS: The overall incidence of SIDS was 81.7 per 100,000 live births. More mothers in the case group than in the control group were reported to have placenta previa (odds ratio [OR]: 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 2.33), abruptio placentae (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.24, 1.98), premature rupture of membranes (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.33, 1.66), or small for gestational age (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.30, 1.50 for the 10th percentile). SIDS cases were also more likely to be male. Mothers of cases were more likely to be younger, less educated, and nonwhite, and more of them smoked during pregnancy and did not attend prenatal care. CONCLUSION: This analysis confirms the importance of several well known demographic and lifestyle risk factors for SIDS. In addition, placental abnormalities were risk factors for SIDS.

FD137, a nitrosourea appended to a quinazoline ring, was designed to simultaneously block epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling and damage genomic DNA in refractory EGF-dependent prostate tumors. METHODS. The mixed inhibition of cell signaling and DNA damage by FD137 were determined by Western blotting, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, sulforhodamine B (SRB), and comet assay. RESULTS. FD137 and its metabolite FD110 induced a dose-dependent increase in inhibition of EGF-stimulated EGFR autophosphorylation and this translated into blockade of c-fos gene expression in DU145 cells. FD137 induced significant levels of DNA damage and showed 150-fold greater anti-proliferative activity than BCNU, a classical nitrosourea. In contrast to BCNU, complete inhibition of EGF-induced cell transition to S-phase was observed at concentrations of FD137 as low as 3 muM. CONCLUSION. FD137 could not only damage DNA, but also significantly block downstream EGFR-mediated signaling. The superior activity of FD137 may be imputable to the combined effect of its mixed EGFR/DNA targeting properties. This novel strategy may well represent a new approach to target nitrosoureas to EGFR-overexpressing carcinomas of the prostate. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

CVD also contributes to cognitive loss in Alzheimer disease (AD). Summary-Progress in understanding vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and vascular dementia (VaD) has resulted in promising symptomatic and preventive treatments. Cholinergic deficits in VaD due to ischemia of basal forebrain nuclei and cholinergic pathways can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors used in AD. Controlled clinical trials with donepezil and galantamine in patients with VaD, as well as in patients with AD plus CVD, have demonstrated improvement in cognition, behavior, and activities of daily living. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine stabilized progression of VaD compared with placebo. Primary and secondary stroke prevention, in particular with control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, can decrease VaD incidence. Conclusions-From a public health viewpoint, recognition of VCI before the development of dementia and correction of vascular burden on the brain may lead to a global decrease of incident dementia.

To develop an experimental paradigm to study this issue, ameroid (AM) constrictors were implanted around the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) in canines. Six weeks later, unipolar electrograms were recorded from 191 sites in the LCx territory in the open-chest, anesthetized state under basal pacing at 150 beats/min. We investigated the effect of SCS on ST segment displacements induced in the collateral-dependent myocardium in response to two stressors: (i) transient bouts of rapid ventricular pacing (TRP: 240/min for 1 min) and (ii) angiotensin II administered to right atrial neurons via their coronary artery blood supply. ST segment responses to TRP consisted of ST segment elevation in central areas of the LCx territory and ST depression at more peripheral areas. Such responses were unchanged when TRP was applied under SCS. Shortening of repolarization intervals in the metabolically compromised myocardium in response to TRP was also unaffected by SCS. In contrast, ST segment responses to intracoronary angiotensin II, which consisted of increased ST elevation, were attenuated by SCS in 6/8 preparations. The modulator effects of SCS were greatest at sites at which the greatest responses to angiotensin II occurred in the absence of SCS. These data indicate that spinal cord stimulation may attenuate the deleterious effects that stressors exert on the myocardium with reduced coronary reserve, particularly stressors associated with chemical activation of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system.

Compared with heteropolymeric assemblies of NF triplet proteins in mammals, NF in lampreys has been thought to contain only a single subunit (NF180). This would imply that NF180 self-assembles, which would be important for manipulating its expression in studies of axonal regeneration. In order to study the possible role of NF in process outgrowth and to determine whether NF180 can self-assemble, its gene was transfected into mammalian and fish cell lines that either contain or lack vimentin. In transfected NIH3T3 cells, NF180 was poorly phosphorylated and its expression did not alter the length or number of cell processes. Nor did it appear to form typical intermediate filaments, suggesting that it may not self-assemble. NF180 also did not form typical filaments in SW13cl cells that either possessed or lacked vimentin, nor in transfected fish cells that were cultured at 18degreesC. In vitro, NF180 could not self-assemble but interacted with NF-L to interrupt its self-assembly. When cotransfected with rat NF-L into SW13cl.2vim(-) cells, NF180 did form thick, rod-like filamentous structures on immunofluorescence. More typical NFs were observed when NF180 was cotransfected with both NF-L and NF-M. Thus, NF180 cannot self-assemble but appears to require one or more additional elements for incorporation into NFs. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, it is not known whether link protein can function with similar avidity with versican, another member of the large hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan family that also binds to hyaluronan via its G1 domain. To address this issue, we have compared the interaction of the versican and aggrecan G1 domains with link protein and hyaluronan using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells and BIAcore analysis. The results showed that link protein could significantly improve the binding of both G1 domains to hyaluronan and that its interaction with VG1 is of a higher affinity than that with AG1. These observations suggest that link protein may function as a stabilizer of the interaction, not only between aggrecan and hyaluronan in cartilage, but also between versican and hyaluronan in many tissues.

Although cellular mechanisms leading to cell desensitization have been widely studied, those responsible for cell resensitization are still poorly understood. We examined here the traffic of the high affinity neurotensin receptor (NT1 receptor) following prolonged exposure to high agonist concentration. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy of Chinese hamster ovary, human neuroblastoma (CHP 212), and murine neuroblastoma (N1E-115) cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged NT1 receptor revealed that under prolonged treatment with saturating concentrations of neurotensin (NT) agonist, NT1 receptor and NT transiently accumulated in the perinuclear recycling compartment ( PNRC). During this cellular event, cell surface receptors remained markedly depleted as detected by both confocal microscopy and I-125-NT binding assays. In dividing cells, we observed that following prolonged NT agonist stimulation, NT1 receptors were removed from the PNRC, accumulated in dispersed vesicles inside the cytoplasm, and subsequently reappeared at the cell surface. This NT binding recovery allowed for constant cell sensitization and led to a chronic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases p42 and p44. Under these conditions, the constant activation of NT1 receptor generates an oncogenic regulation. These observations support the potent role for neuropeptides, such as NT, in cancer progression.

Cu( II)- to- Cu( I)- reduction supports extensive and permanent nitrosothiol formation, whereas Zn( II) ions appear to support a more limited, possibly transient one. Ascorbate induces release of nitric oxide, which catalyzes deaminative degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on the same core protein. Although free Zn( II) ions support a more limited degradation, Cu( II) ions support a more extensive self- pruning process. Here, we have investigated processing of glypican- 1 in rat C6 glioma cells and the possible participation of the copper- containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked splice variant of ceruloplasmin in nitrosothiol formation. Confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalization of glypican- 1 and ceruloplasmin in endosomal compartments. Ascorbate induced extensive, Zn( II)- supported heparan sulfate degradation, which could be demonstrated using a specific zinc probe. RNA interference silencing of ceruloplasmin expression reduced the extent of Zn( II)- supported degradation. In cell- free experiments, the presence of free Zn( II) ions prevented free Cu( II) ion from binding to glypican- 1 and precluded extensive heparan sulfate autodegradation. However, in the presence of Cu( II)- loaded ceruloplasmin, heparan sulfate in Zn( II)loaded glypican- 1 underwent extensive, ascorbate- induced degradation. We propose that the Cu( II)- to- Cu( I)- reduction that is required for S- nitrosylation of glypican- 1 can take place on ceruloplasmin and thereby ensure extensive glypican-1 processing in the presence of free Zn( II) ions.

Here, we show that mutations in GPR56, which encodes an orphan G protein - coupled receptor (GPCR) with a large extracellular domain, cause a human brain cortical malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). BFPP is characterized by disorganized cortical lamination that is most severe in frontal cortex. Our data suggest that GPCR signaling plays an essential role in regional development of human cerebral cortex.

Here, we show that DCC ( deleted in colorectal cancer), a receptor for the axon guidance cue netrin-1, is distributed both at the plasma membrane and in a pre-existing intracellular vesicular pool in embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. We hypothesized that the intracellular pool of DCC could be mobilized to the plasma membrane and enhance the response to netrin-1. Consistent with this, we show that application of netrin-1 causes a modest increase in cell surface DCC, without increasing the intracellular concentration of cAMP or activating PKA. Intriguingly, activation of PKA enhances the effect of netrin-1 on DCC mobilization and increases axon extension in response to netrin-1. PKA-dependent mobilization of DCC to the plasma membrane is selective, because the distributions of transient axonal glycoprotein-1, neural cell adhesion molecule, and trkB are not altered by PKA in these cells. Inhibiting adenylate cyclase, PKA, or exocytosis blocks DCC translocation on PKA activation. These findings indicate that netrin-1 increases the amount of cell surface DCC, that PKA potentiates the mobilization of DCC to the neuronal plasma membrane from an intracellular vesicular store, and that translocation of DCC to the cell surface increases axon outgrowth in response to netrin-1.

For this parameter the authors reviewed available evidence on the assessment of a child suspected of having cerebral palsy (CP), a nonprogressive disorder of posture or movement due to a lesion of the developing brain. Methods: Relevant literature was reviewed, abstracted, and classified. Recommendations were based on a four-tiered scheme of evidence classification. Results: CP is a common problem, occurring in about 2 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births. In order to establish that a brain abnormality exists in children with CP that may, in turn, suggest an etiology and prognosis, neuroimaging is recommended with MRI preferred to CT (Level A). Metabolic and genetic studies should not be routinely obtained in the evaluation of the child with CP (Level B). If the clinical history or findings on neuroimaging do not determine a specific structural abnormality or if there are additional and atypical features in the history or clinical examination, metabolic and genetic testing should be considered (Level C). Detection of a brain malformation in a child with CP warrants consideration of an underlying genetic or metabolic etiology. Because the incidence of cerebral infarction is high in children with hemiplegic CP, diagnostic testing for coagulation disorders should be considered (Level B). However, there is insufficient evidence at present to be precise as to what studies should be ordered. An EEG is not recommended unless there are features suggestive of epilepsy or a specific epileptic syndrome (Level A). Because children with CP may have associated deficits of mental retardation, ophthalmologic and hearing impairments, speech and language disorders, and oral-motor dysfunction, screening for these conditions should be part of the initial assessment (Level A). Conclusions: Neuroimaging results in children with CP are commonly abnormal and may help determine the etiology. Screening for associated conditions is warranted as part of the initial evaluation.

By immunofluorescent labeling, we detected both homologues in the developing brains of wild-type and wasted mutant mice, carrying a deletion in the eEF1A-21S1 gene; we found that brain expression of eEF1A-2/S1 protein is restricted to mature, terminally differentiated neurons, and coincides with the disappearance of eEF1A-1/EF-1alpha 20 days after birth. Furthermore, no elongation factor 1A is present in wasted mutant mice neurons following the developmental switch, indicating that the genetic regulation silencing eEF1A-1/EF-1alpha is still functional.

The method aims to extract the dimensions of the blood vessel directly from PET images and to simultaneously correct the radioactivity concentration for partial volume and spillover. This involves simulation of the tomographic imaging process to generate images of different blood vessel and background geometries and selecting the one that best fits, in a least-squares sense, the acquired PET image. A phantom experiment was conducted to validate the method which was then applied to eight subjects injected with 6-[F-18]fluoro-L-DOPA and one subject injected with [C-11]CO-labelled red blood cells. In the phantom study, the diameter of syringes filled with an 11C solution and inserted into a water-filled cylinder were estimated with an accuracy of half a pixel (I mm). The radioactivity concentration was recovered to 100 +/- 4% in the 8.7 mm diameter syringe, the one that most closely approximated the superior sagittal sinus. In the human studies, the method systematically overestimated the calibre of the superior sagittal sinus by 23 mm compared to measurements made in magnetic resonance venograms on the same subjects. Sources of discrepancies related to the anatomy of the blood vessel were found not to be fundamental limitations to the applicability of the method to human subjects. This method has the potential to provide accurate quantification of blood radioactivity concentration from PET images without the need for blood samples, corrections for delay and dispersion, co-registered anatomical images, or manually defined regions of interest.

The mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease (Hexa -/-) has been described as behaviorally indistinguishable from wild type until at least I year of age due to a sialidase-mediated bypass of the metabolic defect that reduces the rate of G(M2) ganglioside accumulation. In this study, we have followed our mouse model to over 2 years of age and have documented a significant disease phenotype that is reminiscent of the late onset, chronic form of human Tay-Sachs disease. Onset occurs at 11-12 months of age and progresses slowly, in parallel with increasing storage of G(M2) ganglioside. The disease is characterized by hind limb spasticity, weight loss, tremors, abnormal posture with lordosis, possible visual impairment, and, late in the disease, muscle weakness, clasping of the limbs, and myoclonic twitches of the head. Immunodetection of G(M2) ganglioside showed that storage varies widely in different regions, but is most intense in pyriform cortex, hippocampus (CA3 field, subiculum), amygdala, hypothalamus (paraventricular supraoptic, ventromedial and arcuate nuclei, and mammilary body), and the somatosensory cortex (layer V) in 1- to 2-year-old mutant mice. We suggest that the TaySachs mouse model is a phenotypically valid model of disease and may provide for a reliable indicator of the impact of therapeutic strategies, in particular geared to the late onset, chronic form of human Tay-Sachs disease.

In cycling rats, rising endogenous E2 levels not only induce a surge in LH release, but also increase the expression of the immediate early gene Fos in the anteroventral preoptic area (AVPV) and within gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. This experiment examined whether the induction of Fos expression in the AVPV and within GnRH neurons after E2 treatment varied with stage of lactation and nutritional status. Brains of estrogen-treated ad lib fed and food-restricted lactating rats were processed for Fos or Fos/GnRH immunocytochemistry on days 15, 20, or 25 postpartum (pp). Cell counts from both labeling studies showed that on day 15 pp, neuronal activation in the AVPV and within GnRH neurons was low and did not differ between ad lib fed and food-restricted dams. On day 20 pp, levels of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FOS-IR) in the AVPV remained low in all dams but were significantly higher in ad lib fed dams. By day 25 pp, the ability of E2 to induce FOS-IR in the AVPV of food-restricted dams remained compromised. The proportion of GnRH cells expressing FOS-IR following E2 stimulation was restored to baseline levels by day 20 pp regardless of the nutritional status of the dam. These results show that the effects of E2 on neuronal events that correlate with the LH surge, are attenuated during lactation. Furthermore, food restriction during lactation selectively alters neuronal activation in the AVPV suggesting that this area integrates nutritional information to regulate LH release.

Therefore, mechanisms that control the ability of climbing fibers to forward information to the cerebellum are of considerable interest. We examined changes in transmission in cerebro-olivocerebellar pathways (COCPs) and spino-olivocerebellar pathways (SOCPs) during locomotion in awake cats ( n = 4) using low-intensity electrical stimuli delivered to the contralateral cerebral peduncle or the ipsilateral superficial radial nerve to set up volleys in COCPs and SOCPs, respectively. The responses were recorded as evoked extracellular climbing fiber field potentials within the C1 or C3 zones in the paravermal cerebellar cortex ( lobule Va - Vc). At most C1 and C3 zone sites, the largest COCP responses occurred during the stance phase, and the smallest responses occurred during the swing phase of the ipsilateral forelimb step cycle. In marked contrast, SOCP responses recorded at the same sites were usually largest during the swing phase and smallest during the stance phase. Because substantial climbing fiber responses could be evoked in all phases of the step cycle, the results imply that olivary neurons remain excitable throughout, and that the differences between SOCPs and COCPs in their pattern of step-related modulation are unlikely to have arisen solely through inhibition at the level of the inferior olive ( e. g., by activity in the inhibitory cerebellar nucleo-olivary pathway). The different patterns of modulation also suggest that climbing fiber signals conveyed by COCPs and SOCPs are likely to affect information processing within the cerebellar cortical C1 and C3 zones at different times during locomotion.

A critical structure in the gaze control circuitry is the superior colliculus (SC) of the midbrain, which drives gaze saccades by relaying cortical commands to brainstem eye and head motor circuits. We proposed that the SC lies within a gaze feedback loop and generates an error signal specifying gaze position error (GPE), the distance between target and current gaze positions. We investigated this feedback hypothesis in cats by briefly stopping head motion during large (approximate to50degrees) gaze saccades made in the dark. This maneuver interrupted intended gaze saccades and briefly immobilized gaze ( a plateau). After brake release, a corrective gaze saccade brought the gaze on goal. In the caudal SC, the firing frequency of a cell gradually increased to a maximum that just preceded the optimal gaze saccade encoded by the position of the cell and then declined back to zero near gaze saccade end. In brake trials, the activity level just preceding a brake-induced plateau continued steadily during the plateau and waned to zero only near the end of the corrective saccade. The duration of neural activity was stretched to reflect the increased time to target acquisition, and firing frequency during a plateau was proportional to the GPE of the plateau. In comparison, in the rostral SC, the duration of saccade-related pauses in fixation cell activity increased as plateau duration increased. The data show that the cat's SC lies in a gaze feedback loop and that it encodes GPE.

However, animal studies also demonstrate dopamine release in response to aversive stressful stimuli. Also, in animal studies, disruptions of the mother - infant relationship have been shown to have long-lasting effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system and the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. We therefore investigated dopamine release in response to stress in human subjects, considering the relationship to early life parental care. We screened 120 healthy young college students for parental care in early life using a combination of telephone interviews and questionnaires. Five students from the top end and five students from the bottom end of the parental care distribution were then invited for a positron emission tomography study using [(11)C] raclopride and a psychosocial stress task. The psychosocial stressor caused a significant release of dopamine in the ventral striatum as indicated by a reduction in [(11)C] raclopride binding potential in the stress versus resting condition in subjects reporting low parental care. Moreover, the magnitude of the salivary cortisol response to stress was significantly correlated with the reduction in [(11)C] raclopride binding in the ventral striatum (r = 0.78), consistent with a facilitating effect of cortisol on dopamine neuron firing. These data suggest that aversive stressful events can be associated with mesolimbic dopamine release in humans, and that the method presented here may be useful to study the effects of early life events on neurobiological stress systems.

An overwhelming abundance of peptides were assigned to the clathrin coat with a 1:1 stoichiometry observed for clathrin heavy and light chains and a 2:1 stoichiometry of clathrin heavy chain with clathrin adaptor protein heterotetramers. Thirty-two proteins representing many of the known components of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were identified, supporting that a main function for brain CCVs is to recapture SVs after exocytosis. A ratio of vesicle-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors to target-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors, similar to that previously detected on SVs, supports a single-step model for SV sorting during CCV-mediated recycling of SVs. The uncovering of eight previously undescribed proteins, four of which have to date been linked to clathrin-mediated trafficking, further attests to the value of the current organelle-based proteomics strategy.

Although ERK activation has been linked to learning behaviors and activity-dependent neuronal function, much of the acquired data has relied upon pharmacological agents that suppress ERK function in both neurons and nonneuronal cells. To determine the function of neuronal ERK activity in learning, a new line of transgenic mice was generated wherein dominant-negative MEK1, the upstream obligate activator of ERK1/2, was expressed by using a neuronal-specific and pan-neuronal Talpha1 alpha-tubulin promoter element. Mice expressing this construct exhibited decreased ERK1/2 activity in the hippocampus and thus were tested for learning impairments. In a battery of control tests, including open field, rotarod, and shock threshold, the transgenic mice displayed no deficits and performed as well as their wild-type littermate counterparts. However, the mice displayed a significant impairment in contextual fear conditioning compared with the wild-type littermates. These findings indicate that the MEK1/ERK1/2 cascade within neurons plays an important role in the processes of learning and memory. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Design: Sleep assessment was conducted for 5 consecutive days and neurobehavioral assessment was conducted in the morning of the third day of measurement in children with ADHD and no breathing problems and control children. Setting: The neurobehavioral assessment was conducted in the school; sleep was assessed in the home. Participants: 25 controls and 24 boys diagnosed with ADHD between 7 and 11 years of age. Measurements: Sleep was monitored using actigraphy for 5 consecutive nights. A computerized neurobehavioral evaluation system was used to assess children's neurobehavioral functioning. Results: Canonical correlation analyses revealed different patterns of associations between sleep and neurobehavioral functioning for the 2 groups. Significant relationships were found between measures of sleep and performance on complicated neurobehavioral tasks in the control group but not in the ADHD group. In addition, children with ADHD had increased instability of sleep parameters compared to the controls. Conclusions: The findings highlighted the distinct nature of associations between sleep and neurobehavioral functioning in boys with ADHD children and no reported breathing problems compared to controls. Despite the similarity between symptoms caused by sleep fragmentation and symptoms of ADHD, these appear to be different clinical conditions. The source of inattentiveness in children should be identified for best planning of clinical intervention.

WC used whole-cell recording and confocal imaging to characterize group I mGluR actions in CAI oriens/alveus interneurons in slices. fit tetrodotoxin and inotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, the group I mGluR specific agonist DHPG increased intradendritic Ca2+ levels and depolarized interneurons, whereas the group II mGluR specific agonist DCG-IV and the group III mGluR specific agonist L-AP4 did not. DHPG-induced depolarizing and Ca2+ responses were antagonized by the group I mGluR antagonist 4CPG, but Only Ca2+ responses were significantly inhibited by the mGluR 1 antagonist CPCCOEt. DHPG-induced depolarizing responses were not blocked by the inositol-1,4,5-trisphospliate (IP3) receptor inhibitor heparin, the protein kinase C (PKC) antagonists GF-109203X, or the inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC) U73122. Thus, these responses to DHPG may not be transduced by the PLC --> IP3/diacylglycerol (DAG) pathway classically linked to group I mGluRs. DHPG-induced depolarizations were not blocked by intracellular GDPbetaS or bath-application of N-ethylinaleimide (NEM), suggesting the involvement of a G protein-independent pathway. Our findings indicate that group I mGluRs induce a depolarization of oriens/alveus interneurons via a G protein-independent mechanism different from their classic signalling pathway. Since depolarizations are associated with intracellular Ca2+ rises, these actions may be important for their synaptic plasticity and Vulnerability to excitotoxicity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we tested two different control genes used for RT-PCR experiments, beta-actin and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D), in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia under normo- or hyperglycemic conditions. A three-vessel occlusion model with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was used in the rat. P-Actin mRNA expression was decreased in hyperglycemic ischemic rats compared to normoglycemic ischemic animals 3 h post-ischemia. beta-Actin protein content was unchanged. As for PBG-D, its mRNA expression remained constant throughout the groups. Our data thus show that, following focal cerebral ischemia in hyperglycemic conditions, beta-actin is an unsuitable housekeeping gene whereas PBG-D is more appropriate. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of selecting a stable housekeeping gene when performing RT-PCR experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The signal transduction pathways involved in these effects have not been characterized, but NT receptors are coupled to the phospholipase C pathway and Ca2+ mobilization. However, an enhancement of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) evoked by NT in DAergic neurons has yet to be demonstrated. Furthermore, the hypothesis that the excitatory effects of NT in DAergic neurons are Ca2+ dependant is currently untested. In whole-cell recording experiments, DAergic neurons in culture were identified by their selective ability to express a cell-specific green fluorescent protein reporter construct. These experiments confirmed that NT increases firing rate in cultured DAergic neurons. This effect was Ca2+ dependent because it was blocked by intracellular dialysis with BAPTA. Using Ca2+ imaging, we showed that NT caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+](i) in DAergic neurons. Most of the Ca2+ originated from the extracellular medium. NT-induced excitation and Ca2+ influx were blocked by SR48692, an antagonist of the type 1 NT receptor. Blocking IP3 receptors using heparin prevented the excitatory effect of NT. Moreover, Zn2+ and SKF96365 both blocked the excitatory effect of NT, suggesting that nonselective cationic conductances are involved. Finally, although NT can also induce a rise in [Ca2+](i) in astrocytes, we find that NT-evoked excitation of DAergic neurons can occur independently of astrocyte activation.

We have used intracellular recording and biocytin-labeling techniques in the entorhinal slice preparation from macaque monkeys to investigate the morphology and intrinsic electrophysiology of principal neurons. These neurons have previously been studied most extensively in rats. In monkeys, layer 11 neurons are usually stellate cells, as in rats, but they occasionally have a pyramidal shape. They tend to discharge trains, not bursts, of action potentials, and some display subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. Layer III neurons are pyramidal, and they do not appear to display membrane potential oscillations. The distribution of dendrites and of axon collaterals suggests that neurons in layers 11 and III are interconnected by a network of associational fibers. Layer V and VI neurons are pyramidal and tend to discharge trains of action potentials. The distribution of dendrites and axon collaterals suggests that there is an associative network of principal neurons in layers V and VI, and they also project axon collaterals toward superficial layers. Importantly, entorhinal cortical neurons in monkeys appear to exhibit significant differences from those in rats. Morphologically, neurons in monkey entorhinal layers 11 and III have more primary dendrites, more dendritic branches, and greater total dendritic length than in rats. Electrophysiologically, layer II neurons in monkeys exhibit less sag, and subthreshold oscillations are less robust and slower. Some monkey layer III neurons discharge bursts of action potentials that are not found in rats. The interspecies differences revealed by this study may influence information processing and pathophysiological processes in the primate entorhinal cortex. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Sim1 haploinsufficiency causes hyperphagia in mice and humans, most likely by perturbing the hypothalamus function. The administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD), a ligand of AHR, causes severe anorexia, which also appears to be of central origin. Both SIM1 and AHR require heterodimerization either with ARNT or ARNT2 to function. Here, we characterize the promoter for Sim1 and show that a consensus AHR-ARNT/2 binding site positively regulates its activity in the context of transfection experiments in Neuro-2A cells. A gel shift assay indicated that AHR-ARNT/2 can bind its putative site in the Sim1 promoter. Overexpression of Arnt, Arnt2, or Ahr increased the activity of a reporter construct containing the Sim1 promoter by 1.8-, 1.5-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, but failed to do so when the AHRARNT/2 binding site was mutated. Similarly, TCDD increased the activity of the reporter construct by 1.8- fold but not that of its mutated version. Finally, we found that TCDD increased Sim1 expression in Neuro-2A cells and in mouse kidney and hypothalamus by 4-, 3-, and 2-fold, respectively. We conclude that Sim1 expression is regulated by AHR-ARNT/2. This result raises the possibility that Sim1 mediates the effect of TCDD on feeding and points to a complex network of regulatory interactions between bHLH-PAS proteins.

To accomplish this, it has been proposed that an internal prediction of the consequences of our actions is compared with the actual sensory input to cancel the resultant self-generated activation. Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis at an early stage of processing in the vestibular system. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the vestibular nucleus, which receive direct inputs from vestibular afferent fibers, are responsive to passively applied head movements. However, these same neurons do not reliably encode head velocity resulting from self-generated movements of the head on the body. In this study, we examined the mechanism that underlies the selective elimination of vestibular sensitivity to active head-on-body rotations. Individual neurons were recorded in monkeys making active head movements. The correspondence between intended and actual head movement was experimentally controlled. We found that a cancellation signal was gated into the vestibular nuclei only in conditions in which the activation of neck proprioceptors matched that expected on the basis of the neck motor command. This finding suggests that vestibular signals that arise from self-generated head movements are inhibited by a mechanism that compares the internal prediction of the sensory consequences by the brain to the actual resultant sensory feedback. Because self-generated vestibular inputs are selectively cancelled early in processing, we propose that this gating is important for the computation of spatial orientation and control of posture by higher-order structures.

Material and methods - A total of 19 Canadian patients (I) with a median age of 22 years, 17 Swedish patients (II) with a median age of 14 years and a reference group comprising 12 individuals were studied. Presence of herpesviral DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction. Results - Of three children with Rasmussen's encephalitis, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was found in two, and human herpesvirus type 6 DNA in two. In six children with ganglioglioma, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in four. CMV DNA was found significantly more in group I compared with II, while the reverse occurred with EBV DNA. Malformations of cortical development were found significantly more in group II compared with I. Conclusion - Detection of DNA from some herpesviruses in epileptic brain tissue may possibly be associated with distinct clinical conditions, but factors such as age and malformations of cortical development should also be considered.

The systematic study of gene expression profiles of the human alcoholic brain was initiated using the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-differential display and was followed by DNA microarray. To date, more than 100 alcohol-responsive genes have been identified from the frontal cortex, motor cortex and nucleus accumbens of the human brain. These genes have a wide range of functions in the brain and indicate diverse actions of alcohol on neuronal function. This review discusses the current information on the genetic basis of alcoholism and the induction and characterization of these alcohol-responsive genes.

Design: Cohort study. Setting: Pediatric trauma center. Participants: Thirty-eight children aged 7 to 16 years (mean, 12.2+/-2.8y) were recruited in each group. Children with mild TBI had a mean Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14.8 and were considered normal on a neurologic assessment at hospital discharge. Noninjured children were friends of those with mild TBI. Intervention: Assessments of balance were conducted at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after mild TBI and at corresponding time intervals for the controls. Main Outcome Measures: The balance subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP), the Pediatric Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction for Balance (P-CTSIB), and the Postural Stress Test (PST) were used. Results: Over the time interval of the study, analyses of variance revealed that children with mild TBI performed significantly worse than the noninjured group on the BOTMP balance subtest (P<.001) and on the PST (P=.031), as well as on the eyes-closed conditions in the P-CTSIB tandem position (P=.05). Conclusions: Children with a mild TBI still showed balance deficits at 12 weeks postinjury. These deficits should be taken into consideration when planning a return to physical activities, particularly to those that require subtle balance skills.

This model is based on several lines of experimental evidence and considers the endogenous circadian pacemaker as a complex oscillatory system that responds dynamically to the resetting effect of light. This model can help us understand the results of an experiment using intermittent bright light exposure in the workplace environment. Intermittent exposure to bright light was effectively used as part of an intervention to promote circadian re-entrainment of a group of nurses to their permanent night work schedule. Regular exposure to lower light levels and darkness also provided a significant phase delay of endogenous circadian rhythms, although the adaptation was incomplete in this group of workers. These last results are consistent with the intensity-dependent component of the model. The development of better tools to measure retinal exposure to light throughout the 24-h day is required to adequately test modeling predictions under field conditions.

The syndrome arises from expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, leading to methylation of the promoter sequence and lack of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Affected individuals display a unique neurobehavioural phenotype that includes striking visual-motor deficits. Here we provide neurobiological and behavioural evidence that supports the hypothesis that these visual-motor deficits are attributable to a magnocellular (M) visual pathway impairment. Immunohistochemical staining of a lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of a normal human male revealed high FMRP basal expression selectively within the M layers, suggesting an increased susceptibility of these neurons to the lack of FMRP as occurs in FXS. Similar staining of monkey LGNs for quantification purposes revealed that the difference is not an artefact of cell size differences between M and parvocellular (P) neurons. Further, Nissl staining of the LGNs of a male FXS patient revealed alaminar nuclei comprised of a homogenous population of small sized neurons, providing anatomical and morphological support for the idea that an M pathway pathology exists in FXS. Consistent with these neurobiological data, we have found that male patients with FXS have reduced sensitivity for psychophysical stimuli that probe the M pathway but not for those that probe the P pathway, a complementary visual stream that performs a separate set of early visual operations. Finally, male patients with FXS performed poorly on a global motion task but not on a form perception task, suggesting that the M pathway thalamic deficit may have a selective impact on cortical visual functioning in the parietal lobe, which is known to be a major recipient of M pathway afferents via the primary visual cortex. Together, these findings provide the first evidence that the loss of a single gene product, FMRP, in humans leads to abnormal neuroanatomical morphology of the LGN and a concomitant selective visual deficit of the M pathway.

Design: Retrospective analysis. Main Outcome Measures: Data compiled for the US Consumer Product Safety Commission using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System were used to generate estimates for the total number of head injuries, concussions, internal head injuries, and skull fractures occurring on a national level from the years 1990 to 1999. These data were combined with yearly participation figures to generate rates of injuries presenting to the ED for each sport. Results: There were an estimated 17,008 head injuries from ice hockey, 86,697 from soccer, and 204,802 from football that presented to US EDs from 1990 to 1999. The total number ofconcussions presenting to EDs in the United States over the same period was estimated to be 4820 from ice hockey, 21,715 from soccer, and 68,861 from football. While the rates of head injuries, concussions, and combined concussions/internal head injuries/skull fractures presenting to EDs per 10,000 players were not always statistically similar for all 3 sports in each year data were available, they were usually comparable. Conclusion: While the total numbers of head injuries, concussions, and combined concussions/skull fractures/internal head injuries presenting to EDs in the United States are different for ice hockey, soccer, and football for the years studied, the yearly rates for these injuries are comparable among all 3 sports.

It investigates the discriminatory ability of three video indicators of mastication for a group of people with Down's syndrome, representing a target group with neurological disabilities. The variables were generated through video recordings of 11 adults with Down's syndrome and 12 healthy subjects eating four natural foods varying in hardness. The collected variables were masticatory time, number of masticatory cycles, and number of open masticatory cycles. The analytical approach attempts to test four hypotheses exploring the variations of the video indicators according to food hardness for both groups. It was demonstrated that masticatory time and the number of masticatory cycles have very strong, positive correlations and the number of open masticatory cycles has a fair, positive correlation with the food hardness rankings for both groups. Video evaluation of the test variables using real foods in people with Down's syndrome was found to be a valid means of evaluating aspects of their masticatory function.

Besides positive and negative symptom control, they may improve cognition. Due to their limited availability as oral agents only, benefits are limited by noncompliance. Methods: Using Medline and PsycINFO databases, literature was reviewed to address: (1) factors underlying medication noncompliance; (2) available evidence on efficacy of depot intramuscular (IM) typical antipsychotics; and (3) current knowledge of long-acting atypicals. Results: Noncompliance remains high due to illness-, treatment-, and clinician-related factors. Compared to oral typicals, atypicals may improve compliance, even though noncompliance remains high. Depot IM typicals are efficacious (reduced relapses and rehospitalizations), but extrapyramidal symptoms are problematic. Available data on long-acting atypical risperidone suggest that it is safe and efficacious. Conclusion: Development of long-acting injectable atypical agents is warranted since noncompliance remains high. Future long-acting IM atypical trials should include outpatient functioning, and preferably be of longer duration to address cost-effectiveness. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V./ECNP. All rights reserved.

In the present study, unconscious modulation of corticospinal excitability was probed in healthy volunteers with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected from the first dorsal interosseus muscle while subjects performed a masked semantic priming task that has been shown to elicit covert motor cortex activations. Our data show that the amplitude of the MEPs is modulated by an unseen prime, in line with temporal patterns revealed with event related potentials. These data confirm previous reports showing specific motor neural responses associated with an unseen visual stimulus and establish TMS as a valuable tool in the study of the neural correlates of consciousness.

Method.-Medical records were retrospectively reviewed of all patients with cluster headache who received outpatient intravenous DHE for treatment of refractory cluster headache between January 1992 and May 2000. Results.-One hundred four treatments were identified in 70 patients. There were 7 dropouts. Of the 97 completed treatments, 60 were for episodic cluster headache and 37 were for chronic cluster headache. Results for all treatments showed complete resolution of pain during the intravenous phase at 1 month in 61 (63%) of 97 cases, partial resolution in 13 cases (15%), and failure in 23 cases (24%). For the treatment of episodic cluster headache, there was complete resolution in 44 (73%) of 60 cases, partial resolution in 9 cases (13%), and failure in 7 cases (12%). For treatment of chronic cluster headache, there was complete resolution in 17 (46%) of the 37 cases, partial resolution in 4 cases (11%), and 16 failures (43%). As regards side effects and safety, the treatment triggered chest pain suspected of being vasospastic angina in 1 patient on day 7 of the treatment, when she was in the subcutaneous phase. Two patients dropped out due to fear of the injection, 1 because of palpitations, 1 because of chest tightness, and 2 others because of leg cramps, nausea, and diarrhea. Conclusions.-Outpatient intravenous DHE is a safe treatment. It is useful for refractory cluster headache, is more effective for the episodic form than the chronic form, and has a rapid onset of action. It did not change the evolution of the episodic form, but it did appear to induce remission in the chronic form or transform it to the episodic form. We advance a hypothesis to explain this.

Parameters (weights and biases) of the proposed model are identified using the back-propagation algorithm, which is applied to the input and output waveforms of the PA recorded under real operation conditions. Time- and frequency-domain simulation of a 90-W LDMOS PA output using this novel neural-network model exhibit a good agreement between the RVTDNN behavioral model's predicted results and measured ones along with a good generality. Moreover, dynamic AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that the RVTDNN can track and account for the memory effects of the PAs well. These characteristics also point out that the small-signal response of the LDMOS PA is more affected by the memory effects than the PAs large-signal response when it is driven by 3G signals. This RVTDNN model requires a significantly reduced complexity and shorter processing time in the analysis and training procedures, when driven with complex modulated and highly varying envelope signals such as 3G signals, than previously published neural-network-based PA models.

Unlike other self-creating models, the proposed scheme, called branching competitive learning (BCL), adopts a special node-splitting criterion, which is based mainly on the geometrical measurements of the movement of the synaptic vectors in the weight space. Compared with other self-creating and nonself-creating competitive learning models, the BCL network is more efficient to capture the spatial distribution of the input data and, therefore, tends to give better clustering or quantization results. We demonstrate the ability of the BCL model to appropriately estimate the cluster number in a data distribution, show its adaptability to nonstationary data inputs and, moreover, present a scheme leading to a multiresolution data clustering. Extensive experiments on vector quantization of image compression are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the BCL algorithm.

We develop a fast converging adaptive training algorithm that minimizes the bit-error rate (BER) at the output of the receiver. The adaptive algorithm has three key features: i) it incorporates the BER, i.e., the ultimate performance evaluation measure, directly into the learning process, ii) it utilizes constraints that are derived from the properties of the optimum single-user decision boundary for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) multiple-access channels, and iii) it embeds importance sampling (IS) principles directly into the receiver optimization process. Simulation studies illustrate the BER performance of the proposed scheme.
