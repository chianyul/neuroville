In this review, ICBEN team chairs and co-chairs summarize relevant findings, publications, developments, and policies related to the biological effects of noise, with a focus on the period 2011-2014 and for the following topics: Noise-induced hearing loss; nonauditory effects of noise; effects of noise on performance and behavior; effects of noise on sleep; community response to noise; and interactions with other agents and contextual factors. Occupational settings and transport have been identified as the most prominent sources of noise that affect health. These reviews demonstrate that noise is a prevalent and often underestimated threat for both auditory and nonauditory health and that strategies for the prevention of noise and its associated negative health consequences are needed to promote public health.

Interaction of the amyloid precursor protein-like protein 1 (APLP1) E2 domain with heparan sulfate involves two distinct binding modes	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION D-STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						APP-like protein 1; heparan sulfate binding domain; protein heparin complex; Alzheimer's disease	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FAMILY-MEMBERS; F-SPONDIN; APP; RECEPTOR; DIMERIZATION; SITE; CRYSTALLOGRAPHY; PROTEOGLYCANS; SPECIFICITY	Beyond the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, the members of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) family are essential for neuronal development and cell homeostasis in mammals. APP and its paralogues APP-like protein 1 (APLP1) and APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) contain the highly conserved heparan sulfate (HS) binding domain E2, which effects various (patho)physiological functions. Here, two crystal structures of the E2 domain of APLP1 are presented in the apo form and in complex with a heparin dodecasaccharide at 2.5 angstrom resolution. The apo structure of APLP1 E2 revealed an unfolded and hence flexible N-terminal helix alpha A. The (APLP1 E2) 2-(heparin) 2 complex structure revealed two distinct binding modes, with APLP1 E2 explicitly recognizing the heparin terminus but also interacting with a continuous heparin chain. The latter only requires a certain register of the sugar moieties that fits to a positively charged surface patch and contributes to the general heparin-binding capability of APP-family proteins. Terminal binding of APLP1 E2 to heparin specifically involves a structure of the nonreducing end that is very similar to heparanase-processed HS chains. These data reveal a conserved mechanism for the binding of APP-family proteins to HS and imply a specific regulatory role of HS modifications in the biology of APP and APP-like proteins.

Monoamine oxidase A gene promoter methylation and transcriptional downregulation in an offender population with antisocial personality disorder	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; BRAIN-SEROTONIN; MAOA GENOTYPE; ABUSE; ENVIRONMENT; ADOLESCENCE; IMPULSIVITY; EXPRESSION; CHILDREN	Background Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is characterised by elevated impulsive aggression and increased risk for criminal behaviour and incarceration. Deficient activity of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene is suggested to contribute to serotonergic system dysregulation strongly associated with impulsive aggression and antisocial criminality. Aims To elucidate the role of epigenetic processes in altered MAOA expression and serotonin regulation in a population of incarcerated offenders with ASPD compared with a healthy non-incarcerated control population. Method Participants were 86 incarcerated participants with ASPD and 73 healthy controls. MAOA promoter methylation was compared between case and control groups. We explored the functional impact of MAOA promoter methylation on gene expression in vitro and blood 5-HT levels in a subset of the case group. Results Results suggest that MAOA promoter hypermethylation is associated with ASPD and may contribute to downregulation of MAOA gene expression, as indicated by functional assays in vitro, and regression analysis with whole-blood serotonin levels in offenders with ASPD. Conclusions These results are consistent with prior literature suggesting MAOA and serotonergic dysregulation in antisocial populations. Our results offer the first evidence suggesting epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to MAOA dysregulation in antisocial offenders.

Why University Athletes Choose Not to Reveal Their Concussion Symptoms During a Practice or Game	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE			English	Article						concussion; symptoms; team sports; university; reasons	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HIGH-SCHOOL FOOTBALL; HEAD-INJURIES; SOCCER PLAYERS; INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; CEREBRAL CONCUSSION; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; SPORT HELD; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION	Objective: To determine why athletes decide not to seek medical attention during a game or practice when they believe they have suffered a concussion. Design: A retrospective survey. Setting: University Sport Medicine Clinic. Participants: A total of 469 male and female university athletes from several varsity team sports were participated in the study. Main Outcome Measures: Athletes were surveyed about the previous 12 months to identify specific reasons why those athletes who believed they had suffered a concussion during a game or practice decided not to seek attention at that time, how often these reasons occurred, and how important these reasons were in the decision process. Results: Ninety-two of the 469 athletes (19.6%) believed they had suffered a concussion within the previous 12 months while playing their respective sport, and 72 of these 92 athletes (78.3%) did not seek medical attention during the game or practice at least once during that time. Sports in which athletes were more likely to not reveal their concussion symptoms were football and ice hockey. The reason "Did not feel the concussion was serious/severe and felt you could still continue to play with little danger to yourself," was listed most commonly (55/92) as a cause for not seeking medical attention for a presumed concussion. Conclusions: A significant percentage of university athletes who believed they had suffered a concussion chose not to seek medical attention at the time of injury. Improved education of players, parents, and coaches about the dangers of continuing to play with concussion symptoms may help improve reporting.	[Delaney, J.

Methods: Thirty-seven patients with interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) with fronto-central predominance underwent EEG/fMRI. Patients were divided into a Focal (20 patients) group with focal frontal spikes and a WBSD group (17 patients). Maps of hemodynamic responses related to IEDs were compared between the two groups. Results: The mean number +/- SD of IEDs in the Focal group was 137.5 +/- 38.1 and in the WBSD group, 73.5 +/- 16.6 (p = 0.07). The volume of hemodynamic responses in the WBSD group was significantly larger than in the Focal group (mean, 243.3 +/- 41.1 versus 114.8 +/- 27.4 cm(3), p = 0.01). Maximum hemodynamic responses occurred in both groups in the following regions: dorsolateral prefrontal, mesial prefrontal, cingulate, and supplementary motor cortices. Maxima in premotor and motor cortex, frontal operculum, frontopolar, and orbitofrontal regions were found only in the Focal group, and maxima in thalamus and caudate only occurred in the WBSD group. Thalamic responses were significantly more common in the WBSD group (14/17) than in the Focal group (7/20), p = 0.004. Deactivation in the default mode network was significantly more common in the WBSD group (14/17) than in the Focal group (10/20), p = 0.04. Significance: The spatial distribution and extent of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses correlate well with electrophysiologic changes. Focal frontal spikes and WBSDs are not region specific in the frontal lobe, and the same frontal region can generate focal and generalized discharges. This suggests that widespread discharges reflect widespread epileptogenicity rather than a focal discharge located in a region favorable to spreading. The thalamus plays an important role in bilateral synchronization.

It has been shown that the DMN would deactivate during goal-directed tasks, but the actual relationship between them is still a matter of debate. In a previous study, we reported a specific pattern of activation of the frontostriatal regions during a set-shifting task in which these regions were increasing their activity as set-shifts were performed continuously and decreasing when the same rule was executed repeatedly. The present study aimed at assessing the relationship between the frontostriatal regions and the DMN. We hypothesized that the DMN would be anticorrelated with the frontostriatal regions so the DMN would be more deactivated as set-shifts are executed for a long period, but would start increasing when the same rule is being executed for a long period. Here, 15 participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a card-sorting task. We observed increased activity in the frontostriatal regions as more set-shifts are being performed while the DMN gets more deactivated. Interestingly, as decreased activity was observed in the frontostriatal regions during the execution of the same rule for a long period, the DMN showed increasing activity. We argue that there is an anticorrelation between the frontostriatal regions and the DMN, but also that the DMN could show positive activation during performance of a familiar goal-directed task.

Method: This paper gives an overview of the role of genetic and environmental factors in the pathophysiology of MDD and describes the structural changes in brain structures of depressed individuals. A closer look is given at the molecular processes and neurotransmitters implicated in this mental disorder. Moreover, this paper discusses key findings from recent research using animal models and their relevance for clinical applications. Results: Although the exact cause of MDD is not known, there is enough evidence showing that genetic, psychological and environmental factors significantly increase the risk of developing this disease. Individuals affected by MDD exhibit a reduced volume of structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus and basal ganglia, as well as altered level of neurotransmitters in the brain. Conclusion: The studies presented in this review show promising results that could shed light on the molecular mechanisms of MDD. However, more work needs to be done to better understand this psychiatric disorder and promote the development of new treatment strategies. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The MEMO+ study is a randomized, controlled, single-blind trial designed to test the efficacy, specificity, and long-term effect of a cognitive training intervention and a psychosocial intervention in persons with MCI. Methods: One hundred and sixty-two participants with MCI will be recruited. They will be randomized into three groups: cognitive training, psychosocial intervention, and no-contact. Each intervention will last for eight weeks (one session per week) and a booster training session will be provided three months after the end of the intervention. Various proximal and distal outcomes will be measured at pre-intervention as well as at one week, three months, and six months post-training. Proximal outcomes include memory and psychological health measures. Distal outcomes focus on self-rated functioning in complex daily activities and strategies used in daily life to enhance function. Socio-demographic factors (age, gender, and education), general cognition, personality traits, engagement in activities, and self-efficacy will be used as moderators.

Although LKB1 (also known as STK11) is sufficient to initiate polarity in a single mammalian intestinal epithelial cell, its necessity in the formation and maintenance of mammalian epithelia remains unclear. To address this, we completely remove LKB1 from mouse embryos by generating maternal-zygotic Lkb1 mutants and find that it is dispensable for polarity and epithelia formation in the early embryo. Instead, loss of Lkb1 leads to the extrusion of cells from blastocyst epithelia that remain alive and can continue to divide. Chimeric analysis shows that Lkb1 is cell-autonomously required to prevent these extrusions. Furthermore, heterozygous loss of Cdh1 exacerbates the number of extrusions per blastocyst, suggesting that LKB1 has a role in regulating adherens junctions in order to prevent extrusion in epithelia.

Normalization of White Matter Intensity on T1-Weighted Images of Patients with Acquired Central Nervous System Demyelination	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Intensity normalization; magnetic resonance imaging; clinical trials; multiple sclerosis	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESIONS; HYPOINTENSE LESIONS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; BLACK-HOLES; CLINICAL CORRELATIONS; MR-IMAGES; MS; PERSISTENT; SCALE	BACKGROUNDIntensity variation between magnetic resonance images (MRI) hinders comparison of tissue intensity distributions in multicenter MRI studies of brain diseases. The available intensity normalization techniques generally work well in healthy subjects but not in the presence of pathologies that affect tissue intensity. One such disease is multiple sclerosis (MS), which is associated with lesions that prominently affect white matter (WM). OBJECTIVETo develop a T1-weighted (T1w) image intensity normalization method that is independent of WM intensity, and to quantitatively evaluate its performance. METHODS AND SUBJECTSWe calculated median intensity of grey matter and intraconal orbital fat on T1w images. Using these two reference tissue intensities we calculated a linear normalization function and applied this to the T1w images to produce normalized T1w (NT1) images. We assessed performance of our normalization method for interscanner, interprotocol, and longitudinal normalization variability, and calculated the utility of the normalization method for lesion analyses in clinical trials. RESULTSStatistical modeling showed marked decreases in T1w intensity differences after normalization (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONSWe developed a WM-independent T1w MRI normalization method and tested its performance. This method is suitable for longitudinal multicenter clinical studies for the assessment of the recovery or progression of disease affecting WM.

To test usefulness in humans, we determined blood-brain clearances, volumes of distribution, and receptor availability by means of PET with C-11-yohimbine in healthy male adults. Methods: We recorded the distribution of C-11-yohimbine with 90-min dynamic PET and sampled arterial blood to measure intact C-11-yohimbine in plasma. For analysis, we coregistered PET images to individual MR images and automatically identified 27 volumes of interest. We used 1-tissue-compartment graphical analysis with 6 linearized solutions of the fundamental binding equation, with the metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curves as input function, to estimate the kinetic parameters of C-11-yohimbine. With the lowest steady-state distribution volume (V-T), determined in the corpus callosum, we calculated the binding potential (receptor availability) of the radioligand in other regions. Results: The linear regressions yielded similar estimates of the kinetic parameters. The cortical values of V-T ranged from 0.82 mL cm(-3) in the right frontal cortex to 0.46 mL cm-3 in the corpus callosum, with intermediate V-T values in subcortical structures. Binding potentials averaged 0.6-0.8 in the cortex and 0.2-0.5 in subcortical regions. Conclusion: The maps of C-11-yohimbine binding to alpha 2 adrenoceptors in human brain had the highest values in cortical areas and hippocampus, with moderate values in subcortical structures, as found also in vitro. The results confirm the usefulness of the tracer C-11-yohimbine for mapping alpha 2 adrenoceptors in human brain in vivo.

The incidence of T-SCI ranges from 10.4 to 83 cases per million and varies with age, sex, or geographical region. This study describes the epidemiology and demographic characteristics of patients treated for T-SCI in our region over 11 years. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Single Level-I trauma center in Quebec, Canada. Participants: Patients who sustained T-SCI between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2011. Interventions: None. Outcome measures: Data concerning T-SCI patients was retrieved from the Quebec Trauma Registry. Information on age, sex, trauma, level of injury, type and severity of neurological deficit (ASIA scale), and treatment was extracted. Annual, age-standardized rates of T-SCI were calculated and trends over time were examined. Results: Eight hundred and thirty-one patients with T-SCI were identified. The incidence of T-SCI did not change over time but there was a 13-year increase in age between 2002 and 2010. More than 60% of patients aged 55 years or more were injured following a fall and 80% became tetraplegic. These patients were more likely to have central cord syndrome (CCS) and incomplete neurological injury, compared to younger patients. The incidence of CCS increased from 25 to 37% over 11 years. Conclusions: The T-SCI population is aging and is more frequently sustaining injuries associated with CCS, incomplete neurological deficits and tetraplegia.

Astrocytic abnormalities and global DNA methylation patterns in depression and suicide	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-BINDING; KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; HUMAN GENOME; ACCESSIBLE CHROMATIN; KAINATE RECEPTORS; DYSFUNCTION; COMPLETERS	Astrocytes are glial cells specific to the central nervous system and involved in numerous brain functions, including regulation of synaptic transmission and of immune reactions. There is mounting evidence suggesting astrocytic dysfunction in psychopathologies such as major depression, however, little is known about the underlying etiological mechanisms. Here we report a two-stage study investigating genome-wide DNA methylation associated with astrocytic markers in depressive psychopathology. We first characterized prefrontal cortex samples from 121 individuals (76 who died during a depressive episode and 45 healthy controls) for the astrocytic markers GFAP, ALDH1L1, SOX9, GLUL, SCL1A3, GJA1 and GJB6. A subset of 22 cases with consistently downregulated astrocytic markers was then compared with 17 matched controls using methylation binding domain-2 (MBD2) sequencing followed by validation with high-resolution melting and bisulfite Sanger sequencing. With these data, we generated a genome-wide methylation map unique to altered astrocyte-associated depressive psychopathology. The map revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between cases and controls, the majority of which displayed reduced methylation levels in cases. Among intragenic DMRs, those found in GRIK2 (glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 2) and BEGAIN (brain-enriched guanylate kinase-associated protein) were most significant and also showed significant correlations with gene expression. Cell-sorted fractions were investigated and demonstrated an important non-neuronal contribution of methylation status in BEGAIN. Functional cell assays revealed promoter and enhancer-like properties in this region that were markedly decreased by methylation. Furthermore, a large number of our DMRs overlapped known Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE)-identified regulatory elements. Taken together, our data indicate significant differences in the methylation patterns specific to astrocytic dysfunction associated with depressive psychopathology, providing a potential framework for better understanding this disease phenotype.

Ethanol-induced epigenetic regulations at the Bdnf gene in C57BL/6J mice	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NEURAL STEM-CELLS; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; ADULT NEUROGENESIS; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; PROGENITOR CELLS; RETT-SYNDROME	High ethanol intake is well known to induce both anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects, in correlation with chromatin remodeling in the amygdaloid brain region and deficits in cell proliferation and survival in the hippocampus of rodents. Whether only moderate but chronic ethanol intake in C57BL/6J mice could also have an impact on chromatin remodeling and neuroplasticity was addressed here. Chronic ethanol consumption in a free choice paradigm was found to induce marked changes in the expression of genes implicated in neural development and histone post-translational modifications in the mouse hippocampus. Transcripts encoding neural bHLH activators and those from Bdnf exons II, III and VI were upregulated, whereas those from Bdnf exon VIII and Hdacs were downregulated by ethanol compared with water consumption. These ethanol-induced changes were associated with enrichment in both acetylated H3 at Bdnf promoter PVI and trimethylated H3 at PII and PIII. Conversely, acetylated H3 at PIII and PVIII and trimethylated H3 at PVIII were decreased in ethanol-exposed mice. In parallel, hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and TrkB-mediated neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus were significantly enhanced by ethanol consumption. These results suggest that, in C57BL/6J mice, chronic and moderate ethanol intake produces marked epigenetic changes underlying BDNF overexpression and downstream hippocampal neurogenesis.

Double dissociation of error inhibition and correction deficits after basal ganglia or dorsomedial frontal damage in humans	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Error inhibition; Error correction; Performance monitoring; Action selection; Basal ganglia; Prefrontal cortex	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MOTOR AREAS; CONFLICT; PERFORMANCE; NEGATIVITY; MECHANISMS	Effective self-control relies on the rapid adjustment of inappropriate responses. Understanding the brain basis of these processes has the potential to inform neurobiological models of the many neuropsychiatric disorders that are marked by maladaptive responding. Research on error processing in particular has implicated the dorsomedial frontal lobe (DMF) and basal ganglia (BG) in error detection, inhibition and correction. However there is controversy regarding the specific contributions of these regions to each of these component processes. Here we examined the effects of lesions affecting DMF or BG on these error-related processes. A flanker task was used to induce errors that in turn led to spontaneous, online corrections, while response kinematics were measured with high spatiotemporal resolution. The acceleration of errors was initially greater than that of correct responses. Errors then showed slower acceleration compared to correct responses, consistent with engagement of inhibition shortly after error response onset. BG damage disproportionately disrupted this early inhibitory phenomenon, above and beyond effects on baseline motor performance, but did not affect the kinematics of the corrective response. DMF damage showed the opposite pattern, with relatively delayed onset and weaker initial acceleration of the corrective response, but error suppression kinematics similar to that of the control group. This work clarifies the component processes and neural substrates of online post-error control, providing evidence for dissociable contributions of BG to error inhibition, but not correction, and DMF to rapid error correction, but not error suppression.

Fear across the senses: brain responses to music, vocalizations and facial expressions	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amygdala; hippocampus; fear; emotional expressions; music; vocalizations	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN AMYGDALA; NEURAL RESPONSES; EMOTIONAL VOCALIZATIONS; BODY EXPRESSIONS; IMPAIRED RECOGNITION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FMRI; MEMORY	Intrinsic emotional expressions such as those communicated by faces and vocalizations have been shown to engage specific brain regions, such as the amygdala. Although music constitutes another powerful means to express emotions, the neural substrates involved in its processing remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether brain regions typically associated with processing 'biologically relevant' emotional expressions are also recruited by emotional music. To address this question, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 47 healthy volunteers in which we directly compared responses to basic emotions (fear, sadness and happiness, as well as neutral) expressed through faces, non-linguistic vocalizations and short novel musical excerpts. Our results confirmed the importance of fear in emotional communication, as revealed by significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus, as well as in the posterior insula across all three domains. Moreover, subject-specific amygdala responses to fearful music and vocalizations were correlated, consistent with the proposal that the brain circuitry involved in the processing of musical emotions might be shared with the one that have evolved for vocalizations. Overall, our results show that processing of fear expressed through music, engages some of the same brain areas known to be crucial for detecting and evaluating threat-related information.

IMAGEN Consortium	BDNF Val66Met and reward-related brain function in adolescents: Role for early alcohol consumption	ALCOHOL			English	Article						Reward; Striatum; BDNF gene; Adolescence; Alcohol	DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION TEST; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR BDNF; SUBSTANCE USE; VAL(66)MET POLYMORPHISM; DORSOLATERAL STRIATUM; RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; EATING-DISORDERS; PRIMARY-CARE	Changes in reward processing have been identified as one important pathogenetic mechanism in alcohol addiction. The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene (rs6265/Val66Met) modulates the central nervous system activity of neurotransmitters involved in reward processing such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. It was identified as crucial for alcohol consumption in healthy adults and, in rats, specifically related to the function in the striatum, a region that is commonly involved in reward processing. However, studies in humans on the association of BDNF Val66Met and reward-related brain functions and its role for alcohol consumption, a significant predictor of later alcohol addiction, are missing. Based on an intermediate phenotype approach, we assessed the early orientation toward alcohol and alcohol consumption in 530 healthy adolescents that underwent a monetary incentive delay task,during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found a significantly lower response in the putamen to reward anticipation in adolescent Met carriers with high versus low levels of alcohol consumption. During reward feedback, Met carriers with low putamen reactivity were significantly more likely to orient toward alcohol and to drink alcohol 2 years later. This study indicates a possible effect of BDNF Val66Met on alcohol addiction-related phenotypes in adolescence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Functional Outcomes and Quality of Life After Proximal Gastrectomy with Esophagogastrostomy Using a Narrow Gastric Conduit	ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article							REFLUX ESOPHAGITIS; JEJUNAL INTERPOSITION; SURGICAL RESECTION; UPPER 3RD; CANCER; ADENOCARCINOMA; CARCINOMA; STOMACH; CARDIA; CLASSIFICATION	Background. The best surgical approach for tumors of the proximal stomach remains controversial. For proximal gastrectomy (PG), the evidence regarding quality of life (QoL) and functional outcomes is controversial. Moreover, there are limited data from non-Asian settings. Methods. All patients who underwent PG from September 2005 to July 2013 were identified from an institutional database. Demographic, perioperative and pathologic characteristics were retrieved. Symptom scores (0 = best/4 = worst) for reflux symptoms, dysphagia and validated QoL metrics (FACT scale, where a higher score is better) were assessed during early and late follow-up. Eligible patients for analysis were those with no evidence of recurrence. Results. Of 465 upper gastrointestinal cancer resections, 50 were PG for adenocarcinoma (42; 84 %), neuroendocrine carcinoma (5; 10 %) or other pathologies (3; 6 %). R0 resection was achieved in 44 (89.8 %) of 49 patients with malignant tumors. Median lymph node collection was 32 (range 7-57). QoL scores did not differ from preoperative to early follow-up but increased compared to both at late follow-up [preoperative, 125 (interquartile range 105140); early follow-up, 122.5 (97-142); late follow-up, 147 (132-159); p<0.05]. At early and late follow-up, 9 (21.4 %) of 42 and 10 (33.3 %) of 30 patients reported reflux symptoms, but most were mild. Endoscopic signs of esophagitis were found in 7 (29 %) of 24 patients, but only two of these reported reflux symptoms. Conversely only three of eight patients with reflux symptoms had esophagitis on endoscopy. Conclusions. Global QoL is not reduced early after PG, and increases compared to baseline at late follow-up. Although reflux symptoms are reported by a quarter of patients, most are mild, and there is little correlation with esophagitis. PG should remain a viable option in the management of proximal gastric tumors.

Predictors of longitudinal outcome and recovery of pragmatic language and its relation to externalizing behaviour after pediatric traumatic brain injury	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Child; Brain injuries; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pragmatic language; Neurobiology	WEIGHTED IMAGING SWI; CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; SOCIAL BRAIN; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; ATYPICAL DEVELOPMENT; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; ADOLESCENCE	The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the contribution of age-at-insult and brain pathology on longitudinal outcome and recovery of pragmatic language in a sample of children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Children and adolescents with mild to severe TBI (n = 112) were categorized according to timing of brain insult: (i) Middle Childhood (5-9 years; n = 41); (ii) Late Childhood (10-11 years; n = 39); and (iii) Adolescence (12-15 years; n = 32) and group-matched for age, gender and socio-economic status (SES) to a typically developing (TD) control group (n = 43). Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including a susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence 2-8 weeks after injury and were assessed on measures of pragmatic language and behavioural functioning at 6- and 24-months after injury. Children and adolescents with TBI of all severity levels demonstrated impairments in these domains at 6-months injury before returning to age-expected levels at 2-years post-TBI. However, while adolescent TBI was associated with post-acute disruption to skills that preceded recovery to age-expected levels by 2-years post injury, the middle childhood TBI group demonstrated impairments at 6-months post-injury that we're maintained at 2-year follow up. Reduced pragmatic communication was associated with frontal, temporal and corpus callosum lesions, as well as more frequent externalizing behaviour at 24-months post injury. Findings show that persisting pragmatic language impairment after pediatric TBI is related to younger age at brain insult, as well as microhemorrhagic pathology in brain regions that contribute to the anatomically distributed social brain network. Relationships between reduced pragmatic communication and more frequent externalizing behavior underscore the need for context-sensitive rehabilitation programs that aim to increase interpersonal effectiveness and reduce risk for maladaptive behavior trajectories into the long-term post injury.

J	Freire, G; Shevell, M; Oskoui, M				Freire, Gabrielle; Shevell, Michael; Oskoui, Maryam			Cerebral palsy: Phenotypes and risk factors in term singletons born small for gestational age	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Cerebral palsy; Intra-uterine growth restriction	WEIGHT PERCENTILE CURVES; INTRAUTERINE GROWTH; NEWBORN ENCEPHALOPATHY; BIRTH-WEIGHT; METAANALYSIS; DELIVERIES; PREVALENCE; ASPHYXIA	Background and objectives: Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are at increased risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP). The pathophysiology behind this association remains unclear. We compare the clinical profile of children with CP born SGA to other children with CP. We hypothesize that differences noted will support antenatal causes of CP in children born SGA. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of term singletons with CP, extracting data from the Canadian Cerebral Palsy Registry. SGA was determined as birth weight for gestational age and sex below the tenth percentile. Results: Mothers of children with CP born SGA were more likely to be of African-American ethnicity (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.20-5.39), have intrauterine infections (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.09-4.50) and have gestational hypertension (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.06-3.00). Children with CP born SGA had smaller head circumferences at birth (p < 0.001) and higher frequencies of emergency cesarean-section (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.22-1.92), birth asphyxia (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.0-2.32), and placental abnormalities (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.00-2.10). Children with CP born SGA had greater fine motor (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02-2.11), gross motor (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.10) and communication impairment (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10-1.40), and a higher frequency of cognitive impairment (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06-1.69). Conclusion: Children with CP born SGA have different clinical factors and phenotypic profiles than other children with CP.

An ability that has received little to no attention in this population is entrainment to a musical beat. We show for the first time that a heterogeneous group of cochlear implant users is able to find the beat and move their bodies in time to Latin Merengue music, especially when the music is presented in unpitched drum tones. These findings not only reveal a hidden capacity for feeling musical rhythm through the body in the deaf and hearing impaired population, but illuminate promising avenues for designing early childhood musical training that can engage implanted children in social musical activities with benefits potentially extending to non-musical domains.

In this paper, we propose to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for this task, and present several novel architectures designed to efficiently model past and future temporal dependencies. Specifically, we implemented and compared several important RNN architectures, including Elman, Jordan, and hybrid variants. To facilitate reproducibility, we implemented these networks with the publicly available Theano neural network toolkit and completed experiments on the well-known airline travel information system (ATIS) benchmark. In addition, we compared the approaches on two custom SLU data sets from the entertainment and movies domains. Our results show that the RNN-based models outperform the conditional random field (CRF) baseline by 2% in absolute error reduction on the ATIS benchmark. We improve the state-of-the-art by 0.5% in the Entertainment domain, and 6.7% for the movies domain.

Through the implementation of a novel animal model of endoscopic carotid artery injury (CAI), effective techniques to manage this scenario have been developed. The Vascular Injuries Workshop has trained over 110 surgeons in these techniques. This study reviews events of major arterial hemorrhage managed by surgeons who completed this vascular injury workshop training. MethodsWe report a retrospective multicenter case series of patients who required endoscopic management of intranasal major arterial hemorrhage. Delegates who had attended the course were contacted by e-mail and surveyed with regard to instances of major arterial bleeding and the management undertaken. Patient demographics, tumor type, factors influencing injury, management technique, and outcomes were reviewed. ResultsThe cases reported herein are characterized as follows: 9 cases are reported in total, 3 male, 6 female; age range 37 to 82 years; 1 basilar artery, and 8 ICA injuries. Each case was successfully managed endoscopically with intraoperative muscle patch application. There were no deaths, 1 case of pseudoaneurysm with successful endovascular treatment, 2 cases of impaired carotid flow, and 1 carotid dissection was conservatively managed. There were no permanent neurological sequelae or other permanent morbidity. ConclusionThe Vascular Injuries Workshop arms surgeons with a structured approach to managing the surgical field and provides effective hemostatic techniques in the face of impending catastrophe. In comparison to the existing literature on ICA rupture, our results show trained surgeons are well equipped to achieve safe outcomes for their patients.

Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy for Obstructive Hydrocephalus due to Intraventricular Hemorrhage	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART A-CENTRAL EUROPEAN NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						endoscopic third ventriculostomy; hydrocephalus; ventriculoperitoneal shunt; stroke; intraventricular hemorrhage	NEUROENDOSCOPIC REMOVAL; HEMATOMA; MANAGEMENT; DRAINAGE; NEUROSURGERY; COILING	Background Although endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is the first-line treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus due to various pathologies, its role in hemorrhage-related obstructive hydrocephalus is poorly defined. We report our experience with ETV for hemorrhage-related obstructive hydrocephalus, demonstrate it feasibility, and discuss potential advantages over more conventional treatment modalities. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 78 consecutive patients who underwent ETV in our institution between January 2003 and January 2011. We identified 17 consecutive patients who underwent ETV for obstructive hydrocephalus related to intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Results ETV was performed in 9 men and 8 women (mean age: 58 years; range: 42-79). All patients had IVH (n = 17), either alone (n = 3) or with intracranial hemorrhage (n = 4) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (n = 10). Endoscopic clot evacuation was performed in seven cases (41%). External ventricular drain (EVD) was avoided in two patients. 15 patients had external EVD, and EVD wean was performed on average 5 days post-ETV. Two patients died in the early postoperative period (< 1 month) from the initial cerebral insult. For the 15 surviving patients, the average modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at last follow-up (15 months; range: 1-48) was 2.4. Thus most surviving patients were independent (mRS < 3). Of those 15 patients, one died (malignancy) at last follow-up. Twelve patients (80%) were ventriculoperitoneal shuntfree. The three shunt-dependent patients had significant SAH (100%). Conclusion ETV with or without endoscopic clot evacuation is feasible for patients with hemorrhage-related obstructive hydrocephalus. Potential advantages include avoiding or reducing duration of EVD placement and preventing ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Further large prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ETV with or without clot evacuation for IVH-related obstructive hydrocephalus.

Sarcoidosis and pregnancy: obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in a population-based cohort of 7 million births	JOURNAL OF PERINATAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Maternal outcomes; neonatal outcomes; postpartum complications; pregnancy; sarcoidosis	LUNG-DISEASES; ASTHMA; DEATH; WOMAN; NEUROSARCOIDOSIS	Objectives: Data on sarcoidosis in pregnancy is sparse and limited to a few case reports and series. Our aim is to determine the prevalence of sarcoidosis at delivery, and related maternal and newborn outcomes. Study design: Using the United States Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUPNIS) from 2003 to 2010, we conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study to compare women with and without sarcoidosis at delivery. We calculated the prevalence of sarcoidosis in pregnancy and used logistic regression analyses to estimate the associated risks of maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results: There were 678 cases of sarcoidosis in 7,094,400 births over an 8-year period for an overall prevalence of nine and six-tenths cases per 100,000 births. Compared with controls, women with sarcoidosis were older, more likely to be African American and to report being smokers. Women with sarcoidosis were more likely to have preeclampsia odds ratio (OR) 1.62 (95% CI 1.18-2.22), eclampsia OR 5.27 (95% CI 1.69-16.40), deep vein thrombosis OR 4.92 (95% CI 1.58-15.33), pulmonary embolism OR 6.68 (95% CI 3.99-11.21), and premature delivery OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.40-2.15). There was also an increased risk of cesarean deliveries and postpartum hemorrhages. There were no cases of maternal death reported. Conclusions: Sarcoidosis in pregnancy is a rare disease associated with an increased risk of adverse obstetrical outcomes. Women with sarcoidosis can carry out successful pregnancies, however should be made aware of the higher risk of adverse events. Given the higher risk of venous thromboembolic events, consideration should be given to thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy.

As such, mTOR has been implicated in an increasing number of pathological conditions, including cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes and neurodegeneration. As part of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR regulates cell growth by promoting the biosynthesis of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Several mTORC1 substrates have been shown to regulate protein synthesis, including the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs) and the ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) 1 and 2. In this work, we focus on the signalling pathways that lie both upstream and downstream of mTORC1, as well as their relevance to human pathologies. We further discuss pharmacological approaches that target mTOR and their applications for the treatment of cancer.

The Franco-Canadian multicolumn spinal cord stimulation prospective study: A subgroup analysis focusing on the decisive role of lead positioning	NEUROCHIRURGIE			English	Article						Low back pain; Chronic pain; Failed back surgery syndrome; Multicolumn spinal cord stimulation; Neuropathic pain	FAILED BACK SURGERY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; INTERNATIONAL MULTICENTER; RELIEF	Introduction. - Multicolumn spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is now considered to be effective for the treatment of the radicular and back component in refractory Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) patients. The relationship between the paresthesia coverage of the back and clinical outcomes has recently been confirmed by an international prospective study. However, significant disparities in outcomes were identified and could result from the heterogeneity of lead implantation parameters which are dependant on local practices and experience. We therefore sought to analyse the impact of lead implantation level and its lateralization on the ability to address back pain with multicolumn SCS leads. Study objectives, materials and methods. - The present study was a retrospective subgroup analysis from an observational, prospective non-randomized trial that included 76 patients with refractory FBSS, implanted with multicolumn SCS between 2008 to 2011 in three neurosurgical pain centres (Poitiers, France, Montreal, Canada and Regina, Canada). A subgroup of 21 patients with "optimized lead positioning" (OLP) was identified, distinguished from the rest of the main study population (NON OLP subgroup; n = 51) and submitted to specific data analysis. Baseline characteristics of both groups were strictly comparable. Our primary objective was to analyse the impact of lead positioning (vertebral level and lateralization) on the back paresthesia coverage. The secondary objectives were to compare the analgesic and functional efficacy of multicolumn stimulation in these OLP and NON OLP subgroups and to determine if a paresthesia coverage improvement leads to better clinical outcomes in these difficult-to-treat patients. Results. - In this subgroup analysis, unilateral coverage of the low back area was achieved in 85.0% of OLP patients vs. 76.5% in the NON OLP group. Bilateral and complete coverage of the low back area was achieved in 60% of OLP patients vs. 51% in the NON OLP group but these differences were not statistically significant. At 6 months, 81.0% of OLP patients vs. 69.4% in the NON OLP group presented at least 30% improvement of the low back VAS, while 52.4% of them achieved at least 50% improvement of the low back VAS vs. 38.8% in the NON OLP group. Functional improvement at 6 months, available and calculated only in the French group of OLP patients (n = 14) by the Oswestry Disability Index, was significant, decreasing from 60.67% to 33.43%. Conclusion. - Despite limitations in this retrospective subgroup analysis, this study suggests that the vertebral level (T8-T9) and midline positioning of the lead during implantation could be decisive factors to optimize paresthesia coverage and finally, clinical and functional outcomes. While sophistication has been responsible for an increase of the size and the programming possibilities of surgical SCS leads during the past years, multicolumn SCS lead implantation should in fact be considered as a "functional neurosurgical" procedure and could benefit from intraoperative patient cooperation, as in the case for deep brain stimulation procedures, due to minimally invasive implantation techniques.

However, the back pain component of FBSS has been recalcitrant. Recent clinical trials have suggested that multicolumn surgically implanted leads combined with enhanced programming capabilities in the newer implantable pulse generators demonstrate the ability to treat the back pain component of FBSS. The objective of our present international multicentre study is to prospectively evaluate these findings in a larger population. MethodsWe conducted a prospective, nonrandomized, observational study on 76 patients with refractory FBSS, consecutively implanted with multicolumn spinal cord stimulation (SCS) between 2008 and 2011 in three neurosurgical pain management centers (Poitiers, France; Montreal, Canada; and Regina, Canada). The primary objective of this study was to prospectively analyze the effect of multicolumn lead programming on paresthesia coverage for the back pain region in these patients. The secondary objective was to assess the analgesic efficacy of this technique on the global and back pain components. ResultsParesthesia could be induced in the lower extremities in the majority of patients with at least one of the configurations tested. Bilateral low back paresthesia was induced in 53.5% of patients, while unilateral low back paresthesia was induced in 78.9% of patients. Multicolumn configurations were statistically more effective than monocolumn configurations for all anatomic regions studied. At 6months, 75.4% of patients receiving multicolumn stimulation (n=57) obtained at least a 30% improvement of the back pain VAS score, while 42.1% of patients obtained at least a 50% improvement of the back pain VAS score. ConclusionThis study confirms the hypothesis that multicolumn SCS should be considered as an important tool in the treatment of radicular and axial pain in FBSS patients. The efficacy of this modality is based on a rigorous patient selection process, access to new generation lead technologies, but most importantly an algorithmic programming approach for optimal stimulation and electrical field shaping. With over 40 million potential programming combinations associated with 16 contact leads to achieve paresthesia coverage, optimal stimulation is often missed as either the patient or the clinician become exhausted or overwhelmed during the course of therapy programming and optimization session.

METHODS: This is an expert opinion based two-part review on pediatric post-traumatic headaches. Part I will focus on an overview and approach to the evaluation of post-traumatic headache. Part II will focus on the medical management of post-traumatic headache. Relevant articles were reviewed, and an algorithm is proposed. RESULTS: We review the epidemiology, classification, pathophysiology, and clinical approach to evaluating patients with post-traumatic headache. A comprehensive history and physical examination are fundamental to identifying the headache type(s). Identifying the precise headache phenotype is important to help guide treatment. Most of the post-traumatic headaches are migraine or tension type, but occipital neuralgia, cervicogenic headache, and medication overuse headache also occur. Postconcussive signs often resolve within 1 month, and individuals whose signs persist longer may benefit from an interprofessional approach. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous evaluation and diagnosis are vital to treating post-traumatic headaches effectively. A multifaceted approach is needed to address all the possible contributing factors to the headaches and any comorbid conditions that may delay recovery or alter treatment choices.

METHODS: This is an expert opinion-based two-part review on pediatric post-traumatic headaches. In part II, we focus on the medical management of post-traumatic headaches. There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of therapies specifically for pediatric post-traumatic headaches. Thus, the algorithm we propose has been extrapolated from the primary headache literature and small noncontrolled trials of post-traumatic headache. RESULTS: Most post-traumatic headaches are migraine or tension type, and standard medications for these headache types are used. A multifaceted approach is needed to address all the possible causes of headache and any comorbid conditions that may delay recovery or alter treatment choices. For acute treatment, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories can be used. If the headaches have migrainous features and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are not effective, triptans may be beneficial. Opioids are not indicated. Medication overuse should be avoided. For preventive treatments, some reports indicate that amitriptyline, gabapentin, or topiramate may be beneficial. Amitriptyline is a good choice because it can be used to treat both migraine and tension-type headaches. Nerve blocks, nutraceuticals (e.g. melatonin), and behavioral therapies may also be useful, and lifestyle factors, especially adequate sleep hygiene and strategies to cope with anxiety, should be emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: Improved treatment of acute post-traumatic headache may reduce the likelihood of developing chronic headaches, which can be especially problematic to effectively manage and can be functionally debilitating.

Design: The associational breadth task was applied in both a priming condition, where cue words were signaled to be memorized prior to sleep (primed), and a nonpriming condition, where cue words were not memorized (nonprimed). Cue words were either emotional (positive, negative) or nonemotional. Participants were randomly assigned to either an awake (WAKE) or a sleep condition, which was subsequently split into NREM or REM groups depending on stage at awakening. Setting: Hospital-based sleep laboratory. Participants: Fifty-eight healthy participants (22 male) ages 18 to 35 y (mean age = 23.3 +/- 4.08 y). Measurements and Results: The REM group scored higher than the NREM or WAKE groups on primed, but not nonprimed emotional cue words; the effect was stronger for positive than for negative cue words. However, REM time and percent correlated negatively with degree of emotional priming. Priming occurred for REM awakenings but not for NREM awakenings, even when the latter sleep episodes contained some REM sleep. Conclusions: Associational breadth may be selectively consolidated during REM sleep for stimuli that have been tagged as important for future memory retrieval. That priming decreased with REM time and was higher only for REM sleep awakenings is consistent with two explanatory REM sleep processes: REM sleep consolidation serving emotional downregulation and REM sleep inertia.

Design: Three consecutive full-night polysomnography recordings were made in the laboratory. After the habituation night, a random order for night ON-stim and OFF-stim was applied for the second and third nights. Setting: Sleep disorders unit of a university hospital. Patients: Eleven patients with bilateral stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) for drug-resistant tremor. Measurements: Sleep measures on polysomnography. Results: Total sleep time was reduced during night ON-stim compared to OFF-stim, as well as rapid eye movement sleep percentage while the percentage of N2 increased. Wakefulness after sleep onset time was increased. Conclusion: Our results show that bilateral stimulation of the VIM nuclei reduces sleep and could be associated with insomnia.

However, the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) may be increased if both procedures are performed simultaneously. Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of 41 consecutive patients who underwent both procedures simultaneously in our institution between March 2000 and January 2008. Results: Analysis revealed no difference in SSI rate between patients undergoing both procedures simultaneously and in staged procedures. Conclusions: VP shunting and tracheotomy procedures could be performed simultaneously without increasing the risk of surgical site infection. Such strategy may shorten the length of stay in critical care units. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Eighty-two schizophrenia-spectrum (DSM-IV criteria) outpatients were recruited. Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated with the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, while spatial working, planning abilities and visual paired associates learning were evaluated with the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery. The Stroop test was also administered. Multivariate hierarchic linear regression analyses were performed. We found that negative symptoms were associated with cognitive flexibility, planning, visual learning and working memory performance in schizophrenia. Age, sex, number of hospitalizations and antipsychotic type also emerged as significant predictors. More importantly, we found a significant association between antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism and working memory performance. The fact that negative symptoms and socio-demographic variables predicted cognitive performance in schizophrenia is consistent with the previous literature on the topic. The finding of an association between parkinsonism and working memory may have clinical implications, since working memory deficits are considered putative endophenotypes of schizophrenia and are known to impair patients' social and occupational functioning. Our results will need to be replicated in longitudinal studies involving larger samples of patients.

J	Martel, S				Martel, Sylvain			Learning from our failures in blood-brain permeability: what can be done for new drug discovery?	EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DISCOVERY			English	Editorial Material						blood-brain barrier; carrier-mediated transport; hyperthermia; nanotechnology; navigable agents; receptor-mediated transport	BARRIER; TRANSPORT	Many existing pharmaceuticals are rendered ineffective in the treatment of cerebral diseases due to a permeability barrier well known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Such barrier between the blood within brain capillaries and the extracellular fluid in brain tissue has motivated several approaches aimed at delivering therapeutics to the brain. These approaches rely on strategies that can be classified as molecular modifications, the use of BBB bypassing pathways, and BBB disruptions. Although several of these approaches that have been investigated so far show promising results, none has addressed the optimization of the ratio of the dose of the drug molecules that contributes to the therapeutic effects. As such, the extensive research efforts, such as prioritizing the enhancement of the BBB permeability alone is likely to fail to provide the best therapeutic effects for a given dose if prior systemic circulation is not avoided while enhancing the spatial targeting only to regions of the brain that need treatment. Hence, new therapeutics for the brain could be synthesized to take advantage of recent technologies for non-systemic delivery and spatially targeted brain uptake.

Deleterious mutations in the essential mRNA metabolism factor, hGle1, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							EXPORT MEDIATOR; GLE1; DISEASE; COMPLEX; SEQUENCE	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective death of motor neurons. Causative mutations in the global RNA-processing proteins TDP-43 and FUS among others, as well as their aggregation in ALS patients, have identified defects in RNA metabolism as an important feature in this disease. Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 and lethal arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease are autosomal recessive fetal motor neuron diseases that are caused by mutations in another global RNA-processing protein, hGle1. In this study, we carried out the first screening of GLE1 in ALS patients (173 familial and 760 sporadic) and identified 2 deleterious mutations (1 splice site and 1 nonsense mutation) and 1 missense mutation. Functional analysis of the deleterious mutants revealed them to be unable to rescue motor neuron pathology in zebrafish morphants lacking Gle1. Furthermore, in HeLa cells, both mutations caused a depletion of hGle1 at the nuclear pore where it carries out an essential role in nuclear export of mRNA. These results suggest a haploinsufficiency mechanism and point to a causative role for GLE1 mutations in ALS patients. This further supports the involvement of global defects in RNA metabolism in ALS.

In PD research and its surgical treatment, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), anatomical structural identification and references for spatial normalization are essential, and human brain atlases/templates are proven highly instrumental. However, two shortcomings affect current templates used for PD. First, many templates are derived from a single healthy subject that is not sufficiently representative of the PD-population anatomy. This may result in suboptimal surgical plans for DBS surgery and biased analysis for morphological studies. Second, commonly used mono-contrast templates lack sufficient image contrast for some subcortical structures (i.e., subthalamic nucleus) and biochemical information (i.e., iron content), a valuable feature in current PD research. We employed a novel T1-T2* fusion MRI that visualizes both cortical and subcortical structures to drive groupwise registration to create co-registered multi-contrast (T1w, T2*w, T1-T2* fusion, phase, and an R2* map) unbiased templates from 15 PD patients, and a high-resolution histology-derived 3D atlas is co-registered. For validation, these templates are compared against the Colin27 template for landmark registration and midbrain nuclei segmentation. While the T1w, T2*w, and T1-T2* fusion templates provide excellent anatomical details for both cortical and subcortical structures, the phase and R2* map contain the biochemical features. By one-way ANOVA tests, our templates significantly () outperform the Colin27 template in the registration-based tasks. The proposed unbiased templates are more representative of the population of interest and can benefit both the surgical planning and research of PD.

Pain is therefore a critical component of proper management of burns. Although the importance of pain is well recognized, it is often undertreated. Acute uncontrolled pain has been shown to increase the incidence of mental health disorders and increase the incidence of suicide after discharge. Long-term poor pain control leads to an increase in the incidence of persistent pain. Most burn centers have used opioids as the mainstay analgesic, but recently, the significant side effects of opioids have led to the implementation of new and combined therapeutics. Pharmacological agents such as gabapentin, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine have all been suggested as adjuncts to opioids in the treatment of burn pain. Nonpharmacological therapies such as hypnosis, virtual reality devices, and behavioral therapy are also essential adjuncts to current medications. This review aims at identifying the currently available pharmacological and nonpharmacological options for optimal pain management in the adult burn population.

Dual [C-11]yohimbine dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) recordings were applied to five Sprague Dawley rats at baseline, followed by acute amphetamine administration (2 mg/kg) to induce elevation of the endogenous level of noradrenaline. The volume of distribution (V-T) of [C-11]yohimbine was obtained using Logan plot with arterial plasma input. Because alpha-2 adrenoceptors are distributed throughout the brain, the estimation of the BPND is complicated by the absence of an anatomic region of no displaceable binding. We used the Inhibition plot to acquire the reference volume, V-ND, from which we calculated the BPND. Acute pharmacological challenge with amphetamine induced a significant decline of [C-11]yohimbine BPND of similar to 38% in all. volumes of interest. The BPND was greatest in the thalamus and striatum, followed in descending order by, frontal cortex, pons, and cerebellum. The experimental data demonstrate that [C-11]yohimbine binding is sensitive to a challenge known to increase the extracellular level of noradrenaline, which can benefit future PET investigations of pathologic conditions related to disrupted noradrenergic neurotransmission.

It encompasses structural alterations in the vessel wall, degenerating capillaries (string vessels), vascular fibrosis and calcification, features recapitulated in transgenic mice that overexpress transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF mice). We recently found that simvastatin rescued A beta-mediated cerebrovascular and cognitive deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD. However, whether simvastatin can counteract A beta-independent deficits remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the effects of simvastatin in aged TGF mice on cerebrovascular reactivity and structure, and on cognitive performance. Simvastatin restored baseline levels of nitric oxide (NO), NO-, and K-ATP channel-mediated dilations and endothelin-1-induced contractions. Simvastatin significantly reduced vasculopathy with arteriogenic remodeling and string vessel pathology in TGF mice. In contrast, simvastatin did not lessen gliosis, and the cerebrovascular levels of pro-fibrotic proteins and calcification markers remained elevated after treatment. The TGF mice displayed subtle cognitive decline that was not affected by simvastatin. Our results Show potent benefits of simvastatin on endothelial- and smooth muscle cell-Mediated vasomotor responses, endothelial NO synthesis and in preserving; capillary integrity. We conclude that simvastatin could be indicated in the treatment of cerebrovascular dysfunction associated with VaD and AD.

Van Gogh-like protein 2 (Vangl2) is central in the PCP pathway; in mice, Vangl2 loss is embryonically lethal because of neural tube defects, and mutations in Vangl2 are associated with human neural tube defects. In the kidney, PCP signaling may be important for tubular nnorphogenesis and organization of glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) along the glomerular basement membrane. Podocyte cell protrusions (foot processes) are critical for glomerular permselectivity; loss of foot process architecture results in proteinuria and FSGS. Previously, we showed a profound effect of PCP signaling on podocyte shape, actin rearrangement, cell motility, and nephrin endocytosis. To test our hypothesis that the PCP pathway is involved in glomerular development and function and circumvent lethality of the ubiquitous Vangl2 mutation in the Looptail mouse, we generated a mouse model with a podocyte-specific ablation of the Vangl2 gene. We report here that podocyte-specific deletion of Vangl2 leads-to glomerular maturation defects in fetal kidneys. In adult mice, we detected significantly smaller glomeruli, but it did not affect glomerular permselectivity in aging animals. However, in the context of glomerular injury induced by injection of antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, deletion of Vangl2 resulted in exacerbation of injury and accelerated progression to chronic segmental and global glomerular sclerosis. Our results indicate that Vangl2 function in podocytes is important for glomerular development and protects against glomerular injury in adult animals.

Emergence of Virtual Reality as a Tool for Upper Limb Rehabilitation: Incorporation of Motor Control and Motor Learning Principles	PHYSICAL THERAPY			English	Article							UPPER EXTREMITY HEMIPARESIS; RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL; CEREBRAL-PALSY; COGNITIVE REHABILITATION; STROKE REHABILITATION; POINTING MOVEMENTS; SENSORY CORTEX; ARM RECOVERY; BRAIN-INJURY; ENVIRONMENT	The primary focus of rehabilitation for individuals with loss of upper limb movement as a result of acquired brain injury is the relearning of specific motor skills and daily tasks. This relearning is essential because the loss of upper limb movement often. results in a reduced quality of life. Although rehabilitation strives to take advantage of neuroplastic processes during recovery, results of traditional approaches to upper limb rehabilitation have not entirely met this goal. In contrast, enriched training tasks, simulated with a wide range of low- to high-end virtual reality-based simulations, can be used to provide meaningful, repetitive practice together with salient feedback, thereby maximizing neuroplastic processes via motor learning and motor recovery. Such enriched virtual environments have the potential to optimize motor learning by manipulating practice conditions that explicitly engage motivational, cognitive, motor control, and sensory feedback-based learning mechanisms. The objectives of this article are to review motor control and motor learning principles, to discuss how they can be exploited by virtual reality training environments, and to provide evidence concerning current applications for upper limb motor recovery. The limitations of the current technologies with respect to their effectiveness and transfer of learning to daily life tasks also are discussed.

Although the relation between the pelvic asymmetries and scoliosis progression was proposed by several authors, it has not been documented over time in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). PURPOSE: The objective was to determine whether vertebral wedging and pelvic asymmetries progress in the early stages of AIS before any orthopedic treatment. STUDY DESIGN: The study design included an observational cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Nineteen AIS girls participated in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were pelvic and spine geometries from simultaneous biplanar radiographs. METHODS: At the diagnosis, the girls (12.6 +/- 1.3 years) had a Cobb angle of 13.9 degrees +/- 6.0 degrees. At the end of their observation period (11 months on average), the scoliosis progressed to 20.5 degrees +/- 5.5 degrees. Bone 3D geometry was reconstructed from biplanar radiographs. Sagittal and frontal wedgings were calculated for five vertebral levels, namely, at the apex and at the two vertebral bodies above and below it. The pelvic geometry was described using five 3D homologous right-left lengths to estimate pelvic asymmetries. Paired t tests were performed on vertebral wedging and pelvic asymmetries to assess their progression between the two evaluations. Principal component (PC) analyses were applied to determine whether vertebral wedging or pelvic asymmetries were predominant at each evaluation. RESULTS: Vertebral wedging was present at the diagnosis (1.76 degrees-5.92 degrees) and generally did not progress until brace prescription. The mean difference between the right and left pelvic normalized lengths was 1.4% and 2.4% for the initial and final evaluations, respectively. Results revealed the width of the right pelvis to be superior by 3%, and this asymmetry progressed to 4.0%. Principal component analysis revealed that initial vertebral wedgingwas present in seven out of eight parameters of the first three PCs, whereas at the final examination, vertebral wedging and pelvic asymmetries were evenly present. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the presence of vertebral wedging at the early stages of scoliosis. This is the first to document the association between spinal and pelvic deformities over time. Pelvic asymmetries could be responsible for trunkmuscle imbalances and lead to reduced neuromuscular control reported in AIS patients. These results could influence body brace fitting.

However, no studies have directly compared the outcomes of switching to either of these agents. MethodsUsing MSBase, a large international, observational, prospectively acquired cohort study, we identified patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis experiencing relapses or disability progression within the 6 months immediately preceding switch to either natalizumab or fingolimod. Quasi-randomization with propensity score-based matching was used to select subpopulations with comparable baseline characteristics. Relapse and disability outcomes were compared in paired, pairwise-censored analyses. ResultsOf the 792 included patients, 578 patients were matched (natalizumab, n=407; fingolimod, n=171). Mean on-study follow-up was 12 months. The annualized relapse rates decreased from 1.5 to 0.2 on natalizumab and from 1.3 to 0.4 on fingolimod, with 50% relative postswitch difference in relapse hazard (p=0.002). A 2.8 times higher rate of sustained disability regression was observed after the switch to natalizumab in comparison to fingolimod (p<0.001). No difference in the rate of sustained disability progression events was observed between the groups. The change in overall disability burden (quantified as area under the disability-time curve) differed between natalizumab and fingolimod (-0.12 vs 0.04 per year, respectively, p<0.001). InterpretationThis study suggests that in active multiple sclerosis during treatment with injectable disease-modifying therapies, switching to natalizumab is more effective than switching to fingolimod in reducing relapse rate and short-term disability burden.

Prediction solely based on the hippocampus may be hampered by widespread mesiotemporal structural damage shown by advanced imaging. Increasingly complex and high-dimensional representation of MRI metrics motivates a shift to machine learning to establish objective, data-driven criteria for pathogenic processes and prognosis. MethodsWe applied clustering to 114 consecutive unilateral TLE patients using 1.5T MRI profiles derived from surface morphology of hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. To evaluate the diagnostic validity of the classification, we assessed its yield to predict outcome in 79 surgically treated patients. Reproducibility of outcome prediction was assessed in an independent cohort of 27 patients evaluated on 3.0T MRI. ResultsFour similarly sized classes partitioned our cohort; in all, alterations spanned over the 3 mesiotemporal structures. Compared to 46 controls, TLE-I showed marked bilateral atrophy; in TLE-II atrophy was ipsilateral; TLE-III showed mild bilateral atrophy; whereas TLE-IV showed hypertrophy. Classes differed with regard to histopathology and freedom from seizures. Classwise surface-based classifiers accurately predicted outcome in 921% of patients, outperforming conventional volumetry. Predictors of relapse were distributed bilaterally across structures. Prediction accuracy was similarly high in the independent cohort (96%), supporting generalizability. InterpretationWe provide a novel description of individual variability across the TLE spectrum. Class membership was associated with distinct patterns of damage and outcome predictors that did not spatially overlap, emphasizing the ability of machine learning to disentangle the differential contribution of morphology to patient phenotypes, ultimately refining the prognosis of epilepsy surgery.

Lipid-Specific Immunoglobulin M Bands in Cerebrospinal Fluid Are Associated with a Reduced Risk of Developing Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy during Treatment with Natalizumab	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; JC VIRUS; OLIGOCLONAL IGM; BIOMARKER; PREDICTS; CD4(+); PML	ObjectiveProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a serious side effect associated with natalizumab treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS). PML risk increases in individuals seropositive for anti-John Cunningham virus (JC) antibodies, with prolonged duration of natalizumab treatment, and with prior exposure to immunosuppressants. We explored whether the presence of lipid-specific immunoglobulin M oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; IgM bands), a recognized marker of highly inflammatory MS, may identify individuals better able to counteract the potential immunosuppressive effect of natalizumab and hence be associated with a reduced risk of developing PML. MethodsWe studied 24 MS patients who developed PML and another 343 who did not suffer this opportunistic infection during natalizumab treatment. Patients were recruited at 25 university hospitals. IgM bands were studied by isoelectric focusing and immunodetection. CSF lymphocyte counts were explored in 151 MS patients recruited at Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid, Spain. ResultsIgM bands were independently associated with decreased PML risk (odds ratio [OR]=45.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.9-339.3, p<0.0001) in patients treated with natalizumab. They were also associated with significantly higher CSF CD4, CD8, and B-cell numbers. Patients positive for IgM bands and anti-JC antibodies had similar levels of reduced PML risk to those who were anti-JC negative (OR=1.55, 95% CI=0.09-25.2, p=1.0). Higher risk was observed in patients positive for anti-JC antibodies and negative for IgM bands (19% of the total cohort, OR=59.71, 95% CI=13.6-262.2). InterpretationThe presence of IgM bands reflects a process that may diminish the risk of PML by counteracting the excess of immunosuppression that may occur during natalizumab therapy.

Experimental evidence suggests that low-voltage fast-onset seizures mainly result from the synchronous activity of -aminobutyric acid-releasing cells. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using the optogenetic control of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the entorhinal cortex, in the in vitro 4-aminopyridine model. We found that both spontaneous and optogenetically induced seizures had similar low-voltage fast-onset patterns. In addition, both types of seizures presented with higher ripple than fast ripple rates. Our data demonstrate the involvement of interneuronal networks in the initiation of low-voltage fast-onset seizures.

Data were obtained on children born between 1999 and 2008 from the Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry (REPACQ). Out of 535 children with cerebral palsy, 297 were identified to have communication impairments (55.5%). Of these, 96 were unable to communicate verbally (32.3%), 195 had some verbal communication (65.7%), and 6 were unspecified (2.0%). These children were significantly more likely to have a more severe motor deficit (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels IV and V and Manual Ability Classification System levels IV and V), to have spastic quadriplegia or dyskinetic subtypes of cerebral palsy, and gray matter injury on neuroimaging. Communication impairment is a common comorbidity in cerebral palsy and is associated with a more severe motor deficit, spastic quadriplegic or dyskinetic subtype of cerebral palsy, and gray matter injury on neuroimaging. This information allows clinicians to better predict and manage communication impairment in children with cerebral palsy.

Methods and results Blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysis showed an almost complete lack of COX assembly in subject fibroblasts, consistent with the very low enzymatic activity, and pulse-labelling mitochondrial translation experiments showed a specific decrease in synthesis of the COX1 subunit, the core catalytic subunit that nucleates assembly of the holoenzyme. Whole exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations (c. 199dupC, c. 215A>G) in COA3, a small inner membrane COX assembly factor, resulting in a pronounced decrease in the steady-state levels of COA3 protein. Retroviral expression of a wild-type COA3 cDNA completely rescued the COX assembly and mitochondrial translation defects, confirming the pathogenicity of the mutations, and resulted in increased steady-state levels of COX1 in control cells, demonstrating a role for COA3 in the stabilisation of this subunit. COA3 exists in an early COX assembly complex that contains COX1 and other COX assembly factors including COX14 (C12orf62), another single pass transmembrane protein that also plays a role in coupling COX1 synthesis with holoenzyme assembly. Immunoblot analysis showed that COX14 was undetectable in COA3 subject fibroblasts, and that COA3 was undetectable in fibroblasts from a COX14 subject, demonstrating the interdependence of these two COX assembly factors. Conclusions The mild clinical course in this patient contrasts with nearly all other cases of severe COX assembly defects that are usually fatal early in life, and underscores the marked tissue-specific involvement in mitochondrial diseases.

Early visual deprivation changes cortical anatomical covariance in dorsal-stream structures	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Blindness; Cortical Thickness; Covariation; Auditory	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MRI DATA; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; STRUCTURE PREDICTS; HUMAN BRAIN; EYE FIELDS; THICKNESS	Early blind individuals possess thicker occipital cortex compared to sighted ones. Occipital cortical thickness is also predictive of performance on several auditory discrimination tasks in the blind, which suggests that it can serve as a neuroanatomical marker of auditory behavioural abilities. In light of this atypical relationship between occipital thickness and auditory function, we sought to investigate here the covariation of occipital cortical morphology in occipital areas with that of all other areas across the cortical surface, to assess whether the anatomical covariance with the occipital cortex differs between early blind and sighted individuals. We observed a reduction in anatomical covariance between the right occipital cortex and several areas of the visual dorsal stream in a group of early blind individuals relative to sighted controls. In a separate analysis, we show that the performance of the early blind in a transposed melody discrimination task was strongly predicted by the strength of the cortical covariance between the occipital cortex and intraparietal sulcus, a region for which cortical thickness in the sighted was previously shown to predict performance in the same task. These findings therefore constitute the first evidence linking altered anatomical covariance to early sensory deprivation. Moreover, since covariation of cortical morphology could potentially be related to anatomical connectivity or driven by experience-dependent plasticity, it could consequently help guide future functional connectivity and diffusion tractography studies.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission and stress corticosteroids (cortisol in human) are critical for Ca2+ mediated neuroplasticity and behavioral adaptation. The mechanisms of action of glutamatergic neurotransmission and stress corticosteroids on the NMDA-receptors of the hippocampus have been long investigated in animals, but given little attention in human studies. In this randomized single-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study (12 healthy young men), five sets of resting-state fMRI (RSFMRI), pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL), and corresponding salivary cortisol samples were acquired over 4 h, at given intervals under pharmacokinetically-controlled infusion of subanesthetic ketamine (20 & 40 mg/70 kg/h). An identical procedure was repeated under a sham placebo condition. Differences in the profile of ketamine versus placebo effect over time were examined. Compared to placebo, ketamine mimicked a stress-like response (increased cortisol, reduced calmness and alertness, and impaired working memory). Ketamine effects on the brain included a transient prefrontal hyperperfusion and a dose-related reduction of relative hippocampal perfusion, plus emerging hyperconnectivity between the hippocampus and the occipital, cingulate, precuneal, cerebellar and basal ganglia regions. The spatiotemporal profiles of ketamine effects on different hippocampal subnetworks suggest a topographically dissociable change in corticohippocampal functional connectivity. We discuss our findings in the context of the negative feedback inhibition theory of the hippocampal stress-control. This pilot study provides a methodological framework for multimodal functional neuroimaging under resting-state conditions, which may be generalized for translational studies of glutamatergic- or stress-related etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

However, the respective functional roles of the hippocampus and the striatum in these processes remain unknown. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in a daytime sleep/wake protocol to investigate this knowledge gap. Using a protocol developed earlier in our lab (Albouy et al., 2013a), the manipulation of an explicit sequential finger-tapping task, allowed us to isolate allocentric (spatial) and egocentric (motor) representations of the sequence, which were supported by distinct hippocampo- and striato-cortical networks, respectively. Importantly, a sleep-dependent performance enhancement emerged for the hippocampal-dependent memory trace, whereas performance was maintained for the striatal-dependent memory trace, irrespective of the sleep condition. Regression analyses indicated that the interaction between these two systems influenced subsequent performance improvements. While striatal activity was negatively correlated with performance enhancement after both sleep and wakefulness in the allocentric representation, hippocampal activity was positively related to performance improvement for the egocentric representation, but only if sleep was allowed after training. Our results provide the first direct evidence of a functional dissociation in consolidation processes whereby memory stabilization seems supported by the striatum in a time-dependent manner whereas memory enhancement seems linked to hippocampal activity and sleep-dependent processes.

Crossmodal encoding of motor sequence memories	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							PITCH HEIGHT; MUSIC; REACTIVATION; PIANISTS; IMAGERY; STROKE; BRAIN	In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to specific auditory sequences could lead to the crossmodal induction of new motor memories. Twenty young, healthy participants memorized a melody without moving. Each tone in the memorized melody had previously been associated with a particular finger movement. For ten of the participants, the contour of the melody memorized was congruent to a subsequently performed, but never practiced, finger movement sequence (C group, n = 10). For the other ten participants, the melody memorized was incongruent to the subsequent finger movement sequence (InC group, n = 10). Results showed faster performance of the movement sequence in the C group than in the InC group. This difference in motor performance was most pronounced 6 h after melody learning and then dissipated over 30 days. These results provide evidence of a specific, crossmodal encoding of a movement sequence representation through an auditory sequence with the effect on motor performance lasting for several hours. The findings of this study are significant, as the formation of new motor memories through exposure to auditory stimuli may be useful in rehabilitation settings where the initial encoding of motor memories through physical training is disrupted.

We examined the relationship between SAA changes, the presence or absence of a mild neurocognitive disorder, age and anticholinergic medication over a one-year time period. Methods: SAA at baseline and one-year follow-up was measured for 121 older adults without dementia. Participants were classified at both timepoints as being cognitively intact or meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for a mild neurocognitive disorder. Medications were assessed according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale. Results: SAA changes did not discriminate between individuals whose cognition remained stable versus those with improvement or decline (H[3] = 0.725, p = 0.867). SAA change did not vary between age groups, and could not reliably differentiate between individuals on ACB medication or not. Conclusion: While SAA does not appear to be a valid biomarker for cognitive decline, longitudinal studies with a larger sample size and longer duration are required to confirm this finding.

In a subset analysis of patients with advanced nonesmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal impairment in a phase III trial of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (nab-P/C) versus solvent-based paclitaxel plus carboplatin, nab-P/C was well tolerated and offered a feasible treatment option for patients with renal impairment and advanced NSCLC. Introduction: Renal impairment in cancer patients can affect treatment tolerability and outcomes. This analysis evaluated the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) versus solvent-based paclitaxel (sb-P), both in combination with carboplatin (C), in patients with advanced nonesmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal impairment. Methods: Untreated patients with stage IIIB/IV disease with NSCLC and a performance status of 0/1 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 100 mg/m(2) nab-P weekly plus C (under the curve = 6, every 3 weeks) or 200 mg/m(2) sb-P plus C (under the curve = 6) every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate. Results: Of 1038 treated patients in the phase III trial, 38% had mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance > 50 to <= 80 mL/min; n = 198 for nab-P/C and n = 206 for sb-P/C) and 5% had moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance <= 50 mL/min: n = 26 for nab-P/C and n = 27 for sb-P/C). For nab-P/C versus sb-P/C, the treatment difference in efficacy in patients with either level of renal impairment was comparable to the overall population but did not reach statistical significance, with an overall response rate of 35% versus 27% (response rate ratio, 1.324; P = .060) in patients with mild renal impairment, and 31% versus 19% (response rate ratio, 1.662; P = .300) in patients with moderate renal impairment. Overall survival and progression-free survival were nonsignificantly longer for nab-P/C versus sb-P/C in these subsets. Patients with renal impairment experienced less grade 3 or higher neutropenia and sensory neuropathy, but more thrombocytopenia and anemia with nab-P/C versus sb-P/C. Conclusion: nab-P/C proved beneficial and tolerable in patients with advanced NSCLC and mild and moderate renal impairment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The contribution of this study is to investigate whether or not the duration prediction accuracy obtained with a multilayer feedforward neural network model, also called a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and with a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model is statistically better than that obtained by a multiple linear regression (MLR) model when functional size and the maximum size of the team of developers are used as the independent variables. The three models mentioned above are trained and tested by predicting the duration of new software development projects with a'set of projects from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) release 11. Results based on absolute residuals, Pred(I) and a Friedman statistical test show that prediction accuracy with the MLP and the RBFNN is statistically better than with the MLR model.

We aimed to measure GABA content in primary motor cortex poststroke (using GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]) and in relation to motor recovery during 2 weeks of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). Methods. Twenty-one patients (3-12 months poststroke) and 20 healthy subjects were recruited. Magnetic resonance imaging structural T1 and GABA-edited MRS were performed at baseline and after CIMT, and once in healthy subjects. GABA:creatine (GABA:Cr) ratio was measured by GABA-edited MRS. Motor function was measured using Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Results. Baseline comparison between stroke patients (n = 19) and healthy subjects showed a significantly lower GABA:Cr ratio in stroke patients (P < .001) even after correcting for gray matter content in the voxel (P < .01) and when expressing GABA relative to N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA; P = .03). After 2 weeks of CIMT patients improved significantly on WMFT, but no consistent change across the group was observed for the GABA:Cr ratio (n = 17). However, the extent of improvement on WMFT correlated significantly with the magnitude of GABA:Cr changes (P < .01), with decreases in GABA:Cr ratio being associated with better improvements in motor function. Conclusions. In patients 3 to 12 months poststroke, GABA levels are lower in the primary motor cortex than in healthy subjects. The observed association between GABA and recovery warrants further studies on the potential use of GABA MRS as a biomarker in poststroke recovery.

Full field spatially-variant image-based resolution modelling reconstruction for the HRRT	PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Resolution modelling; High resolution research tomograph; Spatially variant PSF	SYSTEM MATRIX; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; PET RECONSTRUCTION; SPACE; IMPACT	Accurate characterisation of the scanner's point spread function across the entire field of view (FOV) is crucial in order to account for spatially dependent factors that degrade the resolution of the reconstructed images. The HRRT users' community resolution modelling reconstruction software includes a shift-invariant resolution kernel, which leads to transaxially non-uniform resolution in the reconstructed images. Unlike previous work to date in this field, this work is the first to model the spatially variant resolution across the entire FOV of the HRRT, which is the highest resolution human brain PET scanner in the world. In this paper we developed a spatially variant image-based resolution modelling reconstruction dedicated to the HRRT, using an experimentally measured shift-variant resolution kernel. Previously, the system response was measured and characterised in detail across the entire FOV of the HRRT, using a printed point source array. The newly developed resolution modelling reconstruction was applied on measured phantom, as well as clinical data and was compared against the HRRT users' community resolution modelling reconstruction, which is currently in use. Results demonstrated improvements both in contrast and resolution recovery, particularly for regions close to the edges of the FOV, with almost uniform resolution recovery across the entire transverse FOV. In addition, because the newly measured resolution kernel is slightly broader with wider tails, compared to the deliberately conservative kernel employed in the HRRT users' community software, the reconstructed images appear to have not only improved contrast recovery (up to 20% for small regions), but also better noise characteristics.

The Role of Human Brain Area hMT plus in the Perception of Global Motion Investigated With Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Color vision; Motion discrimination; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; V1; V5; cTBS	THETA-BURST STIMULATION; CHROMATIC MOTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; ISOLUMINANT GRATINGS; DETECTION MECHANISMS; MOTOR CORTEX; M-CONE; CONTRAST; V1; COLOR	Background: Psychophysical evidence suggests that the perception of the motion and color of moving stimuli are determined separately in the human brain. Here we aim to determine the role of visual cortical areas hMT+ and V1/V2 in each task by measuring the effect of rTMS of each area using an off-line continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol. Methods: In the motion task, the direction of moving dots was identified using a global motion stimulus that avoids tracking, and in the detection task for the same stimulus, the presence of the dots was detected regardless of motion. Performance was measured using forced-choice methods in 8 subjects, both before and at 4 time-intervals in the 1-hour after brain stimulation. All experiments were done using achromatic and isoluminant, red-green chromatic stimuli. Results: Performance on global motion for both achromatic and chromatic stimuli was significantly impaired following cTBS of visual area hMT+, with a maximum effect occurring 11 min after stimulation. In comparison, there was no effect of cTBS on the motion task for areas V1/V2 or the vertex (control). cTBS did not affect the detection task in either area. Conclusions: Our experiments validate the use of cTBS as an advantageous off-line rTMS protocol for studying visual areas. The results indicate a causal link between neural activity in area hMT+ and perception of motion of isoluminant chromatic stimuli. We conclude that area hMT+ is part of a common pathway processing the global motion of chromatic and achromatic stimuli, but is not involved in their detection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Cognitive inhibition in older high-lethality suicide attempters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						suicidal behavior; Stroop; neuropsychology; cognitive control; mood disorders	LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION; PRIMARY-CARE PATIENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; STROOP TASK; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MEDICAL ILLNESS	BackgroundPeople who attempt suicide often display cognitive impairments, particularly poor cognitive control. Could poor cognitive control contribute to high suicide rates in old age? A component of cognitive control, cognitive inhibitionactive suppression of task-irrelevant processingis very sensitive to aging and has been linked to attempted suicide. We investigated cognitive inhibition in older high-lethality suicide attempters, closely resembling suicide victims, as well as low-lethality attempters, and control groups with and without depression and suicidal ideation. MethodsA total of 102 participants aged 60years and older (17 psychiatrically healthy control subjects, 38 depressed control subjects, 16 suicide ideators, 14 low-lethality suicide attempters, and 17 high-lethality suicide attempters) underwent comprehensive clinical and cognitive assessments. They completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference Test, a validated modification of the Stroop test. ResultsHigh-lethality suicide attempters demonstrated a distinct pattern of cognitive inhibition deficits. Compared with psychiatrically healthy control subjects and suicide ideators, high-lethality attempters took longer to complete inhibition trials, even after accounting for potential confounding factors (age, education, Mini mental state examination score, information processing speed, and accuracy). Compared with non-suicidal depressed and healthy control subjects, low-lethality suicide attempters committed more uncorrected errors; however, this difference was not specific to the inhibition condition. ConclusionsOlder suicide attempters are a cognitively heterogeneous group. Poor cognitive control in high-lethality attempters may undermine their ability to solve real-life problems, precipitating a catastrophic accumulation of stressors. Meanwhile, low-lethality attempters' poor performance may reflect a careless approach to the task or faulty monitoring. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study was designed to detect a 43% increase in median survival time (MST) from 40.5 to 57.9 months and a 20% improvement in 3-year overall survival (OS) rate from 54% to 65% at a 10% significance level (1-sided) and 96% power. Methods and Materials: Patients with LGGs with 3 or more risk factors for recurrence (age >= 40 years, astrocytoma histology, bihemispherical tumor, preoperative tumor diameter of >= 6 cm, or a preoperative neurological function status of > 1) were treated with RT (54 Gy in 30 fractions) and concurrent and adjuvant TMZ. Results: From 2005 to 2009, 129 evaluable patients (75 males and 54 females) were accrued. Median age was 49 years; 91% had a Zubrod score of 0 or 1; and 69%, 25%, and 6% of patients had 3, 4, and 5 risk factors, respectively. Patients had median and minimum follow-up examinations of 4.1 years and 3 years, respectively. The 3-year OS rate was 73.1% (95% confidence interval: 65.3%-80.8%), which was significantly improved compared to that of prespecified historical control values (P<.001). Median survival time has not yet been reached. Three-year progression-free survival was 59.2%. Grades 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 43% and 10% of patients, respectively. One patient died of herpes encephalitis. Conclusions: The 3-year OS rate of 73.1% for RTOG 0424 high-risk LGG patients is higher than that reported for historical controls (P<.001) and the study-hypothesized rate of 65%.

Methods: AAM was estimated for the population 15 years of age and older using per capita alcohol consumption combined with survey estimates. The effect of alcohol on each cause of death was extracted from the published scientific literature. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to smooth the Standardized Mortality Ratio for each municipality for six groups of causes related to alcohol consumption (total, neuro-psychiatric, cardiovascular, cancer, injuries and other causes). Results: The percentage of municipalities with high risk for any group of causes in each region ranges from 0% to 87.0%, Municipalities with high risk were concentrated in south-central and southern Chile for all groups of causes related to alcohol. Conclusions: AAM risk shows marked geographic concentrations, mainly in south-central and southern regions of Chile. This combination of methods for small-area estimates of AAM is a powerful tool to identify high risk regions and associated factors, and may be used to inform local policies and programs.

We used event contingent recording to investigate the relation between the 2D:4D ratio and social behavior. Participants completed multiple records of their behavior in events in naturalistic settings; records included information about situational features such as the gender of the person with whom the person was interacting. Men were more agreeable towards women than men; this effect was significantly greater in those with smaller 2D:4D ratios. Men with smaller 2D:4D ratios were also less quarrelsome towards women than towards men. The 2D:4D ratio did not influence social behavior in women. The hormonal environment in which the male fetal brain develops may influence adult social behavior in specific contexts. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Moskowitz, D.

Inconel718 superalloy is one of the hard materials utilized widely in the aerospace industries. State of surface residual stress is a critical problem in the finish machining of Inconel718. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to estimate and optimize the effect of machining parameters including cutting speed, depth of cut and feed rate on induced tensile residual stress in the finish/ semi-finish turning process of Inconel718. Machining residual stresses were measured by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) method.

Serotonin (5-HT) inhibits Factor XIII-A-mediated plasma fibronectin matrix assembly and crosslinking in osteoblast cultures via direct competition with transamidation	BONE			English	Article						5-HT; Serotonylation; Plasma fibronectin; Factor XIII-A transglutaminase; Osteoblast; Extracellular matrix	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; TRANSGLUTAMINASE ACTIVITY; TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE; BONE LOSS; COLLAGEN; DIFFERENTIATION; TRANSPORTER; FRACTURE	Serotonin (5-HT) - a monoamine with a variety of physiological functions - has recently emerged as a major regulator of bone mass. 5-HT is synthesized in the brain and the gut, and gut-derived 5-HT contributes to circulating 5-HT levels and is a negative modulator of bone mass and quality. 5-HT's negative effects on the skeleton are considered to be mediated via its receptors and transporter in osteoblasts and osteoclasts; however, 5-HT can also incorporate covalently into proteins via a transglutaminase-mediated serotonylation reaction, which in turn can alter protein function. Plasma fibronectin (pFN) - a major component of the bone extracellular matrix that regulates bone matrix quality in vivo - is a major transglutaminase substrate in bone and in osteoblast cultures. We have recently demonstrated that pFN assembly into osteoblast culture matrix requires a Factor XIII-A (FXIII-A) transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking step that regulates both quantity and quality of type I collagen matrix in vitro. In this study, we show that 5-HT interferes with pFN assembly into the extracellular matrix in osteoblast cultures, which in turn has major consequences on matrix assembly and mineralization. 5-HT treatment of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures dramatically decreased both pFN fibrillogenesis as analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy and pFN levels in DOC-soluble and DOC-insoluble matrix fractions. This was accompanied by an increase in pFN levels in the culture media. Analysis of the media showed covalent incorporation of 5-HT into pFN. Minor co-localization of pFN with 5-HT was also seen in extracellular fibrils. 5-HT also showed co-localization with FXIII-A on the cell surface and inhibited its transamidation activity directly. 5-HT treatment of osteoblast cultures resulted in a discontinuous pFN matrix and impaired type I collagen deposition, decreased alkaline phosphatase and lysyl oxidase activity, and delayed mineralization of the cultures. Addition of excess exogenous pFN to cultures treated with 5-HT resulted in a significant rescue of pFN fibrillogenesis as well as type I collagen deposition and mineralization. In summary, our study presents a novel mechanism on how increased peripheral extracellular 5-HT levels might contribute to the weakening of bone by directly affecting the stabilization of extracellular matrix networks.

An Ensemble System Based on Hybrid EGARCH-ANN with Different Distributional Assumptions to Predict S&P 500 Intraday Volatility	FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS			English	Article						Stock market; volatility; EGARCH; neural networks; ensemble; forecasting	NEURAL-NETWORK; GARCH MODELS; STOCK INDEX; RETURN; FORECASTS	Accurate forecasting of stock market volatility is an important issue in portfolio risk management. In this paper, an ensemble system for stock market volatility is presented. It is composed of three different models that hybridize the exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) process and the artificial neural network trained with the backpropagation algorithm (BPNN) to forecast stock market volatility under normal, t-Student, and generalized error distribution (GED) assumption separately. The goal is to design an ensemble system where each single hybrid model is capable to capture normality, excess skewness, or excess kurtosis in the data to achieve complementarity. The performance of each EGARCH-BPNN and the ensemble system is evaluated by the closeness of the volatility forecasts to realized volatility. Based on mean absolute error and mean of squared errors, the experimental results show that proposed ensemble model used to capture normality, skewness, and kurtosis in data is more accurate than the individual EGARCH-BPNN models in forecasting the S&P 500 intra-day volatility based on one and five-minute time horizons data.

As an important regulator of neuronal gene expression, nuclear calcium is involved in the conversion of synaptic stimuli into functional and structural changes of neurons. Here we identify two synaptic organizers, Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2, as targets of nuclear calcium signaling. Expression of both Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2 increased in a synaptic NMDA receptor- and nuclear calcium-dependent manner in hippocampal neurons within 2-4 h after the induction of action potential bursting. Induction of Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2 occurred independently of the need for new protein synthesis and required calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and the nuclear calcium signaling target CREB-binding protein. Analysis of reporter gene constructs revealed a functional cAMP response element in the proximal promoter of Lrrtm2, indicating that at least Lrrtm2 is regulated by the classical nuclear Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV-CREB/CREB-binding protein pathway. These results suggest that one mechanism by which nuclear calcium signaling controls neuronal network function is by regulating the expression of Lrrtm1 and Lrrtm2.

Cyclin-dependent Kinase 5 Phosphorylation of Familial Prion Protein Mutants Exacerbates Conversion into Amyloid Structure	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CIRCULAR-DICHROISM SPECTRA; NEURONAL CDK5 ACTIVATOR; N-TERMINAL REGION; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGE; Y145STOP VARIANT; APLYSIA CPEB; IN-VITRO; SCRAPIE; DISEASES; ISOFORM	Familial prion protein (PrP) mutants undergo conversion from soluble and protease-sensitive to insoluble and partially protease-resistant proteins. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylation of wild type PrP (pPrP) at serine 43 induces a conversion of PrP into aggregates and fibrils. Here, we investigated whether familial PrP mutants are predisposed to Cdk5 phosphorylation and whether phosphorylation of familial PrP mutants increases conversion. PrP mutants representing three major familial PrP diseases and different PrP structural domains were studied. We developed a novel in vitro kinase reaction coupled with Thioflavin T binding to amyloid structure assay to monitor phosphorylation-dependent amyloid conversion. Although non-phosphorylated full-length wild type or PrP mutants did not convert into amyloid, Cdk5 phosphorylation rapidly converted these into Thioflavin T-positive structures following first order kinetics. Dephosphorylation partially reversed conversion. Phosphorylation-dependent conversion of PrP from alpha-helical structures into beta-sheet structures was confirmed by circular dichroism. Relative to wild type pPrP, most PrP mutants showed increased rate constants of conversion. In contrast, non-phosphorylated truncated PrP Y145X (where X represents a stop codon) and Q160X mutants converted spontaneously into Thioflavin T-positive fibrils after a lag phase of over 20 h, indicating nucleation-dependent polymerization. Phosphorylation reduced the lag phase by over 50% and thus accelerated the formation of the nucleating event. Consistently, phosphorylated Y145X and phosphorylated Q160X exacerbated conversion in a homologous seeding reaction, whereas WT pPrP could not seed WT PrP. These results demonstrate an influence of both the N terminus and the C terminus of PrP on conversion. We conclude that post-translational modifications of the flexible N terminus of PrP can cause or exacerbate PrP mutant conversion.

Anchoring of Protein Kinase A by ERM (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) Proteins Is Required for Proper Netrin Signaling through DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer)	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GROWTH CONE GUIDANCE; ADENOSINE A2B RECEPTOR; FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; CELL-MIGRATION; AXON OUTGROWTH; CYCLIC-AMP; NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; FILOPODIA FORMATION; ENA/VASP PROTEINS; PLASMA-MEMBRANE	Netrin-1, acting through its principal receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), serves as an axon guidance cue during neural development and also contributes to vascular morphogenesis, epithelial migration, and the pathogenesis of some tumors. Several lines of evidence suggest that netrin-DCC signaling can regulate and be regulated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, although the molecular details of this relationship are poorly understood. Specificity in PKA signaling is often achieved through differential subcellular localization of the enzyme by interaction with protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Here, we show that AKAP function is required for DCC-mediated activation of PKA and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins of the Mena/VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) family. Moreover, we show that DCC and PKA physically interact and that this association is mediated by the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton cross-linking proteins. Silencing of ERM protein expression inhibits DCC-PKA interaction, DCC-mediated PKA activation, and phosphorylation of Mena/VASP proteins as well as growth cone morphology and neurite outgrowth. Finally, although expression of wild-type radixin partially rescued growth cone morphology and tropism toward netrin in ERM-knockdown cells, expression of an AKAP-deficient mutant of radixin did not fully rescue growth cone morphology and switched netrin tropism from attraction to repulsion. These data support a model in which ERM-mediated anchoring of PKA activity to DCC is required for proper netrin/DCC-mediated signaling.

Furthermore, ischemia is thought to play a role in a number of neuropathic pain conditions, and yet the role of hypoxia has also not been characterized in neuropathic pain conditions. In this study, we observed the presence of persistent endoneurial hypoxia in a mouse model of traumatic peripheral nerve injury, causing painful mononeuropathy. We attribute the ongoing hypoxia to microvascular dysfunction, endoneurial fibrosis, and increased metabolic requirements within the injured nerve. Increased lactate levels were observed in injured nerves, as well as increased oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates, suggesting that anaerobic glycolysis is required to maintain cellular ATP levels. Hypoxia causes a reduction in levels of the Na+/K+ ATPase ion transporter in both cultured primary dorsal root ganglion neurons and injured peripheral nerve. A reduction of Na+/K+ ATPase ion transporter levels likely contributes to the hyperexcitability of injured nerves. Physiological antagonism of hypoxia with hyperbaric oxygen alleviated mechanical allodynia in nerve-injured animals. These results suggest that hypoxia and the Na+/K+ ATPase ion transporter may be a novel mechanistic target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In addition, the findings support the possibility of using hypoxia activated pro-drugs to localize treatments for neuropathic pain and nerve injury to injured nerves.	[Lim, Tony K.

Integration of Canal and Otolith Inputs by Central Vestibular Neurons Is Subadditive for Both Active and Passive Self-Motion: Implication for Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						head motion; rotation; sensory integration; translation; vestibular nuclei; voluntary	HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; FASTIGIAL NUCLEUS; DETECTION THRESHOLDS; INERTIAL MOTION; NERVE AFFERENTS; FIRING BEHAVIOR; INTERNAL-MODELS	Traditionally, the neural encoding of vestibular information is studied by applying either passive rotations or translations in isolation. However, natural vestibular stimuli are typically more complex. During everyday life, our self-motion is generally not restricted to one dimension, but rather comprises both rotational and translational motion that will simultaneously stimulate receptors in the semicircular canals and otoliths. In addition, natural self-motion is the result of self-generated and externally generated movements. However, to date, it remains unknown how information about rotational and translational components of self-motion is integrated by vestibular pathways during active and/or passive motion. Accordingly, here, we compared the responses of neurons at the first central stage of vestibular processing to rotation, translation, and combined motion. Recordings were made in alert macaques from neurons in the vestibular nuclei involved in postural control and self-motion perception. In response to passive stimulation, neurons did not combine canal and otolith afferent information linearly. Instead, inputs were subadditively integrated with a weighting that was frequency dependent. Although canal inputs were more heavily weighted at low frequencies, the weighting of otolith input increased with frequency. In response to active stimulation, neuronal modulation was significantly attenuated (similar to 70%) relative to passive stimulation for rotations and translations and even more profoundly attenuated for combined motion due to subadditive input integration. Together, these findings provide insights into neural computations underlying the integration of semicircular canal and otolith inputs required for accurate posture and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during everyday life.

Quantifying the Microvascular Origin of BOLD-fMRI from First Principles with Two-Photon Microscopy and an Oxygen-Sensitive Nanoprobe	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BOLD-fMRI; modeling; Monte Carlo; two-photon microscopy	BRAIN BLOOD-FLOW; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BASE-LINE; VASCULAR NETWORK; PARTIAL-PRESSURE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; IN-VIVO; 7 T; SIGNAL	The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is widely used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies aimed at investigating neuronal activity. However, the BOLD signal reflects changes in blood volume and oxygenation rather than neuronal activity per se. Therefore, understanding the transformation of microscopic vascular behavior into macroscopic BOLD signals is at the foundation of physiologically informed noninvasive neuroimaging. Here, we use oxygen-sensitive two-photon microscopy to measure the BOLD-relevant microvascular physiology occurring within a typical rodent fMRI voxel and predict the BOLD signal from first principles using those measurements. The predictive power of the approach is illustrated by quantifying variations in the BOLD signal induced by the morphological folding of the human cortex.

Prefrontal cortex markers of suicidal vulnerability in mood disorders: a model-based structural neuroimaging study with a translational perspective	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; CORTICAL THICKNESS; DECISION-MAKING; HIGH-RISK; BRAIN; BEHAVIOR; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION	The vulnerability to suicidal behavior has been modeled in deficits in both valuation and cognitive control processes, mediated by ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortices. To uncover potential markers of suicidality based on this model, we measured several brain morphometric parameters using 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging in a large sample and in a specifically designed study. We then tested their classificatory properties. Three groups were compared: euthymic suicide attempters with a past history of mood disorders and suicidal behavior (N = 67); patient controls with a past history of mood disorders but not suicidal behavior (N = 82); healthy controls without any history of mental disorder (N = 82). A hypothesis-driven region-of-interest approach was applied targeting the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral (VLPFC), dorsal (DPFC) and medial (including anterior cingulate cortex; MPFC) prefrontal cortices. Both voxel-based (SPM8) and surface-based morphometry (Freesurfer) analyses were used to comprehensively evaluate cortical gray matter measure, volume, surface area and thickness. Reduced left VLPFC volume in attempters vs both patient groups was found (P = 0.001, surviving multiple comparison correction, Cohen's d = 0.65 95% (0.33-0.99) between attempters and healthy controls). In addition, reduced measures in OFC and DPFC, but not MPFC, were found with moderate effect sizes in suicide attempters vs healthy controls (Cohen's d between 0.34 and 0.52). Several of these measures were correlated with suicidal variables. When added to mood disorder history, left VLPFC volume increased within-sample specificity in identifying attempters in a significant but limited way. Our study, therefore, confirms structural prefrontal alterations in individuals with histories of suicide attempts. A future clinical application of these markers will, however, necessitate further research.

J	Chang, PKY; Khatchadourian, A; McKinney, RA; Maysinger, D				Chang, Philip K-Y; Khatchadourian, Armen; McKinney, Rebecca Anne; Maysinger, Dusica			Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA): a modulator of microglia activity and dendritic spine morphology	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Docosahexaenoic acid; Lipid bodies; Mitochondria; Microglia; Neuroinflammation; Dendritic spines	LIPID DROPLET FORMATION; IN-VIVO; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; FATTY-ACIDS; MOUSE MODEL; CELLS; PLASTICITY; ROLES; OMEGA-3-FATTY-ACIDS	Background: Recent studies have revealed that excessive activation of microglia and inflammation-mediated neurotoxicity are implicated in the progression of several neurological disorders. In particular, chronic inflammation in vivo and exposure of cultured brain cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro can adversely change microglial morphology and function. This can have both direct and indirect effects on synaptic structures and functions. The integrity of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic component of excitatory synapses, dictates synaptic efficacy. Interestingly, dysgenesis of dendritic spines has been found in many neurological diseases associated with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) deficiency and cognitive decline. In contrast, supplemented omega-3 PUFAs, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), can partly correct spine defects. Hence, we hypothesize that DHA directly affects synaptic integrity and indirectly through neuron-glia interaction. Strong activation of microglia by LPS is accompanied by marked release of nitric oxide and formation of lipid bodies (LBs), both dynamic biomarkers of inflammation. Here we investigated direct effects of DHA on synaptic integrity and its indirect effects via microglia in the hippocampal CA1 region. Methods: Microglia (N9) and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were exposed to the proinflammagen LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Biochemical and morphological markers of inflammation were investigated in microglia and CA1 regions of hippocampal slices. As biomarkers of hyperactive microglia, mitochondrial function, nitric oxide release and LBs (number, size, LB surface-associated proteins) were assessed. Changes in synaptic transmission of CA1 pyramidal cells were determined following LPS and DHA (25-50 mu M) treatments by recording spontaneous AMPA-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Results: Microglia responded to LPS stimulation with a significant decrease of mitochondrial function, increased nitric oxide production and an increase in the formation of large LBs. LPS treatment led to a significant reduction of dendritic spine densities and an increase in the AMPA-mediated mEPSC inter-event interval (IEI). DHA normalized the LPS-induced abnormalities in both neurons and microglia, as revealed by the restoration of synaptic structures and functions in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that DHA can prevent LPS-induced abnormalities (neuroinflammation) by reducing inflammatory biomarkers, thereby normalizing microglia activity and their effect on synaptic function.

Patients with lesions to the frontal cortex, the temporal lobe and neurologically intact individuals were tested for context memory retrieval when verbal stimuli (words) had been experienced across multiple (unstable context condition) or unique (stable context condition) contexts; basic recognition memory of these words-in-contexts was also tested. Patients with lesions to the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were impaired on context retrieval only when the words had been seen in multiple contexts, demonstrating that this prefrontal region is critical for active retrieval processing necessary to disambiguate memory items embedded across multiple contexts. Patients with lesions to the left dorsomedial prefrontal region were impaired on both context retrieval conditions, regardless of the stability of the stimulus-to-context associations. Conversely, prefrontal lesions sparing the ventrolateral and dorsomedial regions did not impair context retrieval. Only patients with temporal lobe excisions were impaired on basic recognition memory. The results demonstrate a basic contribution of the left dorsomedial frontal region to mnemonic context retrieval, with the VLPFC engaged, selectively, when contextual relations are unstable and require disambiguation.

To clarify whether exogenous active vitamin D rescues hypertension by normalizing the altered central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) via an antioxidative stress mechanism, 1-alpha-hydroxylase [1 alpha(OH)ase] knockout mice [1 alpha(OH)ase(-/-)] and their wild-type littermates were fed a normal diet alone or with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 [1,25(OH)(2)D-3], or a high-calcium, high-phosphorus "rescue" diet with or without antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) supplementation for 4 weeks. Compared with their wild-type littermates, 1 alpha(OH)ase(-/-)mice had high mean arterial pressure, increased levels of renin, angiotensin II (Ang II), and Ang II type 1 receptor, and increased malondialdehyde levels, but decreased anti-peroxiredoxin I and IV proteins and the antioxidative genes glutathione reductase (Gsr) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) in the brain samples. Except Ang II type 1 receptor, these pathophysiological changes were rescued by exogenous 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 or NAC plus rescue diet, but not by rescue diet alone. We conclude that 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 normalizes the altered central RAS in 1 alpha(OH)ase(-/-)mice, at least partially, through a central antioxidative mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study explored whether cognitive inhibition would moderate the effect of empathy on social functioning. Eighty healthy young adults underwent two assessments six months apart. Participants' ability to suppress interference from distracting emotional stimuli was assessed using a Negative Affective Priming Task that included both generic and personally-relevant (i.e., participants' intimate partners) facial expressions of emotion. The UCLA Life Stress Interview and Empathy Quotient were administered to measure interpersonal functioning and empathy respectively. Multilevel modeling demonstrated that higher empathy was associated with worse concurrent interpersonal outcomes for individuals who showed weak inhibition of the personally-relevant depictions of anger. The effect of empathy on social functioning might be dependent on individuals' ability to suppress interference from meaningful emotional distractors in their environment.

This sporadic activity is thought to play a role in memory consolidation, brain plasticity, and protection of sleep integrity. Many automatic detectors have been proposed to assist or replace experts for sleep spindle scoring. However, these algorithms usually detect too many events making it difficult to achieve a good tradeoff between sensitivity (Se) and false detection rate (FDr). In this work, we propose a semi-automatic detector comprising a sensitivity phase based on well-established criteria followed by a specificity phase using spatial and spectral criteria. In the sensitivity phase, selected events are those which amplitude in the 10-16 Hz band and spectral ratio characteristics both reject a null hypothesis (p < 0.1) stating that the considered event is not a spindle. This null hypothesis is constructed from events occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep epochs. In the specificity phase, a hierarchical clustering of the selected candidates is done based on events' frequency and spatial position along the anterior-posterior axis. Only events from the classes grouping most (at least 80%) spindles scored by an expert are kept. We obtain Se = 93.2% and FDr = 93.0% in the first phase and Se = 85.4% and FDr = 86.2% in the second phase. For these two phases, Matthew's correlation coefficients are respectively 0.228 and 0.324. Results suggest that spindles are defined by specific spatio-spectral properties and that automatic detection methods can be improved by considering these features.

By systematically interrogating Sox2 and Pax6 interaction on minimal enhancer elements, we found that cooperative DNA recognition relies on combinatorial nucleotide switches and precisely spaced, but cryptic composite DNA motifs. Surprisingly, all tested Sox and Pax paralogs have the capacity to cooperate on such enhancer elements. NMR and molecular modeling reveal very few direct protein-protein interactions between Sox2 and Pax6, suggesting that cooperative binding is mediated by allosteric interactions propagating through DNA structure. Furthermore, we detected and validated several novel sites in the human genome targeted cooperatively by Sox2 and Pax6.

Neural Heterogeneities Determine Response Characteristics to Second-, but Not First-Order Stimulus Features	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroreceptor; envelope; neural heterogeneity; weakly electric fish	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; DYNAMIC SENSORY FILTER; AFFERENT NERVE-FIBERS; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEM; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; DENDRITIC MORPHOLOGY; VISUAL INFORMATION	Neural heterogeneities are seen ubiquitously, but how they determine neural response properties remains unclear. Here we show that heterogeneities can either strongly, or not at all, influence neural responses to a given stimulus feature. Specifically, we recorded from peripheral electroreceptor neurons, which display strong heterogeneities in their resting discharge activity, in response to naturalistic stimuli consisting of a fast time-varying waveform (i.e., first-order) whose amplitude (i.e., second-order or envelope) varied slowly in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Although electroreceptors displayed relatively homogeneous responses to first-order stimulus features, further analysis revealed two subpopulations with similar sensitivities that were excited or inhibited by increases in the envelope, respectively, for stimuli whose frequency content spanned the natural range. We further found that a linear-nonlinear cascade model incorporating the known linear response characteristics to first-order features and a static nonlinearity accurately reproduced experimentally observed responses to both first-and second-order features for all stimuli tested. Importantly, this model correctly predicted that the response magnitude is independent of either the stimulus waveform's or the envelope's frequency content. Further analysis of our model led to the surprising prediction that the mean discharge activity can be used to determine whether a given neuron is excited or inhibited by increases in the envelope. This prediction was validated by our experimental data. Thus, our results provide key insight as to how neural heterogeneities can determine response characteristics to some, but not other, behaviorally relevant stimulus features.

Performance also varies between different cultural groups. The present study aimed to establish normative data for the Rappel libre/Rappel indice a 16 items (16-item Free and Cued Recall; RL/RI-16), a French adaptation of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (Buschke, 1984; Grober, Buschke, Crystal, Bang, & Dresner, 1988). The sample consisted of 566 healthy French-speaking older adults (50-88 years old) from the province of Quebec, Canada. Normative data for the RL/RI-16 were derived from 80% of the total sample (normative sample) and cross-validated using the remaining participants (20%; validation sample). The effects of participants' age, sex, and education level were assessed on different indices of memory performance. Results indicated that these variables were independently associated with performance. Normative data are presented as regression equations with standard deviations (symmetric distributions) and percentiles (asymmetric distributions).

There is a growing interest to clarify the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie this effect. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the neurophysiological changes in cerebral oxygenation associated with physical fitness level and executive functions. Method: In this study, 22 younger and 36 older women underwent a maximal graded continuous test (i.e., (V)over dotO(2max)) in order to classify them into a fitness group (higher vs. lower fit). All participants completed neuropsychological paper and pencil testing and a computerized Stroop task (which contained executive and non-executive conditions) in which the change in prefrontal cortex oxygenation was evaluated with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Results: Our findings revealed a Fitness x Condition interaction (p < 0.05) such that higher fit women scored better on measures of executive functions than lower fit women. In comparison to lower fit women, higher fit women had faster reaction times in the Executive condition of the computerized Stroop task. No significant effect was observed in the non-executive condition of the test and no interactions were found with age. In measures of cerebral oxygenation (Delta HbT and Delta HbO(2)), we found a main effect of fitness on cerebral oxygenation during the Stroop task such that only high fit women demonstrated a significant increase in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Discussion/Conclusion: Higher fit individuals who demonstrate better cardiorespiratory functions (as measured by ((V)over dotO(2max)) show faster reaction times and greater cerebral oxygenation in the right inferior frontal gyrus than women with lower fitness levels. The lack of interaction with age, suggests that good cardiorespiratory functions can have a positive impact on cognition, regardless of age.

MicroRNA regulation of central glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signalling in depression	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ADHESION MOLECULE NCAM; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CHINESE POPULATION; MOOD DISORDERS; EXPRESSION; NEURONS; GFR-ALPHA-1; RECEPTOR; NEURITOGENESIS	Although multiple studies have reported that peripheral glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is reduced in depression, cerebral GDNF signalling has yet to be examined in this condition. Here, we report an isoform-specific decrease in GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (GFRA1) mRNA expression, resulting in lowered GFR alpha 1a protein levels in basolateral amygdala (BLA) samples from depressed subjects. Downregulation of GFR alpha 1a was associated with increased expression of microRNAs, including miR-511, predicted to bind to long 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR)-containing transcripts (GFRA1-L) coding for GFR alpha 1a. Transfection of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) with a miR-511 mimic was sufficient to repress GFRA1-L/GFR alpha 1a without altering GFR alpha 1b, and resulted in pathway-specific changes in immediate early gene activity. Unexpectedly, GFR alpha 1a knockdown did not reduce NPC responses to GDNF. Rather, it greatly enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. This effect appeared to be mediated by GDNF/soluble GFR alpha 1/neural cell adhesion molecule binding, and substituting the soluble GFR alpha 1a/GFR alpha 1b content of miR-511transfected NPCs with that of controls rescued signalling. In light of previous reports suggesting that GFR alpha 1b can inhibit GFR alpha 1a-induced neuroplasticity, we also assessed the association between GFR alpha 1 and doublecortin (DCX; a hyperplastic marker) in human BLA. Although controls displayed coordinated expression of GFR alpha 1a and b isoforms and these correlated positively with DCX, the only significant association observed among depressed subjects was a strongly negative correlation between GFR alpha 1b and DCX. Taken together, these results suggest that microRNA-mediated reductions of GFR alpha 1a in depression change the quality, rather than the quantity, of GDNF signalling. They also suggest that central GDNF signalling may represent a novel target for antidepressant treatment.	[Maheu, M.; Lopez, J. P.; Crapper, L.; Davoli, M.

Prenatal maternal depression alters amygdala functional connectivity in 6-month-old infants	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MAJOR DEPRESSION; NEURAL RESPONSES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EMOTION REGULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEGATIVE AFFECT; LIMBIC SYSTEM; BRAIN; STRESS; DISORDER	Prenatal maternal depression is associated with alterations in the neonatal amygdala microstructure, shedding light on the timing for the influence of prenatal maternal depression on the brain structure of the offspring. This study aimed to examine the association between prenatal maternal depressive symptomatology and infant amygdala functional connectivity and to thus establish the neural functional basis for the transgenerational transmission of vulnerability for affective disorders during prenatal development. Twenty-four infants were included in this study with both structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) at 6 months of age. Maternal depression was assessed at 26 weeks of gestation and 3 months after delivery using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Linear regression was used to identify the amygdala functional networks and to examine the associations between prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and amygdala functional connectivity. Our results showed that at 6 months of age, the amygdala is functionally connected to widespread brain regions, forming the emotional regulation, sensory and perceptual, and emotional memory networks. After controlling for postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, infants born to mothers with higher prenatal maternal depressive symptoms showed greater functional connectivity of the amygdala with the left temporal cortex and insula, as well as the bilateral anterior cingulate, medial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, which are largely consistent with patterns of connectivity observed in adolescents and adults with major depressive disorder. Our study provides novel evidence that prenatal maternal depressive symptomatology alters the amygdala's functional connectivity in early postnatal life, which reveals that the neuroimaging correlates of the familial transmission of phenotypes associated with maternal mood are apparent in infants at 6 months of age.

One reason is patient-ventilator asynchrony during NIV. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a mode of ventilation controlled by the patient's neural respiratory drive. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and tolerance of NIV-NAVA in children and to evaluate its impact on synchrony and respiratory effort. Methods: This prospective, physiologic, crossover study included 13 patients requiring NIV in the PICU of Sainte-Justine's Hospital from October 2011 to May 2013. Patients were successively ventilated in conventional NIV as prescribed by the physician in charge (30 minutes), in NIV-NAVA (60 minutes), and again in conventional NIV (30 minutes). Electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) and airway pressure were simultaneously recorded to assess patient-ventilator synchrony. Results: NIV-NAVA was feasible and well tolerated in all patients. One patient asked to stop the study because of anxiety related to the leak-free facial mask. Inspiratory trigger dys-synchrony and cycling-off dys-synchrony were significantly shorter in NIV-NAVA versus initial and final conventional NIV periods (both P < 0.05). Wasted efforts were also decreased in NIV-NAVA (all values expressed as median and interquartile values) (0 (0 to 0) versus 12% (4 to 20) and 6% (2 to 22), respectively; P < 0.01). As a whole, total time spent in asynchrony was reduced to 8% (6 to 10) in NIV-NAVA, versus 27% (19 to 56) and 32% (21 to 38) in conventional NIV before and after NIV-NAVA, respectively (P = 0.05).

Lower Methylation of Glucocorticoid Receptor Gene Promoter 1(F) in Peripheral Blood of Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Biomarkers; Combat; Cortisol; Glucocorticoid receptor; HPA axis; Methylation; NR3C1 gene; NR3C1-1(F) promoter; PTSD	DNA METHYLATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CHILDHOOD ABUSE; CORTISOL; DEXAMETHASONE; TRAUMA; NR3C1; SENSITIVITY; SUPPRESSION; INSTRUMENT	BACKGROUND: Enhanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity is present in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the molecular mechanisms of GR sensitivity are not understood. Epigenetic factors have emerged as one potential mechanism that account for how trauma exposure leads to sustained PTSD symptoms given that PTSD develops in only a subset of trauma survivors. METHODS: Cytosine methylation of a relevant promoter of the GR gene (NR3C1-1(F) promoter) and three functional neuroendocrine markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function were examined in a sample of 122 combat veterans. RESULTS: Lower NR3C1-1(F) promoter methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was observed in combat veterans with PTSD compared with combat-exposed veterans who did not develop PTSD. NR3C1-1(F) promoter methylation was also associated with three functional measures of glucocorticoid activity that have been associated with PTSD in combat veterans: PBMCs' lysozyme inhibition on the lysozyme suppression test, plasma cortisol decline on the low-dose (.50 mg) dexamethasone suppression test, and 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion. Finally, NR3C1-1(F) promoter methylation was inversely correlated with clinical markers and symptoms associated with PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in NR3C1-1(F) promoter methylation may reflect enduring changes resulting from combat exposure that lead to functional neuroendocrine alterations. Because epigenetic measures are thought to reflect enduring effects of environmental exposures, they may be useful in distinguishing combat-exposed veterans who do or do not develop PTSD.

A Novel Anxiogenic Role for the Delta Opioid Receptor Expressed in GABAergic Forebrain Neurons	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Conditional gene knockout; Delta opioid receptor; Emotion; GABAergic forebrain neurons; Locomotion; Motivation	ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS; ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS-SEPTI; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; KNOCKOUT MICE; HUMAN BRAIN; MESSENGER-RNA; ANIMAL-MODELS; AMYGDALA; MU	BACKGROUND: The delta opioid receptor (DOR) is broadly expressed throughout the nervous system; it regulates chronic pain, emotional responses, motivation, and memory. Neural circuits underlying DOR activities have been poorly explored by genetic approaches. We used conditional mouse mutagenesis to elucidate receptor function in GABAergic neurons of the forebrain. METHODS: We characterized DOR distribution in the brain of Dlx5/6-CreXOprd1(fl/fl) (Dlx-DOR) mice and tested main central DOR functions through behavioral testing. RESULTS: The DOR proteins were strongly deleted in olfactory bulb and striatum and remained intact in cortex and basolateral amygdala. Olfactory perception, circadian activity, and despair-like behaviors were unchanged. In contrast, locomotor stimulant effects of SNC80 (DOR agonist) and SKF81297 (D-1 agonist) were abolished and increased, respectively. The Dlx-DOR mice showed lower levels of anxiety in the elevated plus maze, opposing the known high anxiety in constitutive DOR knockout animals. Also, Dlx-DOR mice reached the food more rapidly in a novelty suppressed feeding task, despite their lower motivation for food reward observed in an operant paradigm. Finally, c-fos protein staining after novelty suppressed feeding was strongly reduced in amygdala, concordant with the low anxiety phenotype of Dlx-DOR mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that DORs expressed in the forebrain mediate the described locomotor effect of SNC80 and inhibit D-1-stimulated hyperactivity. Our data also reveal an unanticipated anxiogenic role for this particular DOR subpopulation, with a potential novel adaptive role. In emotional responses, DORs exert dual anxiolytic and anxiogenic roles, both of which may have implications in the area of anxiety disorders.

Evaluation of machine learning interpolation techniques for prediction of physical properties	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Superalloys; Database; Gaussian process; Neural network; Quadratic regression; Physical properties; Computational dependence	DIRECT SEARCH ALGORITHM; HETEROGENEOUS MARTENSITIC NUCLEATION; LINEAR INTERPOLATION; START TEMPERATURE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGRESSION; DESIGN; MODELS; STEELS; DATABASES	A knowledge of the physical properties of materials as a function of temperature, composition, applied external stresses, etc. is an important consideration in materials and process design. For new systems, such properties may be unknown and hard to measure or estimate from numerical simulations such as molecular dynamics. Engineers rely on machine learning to employ existing data in order to predict properties for new systems. Several techniques are currently used for such purposes. These include neural network, polynomial interpolation and Gaussian processes as well as the more recent dynamic trees and scalable Gaussian processes. In this paper we compare these approaches for three sets of materials sciences data: molar volume, electrical conductivity and Martensite start temperature. We make recommendations depending on the nature of the data. We demonstrate that a thorough knowledge of the problem beforehand is critical in selecting the most successful machine learning technique. Our findings show that the Gaussian process regression technique gives very good predictions for all three sets of tested data. Typically, Gaussian process is very slow with a computational complexity of typically n(3) where n is the number of data points. In this paper, we found that the scalable Gaussian process approach was able to maintain the high accuracy of the predictions while improving speed considerably, make on-line learning possible.

IgLON Cell Adhesion Molecules Are Shed from the Cell Surface of Cortical Neurons to Promote Neuronal Growth	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER	Matrix metalloproteinases and a disintegrin and metalloproteinases are members of the zinc endopeptidases, which cleave components of the extracellular matrix as well as cell surface proteins resulting in degradation or release of biologically active fragments. Surface ectodomain shedding affects numerous biological processes, including survival, axon outgrowth, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the role of metalloproteinases in regulating cortical neurite growth. We found that treatment of mature cortical neurons with panmetalloproteinase inhibitors or with tissue inhibitors of metal-loproteinase-3 reduced neurite outgrowth. Through mass spectrometry, we characterized the metalloproteinase-sensitive cell surface proteome of mature cortical neurons. Members of the IgLON family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored neural cell adhesion molecules were identified and validated as proteins that were shed from the surface of mature cortical neurons in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner. Introduction of two members of the IgLON family, neurotrimin and NEGR1, in early embryonic neurons was sufficient to confer sensitivity to metalloproteinase inhibitors in neurite outgrowth assays. Outgrowth experiments on immobilized IgLON proteins revealed a role for all IgLON family members in promoting neurite extension from cortical neurons. Together, our findings support a role for metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of IgLON family members in regulating neurite outgrowth from mature cortical neurons.

However the structural pathology model does not adequately explain many of the clinical and experimental findings in subjects with chronic MSD and, more importantly, treatment guided by this paradigm fails to effectively treat many of these conditions. Discussion: Increasing evidence reveals structural and functional changes within the Central Nervous System (CNS) of people with chronic MSD that appear to play a prominent role in the pathophysiology of these disorders. These neuroplastic changes are reflective of adaptive neurophysiological processes occurring as the result of altered afferent stimuli including nociceptive and neuropathic transmission to spinal, subcortical and cortical areas with MSD that are initially beneficial but may persist in a chronic state, may be part and parcel in the pathophysiology of the condition and the development and maintenance of chronic signs and symptoms. Neuroplastic changes within different areas of the CNS may help to explain the transition from acute to chronic conditions, sensory-motor findings, perceptual disturbances, why some individuals continue to experience pain when no structural cause can be discerned, and why some fail to respond to conservative interventions in subjects with chronic MSD. We argue that a change in paradigm is necessary that integrates CNS changes associated with chronic MSD and that these findings are highly relevant for the design and implementation of rehabilitative interventions for this population. Summary: Recent findings suggest that a change in model and approach is required in the rehabilitation of chronic MSD that integrate the findings of neuroplastic changes across the CNS and are targeted by rehabilitative interventions. Effects of current interventions may be mediated through peripheral and central changes but may not specifically address all underlying neuroplastic changes in the CNS potentially associated with chronic MSD. Novel approaches to address these neuroplastic changes show promise and require further investigation to improve efficacy of currents approaches.

This is critical for brain cancer where residual invasive cancer cells frequently remain after surgery, leading to disease recurrence and a negative impact on overall survival. No preoperative or intraoperative technology exists to identify all cancer cells that have invaded normal brain. To address this problem, we developed a handheld contact Raman spectroscopy probe technique for live, local detection of cancer cells in the human brain. Using this probe intraoperatively, we were able to accurately differentiate normal brain from dense cancer and normal brain invaded by cancer cells, with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 91%. This Raman-based probe enabled detection of the previously undetectable diffusely invasive brain cancer cells at cellular resolution in patients with grade 2 to 4 gliomas. This intraoperative technology may therefore be able to classify cell populations in real time, making it an ideal guide for surgical resection and decision-making.

Some signaling intermediates are deployed downstream of molecularly distinct axon guidance receptor families, but the scope of this overlap is unclear, as is the impact of embryonic axon guidance fidelity on adult nervous system function. Here, we demonstrate that the Rho-GTPase-activating protein alpha 2-chimaerin is specifically required for EphA and not EphB receptor signaling in mouse and chick spinal motor axons. Reflecting this specificity, the loss of alpha 2-chimaerin function disrupts the limb trajectory of extensor-muscle-innervating motor axons the guidance of which depends on EphA signaling. These embryonic defects affect coordinated contraction of antagonistic flexor-extensor muscles in the adult, indicating that accurate embryonic motor axon guidance is critical for optimal neuromuscular function. Together, our observations provide the first functional evidence of an Eph receptor-class-specific intracellular signaling protein that is required for appropriate neuromuscular connectivity.

Here, we investigated the involvement of these different regions during emotional and motor mirroring of pain expressions using a two-task paradigm, and including both observation and execution of the expressions. BOLD responses were measured as subjects watched video clips showing different intensities of pain expression and, after a variable delay, either expressed the amount of pain they perceived in the clips (pain task), or imitated the facial movements (movement task). In the pain task condition, pain coding involved overlapping activation across observation and execution in the anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula, and the inferior parietal lobule, and a painrelated increase (pain vs. neutral) in the anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the postcentral gyrus. The 'mirroring' response was stronger in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus during the pain task, and stronger in the inferior parietal lobule in the movement task. These results strongly suggest that while motor mirroring may contribute to the perception of pain expressions in others, interpreting these expressions in terms of pain content draws more heavily on networks involved in the perception of affective meaning.

These studies have reported neural activation patterns for imagined processes that resemble those of real sensory and motor events. The widespread use of such methods has raised questions about the extent to which imagined sensorimotor events mimic their overt counterparts, including their ability to elicit sensorimotor interactions. Direct behavioural evidence of imagery-induced multisensory interactions has been found recently in tasks involving auditory and visual processing. An influence of sensory imagery on the control of motor action, however, has not been investigated previously. Here, we show that both real and imagined moving sounds induce involuntary ocular movement in a nonvisual tracking task. The present data build on the results of previous studies of sensory imagery by showing that such conditions activate sensory neural areas. Moreover, we show an engagement of functional sensorimotor networks for imagined stimuli in a manner similar to the processing of real auditory stimuli. Copyright (c) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

J	Nguyen, HN; Huppe-Gourgues, F; Vaucher, E				Hoang Nam Nguyen; Huppe-Gourgues, Frederic; Vaucher, Elvire			Activation of the mouse primary visual cortex by medial prefrontal subregion stimulation is not mediated by cholinergic basalo-cortical projections	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prefrontal cortex; cholinergic neurons; basal forebrain; visual cortex; neuronal activity; autometallography; thallium; immunocytochemistry	EARLY GENE-EXPRESSION; RAT CINGULATE CORTEX; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE; THALLIUM AUTOMETALLOGRAPHY; PARIETAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; LONG-RANGE; FOREBRAIN; MODULATION	The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) exerts top-down control of primary visual cortex (V1) activity. As there is no direct neuronal projection from mPFC to V1, this functional connection may use an indirect route, i.e., via basalo-cortical cholinergic projections. The cholinergic projections to V1 originate from neurons in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB), which receive neuronal projections from the ventral part of the mPFC, composed of prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic cortices (IL). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether electrical stimulation of mice mPFC subregions activate (1) V1 neurons; and (2) HDB cholinergic neurons, suggesting that the HDB serves as a relay point in the mPFC-V1 interaction. Neuronal activation was quantified using c-Fos immunocytochemistry or thallium autometallography for each V1 layer using automated particle analysis tools and optical density measurement. Stimulation of IL and PrL induced significantly higher c-Fos expression or thallium labeling in layers II/III and V of V1 in the stimulated hemisphere only. A HDB cholinergic neuron specific lesion by saporin administration reduced IL-induced c-Fos expression in layers II/III of V1 but not in layer V. However, there was no c-Fos expression or thallium labeling in the HDB neurons, suggesting that this area was not activated by IL stimulation. Stimulation of another mPFC subarea, the anterior cingulate cortex (AC), which is involved in attention and receives input from V1, activated neither V1 nor HDB. The present results indicate that IL and PrL, but not AC, stimulation activates V1 with the minor involvement of the HDB cholinergic projections. These results suggest a functional link between the ventral mPFC and V1, but this function is only marginally supported by HDB cholinergic neurons and may involve other brain regions.

Hybrid model of the context dependent vestibulo-ocular reflex: implications for vergence-version interactions	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sensory-motor mapping; vestibulo-ocular reflex; context dependent reflex; mathematical model; disconjugate eye movement; ocular nystagmus	PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; CENTRAL VESTIBULAR NEURONS; BURSTER-DRIVING NEURONS; EYE-MOVEMENT; QUICK PHASE; HEAD ROTATION; MEDIATING PATHWAY; VIEWING DISTANCE; BILATERAL MODEL; SQUIRREL-MONKEY	The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is an involuntary eye movement evoked by head movements. It is also influenced by viewing distance. This paper presents a hybrid nonlinear bilateral model for the horizontal angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (AVOR) in the dark. The model is based on known interconnections between saccadic burst circuits in the brainstem and ocular premotor areas in the vestibular nuclei during fast and slow phase intervals of nystagmus. We implemented a viable switching strategy for the timing of nystagmus events to allow emulation of real nystagmus data. The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated with simulations, and results are consistent with experimental observations. The hybrid model replicates realistic AVOR nystagmus patterns during sinusoidal or step head rotations in the dark and during interactions with vergence, e.g., fixation distance. By simply assigning proper nonlinear neural computations at the premotor level, the model replicates all reported experimental observations. This work sheds light on potential underlying neural mechanisms driving the context dependent AVOR and explains contradictory results in the literature. Moreover, context-dependent behaviors in more complex motor systems could also rely on local nonlinear neural computations.

A learning rule that explains how rewards teach attention	VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article						Reinforcement learning; Neural networks; Top-down; Attention; Neuronal plasticity	SELECTIVE VISUAL-ATTENTION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; MODULATION; MOTIVATION; DOPAMINE; NEURONS; BRAIN	Many theories propose that top-down attentional signals control processing in sensory cortices by modulating neural activity. But who controls the controller? Here we investigate how a biologically plausible neural reinforcement learning scheme can create higher order representations and top-down attentional signals. The learning scheme trains neural networks using two factors that gate Hebbian plasticity: (1) an attentional feedback signal from the response-selection stage to earlier processing levels; and (2) a globally available neuromodulator that encodes the reward prediction error. We demonstrate how the neural network learns to direct attention to one of two coloured stimuli that are arranged in a rank-order. Like monkeys trained on this task, the network develops units that are tuned to the rank-order of the colours and it generalizes this newly learned rule to previously unseen colour combinations. These results provide new insight into how individuals can learn to control attention as a function of reward contingency.

N-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein mediating the formation and structural integrity of blood vessels. Its expression has also been documented in numerous types of poorly differentiated tumours. This CAM is involved in regulating the proliferation, survival, invasiveness and metastasis of cancer cells. Disruption of N-cadherin homophilic intercellular interactions using peptide or small molecule antagonists is a promising novel strategy for anti-cancer therapies. This review discusses: the discovery of N-cadherin, the mechanism by which N-cadherin promotes cell adhesion, the role of N-cadherin in blood vessel formation and maintenance, participation of N-cadherin in cancer progression, the different types of N-cadherin antagonists and the use of N-cadherin antagonists as anti-cancer drugs.

Some studies demonstrate diffuse cortical thinning in obesity, while others report effects in areas that are associated with self-regulation, such as lateral prefrontal cortex. Methods: This study used multilevel modeling of data from the NIH Pediatric MRI Data Repository, a mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional database, to examine the relationship between cortical thickness and body weight in children. Cortical thickness was computed at 81,942 vertices of 716 MRI scans from 378 children aged between 4 and 18 years. Body mass index Z score for age was computed for each participant. We performed vertex-wise statistical analysis of the relationship between cortical thickness and BMI, accounting for age and gender. In addition, cortical thickness was extracted from regions of interest in prefrontal cortex and insula. Results: No significant association between cortical thickness and BMI was found, either by statistical parametric mapping or by region of interest analysis. Results remained negative when the analysis was restricted to children aged 12-18. Conclusions: The correlation between BMI and cortical thickness was not found in this large pediatric sample. The association between BMI and cortical thinning develops after adolescence. This has implications for the nature of the relationship between brain anatomy and weight gain.

Here we show that Casz1, the vertebrate ortholog of the Drosophila temporal identity factor castor, controls the production of mid-/late-born neurons in the murine retina. Casz1 is expressed from mid/late stages in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), and conditional deletion of Casz1 increases production of early-born retinal neurons at the expense of later-born fates, whereas precocious misexpression of Casz1 has the opposite effect. In both cases, cell proliferation is unaffected, indicating that Casz1 does not control the timing of cell birth but instead biases RPC output directly. Just as Drosophila castor lies downstream of the early temporal identity factor hunchback, we find that the hunchback ortholog Ikzf1 represses Casz1. These results uncover a conserved strategy regulating temporal identity transitions from flies to mammals.

High Salt Intake Increases Blood Pressure via BDNF-Mediated Downregulation of KCC2 and Impaired Baroreflex Inhibition of Vasopressin Neurons	NEURON			English	Article							CL-COTRANSPORTER KCC2; HYPOTHALAMIC SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; FACTOR MESSENGER-RNA; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; CARDIOVASCULAR REGULATION; CHLORIDE HOMEOSTASIS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; ANION GRADIENT; IN-VIVO; RAT	The mechanisms by which dietary salt promotes hypertension are unknown. Previous work established that plasma [Na+] and osmolality rise in proportion with salt intake and thus promote release of vasopressin (VP) from the neurohypophysis. Although high levels of circulating VP can increase blood pressure, this effect is normally prevented by a potent GABAergic inhibition of VP neurons by aortic baroreceptors. Here we show that chronic high salt intake impairs baroreceptor inhibition of rat VP neurons through a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)dependent activation of TrkB receptors and down-regulation of KCC2 expression, which prevents inhibitory GABAergic signaling. We show that high salt intake increases the spontaneous firing rate of VP neurons in vivo and that circulating VP contributes significantly to the elevation of arterial pressure under these conditions. These results provide the first demonstration that dietary salt can affect blood pressure through neurotrophin-induced plasticity in a central homeostatic circuit.

A Sensorimotor Role for Traveling Waves in Primate Visual Cortex	NEURON			English	Article							LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; MACAQUE AREA V4; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PROPAGATING WAVES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; POPULATION RESPONSES; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; COMPUTATIONAL ROLE; STIMULUS CONTRAST	Traveling waves of neural activity are frequently observed to occur in concert with the presentation of a sensory stimulus or the execution of a movement. Although such waves have been studied for decades, little is known about their function. Here we show that traveling waves in the primate extrastriate visual cortex provide a means of integrating sensory and motor signals. Specifically, we describe a traveling wave of local field potential (LFP) activity in cortical area V4 of macaque monkeys that is triggered by the execution of saccadic eye movements. These waves sweep across the V4 retinotopic map, following a consistent path from the foveal to the peripheral representations of space; their amplitudes correlate with the direction and size of each saccade. Moreover, these waves are associated with a reorganization of the postsaccadic neuronal firing patterns, which follow a similar retinotopic progression, potentially prioritizing the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli.

Recent findings have shown that the amusic brain exhibits altered functioning of a fronto-temporal network during pitch perception and short-term memory. Within this network, during the encoding of melodies, a decreased right backward frontal-to-temporal connectivity was reported in amusia, along with an abnormal connectivity within and between auditory cortices. The present study investigated whether connectivity patterns between these regions were affected during the short-term memory retrieval of melodies. Amusics and controls had to indicate whether sequences of six tones that were presented in pairs were the same or different. When melodies were different only one tone changed in the second melody. Brain responses to the changed tone in Different trials and to its equivalent (original) tone in Same trials were compared between groups using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). DCM results confirmed that congenital amusia is characterized by an altered effective connectivity within and between the two auditory cortices during sound processing. Furthermore, right temporal-to-frontal message passing was altere d in comparison to controls, with notably an increase in Same trials. An additional analysis in control participants emphasized that the detection of an unexpected event in the typically functioning brain is supported by right fronto-temporal connections. The results can be interpreted in a predictive coding framework as reflecting an abnormal prediction error sent by temporal auditory regions towards frontal areas in the amusic brain	[Albouy, Philippe; Tillmann, Barbara] Univ Lyon 1, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Auditory Cognit & Psychoacoust Team, CRNL,CNRS UMR5292,INSERM U1028, F-69365 Lyon, France; [Albouy, Philippe; Mattout, Jeremie; Sanchez, Gaetan; Caclin, Anne] Univ Lyon 1, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Brain Dynam & Cognit Team, CRNL,CNRS UMR5292,INSERM U1028, F-69365 Lyon, France; [Albouy, Philippe] McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada	Albouy, P (reprint author), McGill Univ, Montreal Neurol Inst, 3801 Univ St, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada.	phv.albouy@gmail.com	Caclin, Anne/K-1682-2017; Mattout, Jeremie/I-6417-2017	Sanchez, Gaetan/0000-0002-7242-721X	Rhone Alpes Cluster [11]; "Agence Nationale de la Recherche" (ANR) of the French Ministry of Research [ANR-11-BSH2-001-01]; CNRS; French ANR [ANR-DEFIS 09-EMER-002]; Universite de Lyon, within the program "Investissements d'avenir" [ANR-11-IDEX-0007]	This work was supported by a grant from the Rhone Alpes Cluster no 11: "Handicap, vieillissement, neurosciences" to Barbara Tillmann and by a grant from "Agence Nationale de la Recherche" (ANR) of the French Ministry of Research ANR-11-BSH2-001-01 to Barbara Tillmann and Anne Caclin.

GRANITE is an open-source tool and invaluable resource for a variety of genomic fields. Although our analysis is confined to static expression data, GRANITE has the capability of evaluating time-course data and generating interactive networks that may shed light on acute versus chronic treatment, as well as evaluating dose response and providing insight into mechanisms that underlie therapeutic versus sub-therapeutic doses or toxic doses. As a proof-of-concept study, we investigated lithium (Li) response in bipolar disorder (BD). BD is a severe mood disorder marked by cycles of mania and depression. Li is one of the most commonly prescribed and decidedly effective treatments for many patients (responders), although its mode of action is not yet fully understood, nor is it effective in every patient (non-responders). In an in vitro study, we compared vehicle versus chronic Li treatment in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) (derived from either responders or non-responders) using both microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA gene expression profiling. We present both Li responder and non-responder network visualizations created by our GRANITE analysis in BD. We identified by network visualization that the Let-7 family is consistently downregulated by Li in both groups where this miRNA family has been implicated in neurodegeneration, cell survival and synaptic development. We discuss the potential of this analysis for investigating treatment response and even providing clinicians with a tool for predicting treatment response in their patients, as well as for providing the industry with a tool for identifying network nodes as targets for novel drug discovery.

To explore this hypothesis, we administered a verbal insight task (riddles) and a divergent thinking task (verbal fluency) to 16 native English speakers and 16 non-native English speakers after they underwent Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of the left middle temporal gyrus and right temporo-parietal junction. We found that, in the case of the insight task the depolarization of right temporo-parietal junction and hyperpolarization of left middle temporal gyrus resulted in increased performance, relative to both the control condition and the reverse stimulation condition in both groups (non-native > native speakers). However, in the case of the divergent thinking task, the same pattern of stimulation resulted in a decrease in performance, compared to the reverse stimulation condition, in the non-native speakers. We explain this dissociation in terms of differing task demands of divergent thinking and insight tasks and speculate that the greater sensitivity of non-native speakers to tDCS stimulation may be a function of less entrenched neural networks for non-native languages.

To directly test this idea, we compared the response of TNFo-/- mice and astrocyte-specific TNF alpha(-/-) mice to the antidepressants fluoxetine and desipramine. Using standard behavior models for measuring antidepressant efficacy, the forced swim test (EST) and tail suspension test (TST), we determined that TNF alpha(-/-) mice were essentially normal in basal behavior in the FST and TST. However, TINIFcci- mice showed no behavioral response to a standard dose of chronic antidepressant treatment, in sharp contrast to wildtype mice. Similar results were seen with acute antidepressant treatment, but TNF alpha(-/-) mice did respond to a very high-dose acute antidepressant treatment. We also assessed in vitro and in vivo effects of fluoxetine on INFoi expression. GI ia responded to serotonin in vitro and fluoxetine in vivo by upregulating TNFot mRNA. Consistent with this source of TNFoi, mice with an astrocyte-specific deletion of TNFa also did not respond to standard chronic antidepressant treatment. These data suggest that astrocytic INF alpha. is important to the sensitivity of the behavioral response to administration of antidepressants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The fabrication method yields reliable miniature on-probe IrOx electrodes with long lifetime, high stability and repeatability. Such sensors can be used for long-term measurements. Various dimensions of sol-gel iridium oxide electrodes including 1 mm x 1 mm, 500 mu m x 500 mu m, and 100 mu m x 100 mu m were fabricated. Sensor longevity and pH dependence were investigated by immersing the electrodes in hydrochloric acid, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and sodium hydroxide solutions for 30 days. Less pH dependent responses, compared to IrOx electrodes fabricated by electrochemical deposition processes, were measured at 58.8 +/- 0.4 mV/pH, 53.8 +/- 1.3 mV/pH and 48 +/- 0.6 mV/pH, respectively. The on-probe IrOx pseudo-reference electrodes were utilized for dopamine sensing. The baseline responses of the sensors were higher than the one using an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Using IrOx reference electrodes integrated on the same probe with working electrodes eliminated the use of cytotoxic Ag/AgCl reference electrode without loss in sensitivity. This enables employing such sensors in long-term recording of concentrations of neurotransmitters in central nervous systems of animals and humans.

BASIS Team	Parent-mediated intervention versus no intervention for infants at high risk of autism: a parallel, single-blind, randomised trial	LANCET PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SIBLINGS RESEARCH CONSORTIUM; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; AT-RISK; ATTENTION; PLAY; AGE	Background Risk markers for later autism identified in the first year of life present plausible intervention targets during early development. We aimed to assess the effect of a parent-mediated intervention for infants at high risk of autism on these markers. Methods We did a two-site, two-arm assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial of families with an infant at familial high risk of autism aged 7-10 months, testing the adapted Video Interaction to Promote Positive Parenting (iBASIS-VIPP) versus no intervention. Families were randomly assigned to intervention or no intervention groups using a permuted block approach stratified by centre. Assessors, but not families or therapists, were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was infant attentiveness to parent. Regression analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ISCRTN Registry, number ISRCTN87373263. Findings We randomly assigned 54 families between April 11, 2011, and Dec 4, 2012 (28 to intervention, 26 to no intervention). Although CIs sometimes include the null, point estimates suggest that the intervention increased the primary outcome of infant attentiveness to parent (effect size 0.29, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.86, thus including possibilities ranging from a small negative treatment effect to a strongly positive treatment effect). For secondary outcomes, the intervention reduced autism-risk behaviours (0.50, CI -0.15 to 1.08), increased parental non-directiveness (0.81, 0.28 to 1.52), improved attention disengagement (0.48, -0.01 to 1.02), and improved parent-rated infant adaptive function (chi(2)[2] 15.39, p=0.0005). There was a possibility of nil or negative effect in language and responsivity to vowel change (P1: ES-0.62, CI -2.42 to 0.31; P2: -0.29, -1.55 to 0.71). Interpretation With the exception of the response to vowel change, our study showed positive estimates across a wide range of behavioural and brain function risk-markers and developmental outcomes that are consistent with a moderate intervention effect to reduce the risk for later autism. However, the estimates have wide CIs that include possible nil or small negative effects. The results are encouraging for development and prevention science, but need larger-scale replication to improve precision. Copyright (C) Green et al.

Among men with antisocial personality disorder, modification of the behaviour of those with additional diagnoses of psychopathy seems particularly resistant to punishment. Methods We did a case-control functional MRI (fMRI) study in 50 men, of whom 12 were violent off enders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy, 20 were violent off enders with antisocial personality disorder but not psychopathy, and 18 were healthy non-off enders. We used fMRI to measure brain activation associated with the representation of punishment or reward information during an event-related probabilistic response-reversal task, assessed with standard general linear-model-based analysis. Findings Off enders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy displayed discrete regions of increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula in response to punished errors during the task reversal phase, and decreased activation to all correct rewarded responses in the superior temporal cortex. This finding was in contrast to results for off enders without psychopathy and healthy non-off enders. Interpretation Punishment prediction error signalling in off enders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this finding indicates altered organisation of the information-processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making. This difference between violent off enders with antisocial personality disorder with and without psychopathy has implications for the causes of these disorders and for treatment approaches.

Recent studies suggest that sleep spindles and slow waves play a role in brain plasticity mechanisms and are associated with cognitive performance. However, it remains unknown whether these sleep parameters could serve as markers of cognitive decline in PD. Therefore, we examined whether alterations in sleep spindles and slow waves at baseline visit were associated with increased likelihood of developing dementia at follow-up in PD. Sixty-eight nondemented PD patients (64.9 +/- 8.8 years old; 46 men) participated in the study, along with 47 healthy individuals (65.0 +/- 10.6 years old; 30 men). All participants underwent baseline polysomnographic recording and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Sleep spindles (12-15 Hz) and slow waves (>75 mu V and <4 Hz) were automatically detected on all-night non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalography. At follow-up (mean: 4.5 years later), 18 PD patients developed dementia (70.2 +/- 7.6 years old; 13 men) and 50 remained dementia-free (63.0 +/- 8.5 years old; 33 men). Sleep spindle density and amplitude were lower in PD patients who converted to dementia compared with both patients who remained dementia-free and controls, mostly in posterior cortical regions (p < 0.05). Dementia-free PD patients were intermediate between dementia patients and controls, with lower baseline sleep spindle density in all cortical areas compared with controls (p < 0.01). In demented PD patients, lower sleep spindle amplitude in parietal and occipital areas was associated with poorer visuospatial abilities. Although slow wave amplitude was lower in PD patients compared with controls (p < 0.0001), no difference was observed between those who developed or did not develop dementia. Results demonstrate non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalographic abnormalities in PD patients. Sleep spindle activity was particularly impaired in PD patients who developed dementia, with a more posterior topographic pattern. Sleep spindle alterations are associated with later development of dementia in PD, and thus may serve as an additional marker of cognitive decline in these patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we present a child with a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by intractable seizures and significant tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary degeneration localized predominantly to the substantia nigra on neuropathology with absence of beta-amyloid plaques and Lewy or Pick bodies. Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous truncating mutation in Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot experiments demonstrated diminished SYNJ1 messenger RNA and protein. Knockout Synj1(-/-) mice have convulsions and die early in life. More recently, homozygous missense mutations have been reported in 2 families with early-onset parkinsonism and seizures. Our findings broaden the spectrum of disease associated with alteration of SYNJ1 and further implicate defects in synaptic vesicle recycling in the tauopathies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Method This study used a retrospective design. Clients were included who had completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the on-road driving evaluation from November 2006 to May 2009 (n=154) in a driving rehabilitation program in the Montreal Area. Total scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Useful Field of View risk categories, pass or fail outcomes from an on-road evaluation, as well as demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded from participants' medical charts. Results The Montreal Cognitive Assessment was found to have a sensitivity of 84.5% and a specificity of 50% with a cut-off of 25. It was significantly associated with the Useful Field of View risk category. Conclusion The Montreal Cognitive Assessment could be a valuable screening tool. However, its predictive validity is not strong enough to recommend its use as the sole instrument for identifying unfit drivers.

Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is implicated in mediating social behavior in teleost fish, although its specific role varies between species, sexes, life stages, and social context. To investigate whether the effects of AVT on behavior depend on social context, we used the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, which is well-known for its remarkable behavioral plasticity. We pharmacologically manipulated the AVT system in established socially dominant and subordinate A. burtoni males, as well as in males ascending to dominance status in a socially unstable environment. Our results show that exogenous AVT causes a stress response, as evidenced by reduced behavioral activity and increased circulating levels of cortisol in established dominant and subordinate males. Administration of the AVT antagonist Manning compound, on the other hand, did not affect established subordinate or dominant males. However, AVT antagonist-treated males ascending from subordinate to dominant status exhibited reduced aggressive and increased courtship behavior compared to vehicle-treated animals. Finally, we measured circulating cortisol levels and brain gene expression levels of AVT and its behaviorally relevant V1a2 receptor in all three social phenotypes and found that plasma cortisol and mRNA levels of both genes were increased in ascending males compared to dominant and subordinate males. Our results provide a more detailed understanding of the role of the AVT system in the regulation of complex behavior in a dynamically changing social environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Although several hypotheses have been proposed, the etiology of this disorder is still unknown. Methods: Behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical approaches were used to characterize the emotional phenotype, serotonergic and noradrenergic electrical activity, and corticosterone in melatonin MT1 receptor knockout mice and their wild type counterparts, during both light and dark phases. Results: Melatonin MT1 receptor knockout mice have decreased mobility in the forced swim and tail suspension tests as well as decreased sucrose consumption, mostly during the dark/inactive phase. These mood variations are reversed by chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine. In addition, MT1 receptor knockout mice exhibit psychomotor disturbances, higher serum levels of corticosterone the dark phase, and a blunted circadian variation of corticosterone levels. In vivo electrophysiological recordings show a decreased burst-firing activity of locus coeruleus norepinephrine neurons during the dark phase. The circadian physiological variation in the spontaneous firing activity of high-firing neuronal subpopulations of both norepinephrine neurons and dorsal raphe serotonin neurons are abolished in MT1 knockout mice. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that melatonin MT1 receptor knockout mice recapitulate several behavioral and neurobiological circadian changes of human melancholic depression and, for the first time, suggest that the MT1 receptor may be implicated in the pathogenesis of melancholic depression and is a potential pharmacological target for this mental condition.

Currently, at least 10% of the global population is affected by a mental health disorder, a figure that is set to increase year on year. Meanwhile, the rate of development of new CNS drugs has not increased for many years, despite unprecedented levels of investment. In response to this state of affairs, the Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum (CINP) convened a summit to discuss ways to reverse this disturbing trend through new partnerships to accelerate CNS drug discovery. The objectives of the Summit were to explore the issues affecting the value chain (i.e. the chain of activities or stakeholders that a company engages in/with to deliver a product to market) in brain research, thereby gaining insights from key stakeholders and developing actions to address unmet needs; to identify achievable objectives to address the issues; to develop action plans to bring about measurable improvements across the value chain and accelerate CNS drug discovery; and finally, to communicate recommendations to governments, the research and development community, and other relevant stakeholders. Summit outputs include the following action plans, aligned to the pressure points within the brain research-drug development value chain: Code of conduct dealing with conflict of interest issues, Prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment, Linking science and regulation, Patient involvement in trial design, definition of endpoints, etc., Novel trial design, Reproduction and confirmation of data, Update of intellectual property (IP) laws to facilitate repurposing and combination therapy (low priority), Large-scale, global patient registries, Editorials on nomenclature, biomarkers, and diagnostic tools, and Public awareness, with brain disease advocates to attend G8 meetings and World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual meetings in Davos, Switzerland. In this context Professor Barbara Sahakian recently made a formal presentation at the World Economic Forum (see Barbara Sahakian Blog from April 11, 2014, at https://forumblog.org/people/barbara-sahakian/) Full details of the discussions that formed the bases for these actions are presented in the main body of this document.

Steady-State Contrast Response Functions Provide a Sensitive and Objective Index of Amblyopic Deficits	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						amblyopia; steady-state EEG; dichoptic masking; contrast	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN-VISION; STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; BINOCULAR SUMMATION; INTEROCULAR SUPPRESSION; MASKING EXPERIMENTS; FACILITATION; NORMALIZATION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	PURPOSE. Visual deficits in amblyopia are neural in origin, yet are difficult to characterize with functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI). Our aim was to develop an objective electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm that can be used to provide a clinically useful index of amblyopic deficits. METHODS. We used steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to measure full contrast response functions in both amblyopic (n = 10, strabismic or mixed amblyopia, mean age: 44 years) and control (n = 5, mean age: 31 years) observers, both with and without a dichoptic mask. RESULTS. At the highest target contrast, the ratio of amplitudes across the weaker and stronger eyes was highly correlated (r = 0.76) with the acuity ratio between the eyes. We also found that the contrast response function in the amblyopic eye had both a greatly reduced amplitude and a shallower slope, but that surprisingly dichoptic masking was weaker than in controls. The results were compared with the predictions of a computational model of amblyopia and suggest a modification to the model whereby excitatory (but not suppressive) signals are attenuated in the amblyopic eye. CONCLUSIONS. We suggest that SSVEPs offer a sensitive and objective measure of the ocular imbalance in amblyopia and could be used to assess the efficacy of amblyopia therapies currently under development.

Although being extensively studied in other cell types, this transition is less well characterized in the corneal endothelium. Because of their neuroectodermal origin and their in vivo mitotic arrest, corneal endothelial cells represent a particular tissue that deserves more attention. This review article presents the basic principles underlying EMT/EndMT, with emphasis on the current knowledge regarding the corneal endothelium. Furthermore, this review discusses cell culture conditions and major cell signaling pathways that have been identified as EndMT-triggering factors. Finally, it summarizes strategies that have been developed to inhibit EndMT in corneal endothelial cell culture. The review of current studies on corneal and classical EndMT highlights some research avenues to pursue in the future and underscores the need to extend our knowledge of this process in order to optimize usage of these cells in regenerative medicine.

J	Dickinson, DL; Masclet, D				Dickinson, David L.; Masclet, David			Emotion venting and punishment in public good experiments	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS			English	Article						Sanctions; Public good; Experiment; Venting emotions	VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS MECHANISM; NEURAL BASIS; ALTRUISTIC PUNISHMENT; COLLECTIVE ACTION; COOPERATION; SANCTIONS; COMMUNICATION; PROVISION; BEHAVIOR; CATHARSIS	Experimental studies have shown that sanctions effectively deter free riding within groups. However, the overuse of costly punishment may actually harm overall welfare. A main reason for over-punishment is that free-riders generate negative emotions that likely favor excessive punishments. In this paper we ask whether the venting of one's emotions in different ways can reduce the level of excessive punishment in a standard VCM-with-punishment environment while preserving the norm enforcement properties of punishment. We find that venting emotions reduces (excessive) punishment, and under certain conditions the net effect is an increase in final payoffs (i.e., welfare) to the group. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Severe Multisensory Speech Integration Deficits in High-Functioning School-Aged Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Their Resolution During Early Adolescence	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						autism spectrum disorders; cross-modal; development; sensory integration; speech-in-noise	NOISY ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; CONNECTIVITY MRI; WHITE-MATTER; SEEING VOICES; LOW-LEVEL; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; CORTEX; INDIVIDUALS	Under noisy listening conditions, visualizing a speaker's articulations substantially improves speech intelligibility. This multisensory speech integration ability is crucial to effective communication, and the appropriate development of this capacity greatly impacts a child's ability to successfully navigate educational and social settings. Research shows that multisensory integration abilities continue developing late into childhood. The primary aim here was to track the development of these abilities in children with autism, since multisensory deficits are increasingly recognized as a component of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. The abilities of high-functioning ASD children (n = 84) to integrate seen and heard speech were assessed cross-sectionally, while environmental noise levels were systematically manipulated, comparing them with age-matched neurotypical children (n = 142). Severe integration deficits were uncovered in ASD, which were increasingly pronounced as background noise increased. These deficits were evident in school-aged ASD children (5-12 year olds), but were fully ameliorated in ASD children entering adolescence (13-15 year olds). The severity of multisensory deficits uncovered has important implications for educators and clinicians working in ASD. We consider the observation that the multisensory speech system recovers substantially in adolescence as an indication that it is likely amenable to intervention during earlier childhood, with potentially profound implications for the development of social communication abilities in ASD children.

The aim of this study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance. Methods: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T. Results: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99) and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5%, P < .001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P < .001). Conclusions: The HarP has high measurement stability compared with local segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human tracers. Hippocampi segmented with the HarP can be used as a reference for the qualification of human tracers and automated segmentation algorithms. (C) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association.

Methods: The panel received a questionnaire regarding whole hippocampus boundaries and segmentation procedures. Quantitative information was supplied to allow evidence-based answers. A recursive and anonymous Delphi procedure was used to achieve convergence. Significance of agreement among panelists was assessed by exact probability on Fisher's and binomial tests. Results: Agreement was significant on the inclusion of alveus/fimbria (P = .021), whole hippocampal tail (P = .013), medial border of the body according to visible morphology (P = .0006), and on this combined set of features (P = .001). This definition captures 100% of hippocampal tissue, 100% of Alzheimer's disease-related atrophy, and demonstrated good reliability on preliminary intrarater (0.98) and inter-rater (0.94) estimates. Discussion: Consensus was achieved among international experts with respect to hippocampal segmentation using MR resulting in a harmonized segmentation protocol. (C) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association.

Eadc Adni Working Grp Harmonized P	Training labels for hippocampal segmentation based on the EADC-ADNI harmonized hippocampal protocol	ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA			English	Article						Harmonized protocol; Benchmark images; Automated segmentation algorithms; Algorithm training; MRI; Hippocampus; Hippocampal segmentation	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; BIOMARKERS; DISEASE	Background: The European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Harmonized Protocol (HarP) is a Delphi definition of manual hippocampal segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that can be used as the standard of truth to train new tracers, and to validate automated segmentation algorithms. Training requires large and representative data sets of segmented hippocampi. This work aims to produce a set of HarP labels for the proper training and certification of tracers and algorithms. Methods: Sixty-eight 1.5 T and 67 3 T volumetric structural ADNI scans from different subjects, balanced by age, medial temporal atrophy, and scanner manufacturer, were segmented by five qualified HarP tracers whose absolute interrater intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.953 and 0.975 (left and right). Labels were validated as HarP compliant through centralized quality check and correction. Results: Hippocampal volumes (mm(3)) were as follows: controls: left = 3060 (standard deviation [SD], 502), right = 3120 (SD, 897); mild cognitive impairment (MCI): left = 2596 (SD, 447), right = 2686 (SD, 473); and Alzheimer's disease (AD): left = 2301 (SD, 492), right = 2445 (SD, 525). Volumes significantly correlated with atrophy severity at Scheltens' scale (Spearman's rho = < -0.468, P = <.0005). Cerebrospinal fluid spaces (mm(3)) were as follows: controls: left = 23 (32), right = 25 (25); MCI: left = 15 (13), right = 22 (16); and AD: left = 11(13), right = 20 (25). Five subjects (3.7%) presented with unusual anatomy. Conclusions: This work provides reference hippocampal labels for the training and certification of automated segmentation algorithms. The publicly released labels will allow the widespread implementation of the standard segmentation protocol. (C) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We proceeded to annotate the genome of the 0. novo-ulmi strain H327 that was sequenced in 2012. The 31.784-Mb nuclear genome (50.1 % GC) is organized into 8 chromosomes containing a total of 8,640 protein-coding genes that we validated with RNA sequencing analysis. Approximately 53% of these genes have their closest match to Grosmannia clavigera kw1407, followed by 36% in other close Sordariomycetes, 5% in other Pezizomycotina, and surprisingly few (5%) orphans. A relatively small portion (-3.4%) of the genome is occupied by repeat sequences; however, the mechanism of repeat-induced point mutation appears active in this genome. Approximately 76% of the proteins could be assigned functions using Gene Ontology analysis; we identified 311 carbohydrate-active enzymes, 48 cytochrome P450s, and 1,731 proteins potentially involved in pathogen host interaction, along with 7 clusters of fungal secondary metabolites. Complementary mating-type locus sequencing, mating tests, and culturing in the presence of elm terpenes were conducted. Our analysis identified a specific genetic arsenal impacting the sexual and vegetative growth, phytopathogenicity, and signaling/plant defense degradation relationship between 0. novo-ulmi and its elm host and insect vectors.

In the context of limited resources, it is often necessary to prioritize investigation when multiple cases are reported. Public health personnel currently prioritize contact investigation intuitively based on past experience. Decision-support software using patient attributes to predict the probability of a TB case being involved in recent transmission could aid in this prioritization, but a prediction model is needed to drive such software. Methods: We developed a logistic regression model using the clinical and demographic information of TB cases reported to Montreal Public Health between 1997 and 2007. The reference standard for transmission was DNA fingerprint analysis. We measured the predictive performance, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the ROC (AUC). Results: Among 1552 TB cases enrolled in the study, 314 (20.2%) were involved in recent transmission. The AUC of the model was 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-0.68), which is significantly better than random prediction. The maximized values of sensitivity and specificity on the ROC were 0.53 and 0.67, respectively. Conclusions: The characteristics of a TB patient reported to public health can be used to predict whether the newly diagnosed case is associated with recent transmission as opposed to reactivation of latent infection.

Neuropsychological performance before and after partial or complete insulectomy in patients with epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Cognition; Epilepsy; Insula; Neuropsychology; Neurosurgery; Speech	INTRINSIC INSULAR TUMORS; DECISION-MAKING; SURGICAL RESECTION; CLINICAL ARTICLE; CORTEX LESIONS; LOBE; ARTICULATION; AVOIDANCE; SURGERY; INJURY	Resection of the insular cortex is becoming more frequent as it is increasingly recognized that a nonnegligible proportion of surgical candidates with drug-resistant epilepsy have an epileptogenic zone that involves the insula. In the last decades, however, the insula has been proposed to be involved in several neuropsychological functions, and there is a lack of documentation on whether partial or complete insulectomy results in permanent cognitive impairments in this clinical population. In this study, we conducted standard preoperative and postoperative neuropsychological assessments in 18 patients undergoing epilepsy surgery that included the removal of the insula in the right (n = 13) or the left (n = 5) hemisphere. Postoperative testing was conducted at least five months after surgery. Cognitive impairments were common and heterogeneous prior to surgery, with language and verbal memory impairments being especially frequent among patients in whom epileptic seizures originated from the left hemisphere. After surgery, declines and improvements occurred on a variety of outcomes, although new deficits were relatively infrequent among patients who had obtained normal performance at baseline. Statistical comparisons between preoperative and postoperative assessments revealed significant deterioration of only one outcome - the color naming condition of the Stroop test - which relies on oro-motor speed and lexical access. These findings suggest that partial or complete resection of the insular cortex in patients with drug-refractory epilepsy can be conducted without major permanent neuropsychological impairments in a vast majority of patients. However, small decrements in specific cognitive functions can be expected, which should also be taken into account when considering the surgical option in this clinical population.

To understand the pathophysiology of the disease we generated a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis III type C by germline inactivation of the Hgsnat gene. At 6-8 months mice showed hyperactivity, and reduced anxiety. Cognitive memory decline was detected at 10 months and at 12-13 months mice showed signs of unbalanced hesitant walk and urinary retention. Lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulphate was observed in hepatocytes, splenic sinus endothelium, cerebral microglia, liver Kupffer cells, fibroblasts and pericytes. Starting from 5 months, brain neurons showed enlarged, structurally abnormal mitochondria, impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism, and storage of densely packed autofluorescent material, gangliosides, lysozyme, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid-beta. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that deficiency of acetyl-CoA: alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase causes lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulphate in microglial cells followed by their activation and cytokine release. They also show mitochondrial dysfunction in the neurons and neuronal loss explaining why mucopolysaccharidosis III type C manifests primarily as a neurodegenerative disease.

J	Genesee, F				Genesee, Fred			Myths About Early Childhood Bilingualism	CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGY-PSYCHOLOGIE CANADIENNE			English	Article						bilingualism; bilingual acquisition; child bilingualism	LANGUAGE DIFFERENTIATION; FRENCH IMMERSION; SOCIAL-CLASS; CHILDREN; ACQUISITION; LEARNERS; AGE; BACKGROUNDS; PERFORMANCE; ABILITIES	There has been growing interest in children who learn language in diverse contexts and under diverse circumstances. In particular, dual language acquisition has become the focus of much research attention, arguably as a reflection of the growing awareness that dual language learning is common in children. A deeper understanding of dual language learning under different circumstances is important to ensure the formulation of theories of language learning that encompass all language learners and to provide critical information for clinical and other practical decisions that touch the lives of all language learners. This article reviews research findings on dual language learning in both school and nonschool settings, among simultaneous and sequential bilinguals, and in typically developing learners and those with an impaired capacity for language learning. Key findings with respect to 4 common myths about dual language acquisition in young learners are discussed: (1) the myth of the monolingual brain; (2) the myth that younger is better; (3) the myth of time-on-task; and (4) the myth that bilingualism is not advisable for children with developmental disorders or academic challenges.

Over 170 SACS mutations have been reported worldwide and are thought to cause loss of function of sacsin, a poorly characterized and massive 520 kDa protein. To establish an animal model and to examine the pathophysiological basis of ARSACS, we generated Sacs knockout (Sacs(-/-)) mice. Null animals displayed an abnormal gait with progressive motor, cerebellar and peripheral nerve dysfunctions highly reminiscent of ARSACS. These clinical features were accompanied by an early onset, progressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells followed by spinal motor neuron loss and peripheral neuropathy. Importantly, loss of sacsin function resulted in abnormal accumulation of non-phosphorylated neurofilament (NF) bundles in the somatodendritic regions of vulnerable neuronal populations, a phenotype also observed in an ARSACS brain. Moreover, motor neurons cultured from Sacs(-/-) embryos exhibited a similar NF rearrangement with significant reduction in mitochondrial motility and elongated mitochondria. The data points to alterations in the NF cytoskeleton and defects in mitochondrial dynamics as the underlying pathophysiological basis of ARSACS.

Cytoplasmic sequestration of FUS/TLS associated with ALS alters histone marks through loss of nuclear protein arginine methyltransferase 1	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; CU/ZN-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; MESSENGER-RNA LEVELS; MOTOR-NEURONS; DNA-DAMAGE; EXPRESSION PROFILE; FUS MUTATIONS; IN-VIVO; METHYLATION; LOCALIZATION	Mutations in the RNA-binding protein FUS/TLS (FUS) have been linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although predominantly nuclear, this heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear protein (hnRNP) has multiple functions in RNA processing including intracellulartrafficking. In ALS, mutant or wild-type (WT) FUS can form neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Asymmetric arginine methylation of FUS by the class 1 arginine methyltransferase, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FUS. In motor neurons of primary spinal cord cultures, redistribution of endogenous mouse and that of ectopically expressed WT or mutant human FUS to the cytoplasm led to nuclear depletion of PRMT1, abrogating methylation of its nuclear substrates. Specifically, hypomethylation of arginine 3 of histone 4 resulted in decreased acetylation of lysine 9/14 of histone 3 and transcriptional repression. Distribution of neuronal PRMT1 coincident with FUS also was detected in vivo in the spinal cord of FUSR495x transgenic mice. However, nuclear PRMT1 was not stable postmortem obviating meaningful evaluation of ALS autopsy cases. This study provides evidence for loss of PRMT1 function as a consequence of cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS in the pathogenesis of ALS, including changes in the histone code regulating gene transcription.

This is achieved by measuring the ratio of the fluorescence at two wavelengths in combination with normalization techniques based on diffuse reflectance measurements to evaluate tissue attenuation variations for different depths. It is demonstrated that fluorescence topography can be achieved up to a 5 mm depth using a near-infrared dye with millimeter depth accuracy in turbid media having optical properties representative of normal brain tissue. Wide-field depth estimates are made using optical technology integrated onto a commercial surgical microscope, making this approach feasible for real-world applications.

The emergence of this idea has catapulted the neurosciences beyond the synaptic, chemical conception of the brain, its diseases, and its humans that dominated the second half of the 20th century. I explore the figure of what I call the neurological human to bring such mutations of the neuroscientific order of knowledge into a sharp analytical focus.

Subcortical and cortical morphological anomalies as an endophenotype in obsessive-compulsive disorder	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						endophenotypes; genetics; neuroanatomy; obsessive-compulsive disorder; orbitofrontal cortex; striatum	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; UNAFFECTED RELATIVES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTIONS; BRAIN ACTIVATION; SHAPE DEFORMITY; VOLUME; THICKNESS; TWINS	Endophentoypes, quantifiable traits lying on the causal chain between a clinical phenotype and etiology, can be used to accelerate genomic discovery in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here we identify the neuroanatomic changes that are shared by 22 OCD adult and adolescent patients and 25 of their unaffected siblings who are at genetic risk for the disorder. Comparisons were made against 47 age and sex matched healthy controls. We defined the surface morphology of the striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus, and thickness of the cerebral cortex. Patients with OCD show significant surface expansion compared with healthy controls, following adjustment for multiple comparisons, in interconnected regions of the caudate, thalamus and right orbitofrontal cortex. Their unaffected siblings show similar, significant expansion, most marked in the ventromedial caudate bilaterally, the right pulvinar thalamic nucleus and the right orbitofrontal cortex. These regions define a network that has been consistently implicated in OCD. In addition, both patients with OCD and unaffected siblings showed similar increased thickness of the right precuneus, which receives rich input from the thalamic pulvinar nuclei and the left medial temporal cortex. Anatomic change within the orbitofrontostriatal and posterior brain circuitry thus emerges as a promising endophenotype for OCD.

IMAGEN Consortium	Single nucleotide polymorphism in the neuroplastin locus associates with cortical thickness and intellectual ability in adolescents	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						adolescent; cortical thickness; intelligence; lateralization; neural stem cell; neuroimaging	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; MENTAL-RETARDATION; GENETIC INFLUENCES; KERNEL MACHINES; SELECTION BIAS; HUMAN BRAIN; CHILDREN	Despite the recognition that cortical thickness is heritable and correlates with intellectual ability in children and adolescents, the genes contributing to individual differences in these traits remain unknown. We conducted a large-scale association study in 1583 adolescents to identify genes affecting cortical thickness. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n = 54 837) within genes whose expression changed between stages of growth and differentiation of a human neural stem cell line were selected for association analyses with average cortical thickness. We identified a variant, rs7171755, associating with thinner cortex in the left hemisphere (P = 1.12 x 10(-7)), particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes. Localized effects of this SNP on cortical thickness differently affected verbal and nonverbal intellectual abilities. The rs7171755 polymorphism acted in cis to affect expression in the human brain of the synaptic cell adhesion glycoprotein-encoding gene NPTN. We also found that cortical thickness and NPTN expression were on average higher in the right hemisphere, suggesting that asymmetric NPTN expression may render the left hemisphere more sensitive to the effects of NPTN mutations, accounting for the lateralized effect of rs7171755 found in our study. Altogether, our findings support a potential role for regional synaptic dysfunctions in forms of intellectual deficits.	[Desrivieres, S.; Lourdusamy, A.; Jia, T.; Loth, E.; Medina, L.

Inactivating the infralimbic but not prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex facilitates the extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Long-Evans rats	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Inhibitory conditioning; Pavlovian conditioning; Instrumental conditioning; Sucrose; Learning; Prefrontal cortex	FEAR-POTENTIATED STARTLE; CONTEXT-INDUCED RELAPSE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PLACE PREFERENCE; COCAINE-SEEKING; ALCOHOL-SEEKING; D-CYCLOSERINE; EXPRESSION	The infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL) has been posited as a common node in distinct neural circuits that mediate the extinction of appetitive and aversive conditioning. However, appetitive extinction is typically assessed using instrumental conditioning procedures, whereas the extinction of aversive conditioning is customarily studied using Pavlovian assays. The role of the IL in the extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning remains underexplored. We investigated the involvement of the IL and prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (PrL) in appetitive extinction in Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning assays in male, Long-Evans rats. Following acquisition, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist solution (0.03 nmol muscimol; 0.3 nmol baclofen; 0.3 mu l/side) was bilaterally microinfused into the IL or PrL to pharmacologically inactivate each region before the first extinction session. Compared to saline, PrL inactivation did not affect the acquisition of extinction or the recall of extinction memory 24-h later. IL inactivation caused a more rapid extinction of Pavlovian conditioning, but had no effect on the extinction of instrumental conditioning or extinction recall. IL inactivation during a Pavlovian conditioning session in which conditioned stimulus (CS) trials were paired with sucrose did not affect CS-elicited behaviour, but increased responding during intervals that did not contain the CS. The same manipulation did not impact lever pressing for sucrose. These findings suggest that the IL may normally maintain Pavlovian conditioned responding when an anticipated appetitive CS is unexpectedly withheld, and that this region has distinct roles in the expression of Pavlovian conditioning when an appetitive unconditioned stimulus is either presented or omitted.

Its deficiency is the underlying cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), a disorder primarily associated with, but not limited to, chronic alcoholism. Thiamine deficiency leads to the development of impaired energy metabolism due to mitochondrial dysfunction in focal regions of the brain resulting in cerebral vulnerability. The consequences of this include oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, inflammatory responses, decreased neurogenesis, blood-brain barrier disruption, lactic acidosis and a reduction in astrocyte functional integrity involving a loss of glutamate transporters and other astrocyte-specific proteins which together contribute in a major way to the resulting neurodegeneration. Exactly how these factors acting in concert lead to the demise of neurons is unclear. In this review we reassess their relative importance in the light of more recent findings and discuss therapeutic possibilities that may provide hope for the future for individuals with WE.

In this study, we investigated age-related changes in expressive language lateralization patterns in a population of children (3-6 and 7-10 years old), adolescents (11-16 years old), and young adults (19-30 years old). During functional near-infrared spectroscopy recordings, all participants performed a verbal fluency task, which consisted in naming as many words as possible belonging to a given semantic category. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured in bilateral frontal and temporal cortical areas. During the language task, results showed a strong left hemisphere response along with weaker right hemisphere activation in all groups. Age-related increases in hemodynamic responses were found bilaterally, with younger children showing smaller hemodynamic responses than adolescents and adults in both hemispheres. Overall, these findings confirm that a left hemisphere specialization is already established in young children and persists through adulthood. Early left hemisphere specialization for expressive language suggests that language development hinges on structural and functional properties of the human brain with little reorganization occurring with development.

Ill-defined problem solving in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: Linking episodic memory to effective solution generation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Episodic memory; Medial temporal lobes; Mild cognitive impairment; Problem solving	AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FUTURE THINKING; HIPPOCAMPAL COMPLEX; PROACTIVE BRAIN; DECISION-MAKING; OLDER-ADULTS; SIMULATION; TASK; SPECIFICITY	It is well accepted that the medial temporal lobes (MTL), and the hippocampus specifically, support episodic memory processes. Emerging evidence suggests that these processes also support the ability to effectively solve ill-defined problems which are those that do not have a set routine or solution. To test the relation between episodic memory and problem solving, we examined the ability of individuals with single domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a condition characterized by episodic memory impairment, to solve ill-defined social problems. Participants with aMCI and age and education matched controls were given a battery of tests that included standardized neuropsychological measures, the Autobiographical Interview (Levine et al., 2002) that scored for episodic content in descriptions of past personal events, and a measure of ill-defined social problem solving. Corroborating previous findings, the aMCI group generated less episodically rich narratives when describing past events. Individuals with aMCI also generated less effective solutions when solving ill-defined problems compared to the control participants. Correlation analyses demonstrated that the ability to recall episodic elements from autobiographical memories was positively related to the ability to effectively solve ill-defined problems. The ability to solve these ill-defined problems was related to measures of activities of daily living. In conjunction with previous reports, the results of the present study point to a new functional role of episodic memory in ill-defined goal-directed behavior and other non-memory tasks that require flexible thinking. Our findings also have implications for the cognitive and behavioural profile of aMCI by suggesting that the ability to effectively solve ill-defined problems is related to sustained functional independence.

In this study, a group of late learners of Spanish whose native language is English and a group of Spanish monolinguals were compared while they read sentences, some of which contained syntactic violations. A brain complex network analysis approach was used to assess the time-varying topological properties of the functional networks extracted from the electro-encephalography (EEG) recording. Late L2 learners showed a lower degree of parallel information transfer and a slower propagation between regions of the brain functional networks while processing sentences containing a gender mismatch condition as compared with a standard sentence configuration. In contrast, no such differences between these conditions were detected in the Spanish monolinguals. This indicates that when a morphosyntactic language incongruence that does not exist in the native language is presented in the second language, the neural activation pattern is configured differently in highly proficient late bilinguals than in monolinguals.

In this study, we have analyzed the impact of levetiracetam (LEV) in the pilocarpine model of MTLE. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 19) were injected with pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce a status epilepticus. Twelve animals were used as controls and seven were treated with LEV. They were implanted with bipolar electrodes in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), dentate gyrus (DG) and subiculum and EEG-video monitored continuously from day 4 to day 14 after SE. Results: Only 29% of LEV-treated animals had seizures compared to all controls following a latent period that was similar in duration. Seizure rates were lower in LEV-treated animals. In LEV-treated animals without seizures, lower interictal spike rates were found in all regions compared to controls. Analysis of interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) revealed that LEV-treated animals without seizures had lower rates of interictal spikes with ripples (80-200 Hz) in CA3, EC and subiculum (p < 0.01), whereas rates of interictal spikes with fast ripples (250-500 Hz) were significantly lower in CA3 and subiculum, compared to controls. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the anti-ictogenic properties of LEV are mirrored by decreases of interictal spike rate in temporal lobe regions, and are accompanied by subregion-specific decreases of HFO occurrence in CA3 and subiculum. Overall, this evidence suggest that LEV may inhibit neural network activity in regions that are known to play important roles in MTLE. (C) 2014 British Epilepsy Association.

The question of how musical sounds can have such profound emotional and rewarding effects has been a topic of interest throughout generations. At a fundamental level, listening to music involves tracking a series of sound events over time. Because humans are experts in pattern recognition, temporal predictions are constantly generated, creating a sense of anticipation. We summarize how complex cognitive abilities and cortical processes integrate with fundamental subcortical reward and motivation systems in the brain to give rise to musical pleasure. This work builds on previous theoretical models that emphasize the role of prediction in music appreciation by integrating these ideas with recent neuroscientific evidence.

The development of Trk radiopharmaceuticals would offer unique opportunities toward a more complete understanding of this emerging therapeutic target. To that end, we first developed [C-11]GW441756 ([C-11] 9), a high affinity photoisomerizable pan-Trk inhibitor, as a, lead radiotracer for our positron emission tomography (PET) program. Efficient carbbn-11 radiolabeling afforded [C]9 in high radiochemical yields (isolated RCY, 25.9% +/- 5.7%). In vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain and TrkB-expressing human neuroblastoma cryosections confirmed that [C-11]9 specifically binds to Trk receptors in vitro. MicroPET studies revealed that binding of [C-11]9 in the rodent brain was mostly nonspecific despite initial high brain uptake (SUVmax = 20). Modeling studies of the 4-aza-2-oxindole scaffold led to the successful identification of a small series of high affinity fluorinated and methoxy derivatized pan-Trk inhibitors based on our lead compound 9. Out of this series, the fluorinated compound 10 was selected for initial evaluation and radiolabeled with fluorine 18 (isolated RCY, 2.5% +/- 0.6%). Compound [F-18]10 demonstrated excellent Trk selectivity in a panel of cancer relevant kinase targets and a promising in vitro profile in tumors and brain sections but high oxidative metabolic susceptibility leading to nonspecific brain distribution in vivo. The information gained in this study will guide further exploration of the 4-aza-2-oxindole scaffold as a lead for Trk PET ligand development.

COMT Haplotypes Modulate Associations of Antenatal Maternal Anxiety and Neonatal Cortical Morphology	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; HUMAN PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; PANIC DISORDER; GENETIC-VARIATION; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; ENZYME-ACTIVITY; STRESS; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Objective: Exposure to antenatal maternal anxiety and complex genetic variations may shape fetal brain development. In particular, the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, located on chromosome 22q11.2, regulates catecholamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex and is implicated in anxiety,. pain, and stress responsivity. This study examined whether individual singte-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the COMT gene and their haplotypes moderate the association between antenatal maternal anxiety and in utero cortical development. Method: A total of 146 neonates were genotyped and underwent MRI shortly after birth. Neonatal cortical morphology was characterized using cortical thickness. Antenatal maternal anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at week 26 of pregnancy. Results: Individual COMT SNPs (val158met, rs737865, and rs165599) modulated the association between antenatal maternal anxiety and the prefrontal and parietal cortical thickness in neonates. Based on haplotype trend regression analysis, findings also showed that among rs737865-va/158met-rs165599 haplotypes, the A-vat-G (AGG) haplotype. probabilities modulated positive associations of antenatal maternal anxiety with cortical thickness in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right superior parietal cortex and precuneus. In contrast, the G-met-A (GAA) haplotype probabilities modulated negative associations of antenatal maternal anxiety with cortical thickness in bilateral precentral gyrus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: These results suggest that the association between maternal anxiety and in utero neurodevelopment is modified through complex genetic variation in COMT. Such genetic moderation may explain, in part, the variation in phenotypic outcomes in offspring associated with maternal emotional well-being.

Febrile seizures are sometimes a precursor in childhood of lifelong epilepsy. We investigated whether studying functional connectivity in children with febrile seizures could help understand the mechanisms underlying their long-term seizure susceptibility. Methods: EEG was recorded during rest and intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) in 12 FS patients, 5 siblings and 15 control children between 6 and 36 months of age. Original EEG data were transformed into source space using a multiple regional source model. Source coherence values were calculated for the interfrontal, interoccipital and occipito-frontal connections for the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. Results: Our results suggest enhanced delta and theta frequency EEG source coherence in patients with FSs compared to siblings and control children, both under resting conditions and during IPS, more consistent for the theta band and the occipito-frontal connections. Conclusions: Enhanced connectivity in patients with FSs could indicate a seizure-prone state and interfere with the maturation of cerebral networks. Further prospective studies are needed to assess whether hyperconnectivity is a risk factor for epileptogenesis and neurodevelopmental disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Requirement for interleukin-1 to drive brain inflammation reveals tissue-specific mechanisms of innate immunity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						innate immunity; interleukin-1 (IL-1); neuroinflammation; neutrophil	RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; STROKE; MICE; IL-1-BETA; DAMAGE; EXPRESSION; INFECTION; RESPONSES; DEATH; PHASE	The immune system is implicated in a wide range of disorders affecting the brain and is, therefore, an attractive target for therapy. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent regulator of the innate immune system important for host defense but is also associated with injury and disease in the brain. Here, we show that IL-1 is a key mediator driving an innate immune response to inflammatory challenge in the mouse brain but is dispensable in extracerebral tissues including the lung and peritoneum. We also demonstrate that IL-1 alpha is an important ligand contributing to the CNS dependence on IL-1 and that IL-1 derived from the CNS compartment (most likely microglia) is the major source driving this effect. These data reveal previously unknown tissue-specific requirements for IL-1 in driving innate immunity and suggest that IL-1-mediated inflammation in the brain could be selectively targeted without compromising systemic innate immune responses that are important for resistance to infection. This property could be exploited to mitigate injury- and disease-associated inflammation in the brain without increasing susceptibility to systemic infection, an important complication in several neurological disorders.

High-Dose Immunosuppressive Therapy and Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) A 3-Year Interim Report	JAMA NEUROLOGY			English	Article							DISEASE-ACTIVITY; OUTCOME MEASURE; WORKING PARTY; BLOOD; TRIAL; NATALIZUMAB; REPERTOIRE; GUIDELINES; EXPERIENCE	IMPORTANCE Most patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) who receive approved disease-modifying therapies experience breakthrough disease and accumulate neurologic disability. High-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT) with autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) may, in contrast, induce sustained remissions in early MS. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and durability of MS disease stabilization through 3 years after HDIT/HCT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) is an ongoing, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial of HDIT/HCT for patients with RRMS who experienced relapses with loss of neurologic function while receiving disease-modifying therapies during the 18 months before enrolling. Participants are evaluated through 5 years after HCT. This report is a prespecified, 3-year interim analysis of the trial. Thirty-six patients with RRMS from referral centers were screened; 25 were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS Autologous peripheral blood stem cell grafts were CD34(+) selected; the participants then received high-dose treatment with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan as well as rabbit antithymocyte globulin before autologous HCT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point of HALT-MS is event-free survival defined as survival without death or disease activity from any one of the following outcomes: (1) confirmed loss of neurologic function, (2) clinical relapse, or (3) new lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging. Toxic effects are reported using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. RESULTS Grafts were collected from 25 patients, and 24 of these individuals received HDIT/HCT. The median follow-up period was 186 weeks (interquartile range, 176-250) weeks). Overall event-free survival was 78.4%(90% CI, 60.1%-89.0%) at 3 years. Progression-free survival and clinical relapse-free survival were 90.9%(90% CI, 73.7%-97.1%) and 86.3%(90% CI, 68.1%-94.5%), respectively, at 3 years. Adverse events were consistent with expected toxic effects associated with HDIT/HCT, and no acute treatment-related neurologic adverse events were observed. Improvements were noted in neurologic disability, quality-of-life, and functional scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE At 3 years, HDIT/HCT without maintenance therapy was effective for inducing sustained remission of active RRMS and was associated with improvements in neurologic function. Treatment was associated with few serious early complications or unexpected adverse events.

Effects of lithium on cortical thickness and hippocampal subfield volumes in psychotic bipolar disorder	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Lithium; Bipolar disorder; Hippocampus; Cortical thickness; MRI; Neuro-protective	GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS; TEMPORAL-LOBE STRUCTURES; PHENOTYPES B-SNIP; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; SCHIZOPHRENIA NETWORK; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PROTEIN BCL-2; IN-VIVO	Relative to healthy controls, lithium free bipolar patients exhibit significant gray matter abnormalities. Lithium, the long-time reference standard medication treatment for bipolar disorder, has been proposed to be neuro-protective against these abnormalities. However, its effects on cortical thickness and hippocampal subfield (HSF) volumes remain unstudied and unclear, respectively, in bipolar disorder. This study included 342 healthy controls (HC), 51 lithium free PBD patients (NoLi), and 51 PBD patients taking lithium (Li). Regional gray matter thickness and HSF volume values were extracted from 3T MRI images. After matching NoLi and Li samples, regions where HC differed from either Li or NoLi were identified. In regions of significant or trending HC-NoLi difference, Li-NoLi comparisons were made. No significant HC-Li thickness or HSF volume differences were found. Significantly thinner occipital cortices were observed in NoLi compared to HC. In these regions, Li consistently exhibited non-significant trends for greater cortical thickness relative to NoLi. Significantly less volume was observed in NoLi compared to both HC and Li in right HSFs. Our results suggest that PBD in patients not treated with Li is associated with thinner occipital cortices and reduced HSF volumes,compared with HC. Patients treated with Li exhibited significantly larger HSF volumes than NoLi, and those treated with Li were no different from HC in cortical thickness or hippocampal volumes. This evidence directly supports the hypothesis that Li may counteract the locally thinner and smaller gray matter structure found in PBD. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Giakoumatos, C.

The techniques included end-to-end sacral root repairs, transfer of roots from other spinal segments to sacral roots, transfer of intercostal nerves to sacral roots, transfer of various somatic nerves to the pelvic or pudendal nerve, direct reinnervation of the detrusor muscle, or creation of an artificial reflex pathway between the skin and the bladder via the central nervous system. All of these surgical techniques have demonstrated specific strengths and limitations. The findings made to date already indicate appropriate patient populations for each procedure, but a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of each technique to restore urinary function after bladder decentralization is required to guide future research and potential clinical application.

Characterization of Human Disease Phenotypes Associated with Mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR, and IFIH1	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A			English	Article						Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome; bilateral striatal necrosis; spastic paraparesis; type I interferon; interferon signature	AICARDI-GOUTIERES-SYNDROME; SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; PROGRESSIVE FAMILIAL ENCEPHALOPATHY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LYMPHOCYTOSIS; I INTERFERON SIGNATURE; DNA EXONUCLEASE TREX1; CEREBRAL-PALSY; CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; BASAL GANGLIA; GENE	Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is an inflammatory disease occurring due to mutations in any of TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR or IFIH1. We report on 374 patients from 299 families with mutations in these seven genes. Most patients conformed to one of two fairly stereotyped clinical profiles; either exhibiting an in utero disease-onset (74 patients; 22.8% of all patients where data were available), or a post-natal presentation, usually within the first year of life (223 patients; 68.6%), characterized by a sub-acute encephalopathy and a loss of previously acquired skills. Other clinically distinct phenotypes were also observed; particularly, bilateral striatal necrosis (13 patients; 3.6%) and non-syndromic spastic paraparesis (12 patients; 3.4%). We recorded 69 deaths (19.3% of patients with follow-up data). Of 285 patients for whom data were available, 210 (73.7%) were profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function. Chilblains, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy, intracerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, bowel inflammation and systemic lupus erythematosus were seen frequently enough to be confirmed as real associations with the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome phenotype. We observed a robust relationship between mutations in all seven genes with increased type I interferon activity in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and the increased expression of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts in peripheral blood. We recorded a positive correlation between the level of cerebrospinal fluid interferon activity assayed within one year of disease presentation and the degree of subsequent disability. Interferon-stimulated gene transcripts remained high in most patients, indicating an ongoing disease process. On the basis of substantial morbidity and mortality, our data highlight the urgent need to define coherent treatment strategies for the phenotypes associated with mutations in the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-related genes. Our findings also make it clear that a window of therapeutic opportunity exists relevant to the majority of affected patients and indicate that the assessment of type I interferon activity might serve as a useful biomarker in future clinical trials.

The consequences of these sleep disturbances on everyday activities are not well documented and are therefore not considered in the evaluation of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs). The goal of this narrative review is to explore the consequences of poor sleep quality on cognition and ADLs in the acute and subacute stages of a moderate and severe TBI, when patients are in acute care or inpatient rehabilitation. MethodsWe will present an overview of normal sleep and its role in cognitive functioning, and then present the findings of studies that have investigated sleep characteristics in hospital settings and the consequences of sleep disturbances on ADLs. ResultsDuring hospitalisation, TBI patients present severe sleep disturbances such as insomnia and sleep fragmentation, which are probably influenced by both the medical condition and the hospital or rehabilitation environment. Sleep disruption is associated with several cognitive deficits, including attention, memory and executive function impairments. Poor quality and/or insufficient quantity of sleep in acute TBI probably affect general functioning and ADLs calling for these cognitive functions. Conclusions and SignificanceThe cognitive impairments present following TBI are probably exacerbated by poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation during hospitalisation, which in turn impact ADLs among this population. Health-care personnel should further consider sleep disturbances among people with TBI and a sleep protocol should be established.

Neural Correlates of Sensory Prediction Errors in Monkeys: Evidence for Internal Models of Voluntary Self-Motion in the Cerebellum	CEREBELLUM			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	SIXTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF SRC	JUL 03-04, 2014	Rome, ITALY			Primate; Cerebellum; Motor learning; Vestibular; Efference copy; Corollary discharge; Internal models	VESTIBULAR NUCLEI; ADAPTATION; MECHANISMS; MOVEMENTS	During self-motion, the vestibular system makes essential contributions to postural stability and self-motion perception. To ensure accurate perception and motor control, it is critical to distinguish between vestibular sensory inputs that are the result of externally applied motion (exafference) and that are the result of our own actions (reafference). Indeed, although the vestibular sensors encode vestibular afference and reafference with equal fidelity, neurons at the first central stage of sensory processing selectively encode vestibular exafference. The mechanism underlying this reafferent suppression compares the brain's motor-based expectation of sensory feedback with the actual sensory consequences of voluntary self-motion, effectively computing the sensory prediction error (i.e., exafference). It is generally thought that sensory prediction errors are computed in the cerebellum, yet it has been challenging to explicitly demonstrate this. We have recently addressed this question and found that deep cerebellar nuclei neurons explicitly encode sensory prediction errors during self-motion. Importantly, in everyday life, sensory prediction errors occur in response to changes in the effector or world (muscle strength, load, etc.), as well as in response to externally applied sensory stimulation. Accordingly, we hypothesize that altering the relationship between motor commands and the actual movement parameters will result in the updating in the cerebellum-based computation of exafference. If our hypothesis is correct, under these conditions, neuronal responses should initially be increased-consistent with a sudden increase in the sensory prediction error. Then, over time, as the internal model is updated, response modulation should decrease in parallel with a reduction in sensory prediction error, until vestibular reafference is again suppressed. The finding that the internal model predicting the sensory consequences of motor commands adapts for new relationships would have important implications for understanding how responses to passive stimulation endure despite the cerebellum's ability to learn new relationships between motor commands and sensory feedback.

RaPTOR computes local correlation ratio (CR) values on small patches and adds the CR values to form a global cost function. It is therefore invariant to large amounts of spatial intensity inhomogeneity. We also propose a novel outlier suppression technique based on the orientations of the RaPTOR gradients. Our deformation is modeled with free-form cubic B-splines. We analytically derive the derivatives of RaPTOR with respect to the transformation, i.e., the displacement of the B-spline nodes, and optimize RaPTOR using a stochastic gradient descent approach. RaPTORis validated on MR and tracked US images of neurosurgery. Deformable registration of the US and MR images acquired, respectively, preoperation and postresection is of significant clinical significance, but challenging due to, among others, the large amount of missing correspondences between the two images. This work is also novel in that it performs automatic registration of this challenging dataset. To validate the results, we manually locate corresponding anatomical landmarks in the US and MR images of tumor resection in brain surgery. Compared to rigid registration based on the tracking system alone, RaPTOR reduces the mean initial mTRE over 13 patients from 5.9 to 2.9 mm, and the maximum initial TRE from 17.0 to 5.9 mm. Each volumetric registration using RaPTOR takes about 30 sec on a single CPU core. An important challenge in the field of medical image analysis is the shortage of publicly available dataset, which can both facilitate the advancement of new algorithms to clinical settings and provide a benchmark for comparison. To address this problem, we will make our manually located landmarks available online.

Int Network Simulation Based Pedia	Improving Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation With a CPR Feedback Device and Refresher Simulations (CPR CARES Study) A Randomized Clinical Trial	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST; AMERICAN-HEART-ASSOCIATION; VIDEO SELF-INSTRUCTION; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; OLDER CHILDREN; QUALITY; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION; OUTCOMES; SKILLS	IMPORTANCE The quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) affects hemodynamics, survival, and neurological outcomes following pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Most health care professionals fail to perform CPR within established American Heart Association guidelines. OBJECTIVE To determine whether "just-in- time" (JIT) CPR training with visual feedback (VisF) before CPA or real-time VisF during CPA improves the quality of chest compressions (CCs) during simulated CPA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, randomized, 2 x 2 factorial-design trial with explicit methods (July 1, 2012, to April 15, 2014) at 10 International Network for Simulation-Based Pediatric Innovation, Research, & Education (INSPIRE) institutions running a standardized simulated CPA scenario, including 324 CPR-certified health care professionals assigned to 3-person resuscitation teams (108 teams). INTERVENTIONS Each team was randomized to 1 of 4 permutations, including JIT training vs no JIT training before CPA and real-time VisF vs no real-time VisF during simulated CPA. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The proportion of CCs with depth exceeding 50 mm, the proportion of CPR time with a CC rate of 100 to 120 per minute, and CC fraction (percentage CPR time) during simulated CPA. RESULTS The quality of CPR was poor in the control group, with 12.7%(95% CI, 5.2%-20.1%) mean depth compliance and 27.1%(95% CI, 14.2%-40.1%) mean rate compliance. JIT training compared with no JIT training improved depth compliance by 19.9%(95% CI, 11.1%-28.7%; P < .001) and rate compliance by 12.0%(95% CI, 0.8%-23.2%; P = .037). Visual feedback compared with no VisF improved depth compliance by 15.4%(95% CI, 6.6%-24.2%; P = .001) and rate compliance by 40.1%(95% CI, 28.8%-51.3%; P < .001). Neither intervention had a statistically significant effect on CC fraction, which was excellent (>89.0%) in all groups. Combining both interventions showed the highest compliance with American Heart Association guidelines but was not significantly better than either intervention in isolation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The quality of CPR provided by health care professionals is poor. Using novel and practical technology, JIT training before CPA or real-time VisF during CPA, alone or in combination, improves compliance with American Heart Association guidelines for CPR that are associated with better outcomes.

Materials and MethodsForty-nine healthy subjects, as well as 29 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 19 with spinal muscular atrophy, and 14 with spinal cord injuries were studied. Cord area was measured from T-2-weighted 3D turbo spin echo images (cord levels from C2 to T9) using the semiautomated segmentation method of Losseff et al (Brain [1996] 119(Pt 3):701-708), compared with manual segmentation. Reproducibility was evaluated using the inter- and intraobserver coefficient of variation (CoV). Accuracy was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Robustness to initialization was assessed by simulating modifications to the contours drawn manually prior to segmentation. ResultsMean interobserver CoV was 4.00% for manual segmentation (1.90% for Losseff's method) in the cervical region and 5.62% (respectively 2.19%) in the thoracic region. Mean intraobserver CoV was 2.34% for manual segmentation (1.08% for Losseff's method) in the cervical region and 2.35% (respectively 1.34%) in the thoracic region. DSC was high (0.96) in both cervical and thoracic regions. DSC remained higher than 0.8 even when modifying initial contours by 50%. ConclusionThe semiautomated segmentation method showed high reproducibility and accuracy in measuring spinal cord area. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:454-459.(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although these findings suggest blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown as an important feature in MS pathogenesis, limited information is available on the BBB alterations during lesion genesis. Here, we perform a longitudinal characterization of the vascular, neuropathological and immunological changes before lesion formation in mice developing spontaneous relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (sRR-EAE). We found a significant upregulation of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in the periphery of sRR-EAE mice before any evident neuropathology. In the CNS, BBB and astroglial activations were the first pathological changes occurring after 45 days of age and were followed by immune cell infiltration by day 50. These pathological alterations subsequently led to perivascular demyelination and disease onset. In MS, (p)reactive lesions mirrored the changes seen in early sRR-EAE by displaying considerable BBB disruption, perivascular astrogliosis, redistribution of junctional proteins and increased expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules. Our findings suggest that BBB breach occurs before significant immune cell infiltration and demyelination. In addition, peripheral immune activation during sRR-EAE precedes CNS pathology, suggesting that outside in signaling mechanisms play a role in the development of neuroinflammatory lesions.

However, few studies have examined associations between breastfeeding and specific cognitive task performance in the first 2 y of life, particularly in an Asian population. Objective: We assessed associations between early infant feeding and detailed measures of cognitive development in the first 2 y of life in healthy Asian children born at term. Design: In a prospective cohort study, neurocognitive testing was performed in 408 healthy children (aged 6, 18, and 24 mo) from uncomplicated pregnancies (i.e., birth weight >2500 and <4000 g, gestational age >= 37 wk, and 5-min Apgar score >= 9). Tests included memory (deferred imitation, relational binding, habituation) and attention tasks (visual expectation, auditory oddball) as well as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Children were stratified into 3 groups (low, intermediate, and high) on the basis of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. Results: After potential confounding variables were controlled for, significant associations and dose-response relations were observed for 4 of the 15 tests. Higher breastfeeding exposure was associated with better memory at 6 mo, demonstrated by greater preferential looking toward correctly matched items during early portions of a relational memory task (i.e., relational binding task: P-trend = 0.015 and 0.050 for the first two 1000-ms time bins, respectively). No effects of breastfeeding were observed at 18 mo. At 24 mo, breastfed children were more likely to display sequential memory during a deferred imitation memory task (P-trend = 0.048), and toddlers with more exposure to breastfeeding scored higher in receptive language [+0.93 (0.23, 1.63) and +1.08 (0.10, 2.07) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively, compared with the low-breastfeeding group]; as well as expressive language [+0.58 (-0.06, 1.23) and +1.22 (0.32, 2.12) for intermediate- and high-breastfeeding groups, respectively] assessed via the BSID-III. Conclusions: Our findings suggest small but significant benefits of breastfeeding for some aspects of memory and language development in the first 2 y of life, with significant improvements in only 4 of 15 indicators. Whether the implicated processes confer developmental advantages is unknown and represents an important area for future research. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

Additionally, cytokines associated with fetal placental inflammation can be detrimental to brain development regardless of inciting infection. We investigated whether differential patterns of cytokine markers in maternal and fetal plasma samples reflect subtypes of placental inflammation and neurological outcomes at 6 months in infants born to mothers with PPROM. STUDY DESIGN: Within a prospective cohort study of 25 women with PPROM, plasma cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-a) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from maternal blood samples at rupture and delivery, and from fetal umbilical cord blood samples. Patterns of cytokine expression were correlated with specific placenta pathologies. Infants underwent cranial ultrasound after birth and standardized neurological examinations at 6 months' corrected gestational age. Predictors of inflammation and adverse neurological outcome were assessed by logistic regression, adjusting for gestational age at birth. RESULTS: Inflammation of the fetal side of the placenta was associated with elevated maternal IL-6 and IL-8 at delivery and fetal IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-a. Worse neurological outcome at 6 months was associated with inflammation of the fetal side of the placenta and shorter duration from rupture of membrane to delivery, independent of gestational age at birth or cranial ultrasound results. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the connection between fetal inflammation with adverse neurological outcome with PPROM, regardless of cranial ultrasound results. Further longitudinal studies are needed to adequately examine these patterns, and will aid in risk assessment and intervention strategies.

Their importance is emphasized by the consequences of defects in plasmalogen biosynthesis, which in humans cause the fatal disease rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP). In the present lipidomic study, we used fibroblasts derived from RCDP patients, as well as brain tissue from plasmalogen-deficient mice, to examine the compensatory mechanisms of lipid homeostasis in response to plasmalogen deficiency. Our results show that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a diacyl glycerophospholipid, which like ethanolamine plasmalogens carries the head group ethanolamine, is the main player in the adaptation to plasmalogen insufficiency. PE levels were tightly adjusted to the amount of ethanolamine plasmalogens so that their combined levels were kept constant Similarly, the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in ethanolamine phospholipids was maintained upon plasmalogen deficiency. However, we found an increased incorporation of arachidonic acid at the expense of docosahexaenoic acid in the PE fraction of plasmalogen-deficient tissues. These data show that under conditions of reduced plasmalogen levels, the amount of total ethanolamine phospholipids is precisely maintained by a rise in PE. At the same time, a shift in the ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs occurs, which might have unfavorable, long-term biological consequences. Therefore, our findings are not only of interest for RCDP but may have more widespread implications also for other disease conditions, as for example Alzheimer's disease, that have been associated with a decline in plasmalogens.

The key clinical features of perioperative catabolism are hyperglycemia and loss of body protein, both metabolic consequences of impaired insulin function. Muscle weakness and (even moderate) increases in perioperative blood glucose are associated with morbidity after major surgery. Although the optimal glucose concentration for improving clinical outcomes is unknown, most medical associations recommend treatment of random blood glucose > 10 mmol center dot L-1. Neuraxial anesthesia blunts the neuroendocrine stress response and enhances the anabolic effects of nutrition. There is evidence to suggest that the avoidance of preoperative fasting prevents insulin resistance and accelerates recovery after major abdominal surgery. Current anticatabolic therapeutic strategies include glycemic control and perioperative nutrition in combination with optimal pain control and the avoidance of preoperative starvation. All these elements are part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs.

The overarching goal of this effort is to develop trans-generational models of developmental cascades contributing to the emergence of common chronic disorders, such as depression, addictions, dementia and cardio-metabolic diseases. Over the past 10 years, we have acquired detailed brain and cardio-metabolic phenotypes, and genome-wide genotypes, in 1029 adolescents recruited in a population with a known genetic founder effect. At present, we are extending this dataset to acquire comparable phenotypes and genotypes in the biological parents of these individuals. After providing conceptual background for this work( transactions across time, systems and organs), we describe briefly the tools employed in the adolescent arm of this cohort and highlight some of the initial accomplishments. We then outline in detail the phenotyping protocol used to acquire comparable data in the parents. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A REVIEW OF MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS IN FRESHWATER FISHES OF AFRICA: PATTERNS AND PREDICTORS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Review						Total mercury; Biomagnification; Fisheries; Aquatic; Contaminants	AQUATIC FOOD WEBS; EAST-AFRICA; LAKE; BIOMAGNIFICATION; METHYLMERCURY; BIOMASS; BIOACCUMULATION; EMISSIONS; TANZANIA; PLANKTON	The methylated form of mercury (methylmercury) is a potent neurotoxic chemical and a contaminant of concern for fisheries because of its potential effects on ecosystem and human health. In Africa, inland fisheries are a crucial component of food and economic security, yet little information is available on mercury (Hg) contamination trends. The authors compiled published data on Hg contamination in African freshwater fishes, invertebrates, and plankton, as well as on potential drivers of Hg concentrations in these organisms. From 30 identified studies the authors assembled 407 total Hg concentrations from 166 fish species, 10 types of invertebrates, and various plankton, distributed across 31 water bodies in 12 countries. In fishes, total Hg concentrations, expressed as mean (+/- standard deviation) per location, averaged 156.0 +/- 328.0ng/g wet weight and ranged from 5.5ng/g wet weight to 1865.0ng/g wet weight. Only locations with nearby artisanal and small-scale gold mining operations had mean Hg concentrations above the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization's recommended guideline for fish (500ng/g wet wt). The authors used mixed models to detect relationships between fish Hg concentrations and trophic level, mass, latitude, and chlorophyll a. Mass, trophic level, and latitude were all positive predictors of Hg concentration, confirming the presence of Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification in African fishes. Although strong trends in Hg concentrations were evident, the present study also highlights limited availability of Hg data in Africa. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;9999:1-9.

Synapse formation changes the rules for desensitization of PKC translocation in Aplysia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mathematical modeling; PKA; protein synthesis; serotonin	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; INTERMEDIATE-TERM FACILITATION; SENSORY NEURONS; APL-II; HETEROSYNAPTIC FACILITATION; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MEMORY STORAGE	Protein kinase Cs (PKCs) are activated by translocating from the cytoplasm to the membrane. We have previously shown that serotonin-mediated translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane in Aplysia sensory neurons was subject to desensitization, a decrease in the ability of serotonin to induce translocation after previous application of serotonin. In Aplysia, changes in the strength of the sensory-motor neuron synapse are important for behavioral sensitization and PKC regulates a number of important aspects of this form of synaptic plasticity. We have previously suggested that the desensitization of PKC translocation in Aplysia sensory neurons may partially explain the differences between spaced and massed training, as spaced applications of serotonin, a cellular analog of spaced training, cause greater desensitization of PKC translocation than one massed application of serotonin, a cellular analog of massed training. Our previous studies were performed in isolated sensory neurons. In the present study, we monitored translocation of fluorescently-tagged PKC to the plasma membrane in living sensory neurons that were co-cultured with motor neurons to allow for synapse formation. We show that desensitization now becomes similar during spaced and massed applications of serotonin. We had previously modeled the signaling pathways that govern desensitization in isolated sensory neurons. We now modify this mathematical model to account for the changes observed in desensitization dynamics following synapse formation. Our study shows that synapse formation leads to significant changes in the molecular signaling networks that underlie desensitization of PKC translocation.

Here, we addressed how neurosteroids modulate the occurrence of these interictal events and of the associated high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (ripples, 80-200Hz; fast ripples, 250-500Hz). Under control conditions (i.e. during 4AP application), ripples and fast ripples were detected in 12.3 and 17.5% of fast events, respectively; in contrast, the majority of slow events (>98%) did not co-occur with HFOs. Application of 0.1, 1 or 5m allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) to 4AP-treated slices caused a dose-dependent decrease in the duration of the fast events and an increase in the occurrence of ripples, but not fast ripples; in contrast, the duration of slow events increased. THDOC potentiated the slow events that were recorded during pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic transmission, but had no effect on interictal discharges occurring during GABA(A) receptor antagonism. These results demonstrate that potentiation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated signaling by THDOC differentially affects slow and fast interictal discharges; these differences may provide insights into how hyperexcitable activity is influenced by neurosteroids.

We examined such links in a group of 104 infants with and without a family history for autism in the first year of life. Our findings suggest robust associations between event related potential responses to eye gaze and observed parent-infant interaction measures. In both groups, infants with more positive affect exhibit stronger differentiation to gaze stimuli. This association was observed with the earlier P100 waveform component in the control group but with the later P400 component in infants at-risk. These exploratory findings are critical in paving the way for a better understanding of how infant laboratory measures may relate to overt behavior and how both can be combined in the context of predicting risk or clinical diagnosis in toddlerhood.

To address this, we have established a novel bioassay to characterize signaling cascades activated by p75NTR. We show that in COS7 cells, p75NTR expression causes a large increase in cell surface area that relies on the activation of Rac1, and we demonstrate that the p75NTR-dependent COS7 phenotype is dependent on ADAM17- and gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage of p75NTR and generation of the p75NTR intracellular domain (p75NTR(ICD)). We show that the p75NTR adaptor protein NRAGE (also known as MAGED1) acts downstream of the p75NTRICD in this cascade and, through a yeast two-hybrid screen, identify NEDD9, a Cas family adaptor protein, as a novel NRAGE-binding partner that mediates p75NTR-dependent Rac1 activation and cell spreading. Our results demonstrate a crucial role for p75NTR cleavage in small GTPase activation and define a novel Rac1 activation pathway involving the p75NTR(ICD), NRAGE and NEDD9.

We surveyed Canadian neonatologists and pediatric neurologists using general and vignette-based questions about the use of MRI for prognostication in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic injury. There was inter- and intra-vignette variability in prognosis and in ratings about the usefulness of MRI. Severity of predicted outcome correlated with certainty about the outcome. A majority of physicians endorsed using MRI results in discussing prognosis with families, and most suggested that MRI results contribute to end-of-life decisions. Participating neonatologists, when compared to participating pediatric neurologists, had significantly less confidence in the interpretation of MRI by colleagues in neurology and radiology. Further investigation is needed to understand the complexity of MRI and of its application. Potential gaps relative to our understanding of the ethical importance of these findings should be addressed.

Preclinical studies show that melatonin (MLT), a neurohormone acting on MT1 and MT2 receptors, has analgesic properties, likely through MT2 receptors. Here, we determined the effects of the novel selective MLT MT2 receptor partial agonist N-{2-([3-bromophenyl]-4-fluorophenylamino)ethyl} acetamide (UCM924) in 2 neuropathic pain models in rats and examined its supraspinal mechanism of action. In rat L5-L6 spinal nerve ligation and spared nerve injury models, UCM924 (20-40 mg/kg, subcutaneously) produced a prolonged antinociceptive effect that is : (1) dose,dependent and blocked by the selective MT2 receptor antagonist 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin, (2) superior to a high dose of MLT (150 mg/kg) and comparable with gabapentin (100 mg/kg), but (3) without noticeable motor coordination impairments in the rotarod test. Using double staining immunohistochemistry, we found that MT2 receptors are expressed by glutamatergic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Using in vivo electrophysiology combined with tail flick, we observed that microinjection of UCM924 into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray decreased tail flick responses, depressed the firing activity of ON cells, and activated the firing of OFF cells; all effects were MT2 receptor dependent. Altogether, these data demonstrate that selective MT2 receptor partial agonists have analgesic properties through modulation of brainstem descending antinociceptive pathways, and MT2 receptors may represent a novel target in the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Effects of minocycline add-on treatment on brain morphometry and cerebral perfusion in recent-onset schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Minocycline; Neuroimaging; SPECT; MRI; VBM	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; FOLLOW-UP; CINGULATE GYRUS; DOUBLE-BLIND; NEURAL BASIS; ABNORMALITIES; SYMPTOMS; VOLUME	Increasing evidence suggests that the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline has neuroprotective effects and is a potential treatment for schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms of action of minocycline in the CNS remain elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of minocycline on brain morphology and cerebral perfusion in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia after 12 months of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of minocycline add-on treatment. This study included 24 outpatients with recent-onset schizophrenia randomized for 12 months of adjuvant treatment with minocycline (200 mg/d) or placebo. MRI (1.5 T) and [Tc-99m]-ECD SPECT brain scans were performed at the end of the 12-month of trial. Between-condition comparisons of SPECT and MRI brain images were performed using statistical parametric mapping and analyzed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Minocycline adjuvant treatment significantly reduced positive and negative symptoms when compared with placebo. The VBM analysis of MRI scans showed that the patients in the placebo group had significant lower gray matter volumes in the midposterior cingulate cortex and in the precentral gyrus in comparison with the patients in the minocycline group. In addition, a decreased ECD uptake in the minocycline condition was observed in fronto-temporal areas. These results suggest that minocycline may protect against gray matter loss and modulate fronto-temporal areas involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Furthermore, minocycline add-on treatment may be a potential treatment in the early stages of schizophrenia and may ameliorate clinical deterioration and brain alterations observed in this period.

The effects of acute aerobic exercise on the acquisition and retention of laparoscopic skills	SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES			English	Article						FLS; Aerobic exercise; Retention; Subjective workload	PERFORMANCE; FUNDAMENTALS; COGNITION; SURGERY; BRAIN; HEART	Introduction Exercise is beneficial to learning. The purpose of this research was to determine whether an episode of aerobic exercise prior to practice improves the acquisition and retention of laparoscopic skills in the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) simulator. Methods Baseline maximal physical fitness (VO2 max), performance on peg transfer (PT), pattern cut (PC), and intracorporeal suture (ICS) were measured for FLS naive undergraduates. 2 Weeks later, participants were randomized into exercise (E) and control (C) groups. C did unrelated work for 40 min and then practiced PT and PC for 10 min, and ICS for 15 min. Final scores were recorded. In E, participants ran on a treadmill for 20 min at 60 % of their VO2 max. After a 15 min cool down, they engaged in identical FLS simulator training as group C. Both groups completed the NASA task load index (TLX) to assess workload. Retention was recorded 2 months after the training session. Groups were compared using t tests, chi 2 and Wilcoxon rank tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results There were 52 participants (22 in C; 30 in E) with high physical fitness at baseline. Demographics between the groups were similar at baseline. There were no differences in VO2 max and scores on the three tasks at baseline (all p values NS). There was no statistical significance between the scores of the C and E groups at the training session and retention, except for higher PT scores in the E group after the training session. Conclusion In physically fit, surgically nai ve students, one bout of aerobic exercise enhanced immediate learning of simple FLS skills but did not have an impact on more complex skills or on retention. The use of exercise in the surgical curriculum, or as a learning tool, warrants further investigation regarding how best to apply it.

Ischemic retinopathies are associated with robust inflammation that leads to generation of IL-1 beta, which causes vascular degeneration and impairs retinal revascularization in part through the Liberation of repulsive guidance cue semaphorin 3A (Sema3A). However, retinal revascularization begins as inflammation culminates in ischemic retinopathies. Because inflammation Leads to activation of proteases involved in the formation of vasculature, we hypothesized that proteinase-activated receptor (Par)-2 (official name F2r1.1) may modulate deleterious effects of IL-1 beta. Par2, detected mostly in retinal ganglion cells, was up-regulated in oxygen-induced retinopathy. Surprisingly, oxygen-induced retinopathy induced vaso-obliteration and neovascularization were unaltered in Par2 knockout mice, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. We therefore conditionally knocked down retinal Par2 with shRNA-Par2 encoded Lentivirus. Par2 knockdown interfered with normal revascularization, resulting in pronounced intravitreat neovascularization; conversely, the Par2 agonist peptide (SLIGRL) accelerated normal revascularization. In vitro and in vivo exploration of mechanisms revealed that IL-1 beta induced Par2 expression, which in turn down-regulated sequentially IL-1 receptor type I and Sema3A expression through Erk/Jnk-dependent processes. Collectively, our findings unveil an important mechanism by which IL-1 beta regulates its own endothelial cytotoxic actions by augmenting neuronal Par2 expression to repress sequentially IL-1 receptor type I and Sema3A expression. Timely activation of Par2 may be a promising therapeutic avenue in ischemic retinopathies.

Opioid receptors participate in this pain-relieving action, and preclinical studies in receptor-deficient mice have highlighted a critical role for -, but not -opioid receptors. In this study, we investigated whether -opioid (KOP) receptors have a role in the antiallodynic action of tricyclic antidepressants. Experimental Approach We used a model of neuropathic pain induced by unilateral sciatic nerve cuffing. In this model, the mechanical allodynia was evaluated using von Frey filaments. Experiments were conducted in C57BL/6J mice, and in KOP receptor-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates. The tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline (5mgkg(-1)) was delivered twice a day for over 2 weeks. Agonists and antagonists of opioid receptors were used to test the selectivity of the KOP receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) in mice with neuropathic pain. Key Results After 12 days of treatment, nortriptyline relieved neuropathic allodynia in both wild-type and KOP receptor-deficient mice. Surprisingly, acute nor-BNI reversed the effect of nortriptyline in both wild-type and KOP receptor-deficient mice. Further experiments showed that nor-BNI action was selective for KOP receptors at a late time-point after its administration (8h), but not at an early time-point, when it may also interact with -opioid (DOP) receptors. Conclusions and Implications KOP receptors are not necessary for the effect of a tricyclic antidepressant against neuropathic allodynia. These findings together with previous data indicate that the DOP receptor is the only opioid receptor that is necessary for the antiallodynic action of antidepressants.

Individual Peak Gamma Frequency Predicts Switch Rate in Perceptual Rivalry	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						binocular rivalry; bistability; gamma-band; individual differences; magnetoencephalography	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; BAND ACTIVITY; RESTING GABA; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; INHIBITION; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Perceptual rivalrythe experience of alternation between two mutually exclusive interpretations of an ambiguous imageprovides powerful opportunities to study conscious awareness. It is known that individual subjects experience perceptual alternations for various types of bistable stimuli at distinct rates, and this a stable, heritable trait. Also stable and heritable is the peak frequency of induced gamma-band (30-100 Hz) oscillation of a population-level response in occipital cortex to simple visual patterns, which has been established as a neural correlate of conscious processing. Interestingly, models for rivalry alternation rate and for the frequency of population-level oscillation have both cited inhibitory connections in cortex as crucial determinants of individual differences, and yet the relationship between these two variables has not yet been investigated. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to compare differences in alternation rate for binocular and monocular types of perceptual rivalry to differences in evoked and induced gamma-band frequency of neuromagnetic brain responses to simple nonrivalrous grating stimuli. For both types of bistable images, alternation rate was inversely correlated with the peak frequency of late evoked gamma activity in primary visual cortex (200-400 ms latency). Our results advance models of inhibition that account for subtle variation in normal visual cortex, and shed light on how small differences in anatomy and physiology relate to individual cognition and performance.

The study of brain activity and connectivity at rest provides a unique opportunity for the investigation of brain rewiring after stroke and plasticity changes. This study sought to identify dynamic changes in the functional organization of the default mode network (DMN) of stroke patients at three months after stroke. Eleven patients (eight male and three female; age range: 48-72) with right cortical and subcortical ischemic infarctions and 17 controls (eleven males and six females; age range: 57-69) were assessed by neurological and neuropsychological examinations and scanned with resting-state functional magnetic ressonance imaging. First, we explored group differences in functional activity within the DMN by means of probabilistic independent component analysis followed by a dual regression approach. Second, we estimated functional connectivity between 11 DMN nodes both locally by means of seed-based connectivity analysis, as well as globally by means of graph-computation analysis. We found that patients had greater DMN activity in the left precuneus and the left anterior cingulate gyrus when compared with healthy controls (P<0.05 family-wise error corrected). Seed-based connectivity analysis showed that stroke patients had significant impairment (P=0.014; threshold=2.00) in the connectivity between the following five DMN nodes: left superior frontal gyrus (lSFG) and posterior cingulate cortex (t=2.01); left parahippocampal gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus (t=2.11); left parahippocampal gyrus and lSFG (t=2.39); right parietal and lSFG (t=2.29). Finally, mean path length obtained from graph-computation analysis showed positive correlations with semantic fluency test (r(s)=0.454; P=0.023), phonetic fluency test (r(s)=0.523; P=0.007) and the mini mental state examination (r(s)=0.528; P=0.007). In conclusion, the ability to regulate activity of the DMN appears to be a central part of normal brain function in stroke patients. Our study expands the understanding of the changes occurring in the brain after stroke providing a new avenue for investigating lesion-induced network plasticity. Hum Brain Mapp 36:577-590, 2015.

The ability of the trans-acting activator of transcription (TAT) protein transduction domain (PTD) to transport macromolecules across biological membranes raises the possibility of developing it as a therapeutic delivery tool for nerve regeneration. Most studies have produced TAT PTD fusion protein in bacteria, which can result in problems such as protein solubility, the formation of inclusion bodies and the lack of eukaryotic posttranslational modifications. While some groups have investigated the production of TAT PTD fusion protein in mammalian cells, these strategies are focused on generating TAT PTD fusions that are targeted to the secretory pathway, where furin protease as well as other proteases can cleave the TAT PTD. As an alternative to mutating the furin cleavage site in the TAT PTD, we describe a novel method to generate cytosolic TAT PTD fusion proteins and purify them from cell lysates. Here, we use this method to generate TAT-C4RIP, a cell permeable competitive antagonist of binding between the small GTPase RhoA and the cytosolic phosphoprotein Collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4). We demonstrate that TAT-C4RIP transduces cells in vitro and in vivo and retains its biological activity to attenuate myelin inhibition in an in vitro neurite outgrowth assay.

Feindel; Montreal Neurological Institute; McGill University		William Howard Feindel (1918-2014) was one of the world's most distinguished neurosurgeons and a brilliant neuroscientist. As the Montreal Neurological Institute's third director, having succeeded Theodore Rasmussen and Wilder Pen-field, he proved to be a visionary medical and scientific administrator. His keen interests in epilepsy and brain imaging were enhanced by a passion for medical history. Students and young people invariably gravitated to Dr. Feindel; he was a kind, patient, thoughtful, intelligent, and caring mentor who was never too busy for them. A pioneer in his own right, Dr. Feindel linked our modern neurosurgical world with the legacy of the first generations of important neurosurgeons and neuroscientists.

We sought to identify biological pathways in GWAS data from over 60,000 participants from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We developed an analysis framework to rank pathways that requires only summary statistics. We combined this score across disorders to find common pathways across three adult psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Histone methylation processes showed the strongest association, and we also found statistically significant evidence for associations with multiple immune and neuronal signaling pathways and with the postsynaptic density. Our study indicates that risk variants for psychiatric disorders aggregate in particular biological pathways and that these pathways are frequently shared between disorders. Our results confirm known mechanisms and suggest several novel insights into the etiology of psychiatric disorders.

This work was done in the context of the study of artificially induced atypical febrile seizures. In order to measure the temperature of a moving animal continuously, we need to detect it in each video frame and then select a subset of pixels to evaluate its body temperature. To detect the animal in each frame, we propose a tracking method based on the minimization of a cost function that uses constraints such as temperature smoothness and proximity. The temperature of the animal is then taken as the mean of a subset of pixels from the detected area. For videos up to 19,000 frames long, the method achieves temperature estimation within from ground-truth more than 73 % of the time in difficult measurement scenarios.

Five data-driven models were examined for the forecasting of groundwater levels as a result of recharge via tailings from an abandoned mine in Quebec, Canada, for lead times of 1 day, 1 week and 1 month. The five models are: a multiple linear regression (MLR); an artificial neural network (ANN); two models that are based on de-noising the model predictors using the wavelet-transform (W-MLR, W-ANN); and a W-ensemble ANN (W-ENN) model. The tailing recharge, total precipitation, and mean air temperature were used as predictors. The ANN models performed better than the MLR models, and both MLR and ANN models performed significantly better after de-noising the predictors using wavelet-transforms. Overall, the W-ENN model performed best for each of the three lead times. These results highlight the ability of wavelet-transforms to decompose non-stationary data into discrete wavelet-components, highlighting cyclic patterns and trends in the time-series at varying temporal scales, rendering the data readily usable in forecasting. The good performance of the W-ENN model highlights the usefulness of ensemble modeling, which ensures model robustness along with improved reliability by reducing variance.

Themis(I23N) homozygous mice show reduced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte numbers. ECM resistance in P. berghei ANKA-infected Themis(I23N) mice is associated with decreased cerebral cellular infiltration, retention of blood-brain barrier integrity, and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production. THEMISI23N protein expression is absent from mutant mice, concurrent with the decreased THEMISI23N stability observed in vitro. Biochemical studies in vitro and functional complementation in vivo in Themis(I23N/+) : Lck(-/+) doubly heterozygous mice demonstrate that functional coupling of THEMIS to LCK tyrosine kinase is required for ECM pathogenesis. Damping of proinflammatory responses in Themis(I23N) mice causes susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, THEMIS is required for the development and ultimately the function of proinflammatory T cells. Themis(I23N) mice can be used to study the newly discovered association of THEMIS (6p22.33) with inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.

However, values in literature vary greatly, with T-1 in white matter ranging from 690 to 1100 ms at 3 Tesla. This brings into question the accuracy of one of the most fundamental measurements in quantitative MRI. Our goal was to explain these variations and look into ways of mitigating them. Theory and MethodsWe evaluated the three most common T-1 mapping methods (inversion recovery, Look-Locker, and variable flip angle) through Bloch simulations, a white matter phantom and the brains of 10 healthy subjects (single-slice). We pooled the T-1 histograms of the subjects to determine whether there is a sequence-dependent bias and whether it is reproducible across subjects. ResultsWe found good agreement between the three methods in phantoms, but poor agreement in vivo, with the white matter T-1 histogram peak in healthy subjects varying by more than 30% depending on the method used. We also found that the pooled brain histograms displayed three distinct white matter peaks, with Look-Locker consistently underestimating, and variable flip angle overestimating the inversion recovery T-1 values. The Bloch simulations indicated that incomplete spoiling and inaccurate B-1 mapping could account for the observed differences. ConclusionWe conclude that the three most common T-1 mapping protocols produce stable T-1 values in phantoms, but not in vivo. To improve the accuracy of T-1 mapping, we recommend that sites perform in vivo validation of their T-1 mapping method against the inversion recovery reference method, as the first step toward developing a robust calibration scheme.

MethodsMultiple-repetition, single-shot, electrocardiograph-triggered, T2-prepared BOLD balanced steady-state free precession was performed during repeated long breath-holds in 13 volunteers. Nonrigid motion correction was applied to the continuously acquired data and it was analyzed with a general linear model (GLM) taking into account the effects of the breath-hold duration, RR interval, motion, and baseline variations. Both voxel- and region of interest-based analyses were performed. ResultsThe GLM model was able to isolate the component of the BOLD signal arising from the breath-holds and separate it from the background effects due to the changing heart rate and motion. A significant (P<0.05) BOLD signal increase was observed in the myocardium of healthy volunteers. ConclusionUsing a recent elastic motion correction algorithm and adapted acquisition techniques, it was possible to apply fMRI-like strategies for cardiac BOLD MRI in volunteers and derive robust BOLD measurements. The observed slight but significant oxygenation increase in the myocardium of volunteers might be explained by the vasodilator effect of increased CO2 concentration under apnea. Detection of such small physiological changes in volunteers performing breath-holds demonstrates that the method could have potential in identifying low oxygenation regions in the myocardium of patients during stress tests.

Targeting the cis-dimerization of LINGO-1 with low MW compounds affects its downstream signalling	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; OLIGODENDROCYTE PRECURSOR CELLS; PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITORS; RECEPTOR FAMILY-MEMBER; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; NOGO RECEPTOR; CONCISE GUIDE; AXONAL REGENERATION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The transmembrane protein LINGO-1 is a negative regulator in the nervous system mainly affecting axonal regeneration, neuronal survival, oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating its functions are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the formation and the role of LINGO-1 cis-dimers in the regulation of its biological activity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH LINGO-1 homodimers were identified in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells using co-immunoprecipitation experiments and BRET saturation analysis. We performed a hypothesis-driven screen for identification of small-molecule protein-protein interaction modulators of LINGO-1 using a BRET-based assay, adapted for screening. The compound identified was further assessed for effects on LINGO-1 downstream signalling pathways using Western blotting analysis and AlphaScreen technology. KEY RESULTS LINGO-1 was present as homodimers in primary neuronal cultures. LINGO-1 interacted homotypically in cis-orientation and LINGO-1 cis-dimers were formed early during LINGO-1 biosynthesis. A BRET-based assay allowed us to identify phenoxybenzamine as the first conformational modulator of LINGO-1 dimers. In HEK-293 cells, phenoxybenzamine was a positive modulator of LINGO-1 function, increasing the LINGO-1-mediated inhibition of EGF receptor signalling and Erk phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our data suggest that LINGO-1 forms constitutive cis-dimers at the plasma membrane and that low MW compounds affecting the conformational state of these dimers can regulate LINGO-1 downstream signalling pathways. We propose that targeting the LINGO-1 dimerization interface opens a new pharmacological approach to the modulation of its function and provides a new strategy for drug discovery.

The current study investigated the role of two factors in temporal coordination of joint music performance: differences in partners' spontaneous (uncued) rate and auditory feedback generated by oneself and one's partner. Pianists performed melodies independently (in a Solo condition), and with a partner (in a duet condition), either at the same time as a partner (Unison), or at a temporal offset (Round), such that pianists heard their partner produce a serially shifted copy of their own sequence. Access to self-produced auditory information during duet performance was manipulated as well: Performers heard either full auditory feedback (Full), or only feedback from their partner (Other). Larger differences in partners' spontaneous rates of Solo performances were associated with larger asynchronies (less effective synchronization) during duet performance. Auditory feedback also influenced temporal coordination of duet performance: Pianists were more coordinated (smaller tone onset asynchronies and more mutual adaptation) during duet performances when self-generated auditory feedback aligned with partner-generated feedback (Unison) than when it did not (Round). Removal of self-feedback disrupted coordination (larger tone onset asynchronies) during Round performances only. Together, findings suggest that differences in partners' spontaneous rates of Solo performances, as well as differences in self- and partner-generated auditory feedback, influence temporal coordination of joint sensorimotor behaviors.

Some of these studies, based on the analysis of reaction times, have recorded latencies for counter-intuitive or incongruent stimuli compared to intuitive or congruent ones. The proposed interpretations were that prior knowledge survives learning and still coexists with new closer-to-scientific knowledge, producing conflicts that delay correct answers. But these conclusions are based on the assumption that stimuli from different conditions only differ in the presence/absence of interfering misconceptions, which is sometimes, in our opinion, a rather fragile claim. Thus, we have designed a task in which it is possible to test different levels of interference and not only its effects in contrast to another condition. Then, we have used it to see if different intensities of interference produce different levels of conflict. The task tested the persistence of the misconception that "heavy objects sink more than lighter ones". One hundred twenty-eight 14- to 15-year-olds were asked to tell which of the 2 balls presented (3 different materials and 3 different sizes) would "sink more" than the other. Analysis verified the presence of latencies and negative priming. For the most part, results show that the intensity of interference does produce corresponding latencies, which suggests greater conflict and therefore supports the hypothesis of persistence and coexistence of conceptions, even after correct answers are produced, and beyond other plausible effects due to the used stimuli. Prescriptions for theory and teaching are proposed.

BackgroundSafe lower limit of blood pressure during anesthesia in infant is unclear, and inadequate anesthesia can lead to hypotension, hypocapnia, and low cerebral perfusion. Insufficient cerebral perfusion in infant during anesthesia is an important factor of neurological morbidity. In two previous studies, we assessed the impact of sevoflurane anesthesia on cerebral blood flow (CBF) by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and on brain oxygenation by NIRS, in children 2years. As knowledge about consequences of anesthesia-induced hypotension on cerebral perfusion in children 6months is scarce, we conducted a retrospective analysis to compare the data of CBF and brain oxygenation, in this specific population. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from our two previous studies. Baseline values of TCD or NIRS were recorded and then during sevoflurane anesthesia. From a database of 338 patients, we excluded all patients older than 6months. Then, we compared physiological variables of TCD and NIRS population to ensure that the two groups were comparable. We compared rSO(2)c and TCD measurements variation according to MAP value during sevoflurane anesthesia, using anova and Student-Newman-Keuls for posthoc analysis. ResultsOne hundred and eighty patients were included in the analysis. TCD and NIRS groups were comparable. CBF velocities (CBFV) or rSO(2)c reflects a good cerebral perfusion when MAP is above 45mmHg. When MAP is between 35 and 45mmHg, CBFV variation reflects a reduction of CBF, but rSO(2)c increase is the consequence of a still positive balance between CMRO2 and O-2 supply. Below 35mmHg of MAP during anesthesia, CBFV decrease and rSO(2)c variation from baseline is low. For each category of MAP and for the two groups, etCo(2) and expired fraction of sevoflurane (FeSevo) were comparable (anova P>0.05). ConclusionIn a healthy infant without dehydration, with normal PaCO2 and hemoglobin value, scheduled for short procedures, MAP is a good proxy of cerebral perfusion as we found that CBF assessed by CBFV and rSO(2)c decreased proportionally with cerebral perfusion pressure. During 1 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia, maintaining MAP beyond 35mmHg during anesthesia is probably safe and sufficient. But when MAP decreases below 35mmHg, CBF decreases and rSO(2)c variation from baseline is low despite CMRO2 reduction. In this situation, cerebral metabolic reserve is low and further changes of systemic conditions may be poorly tolerated by the brain.

Because the brain undergoes large deformation between these two acquisitions, deformable image-based registration of these data sets is of substantial clinical importance. In this work, we present an algorithm for non-rigid registration of ultrasound images (RESOUND) that models the deformation with free-form cubic B-splines. We formulate a regularized cost function that uses normalized cross-correlation as the similarity metric. To optimize the cost function, we calculate its analytic derivative and use the stochastic gradient descent technique to achieve near real-time performance. We further propose a robust technique to minimize the effect of non-corresponding regions such as the resected tumor and possible hemorrhage in the post-resection image. Using manually labeled corresponding landmarks in the pre- and post-resection ultrasound volumes, we illustrate that our registration algorithm reduces the mean target registration error from an initial value of 3.7 to 1.5 mm. We also compare RESOUND with the previous work of Mercier et al. (2013) and illustrate that it has three important advantages: (i) it is fully automatic and does not require a manual segmentation of the tumor, (ii) it produces smaller registration errors and (iii) it is about 30 times faster. The clinical data set is available online on the BITE database website. (E-mail: hrivaz@ece.concordia.ca) (C) 2015 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Animal studies have been conducted to support the role of these cells in attention, but the lesions induced in these animals were not specific to the cholinergic PPTg system, and were assessed by post-mortem methods remotely performed from the in vivo behavioral assessments. Moreover, sustained attention have not been directly assessed in these studies, but rather deduced from indirect measurements. In the present study, rats were assessed on the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT), and a specific measure of variability in response latency was created. Animals were observed both before and after selective lesion of the PPTg cholinergic neurons. Brain cholinergic denervation was assessed both in vivo and ex vivo, using PET imaging with [F-18]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([F-18]FEOBV) and immunocytochemistry respectively. Results showed that the number of correct responses and variability in response latency in the 5-CSRTT were the only behavioral measures affected following the lesions. These measures were found to correlate significantly with the number of PPTg cholinergic cells, as measured with both [F-18]FEOBV and immunocytochemistry. This suggests the primary role of the PPTg cholinergic cells in sustained attention. It also allows to reliably use the PET imaging with [F-18]FEOBV for the purpose of assessing the relationship between behavior and cholinergic innervation in living animals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Delta opioid receptors expressed in forebrain GABAergic neurons are responsible for SNC80-induced seizures	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Delta opioid receptor; Conditional knockout; Epileptic seizure; Delta agonist; Biased agonism; In vivo	ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; AGONIST SNC80; BRAIN; MICE; INTERNALIZATION; PHARMACOLOGY; CONVULSIONS; MECHANISMS; ANALGESIA	The delta opioid receptor (DOR) has raised much interest for the development of new therapeutic drugs, particularly to treat patients suffering from mood disorders and chronic pain. Unfortunately, the prototypal DOR agonist SNC80 induces mild epileptic seizures in rodents. Although recently developed agonists do not seem to show convulsant properties, mechanisms and neuronal circuits that support DOR-mediated epileptic seizures remain to be clarified. DORs are expressed throughout the nervous system. In this study we tested the hypothesis that SNC80-evoked seizures stem from DOR activity at the level of forebrain GABAergic transmission, whose inhibition is known to facilitate the development of epileptic seizures. We generated a conditional DOR knockout mouse line, targeting the receptor gene specifically in GABAergic neurons of the forebrain (Dlx-DOR). We measured effects of SNC80 (4.5, 9, 13.5 and 32 mg/kg), ARM390 (10,30 and 60 mg/kg) or ADL5859 (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) administration on electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded in Dlx-DOR mice and their control littermates (Ctrl mice). SNC80 produced dose-dependent seizure events in Ctrl mice, but these effects were not detected in Dlx-DOR mice. As expected, ARM390 and ADL5859 did not trigger any detectable change in mice from both genotypes. These results demonstrate for the first time that SNC80-induced DOR activation induces epileptic seizures via direct inhibition of GABAergic forebrain neurons, and supports the notion of differential activities between first and second-generation DOR agonists.

To test whether motor simulation might rely on sensory-motor coding common with those for motor execution, we used a repetition suppression (RS) paradigm while measuring neural activity with sparse sampling fMRI during repeated overt and covert orofacial and speech actions. RS refers to the phenomenon that repeated stimuli or motor acts lead to decreased activity in specific neural populations and are associated with enhanced adaptive learning related to the repeated stimulus attributes. Common suppressed neural responses were observed in motor and posterior parietal regions in the achievement of both repeated overt and covert orofacial and speech actions, including the left premotor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, the superior parietal cortex and adjacent intraprietal sulcus, and the left IC and the SMA. Interestingly, reduced activity of the auditory cortex was observed during overt but not covert speech production, a finding likely reflecting a motor rather an auditory imagery strategy by the participants. By providing evidence for adaptive changes in premotor and associative somatosensory brain areas, the observed RS suggests online state coding of both orofacial and speech actions in somatosensory and motor spaces with and without motor behavior and sensory feedback.

Using a dedicated high-gradient 3 T human MRI scanner with a maximum gradient strength of 300 mT/m, we systematically studied the effect of gradient strength on in vivo axon diameter and density estimates in the human corpus callosum. Pulsed gradient spin echo experiments were performed in a single scan session lasting approximately 2 h on each of three human subjects. The data were then divided into subsets with maximum gradient strengths of 77, 145, 212, and 293 mT/m and diffusion times encompassing short (16 and 25 ms) and long (60 and 94 ms) diffusion time regimes. A three-compartment model of intra-axonal diffusion, extra-axonal diffusion, and free diffusion in cerebrospinal fluid was fitted to the data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. For the acquisition parameters, model, and fitting routine used in our study, it was found that higher maximum gradient strengths decreased the mean axon diameter estimates by two to three fold and decreased the uncertainty in axon diameter estimates by more than half across the corpus callosum. The exclusive use of longer diffusion times resulted in axon diameter estimates that were up to two times larger than those obtained with shorter diffusion times. Axon diameter and density maps appeared less noisy and showed improved contrast between different regions of the corpus callosum with higher maximum gradient strength. Known differences in axon diameter and density between the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum were preserved and became more reproducible at higher maximum gradient strengths. Our results suggest that an optimal q-space sampling scheme for estimating in vivo axon diameters should incorporate the highest possible gradient strength. The improvement in axon diameter and density estimates that we demonstrate from increasing maximum gradient strength will inform protocol development and encourage the adoption of higher maximum gradient strengths for use in commercial human scanners.

Teleost fishes possess vasopressin and oxytocin homologues known as arginine vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT), respectively. The role of these homologous nonapeptides in mediating social behaviour in fishes has received far less attention. The extraordinarily large number of teleost fish species and the impressive diversity of their social systems provide us with a rich test bed for investigating the role of nonapeptides in regulating social behaviour. Existing studies, mostly focused on AVT, have revealed relationships between the nonapeptides, and both social behaviour and dominance status in fishes. To date, much of the work on endogenous nonapeptides in fish brains has measured genomic or neuroanatomical proxies of nonapeptide production rather than the levels of these molecules in the brain. In this study, we measure biologically available AVT and IT levels in the brains of Neolamprologus pulcher, a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish, using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. We found that brain AVT levels were higher in the subordinate than in dominant animals, and levels of IT correlated negatively with the expression of affiliative behaviour. We contrast these results with previous studies, and we discuss the role the nonapeptide hormones may play in the regulation of social behaviour in this highly social animal.

Despite growing interest in epigenetic studies of psychiatric diseases, the methodologies guiding such studies have not been well defined. METHODS: We performed DNA modification analysis in white blood cells from monozygotic twins discordant for MDD, in brain prefrontal cortex, and germline (sperm) samples from affected individuals and control subjects (total N = 304) using 8.1K CpG island microarrays and fine mapping. In addition to the traditional locus-by-locus comparisons, we explored the potential of new analytical approaches in epigenomic studies. RESULTS: In the microarray experiment, we detected a number of nominally significant DNA modification differences in MDD and validated selected targets using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Some MDD epigenetic changes, however, overlapped across brain, blood, and sperm more often than expected by chance. We also demonstrated that stratification for disease severity and age may increase the statistical power of epimutation detection. Finally, a series of new analytical approaches, such as DNA modification networks and machine-learning algorithms using binary and quantitative depression phenotypes, provided additional insights on the epigenetic contributions to MDD. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping epigenetic differences in MDD (and other psychiatric diseases) is a complex task. However, combining traditional and innovative analytical strategies may lead to identification of disease-specific etiopathogenic epimutations.

J	Chesneau, S; Ska, B				Chesneau, Sophie; Ska, Bernadette			Text comprehension in residual aphasia after basic-level linguistic recovery: a multiple case study	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive model of text comprehension; text comprehension; memory; aphasia; executive function	MEASURING WORKING-MEMORY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; BRAIN-DAMAGE; LANGUAGE; ADULTS; DISCOURSE; KNOWLEDGE; ACCURACY; DEFICITS	Background: Text comprehension entails a complex interaction between cognitive and linguistic factors. In ageing, text comprehension depends on text characteristics, particularly semantic load. Persons with residual aphasia may complain of discourse comprehension difficulties without linguistic problems. Three levels of representation are involved in text comprehension (surface level, semantic level constituted by macrostructure and microstructure and situational level). Attention, verbal working memory, long-term memory and executive functions combine to allow processing of all levels of representation. Aims: The primary objectives of this multiple case study were (1) to examine microstructure, macrostructure and situational model updating in text comprehension in five participants with left-brain damage (PWLBD), who continued to complain about problems with discourse comprehension without linguistic problems, and (2) to examine executive function and memory in these participants. Methods & Procedures: Five PWLBD were selected for the study. We asked the participants to read and understand three narrative texts. The texts varied according to semantic load (the amount of information). In each text, we assessed macrostructure, microstructure and situational model updating. To evaluate memory and executive functions, we administered specific complementary tasks. Results were compared to normative data obtained from a previous study with a total of 60 neurologically intact control participants, divided into younger (N=30) and older (N=30) groups. Outcomes & Results: The results of the five PWLBD indicated that text comprehension is influenced by text characteristics, particularly semantic load; the findings demonstrated short-term memory and cognitive flexibility deficits. Conclusions: These findings have two major implications. Analysing text comprehension using several texts with varying semantic loads is a promising tool for diagnosing residual aphasia and for designing specific cognitive interventions that target reading comprehension abilities in persons with residual aphasia.

Current diagnosis of ALS is based on clinical assessment of related symptoms. The clinical manifestations observed in ALS appear relatively late in the disease course after degeneration of a significant number of motor neurons. As a result, the identification and development of disease-modifying therapies is difficult. Therefore, novel strategies for early diagnosis of neurodegeneration, to monitor disease progression and to assess response to existing and future treatments are urgently needed. Factually, many neurological disorders, including ALS, are accompanied by skin changes that often precede the onset of neurological symptoms. Aiming to generate an innovative human-based model to facilitate the identification of predictive biomarkers associated with the disease, we developed a unique ALS tissue-engineered skin model (ALS-TES) derived from patient's own cells. The ALS-TES presents a number of striking features including altered epidermal differentiation, abnormal dermo-epidermal junction, delamination, keratinocyte infiltration, collagen disorganization and cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. Remarkably, these abnormal skin defects, uniquely seen in the ALS-derived skins, were detected in pre-symtomatic C9orf72-linked ALS patients carrying the GGGGCC DNA repeat expansion. Consequently, our ALS skin model could represent a renewable source of human tissue, quickly and easily accessible to better understand the physiopathological mechanisms underlying this disease, to facilitate the identification of disease-specific biomarkers, and to develop innovative tools for early diagnosis and disease monitoring.

It has been well demonstrated that the epsilon 4 allele of the APOE gene can affect brain structure/function in nondemented individuals; however, other polymorphisms in the APOE gene have been largely overlooked when assessing the effects of APOE on the neural system. Rs405509 is a newly recognized AD-related polymorphism located in the APOE promoter region that can regulate the transcriptional activity of the APOE gene. To date, it remains unknown whether and how this APOE promoter polymorphism affects the human brain in aging. Here, for the first time, we investigate the effects of the rs405509 genotype (T/T vs G-allele) on human cortical morphology using a large cohort of nondemented elderly subjects (120 subjects in total; aged 52-81 years). High-resolution structural MRI was performed; cortical thickness and surface area were analyzed separately. Intriguingly, nondemented carriers of the rs405509 T/T genotype showed an accelerated age-related reduction of thickness in the left parahippocampal gyrus compared with the G-allele carriers. Furthermore, the cortical thickness covariance between the left parahippocampal gyrus and left medial cortex, including the left medial superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and paracentral lobule, was modulated by the interaction of the rs405509 genotype and age. These novel findings suggest an important role for the APOE promoter polymorphism in the human brain and also provide valuable insights into how the rs405509 genotype shapes the neural system to modulate the risk of developing AD.

Functional Consequences of Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density in Humans across the Adult Lifespan	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive aging; diffusion-weighted MRI; GBSS; gray matter; neurite orientation dispersion; structure-function relationship	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HUMAN-BRAIN; DIFFUSION MRI; SPINE CHANGES; DENDRITIC STRUCTURE; SPATIAL STATISTICS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; T2-WEIGHTED MRI; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HEALTHY-ADULTS	As humans age, a characteristic pattern of widespread neocortical dendritic disruption coupled with compensatory effects in hippocampus and other subcortical structures is shown in postmortem investigations. It is now possible to address age-related effects on gray matter (GM) neuritic organization and density in humans using multishell diffusion-weighted MRI and the neurite-orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model. In 45 healthy individuals across the adult lifespan (21-84 years), we used a multishell diffusion imaging and the NODDI model to assess the intraneurite volume fraction and neurite orientation-dispersion index (ODI) in GM tissues. Wealso determined the functional correlates of variations inGMmicrostructure by obtaining resting-state fMRI and behavioral data. We found a significant age-related deficit in neocortical ODI (most prominently in frontoparietal regions), whereas increased ODI was observed in hippocampus and cerebellum with advancing age. Neocortical ODI outperformed cortical thickness and white matter fractional anisotropy for the prediction of chronological age in the same individuals. Higher GM ODI sampled from resting-state networks with known age-related susceptibility (default mode and visual association networks) was associated with increased functional connectivity of these networks, whereas the task-positive networks tended to show no association or even decreased connectivity. Frontal pole ODI mediated the negative relationship of age with executive function, whereas hippocampal ODI mediated the positive relationship of age with executive function. Our in vivo findings align very closely with the postmortem data and provide evidence for vulnerability and compensatory neural mechanisms of aging in GM microstructure that have functional and cognitive impact in vivo.

For several decades, the hydration-dependent electrical properties of eumelanin have mainly been interpreted within the amorphous semiconductor model. Recent works undermined this paradigm. Here we study protonic and electronic charge carrier transport in hydrated eumelanin in thin film form. Thin films are ideal candidates for these studies since they are readily accessible to chemical and morphological characterization and potentially amenable to device applications. Currentvoltage (I-V) measurements, transient current measurements with proton-transparent electrodes, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are reported and correlated with the results of the chemical characterization of the films, performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We show that the electrical response of hydrated eumelanin films is dominated by ionic conduction (10(-4)10(-3) S cm(-1)), largely attributable to protons, and electrochemical processes. To propose an explanation for the electrical response of hydrated eumelanin films as observed by EIS and I-V, we considered the interplay of proton migration, redox processes, and electronic transport. These new insights improve the current understanding of the charge carrier transport properties of eumelanin opening the possibility to assess the potential of eumelanin for organic bioelectronic applications, e.g. protonic devices and implantable electrodes, and to advance the knowledge on the functions of eumelanin in biological systems.

Infectious disease, behavioural flexibility and the evolution of culture in primates	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						cultural evolution; parasitism; behavioural innovation; social learning; comparative study	PARASITE SPECIES RICHNESS; WILD PRIMATES; COMPARATIVE TESTS; ONLINE RESOURCE; AFRICAN BUFFALO; WORMY WORLD; BRAIN SIZE; INNOVATION; ANIMALS; PATTERNS	Culturally transmitted traits are observed in a wide array of animal species, yet we understand little about the costs of the behavioural patterns that underlie culture, such as innovation and social learning. We propose that infectious diseases are a significant cost associated with cultural transmission. We investigated two hypotheses that may explain such a connection: that social learning and exploratory behaviours (specifically, innovation and extractive foraging) either compensate for existing infection or increase exposure to infectious agents. We used Bayesian comparative methods, controlling for sampling effort, body mass, group size, geographical range size, terrestriality, latitude and phylogenetic uncertainty. Across 127 primate species, we found a positive association between pathogen richness and rates of innovation, extractive foraging and social learning. This relationship was driven by two independent phenomena: socially contagious diseases were positively associated with rates of social learning, and environmentally transmitted diseases were positively associated with rates of exploration. Because higher pathogen burdens can contribute to morbidity and mortality, we propose that parasitism is a significant cost associated with the behavioural patterns that underpin culture, and that increased pathogen exposure is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of culture in both non-human primates and humans.

However, extended periods of monitoring sessions in natural environments are consistently challenged with movement artifacts and signal attenuation in addition to patient discomfort, particularly when faced with monitoring sessions exceeding 2 h. This is mostly due to the brain-device interface design, the fNIRS cap. To accurately assess the significance of fNIRS caps within the system, it is important to distinguish between technological development margins, as in artifacts that can be eliminated by better electronic components or more sophisticated data filtration/analysis algorithms, and inherent limitations of the system that need to be identified to clearly define the type of support needed for this application. This paper examines the basics of fNIRS technology to discern these factors and define the exact role of fNIRS caps as an essential part of this monitoring device. It also presents a review of available caps and possible future solutions that can be used on freely moving patients.

LSFC Consortium	Tissue-specific responses to the LRPPRC founder mutation in French Canadian Leigh Syndrome	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; MITOCHONDRIALLY ENCODED PROTEINS; GENE-EXPRESSION; RNA GRANULES; DEFICIENCY; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSLATION; COMPLEX; DECAY	French Canadian Leigh Syndrome (LSFC) is an early-onset, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a distinct pattern of tissue involvement. Most cases are caused by a founder missense mutation in LRPPRC. LRPPRC forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with SLIRP, another RNA-binding protein, and this stabilizes polyadenylated mitochondria! mRNAs. LSFC fibroblasts have reduced levels of LRPPRC and a specific complex IV assembly defect; however, further depletion of mutant LRPPRC results in a complete failure to assemble a functional oxidative phosphorylation system, suggesting that LRPPRC levels determine the nature of the biochemical phenotype. We tested this hypothesis in cultured muscle cells and tissues from LSFC patients. LRPPRC levels were reduced in LSFC muscle cells, resulting in combined complex I and IV deficiencies. A similar combined deficiency was observed in skeletal muscle. Complex IV was only moderately reduced in LSFC heart, but was almost undetectable in liver. Both of these tissues showed elevated levels of complexes I and III. Despite the marked biochemical differences, the steady-state levels of LRPPRC and mitochondrial mRNAs were extremely low, LRPPRC was largely detergent-insoluble, and SLIRP was undetectable in all LSFC tissues. The level of the LRPPRC/SLIRP complex appeared much reduced in control tissues by the first dimension blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysis compared with fibroblasts, and even by second dimension analysis it was virtually undetectable in control heart. These results point to tissue-specific pathways for the post-transcriptional handling of mitochondrial mRNAs and suggest that the biochemical defects in LSFC reflect the differential ability of tissues to adapt to the mutation.

This was achieved by using the laser diode thermal desorption-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LDTD-APCI) coupled to the Q-Exactive, a high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer (HRMS). This novel combination, the LDTD-APCI-HRMS, allowed for an ultra-fast analysis time ( < 15 s/sample). A comparison of two different acquisition modes (full scan and targeted ion fragmentation) was made to determine the most rigorous analytical method using the LDTD-APCI interface. Method development focused toward selectivity and sensitivity improvement to reduce the possibility of false positives and to lower detection limits. The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer operates with resolving powers between 17 500 and 140 000 FWHM (m/z 200). Nevertheless, a resolution of 17 500 FWHM is enough to dissociate ANA-a and PHE signals. Mass accuracy was satisfactory with values below 1 ppm reaching precision to the fourth decimal. Internal calibration with standard addition was achieved with the isotopically-labeled (D-5) phenylalanine with good linearity (R-2 > 0.999). Enhancement of signal to noise ratios relative to a standard triple-quadrupole method was demonstrated with lower detection and quantification limit values of 0.2 and 0.6 mu g/L using the Q-Exactive. Accuracy and interday/intraday relative standard deviations were below 15%. The new method was applied to 8 different lake water samples with signs of cyanobacterial blooms. This work demonstrates the possibility of using an ultra-fast LDTD-APCI sample introduction system with an HRMS hybrid instrument for quantitative purposes with high selectivity in complex environmental matrices.

Motor cortex single-neuron and population contributions to compensation for multiple dynamic force fields	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motor cortex; elbow movements; force fields; neural activity; monkey	BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACE; PRIMATE CORTICOMOTONEURONAL CELLS; DIRECTIONAL ISOMETRIC FORCE; FREE ARM MOVEMENTS; INTERNAL-MODELS; REACHING MOVEMENTS; CORTICAL ENSEMBLES; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE; TEMPORAL EVOLUTION	To elucidate how primary motor cortex (M1) neurons contribute to the performance of a broad range of different and even incompatible motor skills, we trained two monkeys to perform single-degree-of-freedom elbow flexion/extension movements that could be perturbed by a variety of externally generated force fields. Fields were presented in a pseudo-random sequence of trial blocks. Different computer monitor background colors signaled the nature of the force field throughout each block. There were five different force fields: null field without perturbing torque, assistive and resistive viscous fields proportional to velocity, a resistive elastic force field proportional to position and a resistive viscoelastic field that was the linear combination of the resistive viscous and elastic force fields. After the monkeys were extensively trained in the five field conditions, neural recordings were subsequently made in M1 contralateral to the trained arm. Many caudal M1 neurons altered their activity systematically across most or all of the force fields in a manner that was appropriate to contribute to the compensation for each of the fields. The net activity of the entire sample population likewise provided a predictive signal about the differences in the time course of the external forces encountered during the movements across all force conditions. The neurons showed a broad range of sensitivities to the different fields, and there was little evidence of a modular structure by which subsets of M1 neurons were preferentially activated during movements in specific fields or combinations of fields.

The study compared pre-and post-injury measures of these skills and investigated the role of pre-injury child status and pre-injury family functioning in the prediction of outcome at six months post-injury. A secondary aim was to compare rates of impairment at six months post-injury between children post-TBI and a typically developing (TD) control group. This study comprised 140 children, 97 survivors of TBI (67 males) and 43 TD children (24 males), matched for age, sex, and socio-economic status. All participants were ascertained between 2007 and 2010, and were between ages 5.5 and 15.0 years. Children with TBI represented consecutive hospital admissions and were recruited at time of injury into a longitudinal study. TD children were recruited from the community, through local schools chosen to provide a range of socio-economic backgrounds. Findings indicated a deterioration of social participation skills post-injury, particularly for those sustaining a more severe injury, and a consistently higher rate of impairment in social and behavioral outcomes in the TBI group. Pre-injury function, injury severity and restrictions to social participation (e.g., reduced sport activities) as recommended by clinicians contributed significantly to outcome. Difficulties are evident in the short-term post-childhood TBI in social and behavioral domains. It is essential to monitor children long-term, particularly as societal expectations and demands increase.	[Catroppa, Cathy; Crossley, Louise; Hearps, Stephen J.

During inflammatory injury, oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells within lesion sites are exposed to secreted products derived from both infiltrating immune cell subsets and CNS-resident cells. Such products may be considered either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory and have the potential to contribute to both injury and repair processes. Within the CNS, astrocytes also contribute significantly to oligodendrocyte biology during development and following inflammatory injury. The overall objective of the current study was to determine how functionally distinct proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory human immune cell subsets, implicated in multiple sclerosis, can directly and/or indirectly (via astrocytes) impact human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell survival and differentiation. Proinflammatory T cell (Th1/Th17) and M1-polarized myeloid cell supernatants had a direct cytotoxic effect on human A2B5(+) neural progenitors, resulting in decreased O4(+) and GalC(+) oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Astrocyte-conditioned media collected from astrocytes pre-exposed to the same proinflammatory supernatants also resulted in decreased oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation without an apparent increase in cell death and was mediated through astrocyte-derived CXCL10, yet this decrease in differentiation was not observed in the more differentiated oligodendrocytes. Th2 and M2 macrophage or microglia supernatants had neither a direct nor an indirect impact on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation. We conclude that proinflammatory immune cell responses can directly and indirectly (through astrocytes) impact the fate of immature oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells more vulnerable to injury compared with mature oligodendrocytes.

This potential limitation can be overcome by intracranial electroencephalography used in presurgical epilepsy evaluation. We investigated the intracranial correlates of scalp spindles using combined scalp and intracerebral depth electrodes covering the frontal, parietal and temporal neocortex, and the scalp and intracranial correlates of hippocampal and insula spindles in 35 pre-surgical epilepsy patients. Spindles in the scalp were accompanied by widespread cortical increases in sigma band energy (10-16 Hz): the highest percentages were observed in the frontoparietal lateral and mesial cortex, whereas in temporal lateral and mesial structures only a low or no simultaneous increase was present. This intracranial involvement during scalp spindles showed no consistent pattern, and exhibited unexpectedly low synchrony across brain regions. Hippocampal spindles were shorter and spatially restricted with a low synchrony even within the temporal lobe. Similar results were found for the insula. We suggest that the generation of spindles is under a high local cortical influence contributing to the concept of sleep as a local phenomenon and challenging the notion of spindles as widespread synchronous oscillations.

Despite the importance of NMJ denervation in ALS, the mechanisms involved remain unexplored and ill defined. The contribution of glial cells in the disease has been highlighted, including axonal Schwann cell activation that precedes the decline of motor function and the onset of hindlimb paralysis. Because NMJ denervation occurs early in the process and that perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at the NMJ, regulate morphological stability, integrity, and repair of the NMJ, one could predict that PSC functions would be altered even before denervation, contributing to NMJ malfunctions. We tested this possibility using a slowly progressive model of ALS (SOD1(G37R) mice). We observed a normal NMJ organization at a presymptomatic stage of ALS (120 d), but PSC detection of endogenous synaptic activity revealed by intracellular Ca2+ changes was enhanced compared with their wild-type littermates. This inappropriate PSC decoding ability was associated with an increased level of neurotransmitter release and dependent on intrinsic glial properties related to enhanced muscarinic receptor activation. The alteration of PSC muscarinic receptor functions also persists during the preonset stage of the disease and became dependent on MN vulnerability with age. Together, these results suggest that PSC properties are altered in the disease process in a manner that would be detrimental for NMJ repair. The impairments of PSC functions may contribute to NMJ dysfunction and ALS pathogenesis.

Brain Browser: distributed, web-based neurological data visualization	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						visualization; neuroimaging; neurology; WebGL; HTML5	MRI	Recent years have seen massive, distributed datasets become the norm in neuroimaging research, and the methodologies used to analyze them have, in response, become more collaborative and exploratory. Tools and infrastructure are continuously being developed and deployed to facilitate research in this context: grid computation platforms to process the data, distributed data stores to house and share them, high-speed networks to move them around and collaborative, often web-based, platforms to provide access to and sometimes manage the entire system. Brain Browser is a lightweight, high-performance Java Script visualization library built to provide easy-to-use, powerful, on-demand visualization of remote datasets in this new research environment. Brain Browser leverages modern web technologies, such as WebGL, HTML5 and Web Workers, to visualize 3D surface and volumetric neuroimaging data in any modern web browser without requiring any browser plugins. It is thus trivial to integrate Brain Browser into any web-based platform. Brain Browser is simple enough to produce a basic web-based visualization in a few lines of code, while at the same time being robust enough to create full-featured visualization applications. Brain Browser can dynamically load the data required for a given visualization, so no network bandwidth needs to be waisted on data that will not be used. Brain Browser's integration into the standardized web platform also allows users to consider using 3D data visualization in novel ways, such as for data distribution, data sharing and dynamic online publications. Brain Browser is already being used in two major online platforms, CBRAIN and LORIS, and has been used to make the 1TB MACACC dataset openly accessible.

Music contains periodic auditory events that give rise to a sense of beat, which in turn generates a sense of meter on the basis of multiple periodicities. Metrical hierarchies may aid memory for music by facilitating similarity-based associations among sequence events at different periodic distances that unfold in longer contexts. A fundamental question is how metrical associations arising from a musical context influence memory during music performance. Longer contexts may facilitate metrical associations at higher hierarchical levels more than shorter contexts, a prediction of the range model, a formal model of planning processes in music performance (Palmer and Pfordresher, 2003; Pfordresher et al., 2007). Serial ordering errors, in which intended sequence events are produced in incorrect sequence positions, were measured as skilled pianists performed musical pieces that contained excerpts embedded in long or short musical contexts. Pitch errors arose from metrically similar positions and further sequential distances more often when the excerpt was embedded in long contexts compared to short contexts. Musicians' keystroke intensities and error rates also revealed influences of metrical hierarchies, which differed for performances in long and short contexts. The range model accounted for contextual effects and provided better fits to empirical findings when metrical associations between sequence events were included. Longer sequence contexts may facilitate planning during sequence production by increasing conceptual similarity between hierarchically associated events. These findings are consistent with the notion that neural oscillations at multiple periodicities may strengthen metrical associations across sequence events during planning.

Human mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 impair nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						folate; MTHFD1; SCID; megaloblastic anemia; thymidylate	ONE-CARBON METABOLISM; SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY; URACIL MISINCORPORATION; MAMMALIAN MITOCHONDRIA; FOLATE-DEFICIENCY; MTHFD1 GENE; DNA; CELLS; SYNTHETASE; PATHWAY	An inborn error of metabolism associated with mutations in the human methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1) gene has been identified. The proband presented with SCID, megaloblastic anemia, and neurologic abnormalities, but the causal metabolic impairment is unknown. SCID has been associated with impaired purine nucleotide metabolism, whereas megaloblastic anemia has been associated with impaired de novo thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis. MTHFD1 functions to condense formate with tetrahydrofolate and serves as the primary entry point of single carbons into folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism in the cytosol. In this study, we examined the impact of MTHFD1 loss of function on folate-dependent purine, dTMP, and methionine biosynthesis in fibroblasts from the proband with MTHFD1 deficiency. The flux of formate incorporation into methionine and dTMP was decreased by 90% and 50%, respectively, whereas formate flux through de novo purine biosynthesis was unaffected. Patient fibroblasts exhibited enriched MTHFD1 in the nucleus, elevated uracil in DNA, lower rates of de novo dTMP synthesis, and increased salvage pathway dTMP biosynthesis relative to control fibroblasts. These results provide evidence that impaired nuclear de novo dTMP biosynthesis can lead to both megaloblastic anemia and SCID in MTHFD1 deficiency.

In conventionally prepared adult anesthetized cats, we used visual adaptation to change the preferred orientation selectivity in V1 neurons. Cortical circuits are dominated by complex and intricate connections between neurons. Cross-correlation of cellular spike-trains discloses the putative functional connection between two neurons. We sought to investigate changes in these links following a 12 min uninterrupted application of a specific, usually non-preferred, orientation. We report that visual adaptation, mimicking training, modulates the magnitude of crosscorrelograms suggesting that the strength of inter-neuronal relationships is modified. While individual cell-pairs exhibit changes in their response correlation strength, the average correlation of the recorded cell cluster remains unchanged. Hence, visual adaptation induces plastic changes that impact the connectivity between neurons. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such a modulation has mostly been documented by averaging the activity of independently recorded neurons over repeated experimental trials. However, in realistic settings, ensembles of simultaneously active LPFC neurons must generate attentional signals on a single-trial basis, despite the individual and correlated variability of neuronal responses. Whether, under these circumstances, the LPFC can reliably generate attentional signals is unclear. Here, we show that the simultaneous activity of neuronal ensembles in the primate LPFC can be reliably decoded to predict the allocation of attention on a single-trial basis. Decoding was sensitive to the noise correlation structure of the ensembles. Additionally, it was resilient to distractors, predictive of behavior, and stable over weeks. Thus, LPFC neuronal ensemble activity can reliably encode attention within behavioral timeframes, despite the noisy and correlated nature of neuronal activity.

Assessment of bootstrap resampling performance for PET data	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						resampling; bootstrap; positron emission tomography; image analysis; statistical uncertainty	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ECAT HRRT; DISTRIBUTIONS; MULTIVARIATE; ROBUSTNESS; ALGORITHM; PHANTOM; SCANS	Bootstrap resampling has been successfully used for estimation of statistical uncertainty of parameters such as tissue metabolism, blood flow or displacement fields for image registration. The performance of bootstrap resampling as applied to PET list-mode data of the human brain and dedicated phantoms is assessed in a novel and systematic way such that: (1) the assessment is carried out in two resampling stages: the 'real world' stage where multiple reference datasets of varying statistical level are generated and the 'bootstrap world' stage where corresponding bootstrap replicates are generated from the reference datasets. (2) All resampled datasets were reconstructed yielding images from which multiple voxel and regions of interest (ROI) values were extracted to form corresponding distributions between the two stages. (3) The difference between the distributions from both stages was quantified using the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the first four moments. It was found that the bootstrap distributions are consistently different to the real world distributions across the statistical levels. The difference was explained by a shift in the mean (up to 33% for voxels and 14% for ROIs) being proportional to the inverse square root of the statistical level (number of counts). Other moments were well replicated by the bootstrap although for very low statistical levels the estimation of the variance was poor. Therefore, the bootstrap method should be used with care when estimating systematic errors (bias) and variance when very low statistical levels are present such as in early time frames of dynamic acquisitions, when the underlying population may not be sufficiently represented.

This dynamic expression suggests that Shh might regulate several aspects of hypothalamic development. To gain insight into them, lineage tracing, (conditional) gene inactivation in mouse, in ovo loss- and gain-of-function approaches in chick and analysis of Shh expression regulation have been employed. We will focus on mouse studies and refer to chick and fish when appropriate to clarify. These studies show that Shh-expressing neuroepithelial cells serve as a signaling center for neighboring precursors, and give rise to most of the basal hypothalamus (tuberal and mammillary regions). Shh signaling is initially essential for hypothalamic induction. Later, Shh signaling from the neuroepithelium controls specification of the lateral hypothalamic area and growth-patterning coordination in the basal hypothalamus. To further elucidate the role of Shh in hypothalamic development, it will be essential to understand how Shh regulates the downstream Gli transcription factors.

Moral reasoning (MR) is an important skill during adolescence because it guides social decisions between right and wrong. Identifying the cognitive underpinnings of MR is essential to understanding the development of this function. The aim of this study was to explore predictors of MR in typically developing adolescents (n = 92, 33 males, M = 16.3 years, SD = 2.2 years) and the specific contribution of higher order cognitive processing using an innovative visual MR assessment tool and measures of executive functioning and intelligence. MR maturity was correlated with four executive functions (cognitive flexibility, feedback utilization, conceptual reasoning, verbal fluency) and was predicted by four variables: age, intelligence, nonverbal flexibility and verbal fluency. Overall, these results contribute to a better understanding of MR during adolescence and highlight the importance of using innovative tools to measure social cognition.	[Vera-Estay, E.; Beauchamp, M.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate sleep duration and quality as a function of child attachment to the mother. One hundred and thirty-four mother-child dyads enrolled in the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) project were included in this study. Attachment was assessed with the Strange Situation procedure at 36months and maternal sleep reports were collected at 6, 12, 24 and 36months. Differences in sleep characteristics were assessed with mixed models with one factor (attachment group) and one repeated measure (age). Children classified as disorganized had a significantly lower duration of nocturnal sleep, went to bed later, signaled more awakenings, had shorter periods of uninterrupted sleep (only at 12months) and had shorter periods of time in bed (only at 6months) than children classified as secure and/or ambivalent (p<0.05). This is the first study to show that children with insecure disorganized attachment present a distinct sleep pattern in comparison with those with secure or ambivalent attachment between 6 and 36months of age. Sleep disturbances could exacerbate difficulties in these families that are already considered vulnerable.

The protocol involved a pre- and a post-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan during which Mrs A had to perform a working memory task (i.e., n-back). Her baseline score on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-21) was 24, indicating severe depressive symptoms. Immediately after 4 weeks of daily DTMS treatment applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), her HAM-D-21 score decreased to 13 (a 46% reduction), and 1 month later, it was 12 (a 50% reduction). Moreover, Mrs A's accuracy scores on the n-back task (i.e., 2-back condition) improved from 79% (baseline) to 96% (after DTMS treatment). At the neural level, Mrs A showed significantly increased brain activity in the working memory network (e.g., DLPFC, parietal cortex) during the execution of the 2-back condition after DTMS treatment compared to baseline.

There exist various fluctuating parameters that contribute in this paramount prediction. In the current study, the traditional method of linear regression and artificial neural network are applied as means of prediction, and it is shown that the performance is improved shen supplemented with a decision tree approach. The outcome reveals which one can more effectively predict trends and behavioral patterns as well as maintenance requirement of such systems with limited considered attributes.

Many traditional and advanced forecasting tools are available. but applying them to a large number of customers is not manageable. In our research, we use data mining techniques to identify segments of customers with similar demand behaviors. Historical usage is used to cluster customers with similar demands. Once customer segments are identified a manageable number of forecasting models can be built to represent the customers within the segments.

However, most of the previous deep models need large scale training data and a long training time to obtain good results. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method based on "stretching" the projection matrices of stacked feature learning models. We call the proposed method "stretching deep architectures" (or SDA). In the implementation of SDA, stacked feature learning models are first learned layer by layer, and then the stretching technique is applied on the weight matrices between successive layers. As the feature learning models can be efficiently optimized and the stretching results can be easily computed, the training of SDA is very fast and no back propagation is needed. We have tested SDA on handwritten digits recognition, Arabic subword recognition and English letter recognition tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDA performs not only better than shallow feature learning models, but also state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Using 5 or 10 signatures for training is the most common case to evaluate ASV. In the scarcely addressed case of only one available signature for training, we propose to use modified duplicates. Our novel technique relies on a fully neuromuscular representation of the signatures based on the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model. This way, a real on-line signature is converted into the Sigma-Lognormal model domain. The model parameters are then varied to generate new duplicated signatures.

Physiological studies have shown that our central neural system (CNS) is able to adapt muscle force, stiffness and damping to perform different tasks under various environments. However, there has been very little research in the robotics communities to incorporate human motor skills of muscle force, stiffness and damping adaptation into teleoperation. As a matter of fact, muscle activities regulated by CNS can be represented by surface electromyography (sEMG) measured by electrodes attached on the skin of human limbs. Therefore, sEMG based teleimpedance control has been recently developed to transfer the variable stiffness from human operator to a robot for flexible manipulation [1], [2], [3]. In this paper, we have developed a personalised variable gain control, whereas the control gain is set according to muscle activation extracted from sEMG signals, and force feedback is employed such that human operator is able to sense the circumstance in a haptic manner and to adapt muscle contraction subconsciously as if they are directly interacting with the environment. The proposed method enables an operator to adjust tracking speed and stiffness of the telerobot easily on the fly, and thus greatly improves a user's manipulation ability for delicate tasks, especially in the presence of motion amplification and varying payload on the telerobot. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been tested and confirmed by comparative experiments, in which a 7-DOF (degrees of freedom) robotic arm of Baxter R. robot is employed.

In this paper, a new adaptive identification method for singularly perturbed nonlinear system using multi-time-scale recurrent high-order neural networks is proposed to obtain an accurate and faithful model. By extending the usage of the optimal bounded ellipsoid concept, which is originally designed for discrete time systems, a novel weight updating law is developed for tuning the weights of the continuous time neural networks during the identification process. Based on the identification results, an indirect adaptive control scheme using singular perturbation theory is developed. By using singular perturbation theory, the system order is reduced, and the controller structure is simplified. The upper bound epsilon* for the small parameter epsilon is also obtained, such that for all 0 < epsilon < epsilon*, the estimated tracking errors will converge to 0 exponentially, and the tracking error will be bounded. The closed-loop stability is analyzed and the effectiveness of the identification and control scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.

It relies on the function of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs). Although the first single-channel recording from MSCs dates back to 30 years ago, the identity of the genes encoding MSCs has remained largely elusive. Because these channels have an important role in the development of mechanical hypersensitivity, a better understanding of their function may lead to the identification of selective inhibitors and generate novel therapeutic pathways in the treatment of chronic pain. Here, I will describe our current understanding of the role MSCs may play in somatosensation and the potential candidate genes proposed to encode them.

The development and maintenance of pain requires the expression of novel genes. The expression of such genes occurs in highly regulated and orchestrated manner where protein translation provides an exquisite temporal and spatial fidelity within the axons and dendrites of neurons. Signaling pathways that regulate local translation are activated by cytokines, neurotrophic factors, or neurotransmitters, which are released either due to tissue damage or neuronal activity. In recent years, the ERK and mTOR pathways have been demonstrated to be central in regulating local translation in neurons of both the peripheral and central nervous systems in diverse models of chronic pain. The ERK and mTOR pathways converge onto the cap-dependent translational machinery that regulates genes essential for the development of nociceptive sensitization. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways has proved to be effective in normalizing the biochemical changes and the associated pain in various preclinical models.

After demonstrating the ability of these networks to automatically acquire internal representations that are similar to mel-scale filter-banks, an investigation into efficient DNN architectures for exploiting WSW features is performed. First, a modified bottleneck DNN architecture is investigated to capture dynamic spectrum information that is not well represented in the time domain signal. Second,the redundancies inherent in WSW based DNNs are considered. The performance of acoustic models defined over WSW features is compared to that obtained from acoustic models defined over mel frequency spectrum coefficient (MFSC) features on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech corpus. It is shown that using WSW features results in a 3.0 percent increase in WER relative to that resulting from MFSC features on the WSJ corpus. However, when combined with MFSC features, a reduction in WER of 4.1 percent is obtained with respect to the best evaluated MFSC based DNN acoustic model.

However, these models are not easily adapted to model a specific speaker characteristic. Recently, one approach was proposed to address this issue, which consists of using the I-vector representation as input to the DNN. The I-vector is playing the role of providing information about the speaker as well as the environmental conditions for a given recording. This approach achieved a significant improvement in the context of a hybrid system of DNN combined with Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In this paper, we study the effect of speaker adaptation based on the I-vector framework in the context of stacked bottleneck features. These features, extracted from a second level of DNNs, are modelled by a classical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) ASR system. The proposed approach achieved an absolute WER improvement of 1.2% on an Arabic Broadcast news task.

ReLU was proposed as a better match to biological neural activation functions compared to sigmoidal non-linearity function. However, ReLU has a disadvantage that the gradient is zero whenever the unit is not active or saturated. To alleviate the potential problems due the zero gradient, Leaky ReLU (LReLU) was proposed. Recently, a parametrized form of ReLU (PReLU) was shown to give superior performance compared to ReLU on large scale computer vision tasks. PReLU is a generalized version of LReLU where the gradient is learned adaptively from the training data. In this paper we investigate PReLU based deep convolutional neural networks for noise robust speech recognition. We report experimental results on Aurora-4 multi-condition training task. We show that PReLU gives slightly better Word Error Rates (WERs) on noisy test sets compared to ReLU. In combination with dropout generalization method we report one of the best WERs in the literature for this noisy speech recognition task.

Recently there has been interest in using systems based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform sequence modelling directly, without the requirement of an HMM superstructure. In this paper, we study the RNN encoder-decoder approach for large vocabulary end-to-end speech recognition, whereby an encoder transforms a sequence of acoustic vectors into a sequence of feature representations, from which a decoder recovers a sequence of words. We investigated this approach on the Switchboard corpus using a training set of around 300 hours of transcribed audio data.

This paper aims to propose a nouvelle model-free adaptive neural fuzzy feed forward torque control for parallel mechanism. The advantage of this kind model-free control is that it uses the information directly from the nonlinear dynamics, without knowing the robot physical parameters and complex models. The neural fuzzy inference system for the model-free adaptive neural fuzzy feed forward control is learning from the robot dynamical data base (joint angular displacement, velocity, acceleration and torque) generated from a PID control system. It is believed that the model-free control is simple, flexible and robust. Results from numerical simulation on a 4-bar planar parallel mechanism show the effectiveness and satisfactory of the proposed control.

The NN component is used to provide feature for label transitions that are then used by the CRF component to compute the likelihood. By exploiting the similarities between labels, we were able to add parameters shared by groups of similar label transitions. We also investigated large margin training, which increases the log-likelihood of the correct hypothesis relative to the best competing hypothesis. Finally, we used ensemble learning to combine the models trained from multiple initializations. Using a combination of those approach, we obtain F-1 = 88.50, a significant improvement over the 87.49 baseline on a named entities recognition task.

Activations from the bottleneck layer of these DNNs are used as features in an i-vector based speaker verification system. The features derived from this network are thought to be more robust with respect to phonetic variability, which is generally considered to have a negative impact on speaker verification performance. The verification performance using these features is evaluated on the 2012 NIST SRE core-core condition with models trained from a subset of the Fisher and Switchboard conversational speech corpora. It is found that improved performance, as measured by the minimum detection cost function (minDCF), can be obtained by appending speaker discriminative features to the more widely used melfrequency cepstrum coefficients.

CRIM and LIUM teams participated in the speech recognition part of the challenge with a joint submission. This paper presents the CRIM and LIUM's contributions. Each team made different choices to develop its ASR system. By the way, it was expected to compare and to evaluate different approaches to diarization and acoustic modeling, and to get complementary ASR systems for effective merging. CRIM's main contributions are the use of a training scenario similar to multi-lingual training to estimate the deep neural net (DNN) acoustic models with most of the data, the use of a pruned trigram model for search, in addition to the use of a genre-dependent quadgram language model for rescoring the lattice from the search. For LIUM, the focus was on fast decoding with high accuracy. The final word error rates (WER) after merging show that it is possible to get reasonable WER with automatically aligned files. The final global WER of 25.1% corresponds to a WER reduction of about 20% absolute in comparison to the ASR baseline system provided by the organizers.

A two-layered feedforward Neural Network (NN) is employed to approximate the desired control signal. In order to estimate system states, an NN-based high gain observer is introduced, which does not suffer from peaking phenomenon. Also, the stability analysis of the overall system is provided based on the non-separation principle. As compared to most of the previous approaches which concentrate on affine systems, the presented method is applicable to nonaffine nonlinear systems. Furthermore, the presented method does not rely on having a lot of a priori knowledge about the system dynamics, the corresponding adaption laws are simple, easy to implement and reliable.

The optimization of multi-fingered robotic dexterous grasping-force can be reformulated as an objective function minimization problem in the presence of constrains caused by form-closure and the balance of external force. A recurrent neural network (RNN) method is introduced to address the force optimization problem in real time when the dexterous hand grasp an object. This RNN based method has a simple structure without using complicated models such that the problem of friction constraint linearization can be avoided. Meanwhile, the primal-dual neural algorithm is used to solve the problem of trajectory planning of manipulators in task space, and the effectiveness has been tested by experimental studies.

In the case of video, information often must be aggregated across a variable length sequence of frames to produce a classification result. Prior work using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for emotion recognition in video has relied on temporal averaging and pooling operations reminiscent of widely used approaches for the spatial aggregation of information. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have seen an explosion of recent interest as they yield state-of-the-art performance on a variety of sequence analysis tasks. RNNs provide an attractive framework for propagating information over a sequence using a continuous valued hidden layer representation. In this work we present a complete system for the 2015 Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) Challenge. We focus our presentation and experimental analysis on a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture for facial expression analysis that can outperform a previously applied CNN approach using temporal averaging for aggregation.

However, while images are static, working with videos requires modeling their dynamic temporal structure and then properly integrating that information into a natural language description. In this context, we propose an approach that successfully takes into account both the local and global temporal structure of videos to produce descriptions. First, our approach incorporates a spatial temporal 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D CNN) representation of the short temporal dynamics. The 3-D CNN representation is trained on video action recognition tasks, so as to produce a representation that is tuned to human motion and behavior. Second we propose a temporal attention mechanism that allows to go beyond local temporal modeling and learns to automatically select the most relevant temporal segments given the text-generating RNN. Our approach exceeds the current state-of-art for both BLEU and METEOR metrics on the Youtube2Text dataset. We also present results on a new, larger and more challenging dataset of paired video and natural language descriptions.

The method is an implementation, for multivariate inputs, of the concept of psychophysiological interactions (PPI). We obtain spectral representations of estimates of brain activity, and use the signal power at specific frequency bands as inputs to our PPI model. PPI can be formulated as a multivariate linear model, which allows us to compute statistics measuring the amount of coupling change. The resulting PPI maps can be thresholded for significance controlling the familywise error rate. These thresholds are directly applicable to tests to identify the frequency bands that cause a significant effect, which are modifications of the original PPI model. Applying our method to simulations and to data from a MEG visuomotor study, we demonstrate that it is able to accurately detect modulations in interaction across space as well as the frequency bands that contribute to these modulations.

Label fusion strategies usually leverage information contained in these training labels but ignore local neuroanatomical information. Here, we address this limitation by explicitly incorporating local information at the label fusion stage. The proposed method - Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields (AWoL-MRF) - is initialized using a set of candidate labels from the atlas library to partition a specific structure into high and low confidence regions. The labels of the low confidence regions are updated based on a localized Markov random field model and a novel sequential inference process (walks), which mimics manual segmentation protocols. The approach combines a priori information from the atlas library with the local spatial constraints improving the accuracy and robustness of the existing segmentation methods.

Many sampling techniques have been proposed to speed up the registration process but these often come at the expense of accuracy ( e. g. random). In this paper, we describe a fast and accurate multi-modal registration framework based on matching gradient orientations at locations of minimal gradient magnitude uncertainties in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the context of IGNS, the method was shown to perform with accuracies below 2mm using 2% of the total voxels when tested on the 14 cases of the publicly available BITE dataset [ 1]. For rigid registration between MRI and CT brain images on the RIRE dataset [ 2], the quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed approach can employ highly reduced sampling rates ( e. g. 0.05 % of the voxels in the image) while still yielding a median registration error inferior to 1mm [ 3]. In the context of the non-rigid registration of inter-patient MRI brain volumes, the proposed approach is evaluated with a publicly available dataset, and achieves comparable accuracy to the top performing methods but with only one sixth of the processing time [ 4]. While the results are promising, there are remaining challenges associated with existing sampling techniques, as well as limitations in the existing validation frameworks for registration.

This study explores the ability of two machine learning methods to predict 1, 3, 6 and 12 months standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index ( SPEI) for the Wilsons Promontory station in Eastern Australia. The two methods are multiple linear regression ( MLR) and artificial neural networks ( ANN). The data-driven models were based on combinations of the input variables: mean precipitations, mean, maximum and minimum temperatures and evapotranspiration, for data between 1915 and 2012. Two performance metrics were used to compare the performance of the optimum MLR and ANN models: the coefficient of determination ( R-2) and the root mean square error ( RMSE). It was found that ANN provided greater accuracy than MLR in forecasting the 1, 3, 6 and 12 months SPEI.

However, today's wind turbines are still expensive to operate, and maintain. The reduction of operational and maintenance costs has become a key driver for applying low-cost, condition monitoring and diagnosis systems in wind turbines. Accurate and timely detection, isolation and diagnosis of faults in a wind turbine allow satisfactory accommodation of the faults and, in turn, enhancement of the reliability, availability and productivity of wind turbines. The so called model-based Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) approaches utilize system model to carry out FDD in real-time. However, wind turbine systems are driven by wind as a stochastic aerodynamic input, and essentially exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics. Accurate modeling of such systems to be suitable for use in FDD applications is a rather difficult task. Therefore, this paper presents a data-driven modeling approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods which have excellent capability in describing complex and uncertain systems. In particular, two data-driven dynamic models of wind turbine are developed based on Fuzzy Modeling and Identification (FMI) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. The developed models represent the normal operating performance of the wind turbine over a full range of operating conditions. Consequently, a model-based FDD scheme is developed and implemented based on each of the individual models. Finally, the FDD performance is evaluated and compared through a series of simulations on a well-known large offshore wind turbine benchmark in the presence of wind turbulences, measurement noises, and different realistic fault scenarios in the generator/converter torque actuator.

As a preprocessing step, MFL data are often reduced into a representative feature set that is capable of accurately estimating pipeline defect depths. However, this estimation capability may vary depending on the features used, which necessitates the need for selecting the most relevant ones. In this paper, self-organizing maps (SOMs) are used as feature visualization tool for the purpose of selecting the most appropriate features. First, a self-organizing map (SOM), i.e., a two-dimensional discretized representation of the input space of the training samples for the features, is produced. The SOM weights for each individual input feature (weight plane) are displayed then visually analyzed. Irrelevant and redundant features can be efficiently spotted and removed. The remaining "good" features (i.e., selected features) are then used as an input to a feedforward neural network for defect depth estimation. Experimental work has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach. For instance, within +/- 5% error-tolerance range, the obtained estimation accuracy, using the SOM-based feature selection, is 93.1%, compared to 74% when all input features are used (i.e., no feature selection is performed); and within +/- 10% error-tolerance range, the obtained estimation accuracy, using the SOM-based feature selection, is 97.5%, compared to 86% when all the input features are used (i.e., no feature selection is performed).

VANET QoS-OLSR is a clustering protocol that is able to increase the stability of the network while maintaining the QoS requirements. However, in this protocol, vehicles can misbehave either by under-speeding or over-speeding the road speed limits after clusters are formed. Such misbehavior leads to a widely disconnected network, which raises the need for a detection mechanism. The majority of the existing detection mechanisms are non-cooperative in the sense that they are based on unilateral judgements, which may be untrustworthy. Others employ cooperative detection scheme with evidence-based aggregation techniques such as the Dempster-Shafer (DS) which suffers from the (1) instability when observations come from dependent sources and (2) absence of learning mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose a cooperative method using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is able to (1) aggregate judgments and prevent the unilateral decisions, and (2) benefit from the previous detection experience by continuous learning. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection probability and reduces the false alarms rate.

We first revisited its formulation to verify its consistency with the criterion of minimization of mutual information. Then, we applied the nonlinear independent component estimation algorithm (NICE) to synthetic 2D images that resemble structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. This data was generated by mixing spatial components that represent axial slices of sMRI tissue concentration images. Next, we generated the images under linear and mildly nonlinear mixtures, being able to show that NICE matches ICA when the data is generated by using the conventional linear mixture and outperforms ICA for the nonlinear mixture of components. The obtained results are promising and suggest that NICE has potential to find richer brain networks if applied to real sMRI data, provided that small conditioning adjustments are performed along with this approach.

Along with sensorimotor impairments, many individuals post-stroke have cognitive deficits that can influence arm motor recovery. However, few studies have identified whether the training environment and presence of cognitive deficits influences the ability to use feedback in individuals post-stroke. We evaluated the influence of the training environment and cognitive impairments on the ability to use feedback to enhance arm motor recovery. Twenty-four subjects with chronic post stroke upper limb hemiparesis were randomized to practice pointing movements in a 3D virtual environment (VE) or a similarly designed physical environment (PE; n=12/group) for 12 sessions (72 trials/session, 3 days/week). All participants were provided with feedback about movement speed (Knowledge of Results) and trunk displacement (Knowledge of Performance). Neurocognitive functioning was assessed only before task practice (PRE), while kinematic assessments were carried out at PRE, immediately after (POST) and 3 months (RET) after task practice. Repeated measures ANOVAs with mixed models assessed the changes in kinematic outcomes. Neurocognitive function was correlated with kinematic outcomes. Those training in the YE had greater endpoint speed and ranges of shoulder horizontal adduction, shoulder flexion and elbow extension. They also tended to use less trunk displacement. Kinematic improvements were related to fewer deficits in memory, problem solving, attention and visuoperception. The presence of cognitive deficits influenced the ability to use feedback in people with chronic stroke for upper limb motor learning and recovery. Information about the presence of these deficits can help in the selection of the most appropriate interventions for maximizing arm motor recovery and motor learning in chronic stroke.

A VLSI architecture is developed based on stochastic computing that is compact and adder-free. Even with a short stream length, the proposed architecture achieves better disparity detection than a floating-point version by using a modified disparity-energy model.

A large number of sensors is usually used to cover the targeted pipelines. The sensors are equally distributed around the circumference of the pipeline; and every three millimeters the sensors measure MFL signals. Thus, the collected raw data is so big that it makes the pipeline probing process difficult, exhausting and error-prone. Machine learning approaches such as neural networks have made it possible to effectively manage the complexity pertaining to big data and learn their intrinsic properties. We concentrate, in this work, on the applicability of artificial neural networks in defect depth estimation and present a detailed study of various network architectures. Discriminant features, which characterize different defect depth patterns, are first obtained from the raw data. Neural networks are then trained using these features. The Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation learning algorithm is adopted in the training process, during which the weight and bias parameters of the networks are tuned to optimize their performances. Compared with the performance of pipeline inspection techniques reported by service providers such as GE and ROSEN, the results obtained using the method we proposed are promising. For instance, within 10% error-tolerance range, the proposed approach yields an estimation accuracy at 86%, compared to only 80% reported by GE; and within 15% error-tolerance range, it yields an estimation accuracy at 89% compared to 80% reported by ROSEN.

For this purpose, pipeline engineers use intelligent Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) sensors that scan the metal pipelines and collect defect-related data. However, due to the huge amount of the collected MFL data, the defect depth estimation task is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based approach to estimate defect depths from MFL signals. Depth-related features are first extracted from the MFL signals and then are used to train the neural network to tune the parameters of the membership functions of the fuzzy inference system. A hybrid learning algorithm that combines least-squares and back propagation gradient descent method is adopted. Moreover, to achieve an optimal performance by the proposed approach, highly-discriminant features are selected from the obtained features by using the weight-based support vector machine (SVM). Experimental work has shown that encouraging results are obtained. Within error-tolerance ranges of +/- 15%, +/- 20%, +/- 25%, and +/- 30%, the depth estimation accuracies obtained by the proposed technique are 80.39%, 87.75%, 91.18%, and 95.59%, respectively. Moreover, further improvement can be easily achieved by incorporating new and more discriminant features.

Typical machine learning approaches, which learn a classifier based on a hand-crafted feature vector, are not sufficiently robust to such reorderings. We propose a different approach, which, similar to natural language modeling, learns the language of mal ware spoken through the executed instructions and extracts robust, time domain features. Echo state networks (ESNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used for the projection stage that extracts the features. These models are trained in an unsupervised fashion. A standard classifier uses these features to detect malicious files. We explore a few variants of ESNs and RNNs for the projection stage, including Max-Pooling and Half-Frame models which we propose. The best performing hybrid model uses an ESN for the recurrent model, Max-Pooling for non-linear sampling, and logistic regression for the final classification. Compared to the standard trigram of events model, it improves the true positive rate by 98.3% at a false positive rate of 0.1 %.

The DNN trains states that correspond to the location of the speaker change point (SCP) in the speech segment input to the DNN. We model these different speaker change point locations in the DNN input by 10 to 20 states. The confidence in the SCP is measured by the number of frame synchronous states that correspond to the hypothesized speaker change point. We only keep the speaker change points with the highest confidence. We show that this DNN-based change point detector reduces the number of missed change points for both an English test set and a French dev set.

In the MTL paradigm, the number of parameters in the output layer is large and scales with the number of languages used in training. This output layer becomes a computational bottleneck. For mono-lingual DNNs, low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) of weight matrices have yielded large computational savings [3, 4]. The LRMF proposed in this work for MTL, is for the original language-specific block matrices to "share" a common matrix, with resulting low-rank language specific block matrices. The impact of LRMF is presented in two scenarios, namely : (a) improving performance in a target language when auxiliary languages are included during multi-lingual training; and (b) cross-language transfer to an unseen language with only 1 hour of transcribed training data. A 44% parameter reduction in the final layer, manifests itself in providing a lower memory footprint and faster training times. An experimental study shows that the LRMF multi-lingual DNN provides competitive performance compared to a full-rank multi-lingual DNN in both scenarios.

Despite their subtle differences, this class of models is collectively referred to as "NeuroCRF" in this paper. We focus our attention on applying a linear-chain NeuroCRF to the fundamental and ubiquitous problem of sequence labeling in natural language processing with distributed word representations. We question the necessity of previous works' use of the neural network to learn a low-rank emission feature matrix, added to a transition feature matrix. By modeling a full-rank feature matrix directly, we show that statistically significant gains can be achieved on the CoNLL-2000 syntactic chunking task, without harming performance on tasks with low dependencies between consecutive labels, such as the CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition task.

Relying on procedural memory to enhance independence in daily living activities: Smartphone use in a case of semantic dementia	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Primary progressive aphasia; Semantic dementia; Procedural memory; Semantic rehabilitation; New technologies	FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; PRIMARY-PROGRESSIVE-APHASIA; OBJECT USE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE; WORD PRODUCTION; VERBAL LABELS; ERRORLESS; BRAIN; RETRIEVAL	Relying on procedural memory is a promising approach for interventions that address the cognitive difficulties found in semantic dementia. The aim of this study was to determine if procedural memory could be used to optimise learning of relevant smartphone functions in MH, a 55-year-old man with semantic dementia. The impact of learning to use specific smartphone applications, which display concepts and their semantic characteristics, on relearning useful significant concepts, was also explored in MH. This patient, who showed no deficits in procedural learning on a serial reaction time paradigm, was able to learn manipulations related to 15 smartphone functions although, because of his deficit in word comprehension, he generally needed verbal cues to clarify which functions he was asked to perform. Six months after the end of the intervention, he was still using 8 of the 15 functions regularly. However, repeated exposure to concepts through the use of two applications did not improve naming or retrieval of semantic attributes. This study showed the potential of relying on procedural memory to optimise learning of new technologies in the ecological rehabilitation of semantic dementia.

The energy source is composed of a battery, an ultracapacitor and a Dual Active Bridge DC/DC converter used to optimize the power distribution between the energy sources involved. The neural network control method applied to this bidirectional converter has many advantages: reduction of the computational time, decrease in the amount of data stored and improvement in the transient response. This method is simulated in an Electric Vehicle application using a normalized driving cycle. The simulation results will show the improvements made by this control method compared to the conventional PI controller, in terms of improving the power management, reducing stress on the sources and increasing robustness due to reference changes.

HEALTH MONITORING AND DEGRADATION PROGNOSTICS IN GAS TURBINE ENGINES USING DYNAMIC NEURAL NETWORKS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO: TURBINE TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, 2015, VOL 6			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition	JUN 15-19, 2015	Montreal, CANADA	Int Gas Turbine Inst			LIFE; DETERIORATION; PREDICTION	In this paper two artificially intelligent methodologies are proposed and developed for degradation prognosis and health monitoring of gas turbine engines. Our objective is to predict the degradation trends by studying their effects on the engine measurable parameters, such as the temperature, at critical points of the gas turbine engine. The first prognostic scheme is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. This architecture enables ONE to learn the engine degradations from the available measurable data: The second prognostic scheme is based on a nonlinear auto-regressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network architecture. It is shown that this network can be trained with fewer data points and the prediction errors are lower as compared to the RNN architecture. To manage prognostic and prediction uncertainties upper and lower threshold bounds are defined and obtained. Various scenarios and case studies are presented to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed neural network-based prognostic approaches. To evaluate and compare the prediction results between our two proposed neural network schemes, a metric known as the normalized Akaike information criterion (NAIC) is utilized. A smaller NAIC shows a better, a more accurate and a more effective prediction outcome. The NAIC values are obtained for each case and the networks are compared relatively with one another.

In this paper, we present the architecture of a wireless network of implantable microsystems (Brain-ASNET: Brain Area Sensor NETwork). As well, we introduce an energy-efficient ad-hoc network protocol for the desired network, along with a method to overcome issue of variable packet length caused by bit stuffing process in HDLC standard protocol. To implement the idea, architecture and design of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) is also presented. The SoC can be configured to be used either as a sensor node chip or the network coordinator's RF front-end and network controller. The SoC is designed and laid-out in an IBM 0.13 mu m CMOS process. The post-layout simulation results show energy efficiency of the designed ad-hoc network protocol and low power dissipation of the SoC. The whole chip, including all functional and peripheral integrated components, consumes 138 mu W and 412 mu W, at 1.2V, configured in a synchronized network as a sensor node and the coordinator, respectively.

Affective State Characterization based on Electroencephalography Graph-Theoretic Features	2015 7TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Annual International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 22-24, 2015	Montpellier, FRANCE	IEEE, EMBS			EMOTION	Affective states are typically characterized using spectral power information obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) data collected over specific brain regions. However, while experiencing a complex emotional audio-video stimuli, brain networks transfer information in a highly interactive manner. To characterize this information, we propose using graph theoretical features. Towards this end, first, we established graph theoretical features as meaningful correlates of affective states through Pearson correlation. Then we compared the classification performance of these features with that of conventional spectral power features where percentage increases in classification performance of 7% and 11% were found in arousal and valence, respectively. Moreover, feature level fusion was explored and resulted in better performance as compared to the feature sets alone thus, highlighting the complementarity of EEG graph based features and spectral powers. Overall it is hoped that this study will enhance affective state evaluation via passive brain computer interfaces, thus leading to a plethora of applications such as user experience perception modelling and affective indexing/tagging of videos, to name a few.

This system does not only detect spikes from a neural signal but also can compress this neural signal with a high compression rate. In the compression part, due to the fact that neural signals are not sparse in the time domain, we designed a sensing matrix, called Minimum Euclidean or Manhattan Distance Cluster-based (MDC) matrix, to compress neural signals. Using this MDC matrix and a novel reconstruction algorithm, we achieve a compression rate which can be up to 90% with the reconstruction error being around 0.2. Moreover, the proposed system has relatively low power consumption (0.59 mW) and a small chip area (7 mu m(2)).

Mutual Information Between Inter-Hemispheric EEG Spectro-Temporal Patterns: A New Feature for Automated Affect Recognition	2015 7TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Annual International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 22-24, 2015	Montpellier, FRANCE	IEEE, EMBS			ASYMMETRY; EMOTIONS; AROUSAL	Automated electroencephalography (EEG) based affect recognition has gained a lot of interest recently, with clinical (e.g., in autism), human-computer interaction (e.g., affective brain-computer interfaces), neuromarketing, and even multimedia (e.g., affective video tagging) applications. Typically, conventional EEG features such as spectral power, coherence, and frontal asymmetry have been used to characterize affective states. Recently, cross-frequency coupling measures have also been explored. In this paper, we propose a new feature set that combines some of these aforementioned paradigms. First, the full-band EEG signal is decomposed into four subband signals, namely theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. The amplitude modulation (or envelope) of these signals is then computed via a Hilbert transform. These amplitude modulations are further decomposed into 10 cross-frequency coupling patterns (e.g., gamma-beta coupling pattern). The mutual information between each of these ten patterns is then calculated for all interhemispheric EEG electrode pairs. To gauge the effectiveness of the newly-proposed feature set, the so-called DEAP database was used. Experimental results show the proposed feature set outperforming conventional ones for estimation of arousal, valence, dominance, and liking affective dimensions. Gains of up to 20% could be achieved when the proposed features were fused with spectral power and asymmetry index features, thus suggesting complementarity between spectral and spectro-temporal features for automated affective state recognition.

With the burgeoning market for text-to-speech (TTS) systems, it has become extremely important to characterise new TTS systems in terms of their QoE. To this end, many objective models for quality estimation have been developed. These state-of-the art models are developed considering the system and contextual factors which influence the users' experience. Such models generally lack inputs from human factors, as these are not directly observable and are manifested inside users' brains. Therefore, in this study a multi-modal database was developed for neuro-physiological identification of the human factors which influence user perceived QoE and also to probe into the users' internal quality formation processes. It is hoped that the database will help improve the pre-existing models for quality estimation. The database utilizes neuro-physiological tools, such as electroencephalography and functional near infrared spectroscopy, to record users' brain activity while experiencing synthesised speech produced from various commercially available TTS systems. Moreover, an extensive analysis of participants' ratings has been reported in the paper. Also, the database has been made publicly available online to encourage other researchers to utilize the neuro-physiological insights while developing new quality estimation algorithms.

Mouse Model for Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase D (PTPRD) Associations with Restless Leg Syndrome or Willis-Ekbom Disease and Addiction: Reduced Expression Alters Locomotion, Sleep Behaviors and Cocaine-Conditioned Place Preference	MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SMOKING-CESSATION SUCCESS; MOLECULAR-GENETICS; NICOTINE REPLACEMENT; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; MICE; DELTA; TRIAL; PARTICIPANTS; KNOCKOUT	The receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase D (PTPRD) gene encodes a cell adhesion molecule likely to influence development and connections of addiction-, locomotion-and sleep-related brain circuits in which it is expressed. The PTPRD gene harbors genome-wide association signals in studies of restless leg syndrome (Willis-Ekbom disease [WED]/restless leg syndrome [RLS]; p < 10(-8)) and addiction-related phenotypes (clusters of nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] with 10(-2) > p > 10(-8) associations in several reports). We now report work that seeks (a) association between PTPRD genotypes and expression of its mRNA in postmortem human brains and (b) RLS-related, addiction-related and comparison behavioral phenotypes in hetero-and homozygous PTPRD knockout mice. We identify associations between PTPRD SNPs and levels of PTPRD mRNA in human brain samples that support validity of mouse models with altered PTPRD expression. Knockouts display less behaviorally defined sleep at the end of their active periods. Heterozygotes move more despite motor weakness/impersistence. Heterozygotes display shifted dose-response relationships for cocaine reward. They display greater preference for places paired with 5 mg/kg cocaine and less preference for places paired with 10 or 20 mg/kg. The combined data provide support for roles for common, level-of-expression PTPRD variation in locomotor, sleep and drug reward phenotypes relevant to RLS and addiction. Taken together, mouse and human results identify PTPRD as a novel therapeutic target for RLS and addiction phenotypes.	[Drgonova, Jana; Walther, Donna; Wang, Katherine J.; Hartstein, G.

Recently, attention has turned from the fibers to the early stages of oligomerization where toxicity could be highest. Here, we focus on the interactions between non-A beta amyloid component of alpha-synuclein (NAC) and A beta(1-40), two proteins found in amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease. We combine the coarse-grained OPEP potential with a Hamiltonian and temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation (HT-REMD) to identify mechanisms leading to the formation of secondary structures promoting fibrillation. We observe that the propensity to form beta-sheet remains the same for A beta(1-40) whereas is decreases significantly for NAC. In particular, the 25-35 region of A beta(1-40) is a significant area of secondary structure stabilization with NAC. The ionic interactions between salt-bridge D23 and K28 in A beta(1-40) and K20 and E23 in NAC of the heterogeneous dimer are consistent with the salt-bridges found in NAC and A beta(1-40) homogenous dimers and allow us to see that these interactions don't necessarily dominate the interchain stabilizations. Our numerical simulation also show the formation of interaction between the early oligomer of NAC and A beta(1-40).

One of the problems facing the use of an MFC as a battery is the fact that its internal resistance varies with various external sources of disturbances causing a variation in its optimal point of operation. In this case the use of a real-time optimization method is necessary for the battery to work at its optimum. Extremum seeking control (ESC) can be applied to optimize the system. However, in the case where important external disturbances cause rapid changes in the optimal operating point, ESC converges to a point other than the desired optimum because of its very slow convergence rate. In this paper, a method which judiciously combines an ESC routine with a neural-network based anticipatory action is proposed. The anticipatory action takes into account a measurable external disturbance, namely the inlet substrate concentration. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme leads to an improvement of the convergence rate towards the desired optimum.

The device is capable of housing single worms in microfluidic chambers and precisely adjusting the chamber's chemical environment during experiments. Eight worms can be readily loaded into the chambers through separate loading channels in a quick and gentle manner. In addition, a custom-made software with a graphic user interface is also created for quantitative analysis of locomotion parameters (swimming frequency and bend amplitude) of the worms in response to chemical stimuli, thus greatly enhancing the efficiency of data collection.

Due to several factors extensively reported in the literature, the accuracy of this registration can be much deteriorated after the initial phases of the surgery. In this paper, we present a simple method that allows the surgeon to correct the initial registration by tracing corresponding features in the real and virtual parts of an augmented reality view of the surgical field using a tracked pointer. Results of a preliminary study on a phantom yielded a target registration error of 4.06 +/- 0.91 mm, which is comparable to results for initial landmark registration reported in the literature.

Furthermore, augmented reality visualization allows the surgeon to see beyond the visible surface of the head or brain at the anatomy that is relevant at different stages of surgery. In this paper, the particular surgical tasks that have benefited from AR visualization by the neurosurgeons that have used our system are described. These tasks include: tailoring a craniotomy, localizing the anatomy of interest, planning a resection corridor and determining a surgical strategy. We present each of these surgical tasks and provide examples of how AR was used in the operating room.	[Kersten-Oertel, Marta; Gerard, Ian J.; Drouin, Simon; Collins, D.

Recent advances in machine learning have helped to improve classification and prognosis rates. We present here a classification framework for Alzheimer's disease which extracts triangulated surface meshes from segmented binary maps in MRI, and establishes reliable point-to-point correspondences among a population of hippocampus 3D surfaces using their spectral representation. Morphological changes between groups are detected using a manifold learning algorithm based on Grassmannian kernels in order to assess similarity between shape topology in control normals and patients. A second manifold using discriminant embeddings is then generated to maximize the class separability between three clinical groups recognized in dementia. We test the method to classify 47 subjects with Alzheimers Disease (AD), 47 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 47 healthy controls enrolled in a clinical study. Classification rates compare favorably to standard classification methods based on SVM and traditional manifold learning methods evaluated on the same database.

The validation of this new method is realized by experimental tests using a model installed in the wind tunnel to determine the pressure distribution.

To date, segmentation of the hippocampus for preterm-born neonates has not yet been performed early-in-life (shortly after birth when clinically stable). The present study focuses on the development and validation of an automatic segmentation protocol that is based on the MAGeT-Brain (Multiple Automatically Generated Templates) algorithm to delineate the hippocampi of preterm neonates on their brain MRIs acquired at not only term-equivalent age but also early-in-life. Methods: First, we present a three-step manual segmentation protocol to delineate the hippocampus for preterm neonates and apply this protocol on 22 early-in-life and 22 term images. These manual segmentations are considered the gold standard in assessing the automatic segmentations. MAGeT-Brain, automatic hippocampal segmentation pipeline, requires only a small number of input atlases and reduces the registration and resampling errors by employing an intermediate template library. We assess the segmentation accuracy of MAGeT-Brain in three validation studies, evaluate the hippocampal growth from early-in-life to term-equivalent age, and study the effect of preterm birth on the hippocampal volume. The first experiment thoroughly validates MAGeT-Brain segmentation in three sets of 10-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) analyses with 187 different groups of input atlases and templates. The second experiment segments the neonatal hippocampi on 168 early-in-life and 154 term images and evaluates the hippocampal growth rate of 125 infants from early-in-life to term-equivalent age. The third experiment analyzes the effect of gestational age (GA) at birth on the average hippocampal volume at early-in-life and term-equivalent age using linear regression. Results: The final segmentations demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain consistently provides accurate segmentations in comparison to manually derived gold standards (mean Dice's Kappa > 0.79 and Euclidean distance <1.3 mm between centroids). Using this method, we demonstrate that the average volume of the hippocampus is significantly different (p < 0.0001) in early-in-life (621.8 mm(3)) and term-equivalent age (958.8 mm(3)). Using these differences, we generalize the hippocampal growth rate to 38.3 +/- 11.7 mm(3)/week and 40.5 +/- 12.9 mm(3)/week for the left and right hippocampi respectively. Not surprisingly, younger gestational age at birth is associated with smaller volumes of the hippocampi (p = 0.001). Conclusions: MAGeT-Brain is capable of segmenting hippocampi accurately in preterm neonates, even at early-in-life. Hippocampal asymmetry with a larger right side is demonstrated on early-in-life images, suggesting that this phenomenon has its onset in the 3rd trimester of gestation. Hippocampal volume assessed at the time of early-in-life and term-equivalent age is linearly associated with GA at birth, whereby smaller volumes are associatedwith earlier birth.

However, the cerebral processes underlying these differences are not well understood. This study investigated whether activity in the fluid "reasoning" network, which includes frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions, is differently modulated by task complexity in autistic and non-autistic individuals during the RSPM. In this purpose, we used fMRI to study autistic and non-autistic participants solving the 60 RSPM problems focussing on regions and networks involved in reasoning complexity. As complexity increased, activity in the left superior occipital gyrus and the left middle occipital gyrus increased for autistic participants, whereas non-autistic participants showed increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral precuneus. Using psychophysiological interaction analyses (PPI), we then verified in which regions did functional connectivity increase as a function of reasoning complexity. PPI analyses revealed greater connectivity in autistic, compared to non-autistic participants, between the left inferior occipital gyrus and areas in the left superior frontal gyrus, right superior parietal lobe, right middle occipital gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus. We also observed generally less modulation of the reasoning network as complexity increased in autistic participants. These results suggest that autistic individuals, when confrontedwith increasing task complexity, rely mainly on visuospatial processes when solving more complex matrices. In addition to the now well-established enhanced activity observed in visual areas in a range of tasks, these results suggest that the enhanced reliance on visual perception has a central role in autistic cognition.

Given recent findings of sex differences in HPA axis function in psychosis, the current study investigated differences in HV in male and female first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and controls and the interaction of HV with the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and symptoms. Methods: Fifty-eight patients with a diagnosis of FEP (39 men, 19 women) and 27 healthy community controls (15 men, 12 women) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MM) on a 1.5 T scanner. Hippocampal volume was determined using previously established segmentation protocols. Saliva samples for cortisol assessment were collected at 0, 30 and 60 min after awakening. Psychotic symptoms were assessed with the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. Results: Male patients had significantly smaller left and right HVs compared to male controls, which appeared to be secondary to global brain volume differences. However, even when controlling for overall brain size, male patients showed smaller HV compared to female patients. The CAR was significantly lower in male patients compared to male controls and female patients. Only in male patients, smaller left HV was significantly associated with a blunted CAR, and smaller HV bilaterally was related to positive psychotic symptoms and lower levels of functioning. Conclusions: We propose that reduced hippocampal volume and an attenuated cortisol awakening response are related markers of increased stress vulnerability in male psychosis patients and that both contribute to the unfavorable clinical picture in men.

The neurobiological underpinnings of this deficit are no well understood. Twenty-five patients with recent onset schizophrenia (within the first 4.5 years of treatment) and twenty-four healthy controls completed a source memory Lisk. Participants navigated through a 3D virtual city, and had 20 encounters of an object with a person at a place. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during a subsequent forced-choice recognition test Two objects were presented and participants were asked to either identify which object was seen (new vs. old object recognition), Of identify which of the two old objects was associated with either the person or the place being presented (source memory recognition). Source memory was examined by contrasting person Of place with object. Both patients and controls demonstrated significant neural activity to source memory relative to object memory, though activity in controls was much more widespread. Croup differences were observed in several regions, including the medial parietal and cingulate cortex, lateral frontal lobes and right superior temporal pats. Patients with schizophrenia did not differentiate between source and object memory in these regions. Positive correlations with hallucination proneness were observed in the left frontal and right middle temporal cortices and cerebellum. Patients with schizophrenia have a deficit in the neural circuits which facilitate source memory, which may underlie both the deficits in this domain and be related to auditory hallucinations.

The autism puzzle: Diffuse but not pervasive neuroanatomical abnormalities in children with ASD	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Pediatric neuroanatomical development; Cerebellar hippocampal and basal ganglia volume; Cortical anatomy	EARLY BRAIN OVERGROWTH; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; CORTICAL THICKNESS; SURFACE-AREA; REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR; BASAL GANGLIA; MRI DATA; 3 T; AMYGDALA	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a clinically diagnosed, heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental condition, whose underlying causes have yet to be fully determined. A variety of studies have investigated either cortical, subcortical, or cerebellar anatomy in ASD, but none have conducted a complete examination of all neuroanatomical parameters on a single, large cohort. The current study provides a comprehensive examination of brain development of children with ASD between the ages of 4 and 18 years who are carefully matched for age and sex with typically developing controls at a ratio of one-to-two. Two hundred and ten magnetic resonance images were examined from 138 Control (116 males and 22 females) and 72 participants with ASD (61 males and 11 females). Cortical segmentation into 78 brain-regions and 81,924 vertices was conducted with CIVET which facilitated a region-of-interest-(ROI-) and vertex-based analysis, respectively. Volumes for the cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum, and thalamus and many associated subregions were derived using the MAGeT Brain algorithm. The study reveals cortical, subcortical and cerebellar differences between ASD and Control group participants. Diagnosis, diagnosis-by-age, and diagnosis-by-sex interaction effects were found to significantly impact total brain volume but not total surface area or mean cortical thickness of the ASD participants. Localized (vertex-based) analysis of cortical thickness revealed no significant group differences, even when age, age-range, and sex were used as covariates. Nonetheless, the region-based cortical thickness analysis did reveal regional changes in the left orbitofrontal cortex and left posterior cingulate gyrus, both of which showed reduced age-related cortical thinning in ASD. Our finding of region-based differences without significant vertex-based results likely indicates non-focal effects spanning the entirety of these regions. The hippocampi, thalamus, and globus pallidus, were smaller in volume relative to total cerebrumin the ASD participants. Various sub-structures showed an interaction of diagnosis-by-age, diagnosis-by-sex, and diagnosis-by-age-range, in the case where age was divided into childhood (age < 12) and adolescence (12 < age < 18). This is the most comprehensive imaging-based neuro-anatomical pediatric and adolescent ASD study to date. These data highlight the neurodevelopmental differences between typically developing children and those with ASD, and support aspects of the hypothesis of abnormal neuro-developmental trajectory of the brain in ASD.

However, its effect on interhemispheric (IH) communication is unknown. We combined structural (CC area and DWI), functional (task-related fMRI activation and connectivity analyses) as well as behavioral (Poffenberger and Purdue tasks) measures to investigate IH integration in adult AS individuals of typical intelligence. Despite similar behavioral IH transfer time and performances in bimanual tasks, the CC sub-regions connecting frontal and parietal cortical areas were smaller in AS than in non-AS individuals, while those connecting visual regions were similar. The activation of visual areas was lower in AS than in non-AS individuals during the presentation of visual stimuli. Behavioral IH performances were related to the properties of CC subregions connecting motor areas in non-AS individuals, but to the properties of posterior CC regions in AS individuals. Furthermore, there was greater functional connectivity between visual areas in the AS than in the non-AS group. Levels of connectivity were also stronger in visual than in motor regions in the autistic subjects, while the opposite was true for the non-autistic group. Thus, visual IH transfer plays an important role in visuo-motor tasks in AS individuals. These findings extend the well established enhanced role of perception in autistic cognition to visuo-motor IH information transfer. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Eight patients with the non-fluent variant of PPA (nfvPPA), 13 patients with the semantic variant (svPPA), seven patients with the logopenic variant (lvPPA), and 29 age-matched, neurologically healthy controls were included in the study. All participants underwent longitudinal MRI, neuropsychological and language testing at baseline and at a 1-year follow-up. Tenser-based morphometry (TBM) was applied to T1-weighted MRI images in order to map the progression of gray and white matter atrophy over a 1-year period. Results showed that each patient group was characterized by a specific pattern of cognitive and anatomical changes. Specifically, nfvPPA patients showed gray matter atrophy progression in the left frontal and subcortical areas as well as a decline in motor speech and executive functions; svPPA patients presented atrophy progression in the medial and lateral temporal lobe and decline in semantic memory abilities; and lvPPA patients showed atrophy progression in lateral/posterior temporal and medial parietal regions with a decline in memory, sentence repetition and calculations. In addition, in all three variants, the white matter fibers underlying the abovementioned cortical areas underwent significant volume contraction over a 1-year period. Overall, these results indicate that the three PPA variants present distinct patterns of neuroanatomical contraction, which reflect their clinical and cognitive progression.

MS lesions can vary in size, location and intensity, making automatic segmentation challenging. In this paper, we propose a new supervised method to segment MS lesions from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images using non-local means (NLM). The method uses a multi-channel and rotation-invariant distance measure to account for the diversity of MS lesions. The proposed segmentation method, rotation-invariant multi-contrast non-local means segmentation (RMNMS), captures the MS lesion spatial distribution and can accurately and robustly identify lesions regardless of their orientation, shape or size. An internal validation on a large clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of MS patients demonstrated a good similarity measure result (Dice similarity = 60.1% and sensitivity = 75.4%), a strong correlation between expert and automatic lesion load volumes (R-2 = 0.91), and a strong ability to detect lesions of different sizes and in varying spatial locations (lesion detection rate = 79.8%). On the independent MS Grand Challenge (MSGC) dataset validation, our method provided competitive results with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Qualitative visual and quantitative voxel- and lesion-wise evaluations demonstrated the accuracy of RMNMS method. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In epilepsy research, recent findings suggest that it offers unique insight into the fingerprints of this pathology on brain dynamics. Most studies hitherto have focused on seizure activity during focal epilepsy, but less is known about functional epileptic brain networks during interictal activity in frontal focal and generalized epilepsy. Besides, it is not clear yet which measures are most suitable to characterize these networks. To address these issues, we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data using two orthogonal planar gradiometers from 45 subjects from three groups (15 healthy controls (7 males, 24 +/- 6 years), 15 frontal focal (8 male, 32 +/- 16 years) and 15 generalized epileptic (6 male, 27 +/- 7 years) patients) during interictal resting state with closed eyes. Then, we estimated the total and relative spectral power of the largest principal component of the gradiometers, and the degree of phase synchronization between each sensor site in the frequency range [0.5-40 Hz]. We further calculated a comprehensive battery of 15 graph-theoretic measures and used the affinity propagation clustering algorithm to elucidate the minimum set of them that fully describe these functional brain networks. The results show that differences in spectral power between the control and the other two groups have a distinctive pattern: generalized epilepsy presents higher total power for all frequencies except the alpha band over a widespread set of sensors; frontal focal epilepsy shows higher relative power in the beta band bilaterally in the fronto-central sensors. Moreover, all network indices can be clustered into three groups, whose exemplars are the global network efficiency, the eccentricity and the synchronizability. Again, the patterns of differences were clear: the brain network of the generalized epilepsy patients presented greater efficiency and lower eccentricity than the control subjects for the high frequency bands, without a clear topography. Besides, the frontal focal epileptic patients showed only reduced eccentricity for the theta band over fronto-temporal and central sensors. These outcomes indicate that functional epileptic brain networks are different to those of healthy subjects during interictal stage at rest, with a unique pattern of dissimilarities for each type of epilepsy. Further, when properly selected, three network indices suffice to provide a comprehensive description of these differences. Yet, since such uniqueness in the pattern of differences is also evident in the power spectrum, we conclude that the added value of the graph theory approach in this context should not be overestimated.

Several factors degrade the quality of post-resection ultrasound images such as hemorrhage, air bubbles in tumor cavity and the application of blood-clotting agent around the edges of the resection. As a result, registration of post- and pre-resection ultrasound is of significant clinical importance. In this paper, we propose a nonrigid symmetric registration (NSR) framework for accurate alignment of pre- and post-resection volumetric ultrasound images in near real-time. We first formulate registration as the minimization of a regularized cost function, and analytically derive its derivative to efficiently optimize the cost function. We use Efficient Second-order Minimization (ESM) method for fast and robust optimization. Furthermore, we use inverse-consistent deformation method to generate realistic deformation fields. The results show that NSR significantly improves the quality of alignment between pre- and post-resection ultrasound images.

Arterial CO2 Effects Modulate Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Resting-State fMRI	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY			BOLD; END-TIDAL CO2; wavelets	HUMAN BRAIN; FLUCTUATIONS; NETWORKS	It is well known that the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is influenced in addition to neuronal activity-by fluctuations in physiological signals, including arterial CO2. For instance, even spontaneous CO2 fluctuations have been shown to influence the BOLD fMRI signal regionally. Related to this, studies of functional connectivity between different brain regions, performed when the subject is at rest, may be confounded by the effects of physiological noise. Moreover, resting functional connectivity has been shown to vary with respect to time (dynamic functional connectivity), with the sources of this variation not fully understood at present. In this context, in the present paper we examine the relation between dynamic functional connectivity patterns and the properties of the end-tidal CO2 signal (PETCO2) using resting-state fMRI measurements from 12 healthy subjects. The results demonstrate that there exists a modulatory effect of the correlation strength between PETCO2 and the BOLD signal on dynamic resting functional connectivity. The extent to which this effect was observed was found to be strongly dependent on the data analysis methodology.	[Nikolaou, F.; Mitsis, G.

At present, tailoring the parameters of a stimulation signal to a specific goal relies heavily on parameters from literature. Optimization methods seek to improve tried and tested waveforms developed for specific purposes, however the fundamental understanding of how stimulation parameters interact and the effects these interactions have on brain tissue remains widely unknown. This study explores the interactions between parameters of the constant-current, biphasic square waveform with the intention of developing a stimulation efficient strategy. We find that, the traditional premise of a waveform's effectiveness being dominated by its amplitude does apply, however exceptions are noted which may be of essential importance to the development of electrical stimuli in restrictive paradigms.

Low-Power Adaptive Spike Detector Based on a Sigma-Delta Control Loop	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY			Spike detection; energy-efficent biosignal processing; neural recording; brain-computer interfaces	INTERFACE	This paper presents a resources-optimized digital action potential (AP) detector featuring an adaptive threshold based on a new Sigma-delta control loop. The proposed AP detector is optimized for utilizing low hardware resources, which makes it suitable for implementation on most popular low-power microcontrollers units (MCU). The adaptive threshold is calculated using a digital control loop based on a Sigma-delta modulator that precisely estimates the standard deviation of the amplitude of the neuronal signal. The detector was implemented on a popular low-power MCU and fully characterized experimentally using previously recorded neural signals with different signal-to-noise ratios. A comparison of the obtained results with other thresholding approaches shows that the proposed method can compete with high performance and highly resources demanding spike detection approaches while achieving up to 100% of true positive detection rate at high SNR, and up to 63% for an SNR as low as 0 dB, while necessitating an execution time as low as 11 mu s with the MCU operating at 8 MHz.

A linear parameter varying (LPV) identification algorithm was used to estimate the Hammerstein system relating ankle position to the reflex EMG response. The estimated Hammerstein system comprised a time-invariant (TI) linear element and a TV static nonlinearity that resembled a half-wave rectifier with a threshold and linear gain. The results demonstrated a systematic change in the reflex nonlinearity with the activation level. The gain of TV nonlinearity increased with activation level reaching its peak at 20-30% maximum voluntary contraction and then decreased. The threshold of the nonlinearity decreased with increasing activation level reaching it minimum at the same point where the gain was maximal. Using the LPV-Hammerstein method in this work, the underlying TV dynamics were extracted from small number of trials. Thus, this method can be used to study stretch reflexes in subjects with neuromuscular disorders.

Assessing the PAC at both sensor and source levels may encounter the problem of spurious coupling because of the volume conduction, field spread, and source leakage. This paper presents a novel method, beamformer-based imaging of PAC (BIPAC), to estimate PAC between sources from electromagnetic signals. For each targeted brain region, this method can extract the source component with the maximum PAC to the reference signal. The results from two simulated MEG data sets demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve high localization accuracy and low spurious coupling.

For this type of model, it is common to have millions of parameters to train, commonly requiring large datasets. We investigate a method to transfer learning across different texture classification problems, using CNNs, in order to take advantage of this type of architecture to problems with smaller datasets. We use a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a source dataset (with lots of data) to project the data of a target dataset (with limited data) onto another feature space, and then train a classifier on top of this new representation. Our experiments show that this technique can achieve good results in tasks with small datasets, by leveraging knowledge learned from tasks with larger datasets. Testing the method on the the Brodatz-32 dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 97.04% - superior to models trained with popular texture descriptors, such as Local Binary Patterns and Gabor Filters, and increasing the accuracy by 6 percentage points compared to a CNN trained directly on the Brodatz-32 dataset. We also present a visual analysis of the projected dataset, showing that the data is projected to a space where samples from the same class are clustered together - suggesting that the features learned by the CNN in the source task are relevant for the target task.

Nineteen undergraduate students completed four blocks of the oddball lexical decision task (Nonword targets among Words, Word targets among Nonwords, Word targets among Pseudowords, and Pseudoword targets among Words). We observed a reliable P3 ERP component in conditions where the distinction between rare and frequent trials could be made solely based on lexical status (Words among Nonwords and Nonwords among Words). We saw a reliable P3 to rare words among frequent pseudowords, but no P3 was observed when participants were asked to detect pseudowords in the context of frequent word stimuli. We argue that this observed modulation of the P3 results is consistent with psycholinguistic literature that suggests that two criteria are available during lexical access when performing a lexicality judgement, a non-lexical criterion that relies on global activation at the word level and a lexical criterion that relies on activation of a lexical representation (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001; Grainger & Jacobs, 1996).

Knowing about their faulty behavior before fabrication would be helpful. This research proposes an approach for modeling the faulty behaviour of digital circuits. It could be applied in a design flow before circuit fabrication. This is achieved by extracting information about faulty behaviour of circuits from low-level models expressed in the VHDL language. Afterwards the extracted information is used to train high-level artificial neural networks models expressed in C/C++ or MATLABTM languages. The trained neural network models are able to replicate the behaviour of circuits in presence of faults. The methodology is based on experiments done with two benchmarks, the ISCAS-C17 and a 4-bit multiplier. Results show that the neural network approach leads to models that are more accurate than a previously reported signature generation method. For the C17, using only 30% of the dataset generated with the LIFTING fault simulator, the neural network is able to replicate the output of the circuit in presence of faults with a mean absolute modeling error below 6%.

A contact force regulator capable of accurately applying mechanical stimuli to a live Drosophila larva could greatly facilitate mechanobiology research on Drosophila and may eventually lead to novel discoveries in mechanotransduction of neuron circuitry. In this paper, we present a novel contact force scheme implemented in an automated Drosophila larvae micromanipulation system, featuring a switched fuzzy-PD controller and a noise-insensitive extended high gain observer. The switched fuzzy-PD controller inherits the fast convergence from fuzzy controller and overcomes the drawbacks (overshoot and oscillation) of a conventional fuzzy controller. The observer provides precise estimation to compensate for system modeling errors despite force measurement noise, which overcomes the disadvantage of traditional high gain observer. Force control experiments show that, compared to an conventional PID controller, this new controller-observer scheme has significantly enhanced dynamic performance in terms of rising time, overshoot, and oscillation. The developed robotic system and the force control scheme will be applied to mechanical stimulation and fluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae for identifying new mechanotransduction mechanisms.

The proposed solar PV energy conversion system, along with feeding fundamental active power to the grid, is capable of compensating linear and nonlinear loads with MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking), supply currents balancing, harmonics elimination, PFC (Power Factor Correction) and mitigation of neutral current. The proposed control approach is based on a decoupled adaptive neural network for each phase, which is used along with PV power feed-forward compensation. Decoupled adaptive neural network for each phase improves the convergence speed and provides fast dynamic response to sudden and severe load changes. The proposed grid tied SPV energy conversion system is implemented using DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and its detailed performance analysis is demonstrated.

The high-order neural networks have simple structure and strong nonlinear approximation capability, which enables it to model the nonlinear singularly perturbed systems more accurately with less computation complexity, compared to multilayer neural networks. The optimal bounded ellipsoid algorithm, which is originally designed for discrete time systems, is introduced to update the weights of continuous multi-time scales neural networks. Compared to other widely used gradient-like updating methods, the on-line identification algorithm proposed in this paper can realize faster convergence, due to the adaptive "learning rate" of the weights updating laws. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.

Commercially available patch cords are expensive and break easily. Researchers have developed methods to build these cables in house for in vivo experiments with rodents [1-4]. However, the half-life of those patch cords is greatly reduced when they are used with behaving rats, which are strong enough to break the delicate cable tip and to bite through the optical fiber and furcation tubing. Based on 31 we have strengthened the patch-cord tip that connects to the optical implant, and we have incorporated multiple layers of shielding to produce more robust and resistant cladding. Here, we illustrate how to build these patch cords with FC or M3 connectors. However, the design can be adapted for use with other common optical-fiber connectors. We have saved time and money by using this design in our optical self stimulation experiments with rats, which are commonly several months long and last four to eleven hours per session. The main advantages are: Long half-life. Resistant to moderate rodent bites. Suitable for long in vivo optogenetic experiments with large rodents. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Understanding expert music performance is interesting to cognitive neuroscientists not only because it tests the limits of human memory and movement, but also because studying expert musicianship can help us understand skilled human behavior in general. In this chapter, we outline important facets of our current understanding of the cognitive and neural basis for music performance, and developmental factors that may underlie musical ability. We address three main questions. (1) What is expert performance? (2) How do musicians achieve expert-level performance? (3) How does expert performance come about? We address the first question by describing musicians' ability to remember, plan, execute, and monitor their performances in order to perform music accurately and expressively. We address the second question by reviewing evidence for possible cognitive and neural mechanisms that may underlie or contribute to expert music performance, including the integration of sound and movement, feedforward and feedback motor control processes, expectancy, and imagery. We further discuss how neural circuits in auditory, motor, parietal, subcortical, and frontal cortex all contribute to different facets of musical expertise. Finally, we address the third question by reviewing evidence for the heritability of musical expertise and for how expertise develops through training and practice. We end by discussing outlooks for future work.

Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites receive synaptic inputs from bipolar and amacrine cells, thus allowing cell-to-cell communication and flow of visual information. In glaucoma, damage to RGC axons results in progressive neurodegeneration and vision loss. Recent data indicate that axonal injury triggers rapid structural alterations in RGC dendritic arbors, prior to manifest axonal loss, which lead to synaptic rearrangements and functional deficits. Here, we provide an update on recent work addressing the role of RGC dendritic degeneration in models of acute and chronic optic nerve damage as well as novel mechanisms that regulate RGC dendrite stability. A better understanding of how defects in RGC dendrites contribute to neurodegeneration in glaucoma might provide new insights into disease onset and progression, while informing the development of novel therapies to prevent vision loss.

Neuroscience applied to perception analysis: Heart and emotion when listening to Ecuador's national anthem	REVISTA LATINA DE COMUNICACION SOCIAL			Spanish	Article						Neuroscience; neuro-communication; persuasion; emotion		Introduction: The use of neuroscience methods, tools and techniques has become widespread in recent decades, and the prefix "neuro-" is now applied to disciplines such as the social sciences and communication as a consequence of the understanding that health and medicine are socially constructed. Method: This article analyses the impact of listening to Ecuador's national anthem sung in different languages on a group of Ecuadorian university students based on the analysis of the physical and emotional changes (heart rate and facial expression, respectively) these students experience while listening to the different versions of the anthem. Results and conclusions: The heart rate variability results are not statistically significant and there are only minor differences in the perception of the anthem across gender groups. The analysis of facial expressions revealed an evolutionary sequential emotional pattern that involves "surprise and joy", that is to say, a feeling of satisfaction.

We first recall the major evidence on the recovery of hindlimb locomotion in completely spinalized cats at the T13 level and the role played by the spinal locomotor network, also known as the central pattern generator, as well as the beneficial effects of locomotor training on this recovery. Having established that hindlimb locomotion can recover, we raise the issue as to whether spinal plastic changes could also contribute to the recovery after partial spinal lesions such as unilateral hemisections. We found that after such hemisection at T10, cats could recover quadrupedal locomotion and that deficits could be improved by training. We further showed that, after a complete spinalization a few segments below the first hemisection (at T13, i.e., the level of previous studies on spinalization), cats could readily walk with the hindlimbs within hours of completely severing the remaining spinal tracts and not days as is usually the case with only a single complete spinalization. This suggests that neuroplastic changes occurred below the first hemisection so that the cat was already primed to walk after the spinalization subsequent to the hemispinalization 3 weeks before. Of interest is the fact that some characteristic kinematic features in trained or untrained hemispinalized cats could remain after complete spinalization, suggesting that spinal changes induced by training could also be durable. Other studies on reflexes and on the pattern of "fictive" locomotion recorded after curarization corroborate this view. More recent work deals with training cats in more demanding situations such as ladder treadmill (vs. flat treadmill) to evaluate how the locomotor training regimen can influence the spinal cord. Finally, we report our recent studies in rats using compressive lesions or surgical complete spinalization and find that some principles of locomotor recovery in cats also apply to rats when adequate locomotor training is provided.

It begins by describing the different types of stroke that can occur in adults, their potential consequences on a person's capacity to function in daily life and statistics on the number of strokes and their burden on families and the economy. The assessment of stroke severity, recovery of function over time, and the impact of initial stroke severity and age on potential recovery are then addressed as well as the concept of rehabilitation to enhance recovery. Fueled by the synthesis of an ever-increasing research knowledge base and the creation of stroke rehabilitation recommendations for optimal delivery of rehabilitation services and of therapeutic interventions, stroke rehabilitation has changed dramatically. Examples of improvements in stroke rehabilitation in Canada are given with emphasis on the "best practices" inspired stroke rehabilitation continuum recently recommended for the Province of Quebec. The need for an improved community-based rehabilitation approach that includes regular follow-ups and community-based programs promoting reintegration is emphasized. The importance of knowledge translation strategies to promote the uptake of best-practice recommendations is illustrated by describing the activities of the Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Research Team. Over the past 3 years, the researchers of this team and clinicians in three rehabilitation centers, two in Montreal and one in Quebec City, have collaborated to adopt standardized assessment tools, create a common stroke registry, a best-practice recommended approach to interventions and the participation of clinicians in the research process.

This chapter reviews briefly the role of haptic cues in postural control during tandem stance and locomotion, focusing on sensorimotor enhancement of locomotion post stroke. The use of mixed-reality systems incorporating both haptic cues and virtual reality technology in gait rehabilitation post stroke is discussed. Over the last decade, researchers and clinicians have shown evidence of cerebral reorganization that underlies functional recovery after stroke based on results from neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. These imaging modalities are however limited in their capacity to measure cortical changes during extensive body motions in upright stance. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) on the other hand provides a unique opportunity to measure cortical activity associated with postural control during locomotion. Evidence of cortical changes associated with sensorimotor enhancement induced by haptic touch during locomotion is revealed through fNIRS in a pilot study involving healthy individuals and a case study involving a chronic stroke patient.

Plasticity after stroke has traditionally been perceived as adaptive and supporting recovery, but recent studies have suggested that some plasticity may also be detrimental. In particular, increased activity in the unaffected (contralesional) hemisphere has been proposed to contribute to motor deficits of the paretic hand in some patients. Longitudinal imaging studies in humans have reported a progressive behavioral improvement associated with a decrease of contralesional activity and have correlated the intensity of contralesional hemisphere activity with the degree of motor impairment. Consequently, inhibitory neuromodulatory protocols have been applied to the contralesional hemisphere of stroke patients. Such protocols can facilitate the activation of the ipsilesional motor cortex and improve the function of the paretic limb. Although the use of noninvasive techniques after brain injury shows promise, much work needs to be done to understand better how these approaches affect postlesion plasticity and motor recovery. Ultimately, this knowledge will allow for the design of more effective treatments and will potentially lead to protocols adapted to the specific condition of each patient. In this chapter, we review the literature on the basic pathways that can support the effects of contralesional inhibition, interhemispheric interactions, and some of the changes that can occur in the sensorimotor network after stroke. Finally, we show work in rats that demonstrates how parameters of contralesional inactivation can affect postlesion recovery.

This study aimed to evaluate the content and the quality of patient or carer information that is readily available on the Internet about specific aspects of sexuality after TBI. A purposive (non-exhaustive) sample of eight leaflets available on the Internet related to sexuality following TBI was analysed using content analysis. Decreased desire was reported as the main sexual difficulty following TBI (87.5%), followed by inappropriate sexual behaviour (62.5%). Among the strategies to overcome these difficulties, all leaflets recommended seeking help from healthcare professionals; 42.8% were centred on the carer or the family, and only 28.5% was directly addressed to the individual with TBI. The information available overemphasises disinhibition, underscores other aspects of sexuality (e.g. sexual risk and inability to fantasise), and is conceived mainly for carers and families. A bias assuming that most individuals with TBI are involved in a romantic relationship was also present. Adolescents, women, older people, single people, and non-heterosexual individuals were not adequately represented. There is a need for Internet resources to provide specific recommendations for these groups.

Linda Rinaman and Yvonne Ulrich-Lai at the 2014 Neurobiology of Stress Workshop held in Cincinnati, OH. This symposium comprised research presentations by four neuroscientists whose work focuses on the biological bases for complex interactions among stress, food intake and emotion. First, Dr Ulrich-Lai describes her rodent research exploring mechanisms by which the rewarding properties of sweet palatable foods confer stress relief. Second, Dr Stephanie Fulton discusses her work in which excessive, long-term intake of dietary lipids, as well as their subsequent withdrawal, promotes stress-related outcomes in mice. Third, Dr Mark Wilson describes his group's research examining the effects of social hierarchy-related stress on food intake and diet choice in group-housed female rhesus macaques, and compared the data from monkeys to results obtained in analogous work using rodents. Finally, Dr Gorica Petrovich discusses her research program that is aimed at defining corticalamygdalar-hypothalamic circuitry responsible for curbing food intake during emotional threat (i.e. fear anticipation) in rats. Their collective results reveal the complexity of physiological and behavioral interactions that link stress, food intake and emotional state, and suggest new avenues of research to probe the impact of genetic, metabolic, social, experiential and environmental factors on these interactions.

We recruited 89 participants scoring <27 (n = 47, 36 women) or >33 (n = 42, 35 women) on the maternal care subscale of the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) at a previous assessment of a larger group (N = 709, range PBI maternal care = 0-36, age range = 19-66 years; median 24 years). 85 participants gave blood for DNA methylation analyses (Sequenom(R) EpiTYPER, San Diego, CA) and cell count (Sysmex PocH-100i (TM), Kobe, Japan). Mixed model statistical analysis showed greater DNA methylation in the low versus high maternal care group, in the BDNF target sequence [Likelihood-Ratio (1) = 4.47; p = 0.035] and in one OXTR target sequence Likelihood-Ratio (1) = 4.33; p = 0.037], but not the second OXTR target sequence [Likelihood-Ratio (1) <0.001; p = 0.995). Mediation analyses indicated that differential blood cell count did not explain associations between low maternal care and BDNF (estimate = -0.005, 95% CI = -0.025 to 0.015; p = 0.626) or OXTR DNA methylation (estimate = -0.015, 95% CI = -0.038 to 0.008; p = 0.192). Hence, low maternal care in childhood was associated with greater DNA methylation in an OXTR and a BDNF target sequence in blood cells in adulthood. Although the study has limitations (cross-sectional, a wide age range, only three target sequences in two genes studied, small effects, uncertain relevance of changes in blood cells to gene methylation in brain), the findings may indicate components of the epiphenotype from early life stress.

Case Presentation. We describe a 28-year-old female who presented with primary amenorrhea at the age of 19. She had a history of very mild neurological and dental abnormalities. She was found to have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hypomyelination. The diagnosis of 4H leukodystrophy was made. She was subsequently found to have mutations in the POLR3B gene, which encodes the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase III. She wished to become pregnant and failed to respond to pulsatile GnRH but achieved normal follicular growth and ovulation with subcutaneous gonadotropin therapy. Discussion. Patients with 4H leukodystrophy may initially present with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, particularly if neurological and dentalmanifestations are subtle. Making the diagnosis has important implications for prognosis and management. Progressive neurologic deterioration is expected, and progressive endocrine dysfunction may occur. Patients with 4H leukodystrophy should be counseled about disease progression and about this disease's autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In those who wish to conceive, ovulation induction may be achieved with subcutaneous gonadotropin therapy, but pulsatile GnRH does not appear to be effective.

Comparison of stimulus rivalry to binocular rivalry with functional magnetic resonance imaging	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						visual cortex; inhibition; suppression; stereopsis; competition; attention; bistable	CONTINUOUS FLASH SUPPRESSION; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; PEAK GAMMA FREQUENCY; NEGATIVE BOLD SIGNAL; EARLY VISUAL-CORTEX; FUSIFORM FACE AREA; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTICAL RESPONSES; PARIETAL CORTEX; DOMINANCE DURATIONS	When incompatible images are presented to each eye, a phenomenon known as binocular rivalry occurs in which the viewer's conscious visual perception alternates between the two images. In stimulus rivalry, similar perceptual alternations between rival images can occur even in the midst of fast image swapping between the eyes. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to directly compare brain activity underlying the two types of perceptual rivalry. Overall, we found that activity for binocular rivalry was always stronger and more widespread than that for stimulus rivalry-even more so during passive viewing conditions. In particular, the right superior parietal cortex and the right temporoparietal junction were prominently engaged for passive binocular rivalry. While both types of rivalry engaged higher tier visual regions such as the ventral temporal cortex during an active task, activity for stimulus rivalry was comparatively weak in early visual areas V1 to V3, presumably due to a weaker feed-forward signal due to both intraocular and interocular inhibition that may reduce effective contrast. In sum, only binocular rivalry produced perceptually vivid alternations, increased activation of the early visual cortex, and the coordinated engagement of dorsal stream regions, even when a task was not performed. These findings help characterize how stimulus rivalry fits within hierarchical models of binocular rivalry.

However, it is still not fully understood how color signals combine with luminance signals to affect object-related form processing. This electroencephalographic study aimed to examine the contribution of chromatic contrast by assessing its effects on the time course of shape-related processing. Participants classified Gaborized images of object shapes, nonobject shapes, and patches of pseudorandomly scattered Gabors. Stimuli excited (a) the luminance (L+M) channel alone, (b) luminance and L-M channels, or (c) luminance, L-M, and S-(L+M) channels and were presented either at mean discrimination threshold or at twice this mean threshold. As expected, classification accuracy was comparable at threshold, as were the attributes of the early, perceptual first negative (N1) component of the event-related potential (ERP). Differences emerged at suprathreshold: Objects defined by the full combination of channels were associated with the poorest performance and the lowest N1 amplitude. Shape sensitivity was not consistently observed in the N1 but was more evident in the late positive potential (LPP), a cognitive ERP component. Both the N1 and the LPP were affected by the amount and type of contrast in the image. While the effects of luminance and L-M contrast were similar, affecting the ERP selectively during the N1 and LPP period, S-(L+M) contrast elicited a sustained shift in amplitude. Our results demonstrate, for the first time using a combination of behavioral as well as early and late electrophysiological effects, that shape classification is determined by both the chromatic and the luminance content of the image.

A cortical locus for anisotropic overlay suppression of stimuli presented at fixation	VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Overlay suppression; Horizontal effect; tDCS; Contrast sensitivity; Broadband noise	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTRAST-GAIN-CONTROL; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; CROSS-ORIENTATION SUPPRESSION; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; HUMAN-VISION; EXCITABILITY CHANGES; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE	Human contrast sensitivity for narrowband Gabor targets is suppressed when superimposed on narrowband masks of the same spatial frequency and orientation (referred to as overlay suppression), with suppression being broadly tuned to orientation and spatial frequency. Numerous behavioral and neurophysiological experiments have suggested that overlay suppression originates from the initial lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) inputs to V1, which is consistent with the broad tuning typically reported for overlay suppression. However, recent reports have shown narrowly tuned anisotropic overlay suppression when narrowband targets are masked by broadband noise. Consequently, researchers have argued for an additional form of overlay suppression that involves cortical contrast gain control processes. The current study sought to further explore this notion behaviorally using narrowband and broadband masks, along with a computational neural simulation of the hypothesized underlying gain control processes in cortex. Additionally, we employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in order to test whether cortical processes are involved in driving narrowly tuned anisotropic suppression. The behavioral results yielded anisotropic overlay suppression for both broadband and narrowband masks and could be replicated with our computational neural simulation of anisotropic gain control. Further, the anisotropic form of overlay suppression could be directly modulated by tDCS, which would not be expected if the suppression was primarily subcortical in origin. Altogether, the results of the current study provide further evidence in support of an additional overlay suppression process that originates in cortex and show that this form of suppression is also observable with narrowband masks.

Sleep apnea has been reported in a substantial proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease, but it is unclear whether it has significant consequences for the quality of life of those affected or whether it is associated with other manifestations of the disease. Objective: To verify whether sleep apnea is associated with more severe motor and non-motor clinical features in Parkinson's disease. Methods: Parkinson's disease patients underwent polysomnography to diagnose the presence of sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnoea index >10). Participants also underwent an extensive assessment, blinded to sleep apnea status, to determine disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, treatment complications, and sleep, autonomic, psychiatric, and sensory dysfunctions. Cognitive status was also determined with a complete neuropsychological assessment. Results were assessed using regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration. Results: Of 92 patients examined, 19 had sleep apnea (21%) and 73 did not. We found no significant differences in motor and non-motor symptoms or signs between apneic and non-apneic Parkinson's disease patients. The use of different apnea-hypopnoea index cut-offs (>5 and >15) produced similar results. Conclusions: Our results show that sleep apnea is not associated with more severe motor or non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease. More studies including control groups are needed to confirm the implications of those results.

This lesion is histologically classified into Type-IIA (dyslamination, dysmorphic neurons) and Type-IIB (dyslamination, dysmorphic neurons, and balloon cells). Reliable in-vivo identification of lesional subtypes is important for preoperative decision-making and surgical prognostics. We propose a novel multi-modal MRI lesion profiling based on multiple surfaces that systematically sample intra-and subcortical tissue. We applied this framework to histologically-verified FCD. We aggregated features describing morphology, intensity, microstructure, and function from T1-weighted, FLAIR, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI. We observed alterations across multiple features in FCD Type-IIB, while anomalies in IIA were subtle and mainly restricted to FLAIR intensity and regional functional homogeneity. Anomalies in Type-IIB were seen across all intra-and subcortical levels, whereas those in Type-IIA clustered at the cortico-subcortical interface. A supervised classifier predicted the FCD subtype with 91% accuracy, validating our profiling framework at the individual level.

Serial imaging of organs embedded in agarose blocks is performed by cutting through tissue using a vibratome which sequentially cuts slices in order to reveal new tissue to image, overcoming limited light penetration encountered in microscopy. Two linear stages allow moving the tissue with respect to the microscope objective, acquiring a 2D grid of volumes (1x1x0.3 mm) with OCT and a 2D grid of images (1x1mm) with the confocal arm. This process is repeated automatically, until the entire sample is imaged. Raw data is then post-processed to re-stitch each individual acquisition and obtain a reconstructed volume of the imaged tissue. This design is being used to investigate correlations between white matter and microvasculature changes with aging and with increase in pulse pressure following transaortic constriction in mice. The dual imaging capability of the system allowed to reveal different contrast information: OCT imaging reveals changes in refractive indices giving contrast between white and grey matter in the mouse brain, while transcardial perfusion of FITC or pre-sacrifice injection of Evans Blue shows microsvasculature properties in the brain with confocal imaging.

Standardised formal resuscitation training programmes for reducing mortality and morbidity in newborn infants	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							HELPING BABIES BREATHE; NEONATAL RESUSCITATION; PERINATAL-MORTALITY; PEDIATRIC RESIDENTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; BIRTH ATTENDANTS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; IMPACT; SIMULATION; COURSES	Background Approximately 10% of all newborns require resuscitation at birth. Training healthcare providers in standardised formal neonatal resuscitation training (SFNRT) programmes may improve neonatal outcomes. Substantial healthcare resources are expended on SFNRT. Objectives To determine whether SFNRT programmes reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity, improve acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills, or change teamwork and resuscitation behaviour. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, ongoing trials and conference proceedings in April 2014 and updated in March 2015. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised trials including cluster-randomised trials, comparing a SFNRT with no SFNRT, additions to SFNRT or types of SFNRT, and reporting at least one of our specified outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data independently and performed statistical analyses including typical risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD), and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) (all with 95% confidence intervals (CI)). We analysed cluster-randomised trials using the generic inverse variance and the approximate analysis methods. Main results We identified two community-based and three manikin-based trials that assessed the effect of SFNRT compared with no SFNRT. Very low quality evidence from one study suggested improvement in acquisition of knowledge (RR 5.96, 95% CI 3.60 to 9.87) and skills (RR 170, 95% CI 10.8 to 2711) and retention of knowledge (RR 3.60, 95% CI 2.43 to 5.35) and the other study suggested improvement in resuscitation and behavioural scores. We identified three community-based cluster-randomised trials in developing countries comparing SFNRT with basic resuscitation training (Early Newborn Care). In this setting, there was moderate quality evidence that SFNRT decreased early neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 3 studies, 66,162 neonates) and when analysed by the approximate analysis method (typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96; RD -0.0044, 95% CI -0.0082 to -0.0006; NNTB 227, 95% CI 122 to 1667). Low quality evidence from one trial showed that SFNRT may decrease 28-day mortality (typical RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.91) but the effect on late neonatal mortality was more uncertain (typical RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.11). None of our a priori defined neonatal morbidities were reported. We did not identify any randomised studies in the developed world. We identified two trials that compared SFNRT with team training to SFNRT. Teamwork training of physician trainees with simulation may increase any teamwork behaviour (assessed by frequency) (MD 2.41, 95% CI 1.72 to 3.11) and decrease resuscitation duration (MD -149.54, 95% CI -214.73 to -84.34) but may lead to little or no difference in Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) scores (MD 1.40, 95% CI -2.02 to 4.82; 98 participants, low quality evidence). We identified two trials that compared SFNRT with booster courses to SFNRT. It is uncertain whether booster courses improve retention of resuscitation knowledge (84 participants, very low quality evidence) but may improve procedural and behavioural skills (40 participants, very low quality evidence). We identified two trials on decision support tools, one on a cognitive aid that did not change resuscitation scores and the other on an electronic decision support tool that improved the frequency of correct decision making on positive pressure ventilation, cardiac compressions and frequency of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) adjustments (97 participants, very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions SFNRT compared to basic newborn care or basic newborn resuscitation, in developing countries, results in a reduction of early neonatal and 28-day mortality. Randomised trials of SFNRT should report on neonatal morbidity including hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Innovative educational methods that enhance knowledge and skills and teamwork behaviour should be evaluated.

Both in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome, this is accompanied by the atrophy of NGF-dependent cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. An NGF trophic compromise in Alzheimer's disease had been early suspected. This hypothesis was discarded with the finding of unaltered NGF mRNA synthesis and of increased NGF precursor levels (proNGF) in postmortem Alzheimer's disease brains. The possibility of an NGF trophic disconnection has been recently revisited at the light of a newly discovered extracellular NGF metabolic pathway; where proNGF is released in an activity-dependent manner and converted by plasmin to mature NGF in the extracellular space. Mature NGF is ultimately degraded by the metalloprotease MMP-9. This pathway has been shown to be compromised in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome brains, thus reviving the trophic factor hypothesis to explain the atrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in these disorders. This chapter will discuss the physiological role of NGF and its biological significance to cholinergic neurons of the CNS, and present the evidence for a dysregulation of the NGF metabolism in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.

Differential Expression of Ribosomal Genes in Brain and Blood of Alzheimer's Disease Patients	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; brain; blood; ribosomal genes; 18S; 28S	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; APOE GENOTYPE; NEURODEGENERATION; METHYLATION; PEPTIDES; GENETICS; CERAD; RNA	Changes in rRNA and rDNA expression have been associated with cellular and organism aging and have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the mRNA expression of ribosomal genes (28S/18S) and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in different post mortem brain tissue regions (the entorhinal and auditory cortices and the hippocampus) of AD patients and elderly control subjects and also evaluated the extent of expression in peripheral blood from young, healthy, elderly, and Alzheimer's disease patients in order to investigate whether these individuals experienced the effects of aging. The comparative threshold cycle (CT) method via Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) were used to analyze gene expression and the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, respectively. When the brain areas were analyzed collectively, we observed a significant decrease in APP expression and a significant increase in levels of mRNA of 18S and 28S in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy elderly individuals. Furthermore, there was a significant upregulation of 28SrRNA in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, but not in the auditory cortex of patients with AD. On the other hand, tests of blood samples verified a decreased expression of 28S rRNA in patients with AD. These results support the hypothesis that changes in rRNA are present in AD patients, are tissue-specific, and seem to occur independently and differently in each tissue. However, the next challenge is to discover the mechanisms responsible for the differences in expression observed in the blood and the brain in both healthy elderly individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as the impact of these genes on AD pathogenesis.

We propose a new measure of problem hardness based on the transient microstate percentage of EEG signals. Based on the heuristic that different segments of design protocol data have different perceived hardness, we use this transient microstate percentage to segment design protocol data into domain-valid segments. Currently, two main techniques exist to analyze design protocol data: simultaneous thinking aloud and retrospective protocol analysis. Our method based on physiological measurements ( EEG) mitigates the strengths and weaknesses of both methods. It was able to classify some segments as expected and discover new segments. Using EEG to solve this problem is a typical inverse problem where a thought process is reconstructed from potential-valued signals of the brain. We discuss limitations and challenges of such an approach.

TrkA/B/C is known to drive tumorogensis and metastatic potential in a wide range of neurogenic and non-neurogenic human cancers. The development of suitable positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands would allow an in vivo exploration of this versatile potential therapeutic target. Herein, the rational remodeling of the amide moiety of a 6-(2-(3-fluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine-3-amide lead structure to accommodate efficient fluorine-18 labeling led to the identification of a series of fluorinated Trk inhibitors with picomolar IC50. The ensuing representative radiolabeled inhibitors [F-18] 16 ([F-18]-(perpendicular to)-IPMICF6) and [F-18]27 ([F-18]-(perpendicular to)-IPMICF10) constitute novel lead radioligands with about 2- to 3-orders of magnitude increased TrkB/C potencies compared to previous lead tracers and display favorable selectivity profiles and physicochemical parameters for translation into in vivo PET imaging agents.

To quantify this morphological development, it is necessary to extract the interface between gray matter and white matter. We employed the well-established CIVET pipeline to extract this cortical surface, with point correspondence across subjects, using a surface-based spherical registration. We developed a variant of the pipeline, called NEOCIVET, that addresses the well-known problems of poor and temporally-varying gray/white contrast in neonatal MRI. NEOCIVET includes a tissue classification strategy that combines i) local and global contrast features, ii) neonatal template construction based on age-specific subgroups, and iii) masking of non-interesting structures using label-fusion approaches. These techniques replaced modules that might be suboptimal for regional analysis of poor-contrast neonatal cortex. In the analysis of 43 preterm-born neonates, many with multiple scans (n=65; 28-40 wks PMA at scan), NEOCIVET identified increases in cortical folding over time in numerous cortical regions (mean curvature: +0.004/wk) while folding did not change in major sulci that are known to develop early (corrected p<0.05). Cortical folding increase was disrupted in the presence of severe types of perinatal WM injury. The proposed pipeline successfully mapped cortical structural development, supporting current models of cerebral morphogenesis.	[Kim, Hosung; Barkovich, A.

Many of these methods rely on appropriate Finite Element (FE) or other mathematical model of a structure and updating the model using the field data. There are a number of existing methods for updating such models and identifying system parameters such as stiffness and mass based on dynamic parameters response of a structure. These methods can be broadly categorized as Physics-based and data-driven models. Since, the model updating problem is an inverse problem, the Physics-based model often provide nonunique solutions. On the other hand, data-driven models using methods like artificial neural networks (ANN) or Genetic Algorithm (GA) utilizes the differences in the data patterns in the structural response in order to update the system parameters. In this study, the FE models of two bridges, a Pre-Stress Concrete Box (PSCB) girder bridge and a Void Slab Bridge have been constructed and updated using measured vibration data. It should be mentioned that both of the bridges are relatively new and there is no reported damage in them. The bridges were instrumented with accelerometers and the modal vectors and frequencies were determined based on ambient vibration tests. The aim of this research is to compare the physics-based and data driven methods of model updating using the data from ambient vibration tests. While the physics-based method was found to be is more precise than GA and NN in both of case studies, the latter two methods provide the flexibility when the data sets are incomplete and noisy.

Stereo Vision: The Haves and Have-Nots	I-PERCEPTION			English	Article						Stereopsis; General population; have-nots		Animals with front facing eyes benefit from a substantial overlap in the visual fields of each eye, and devote specialized brain processes to using the horizontal spatial disparities produced as a result of viewing the same object with two laterally placed eyes, to derived depth or 3-D stereo information. This provides the advantage to break the camouflage of objects in front of similarly textured background and improves hand eye coordination for grasping objects close at hand. It is widely thought that about 5% of the population have a lazy eye and lack stereo vision, so it is often supposed that most of the population (95%) have good stereo abilities. We show that this is not the case; 68% have good to excellent stereo (the haves) and 32% have moderate to poor stereo (the have-nots). Why so many people lack good 3-D stereo vision is unclear but it is likely to be neural and reversible.

There are different conventional methods for capturing respiration signal, such as polysomnography and spirometer. In spite of their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based respiration monitoring platform which allows the patient to continue treatment and diagnosis from different places such as home. These remote services are designed for patients who suffer from breathing problems or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. Based on the high correlation between spirometer and accelerometer signals, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has been applied on respiration signals. The obtained results show that DFA can be used as an efficient feature while classifying the healthy people from patients suffering from breath abnormalities.

However, we do not know how much of this association is confounded by genetics, nor whether the postnatal environment can moderate the impact of in utero adversity. This study used a monozygotic (MZ) twin design to assess (1) the association between birth weight (BW) and brain volume in adolescence, (2) the association between within-twin-pair BW discordance and brain volume discordance in adolescence, and (3) whether the association between BW and brain volume in adolescence is mediated or moderated by early negative maternal parenting behaviours. These associations were assessed in a sample of 108 MZ twins followed longitudinally since birth and scanned at age 15. The total grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes were obtained using the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) toolbox in the Statistical Parametric Mapping version 8 (SPM8). We found that the BW was significantly associated with the total GM and WM volumes, particularly in the superior frontal gyrus and thalamus. Within-twin-pair discordance in BW was also significantly associated with within-pair discordance in both the GM and the WM volumes, supporting the hypothesis that the specific in utero environment is associated with brain development independently of genetics. Early maternal hostile parenting behaviours and depressive symptoms were associated with total GM volume but not WM volume. Finally, greater early maternal hostility may moderate the association between the BW and GM volume in adolescence, since the positive association between the BW and total GM volume appeared stronger at higher levels of maternal hostility (trend). Together, these findings support the importance of the in utero and early environments for brain development. (C) 2015 S.

An open question is: Can effects of optical defects be compensated by perceptual learning in neural processing? To address this question, we conducted a perceptual learning study on 23 observers with myopic vision, targeting high frequency deficits by training them in a monocular grating detection task in the non-dominant eye near their individual cutoff spatial frequencies. The contrast sensitivity function and visual acuity in both eyes (without optical correction) were assessed for all the observers in the training group before and after training, and for all the observers in the control group twice with a 10-day interval between the tests. In addition, the threshold versus external noise contrast function was measured for five observers in the training group before and after training. We found that (a) training significantly improved contrast sensitivity at the trained spatial frequency, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity over a wide range of spatial frequencies in both eyes; (b) training did not lead to any significant refractive changes; (c) the mechanism of improvements was a combination of internal additive noise reduction and external noise exclusion; and (d) the improvements in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were almost fully retained for at least four months in the three observers tested. These results suggest that perceptual learning may provide a potential noninvasive procedure to compensate for optical defects in mild to modest myopia.

We developed a computational model of a microglial cytokine interaction network to study the regulatory mechanisms of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. We established a literature-based cytokine network, including TNF alpha, TGF beta, and IL-10, and fitted a mathematical model to published data from LPS-treated microglia. The addition of a previously unreported TGF beta autoregulation loop to our model was required to account for experimental data. Global sensitivity analysis revealed that TGF beta- and IL-10-mediated inhibition of TNF alpha was critical for regulating network behavior. We assessed the sensitivity of the LPS-induced TNF alpha response profile to the initial TGF beta and IL-10 levels. The analysis showed two relatively shifted TNF alpha response profiles within separate domains of initial condition space. Further analysis revealed that TNF alpha exhibited adaptation to sustained LPS stimulation. We simulated the effects of functionally inhibiting TGF beta and IL-10 on TNF alpha adaptation. Our analysis showed that TGF beta and IL-10 knockouts (TGF beta KO and IL-10 KO) exert divergent effects on adaptation. TFGb KO attenuated TNF alpha adaptation whereas IL-10 KO enhanced TNF alpha adaptation. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that IL-10 KO enhances TNF alpha adaptation in murine macrophages and found supporting evidence. These opposing effects could be explained by differential kinetics of negative feedback. Inhibition of IL-10 reduced early negative feedback that results in enhanced TNF alpha-mediated TGF beta expression. We propose that differential kinetics in parallel negative feedback loops constitute a novel mechanism underlying the complex and non-intuitive pro-versus anti-inflammatory effects of individual cytokine perturbations.

Overall, significant relationships between a subset of trait emotions (trait anger, trait anxiety) and personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) were found for three agent-directed emotions (pride, boredom, and neutral) though the relationships differed between the two PAs. These results demonstrate that some trait emotions and personality traits can be used to predict learners' emotions toward specific PAs (with different roles). Suggestions are provided for adapting PAs to support learners' (with certain characteristics) experience of positive emotions (e.g., enjoyment) and minimize their experience of negative emotions (e.g., boredom). Such an approach presents a scalable and easily implemented method for creating emotionally-adaptive, agent-based learning environments, and improving learner-PA interactions to support learning.

Trp catabolites, by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), play an important role in antimicrobial defense and immune regulation. IDO/AhR acts as a double-edged sword by both depleting L-Trp to starve the invaders and by contributing to the state of immunosuppression with microorganisms that were not cleared during acute infection. Pathogens experiencing Trp deprivation by IDO-mediated degradation include certain bacteria, parasites, and less likely viruses. However, chronic viral infections highjack the host immune response to create a state of disease tolerance via kynurenine catabolites. This review covers the latest data involving chronic viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) and their cellular interplay with Trp catabolites. Strategies developed by viruses to escape immune control also represent new avenues for therapeutic interventions based on Trp metabolism.

The implementation intends to use multicore architectures of modern CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor. The learning procedure is based on the matrix description of RBM, where the learning samples are grouped into packages, and represented as matrices. The influence of the package size on convergence of learning, as well as on performance of computation, are studied for various number of threads, using conventional CPU and Intel Phi architecures. Our research confirms a potential usefulness of MIC parallel architecture for implementation of RBM and similar algorithms.

However, the extent of structural changes after lower limb amputation in patients without phantom pain remains uncertain. We studied 17 adult patients with right lower limb amputation and 18 healthy control subjects using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter (WM) were investigated. In amputees, a thinning trend was seen in the left premotor cortex (PMC). Smaller clusters were also noted in the visual-to-motor regions. In addition, the amputees also exhibited a decreased FA in the right superior corona radiata and WM regions underlying the right temporal lobe and left PMC. Fiber tractography from these WM regions showed microstructural changes in the commissural fibers connecting the bilateral premotor cortices, compatible with the hypothesis that amputation can lead to a change in interhemispheric interactions. Finally, the lower limb amputees also displayed significant FA reduction in the right inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, which is negatively correlated with the time since amputation. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the amputation of lower limb could induce changes in the cortical representation of the missing limb and the underlying WM connections.

Method: A scoping review of the literature was conducted using the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and Cochrane Library databases. Results: A total of 19 articles were retained from the search, and 2 additional articles were retrieved from grey literature (i.e., non-published sources). Personal factors affecting LOS are age and sex, both of which had inconsistent effects on LOS, and communication, language, physical, and cognitive difficulties, for which higher levels of function were generally associated with shorter LOS. Institutional factors affecting LOS were location, interdisciplinary communication, number of disciplines involved, and type of rehabilitation setting. Finally, two clinician-related factors-fewer treatment goals and a selection of evidence-informed treatment techniques-were associated with shorter LOS. Conclusions: Research on factors affecting adult outpatient rehabilitation LOS is limited and inconsistent. A preliminary list of LOS factors was produced, but this topic should be further explored with the collaboration of researchers and clinical institutions.

Is there a functional elementary core sustaining this cognitive process? Could we reproduce the mechanism with an artificial agent and more specifically in a neurorobotic paradigm? Unsupervised autonomous robots may require a decision-making skill to evolve in the real world and the bioinspired approach is the avenue explored through this paper. We propose simulating an AS process by using a small spiking neural network (SNN) as the lower neural organisms, in order to control virtual and physical robots. We base our AS process on a simple central pattern generator (CPG), decision neurons, sensory neurons, and motor neurons as the main circuit components. As novelty, this study targets a specific operant conditioning (OC) context which is relevant in an AS process; choices do influence future sensory feedback. Using a simple adaptive scenario, we show the complementarity interaction of both phenomena. We also suggest that this AS kernel could be a fast track model to efficiently design complex SNN which include a growing number of input stimuli and motor outputs. Our results demonstrate that merging AS and OC brings flexibility to the behavior in generic dynamical situations.

The objective of this system is to maintain the learner in a positive mental state throughout the tutoring session by selecting the next pedagogical activity that fits the best to his current state. An experimental evaluation of our approach involving two groups of learners showed that the group who interacted with the mental state-based adaptive version of the system obtained higher learning outcomes and had a better learning experience than the group who interacted with a non-adaptive version.

Management of persistent postconcussion symptoms in youth: a randomised control trial protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; GENERIC CORE SCALES; PREADOLESCENT CHILDREN; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; AEROBIC FITNESS; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; EXERCISE; VALIDITY	Introduction: Current management of concussion consists of early education, rest until symptom free, with gradual return to school and physical activity protocols. Although this management strategy is effective for most youth who sustain a concussion, it is not an appropriate strategy for youth with persistent postconcussion symptoms. Prolonged rest and periods of restricted activity may place youth at risk for secondary issues and contribute to the chronicity of postconcussion symptoms. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an active rehabilitation protocol for youth who are slow to recover from concussion. It is hypothesised that an active rehabilitation intervention can reduce persistent postconcussion symptoms, improve function and facilitate return to activity. This article describes the research protocol. Methods and analysis: This is a randomised clinical trial with blinded outcome measurement. Participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, an active rehabilitation intervention or a standard care education group. Both groups will receive standard care education. However, the active rehabilitation group will participate in an additional low-intensity exercise programme consisting of aerobic, coordination and visualisation exercises. Both the active rehabilitation and the standard care education interventions will be 6 weeks in duration. The primary outcome measure is postconcussion symptoms. Secondary outcome measures include functional recovery (cognitive, motor, psychosocial and emotional functioning) and return to activity. Outcome measures will be administered preintervention and postintervention. The primary outcome measure will also be repeated 2 weeks into the intervention period. Ethics and dissemination: This study has been approved by the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital research ethics board (REB # 13-459). The findings from this study will be shared with the general public, sport associations, relevant brain injury organisations and healthcare professionals.

Shared Control of an Intelligent Wheelchair with Dynamic Constraints Using Brain-Machine Interface	INTELLIGENT ROBOTICS AND APPLICATIONS (ICIRA 2015), PT II	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Applications (ICIRA)	AUG 24-27, 2015	Portsmouth, ENGLAND			Shared control; Brain-machine interfaces; Dynamic constraints	EEG; NETWORKS	In this paper, a human-machine shared control strategy is developed for the navigation of a wheelchair. The shared controller switches between a brain-machine control mode and an autonomous control mode. In the brain-machine control mode, a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) using only two command signals produced by steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) instead of traditional four-direction command signals is developed. These two brain signals are involved to generate a polar polynomial trajectory (PPT), which is continuous in curvature without violating dynamic constraints of the wheelchair. In the autonomous control mode, the synthesis of angle-based potential field (APF) and vision-based simultaneous localization and map-building (SLAM) technique is proposed to guide the robot navigating in environments where obstacles exist. Experimental studies have been carried out with a number of volunteers and the effectiveness of the proposed shared control scheme has been verified.

However, the index can be calculated in two ways, and so, the first approach uses the mean of the mean silhouettes through all the clusters. On the other hand, the second one is realized by averaging the silhouettes over the whole data set. These various approaches of the index have significant influence on indicating the proper number of clusters in a data set. To study the performance of the index, as the underlying clustering algorithms, two popular hierarchical methods were applied, that is, the complete-linkage and the single-linkage algorithm. These methods have been used for artificial and real-life data sets, and the results confirm very good performances of the index and they also allow to choose the best approach.

To explore differences according to sex in sociosexuality and infidelity in individuals with TBI and in healthy controls. Participants. Forty-two individuals with mild, moderate, and severe TBI having completed a postacute TBI rehabilitation program, at least six months after injury, and 47 healthy controls. Main Measures. Sociosexual Orientation Inventory-Revised (SOI-R) and Attitudes toward Infidelity Scale. Results. Overall, men score significantly higher than women in sociosexuality. However, there was a nonsignificant trend towards a reduction of sociosexuality levels in men with TBI. Infidelity levels were comparable in healthy controls and individuals with TBI. In individuals with TBI, less acceptance of infidelity was significantly associated with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation, but not in healthy controls. Conclusions. As documented in previous cross-cultural studies, men have higher levels of sociosexuality than women. However, men with TBI showed a tendency towards the reduction of sociosexuality. The possibility of a latent explanatory variable is suggested (e.g., post-TBI neuroendocrinological changes). TBI does not seem to have an impact on infidelity, but individuals with TBI who express less acceptance of infidelity also report a more promiscuous mating strategy regarding their behavior, attitudes, and desire.

A core feature of such hyperarousal theory of insomnia involves increased sensory processing that interferes with the onset andmaintenance of sleep. In this work, we collected structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 35 patients with primary insomnia and 35 normal sleepers and applied structural covariance analysis to investigate whether insomnia is associated with disruptions in structural brain networks centered at the sensory regions (primary visual, primary auditory, and olfactory cortex). As expected, insomnia patients showed increased structural covariance in cortical thickness between sensory and motor regions. We also observed trends of increased covariance between sensory regions and the default-mode network, and the salience network regions, and trends of decreased covariance between sensory regions and the frontoparietal working memory network regions, in insomnia patients. The observed changes in structural covariance tended to correlated with poor sleep quality. Our findings support previous functional neuroimaging studies and provide novel insights into variations in brain network configuration that may be involved in the pathophysiology of insomnia.

Sedation Safety Study Grp Pediat E	The design of a multicentre Canadian surveillance study of sedation safety in the paediatric emergency department	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							INTRAVENOUS KETAMINE SEDATION; PROCEDURAL SEDATION; ADVERSE EVENTS; CHILDRENS BEHAVIOR; OPERATING-ROOM; DOUBLE-BLIND; RESEARCH CONSORTIUM; ANALGESIA; HOSPITALIZATION; MIDAZOLAM	Introduction: Procedural sedation and analgesia have become standard practice in paediatric emergency departments worldwide. Although generally regarded as safe, serious adverse events such as bradycardia, asystole, pulmonary aspiration, permanent neurological injury and death have been reported, but their incidence is unknown due to the infrequency of their occurrence and lack of surveillance of sedation safety. To improve our understanding of the safety, comparative effectiveness and variation in care in paediatric procedural sedation, we are establishing a multicentre patient registry with the goal of conducting regular and ongoing surveillance for adverse events in procedural sedation. Methods: This multicentre, prospective cohort study is enrolling patients under 18 years of age from six paediatric emergency departments across Canada. Data collection is fully integrated into clinical care and is performed electronically in real time by the healthcare professionals caring for the patient. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who experience a serious adverse event as a result of their sedation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients who experience an adverse event that could lead to a serious adverse event, proportion of patients who receive a significant intervention in response to an adverse event, proportion of patients who experience a successful sedation, and proportion of patients who experience a paradoxical reaction to sedation. There is no predetermined end date for data collection. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been obtained from participating sites. Results will be disseminated using a multifaceted knowledge translation strategy by presenting at international conferences, publication in peer-reviewed journals, and through established networks.

Anti-Dementia Drugs-Related Changes in Gait Performance While Single and Dual Tasking in Patients with Alzheimer Disease: A Meta-Analysis	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; anti-dementia drugs; dual task; gait disorders; meta-analysis; older adults	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; OPEN-LABEL; VARIABILITY; FALLS; PREVALENCE; GUIDELINES; MEMANTINE; DEMENTIA; RISK	Background: The effects of anti-dementia drugs on gait performance in Alzheimer disease (AD) are questionable. The objective of this meta-analysis was to examine the effects of anti-dementia drugs on the mean value and the coefficient of variation (CoV) of stride time among patients with AD while taking into account the type of drugs (i.e., acetylcholinesterase inhibitors [AChEIs] versus memantine) and the walking conditions (i.e., single versus dual-task). Methods: An English and French Medline search was conducted in March 2015, with no limit of date, using the Medical Subject Headings terms "pharmaceutical preparations" combined with terms "Pharmaceutical preparations" OR "Therapeutic uses" OR "Drug substitution" OR "Drugs essential" OR "Drugs, Generic" OR "Psychotropic drugs" combined with "Delirium" OR "Dementia" OR "Amnestic" OR "Cognitive disorders" AND "Gait" OR "Gait Ataxia" OR "Gait disorders, Neurologic" OR "Gait apraxia". Fixed-effects meta-analyses were used to examine anti-dementia drugs-related changes in mean value and CoV of stride time. Results: Of the 66 identified abstracts, 5 (7.6%) were included in the meta-analysis. Inter-group comparison of between-visit change underscored a significant decrease in CoV of stride time (P<0.004) in intervention group compared to control group, whatever the pooled analysis considered, but no significant change in the mean value (P>0.06). Intra-group changes in stride time parameters following the use of anti-dementia drugs showed a significant decrease for memantine (P<0.001) and while pooling AChEIs and memantine (P<0.001) under single task condition. Under dual task condition, only AChEIs improved significantly stride time parameters (P=0.002). Conclusion: Anti-dementia drugs demonstrated a significant improvement of gait performance with specific class effect depending on the walking conditions and on the type of stride time parameters considered.

The objective of this study was to study the epidemiological features of primary brain tumors in Jordan. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study incorporating data from 16 hospitals in Jordan during a 1 year period (May 1, 2011-April 30, 2012). All primary brain tumors diagnosed in Jordan during the study period were identified. The following parameters were retrieved from patients' files: age, gender, histological type, and location. The demographic data of the country was obtained from the National Department of Statistics. Results: A total of 313 primary brain tumors were identified during the study period. The incidence of primary brain tumors in Jordan among the general population was 5.01 per 100,000 person-years (5.38 in females and 4.65 in males). The incidence in pediatric, adult, and elderly patients was 2.09, 7.29, and 14.38 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The most common histological types were meningioma (26.2%), glioblastonna (18.9%), astrocytoma (14.1%), and pituitary adenoma (9.3%). Condusions: The incidence of primary brain tumors in the Jordanian population is relatively low, in part due to the young age of the general population. (C) 2015 S.

While dopaminergic treatments have improved the motor aspects of PD, progression remains inevitable. Research has recently increasingly focused on strategies to modify disease progression and on nonmotor manifestations of PD, given their impact on patients' quality of life. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a treatable sleep disorder, common in the general population, associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and neurocognitive deficits. Neuroimaging has demonstrated structural and functional changes in OSA patients; in animal models, OSA causes brain inflammation and oxidative injury, including in key areas involved in PD pathophysiology such as locus coeruleus. The prevalence of OSA in PD has been variable in studies to date, and potential consequences and interrelationship between the two disorders have not been well studied. There is however emerging evidence that OSA is associated with increased NMS in PD, particularly cognitive dysfunction. This review focuses on the possible interrelationship between OSA and PD. Mechanisms promoting OSA in PD will be reviewed, as well as mechanisms whereby OSA can affect the neurodegenerative process in PD.	[Kaminska, Marta; Kimoff, R.

Recent papers argue that epigenetic marks acquired through experience are passed to offspring, but as in much of the field of epigenetics, there is lack of precision in the definitions and perhaps too much eagerness to translate animal research to humans. Here, we review operational definitions of transgenerational inheritance and the processes of epigenetic programing during early development. Subsequently, based on this background, we critically examine some recent findings of studies investigating transgenerational inheritance. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms that may explain transgenerational inheritance, including transmission of an epigenetic blueprint, which may predispose offspring to specific epigenetic patterning. Taken together, we conclude that presently, the evidence suggesting that acquired epigenetic marks are passed to the subsequent generation remains limited.

Whether these abnormalities are associated with impaired synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Methods: The effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) on transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were assessed on average two weeks and six weeks following mTBI in five individuals. Results: The procedure was well-tolerated by all participants. Continuous TBS failed to induce a significant reduction of MEP amplitudes two weeks after the injury, but response to cTBS normalized six weeks following injury, as a majority of patients became asymptomatic. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that cTBS can be used to assess M1 synaptic plasticity in subacute phase following mTBI and may provide insights into neurobiological substrates of symptoms and consequences of mTBI.

Depressive symptoms influence use of feedback for motor learning and recovery in chronic stroke	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Rehabilitation; kinematics; upper limb; mood; knowledge of performance; knowledge of results; cerebrovascular accident	RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL; POSTSTROKE DEPRESSION; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; NEGATIVE FEEDBACK; NEURAL PLASTICITY; POST-STROKE; REHABILITATION; ARM; THERAPY; IMPAIRMENT	Purpose: Sensorimotor impairments and depressive symptoms (PSD) influence arm motor recovery post-stroke. Feedback provision improves upper limb motor learning in patients with chronic stroke but factors including PSD may affect ability to use feedback. We evaluated the influence of PSD on the ability to use auditory feedback for upper limb recovery and motor learning in patients with chronic stroke. Methods: Participants (n = 24) practiced 72 pointing movements/session (6 targets, 12 sessions, randomized) with auditory feedback on movement speed and trunk displacement. The presence of PSD (Beck's Depression Inventory; BDI-II) was assessed at pre-intervention (PRE). Arm motor impairment (Fugl-Meyer Assessment, shoulder horizontal adduction, shoulder flexion, elbow extension ranges, trunk displacement) and arm use (Motor Activity Log) were assessed at PRE, immediately after (POST) and retention (3mos; RET). Participants were divided into two groups based on BDI-II scores: >= 14/63 (DEP group; n = 8; score: 20.5+/-7.5) and <= 13/63 (no PSD (ND) group; n = 16; score: 5.0+/-3.8). Changes in impairment and arm use levels were assessed (mixed-model ANOVAs). Results: All participants improved arm use.

Greater amygdala activity and dorsomedial prefrontal-amygdala coupling are associated with enhanced inflammatory responses to stress	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Amygdala; Medial prefrontal cortex; Inflammation; IL-6; Stress; Social stress; Social rejection; fMRI; Neuroimaging	C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; SOCIAL REJECTION; CONDITIONED FEAR; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; PHYSICAL HEALTH; SEX-DIFFERENCES; DISEASE	Psychological stress is implicated in the etiology of many common chronic diseases and mental health disorders. Recent research suggests that inflammation may be a key biological mediator linking stress and health. Nevertheless, the neurocognitive pathways underlying stress-related increases in inflammatory activity are largely unknown. The present study thus examined associations between neural and inflammatory responses to an acute laboratory-based social stressor. Healthy female participants (n = 31) were exposed to a brief episode of stress while they underwent an fMRI scan. Blood samples were taken before and after the stressor, and plasma was assayed for markers of inflammatory activity. Exposure to the stressor was associated with significant increases in feelings of social evaluation and rejection, and with increases in levels of inflammation. Analyses linking the neural and inflammatory data revealed that heightened neural activity in the amygdala in response to the stressor was associated with greater increases in inflammation. Functional connectivity analyses indicated that individuals who showed stronger coupling between the amygdala and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) also showed a heightened inflammatory response to the stressor. Interestingly, activity in a different set of neural regions was related to increases in feelings of social rejection. These data show that greater amygdala activity in response to a stressor, as well as tighter coupling between the amygdala and the DMPFC, are associated with greater increases in inflammatory activity. Results from this study begin to identify neural mechanisms that might link stress with increased risk for inflammation-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease and depression.

Methods: Articles using TMS over M1 in patients with mTBI or sport-related concussion indexed in PubMed and published between 1998 and September 2014 were included in the present review. Main outcomes and results: From the 17 articles that matched search criteria, results from various TMS paradigms were summarized and divided in three main areas of interest: motor cortical excitability/facilitation, motor cortical inhibition and cortical plasticity. Although studies suggest a trend of abnormal intra-cortical inhibition following mTBI, no clear and specific pattern emerges from the surveyed data. Conclusions: At this time and with the possible exception of intra-cortical inhibitory measures, TMS cannot reliably detect changes in M1 excitability in individuals with mTBI or a concussion at both the acute and chronic stages of injury. This may be explained by the small number of studies and large variety of stimulation parameters. Additional longitudinal and multimodal studies are needed to better understand the nature of the excitability changes that may occur within M1 following mTBI.

Research design: The sample was comprised of 84 adult outpatients with mild and moderate/severe TBI who were assessed by means of a battery of EF tasks. A Hierarchical Cluster analysis was performed with tasks Z-scores. Clusters were compared by means of ANOVA and Chi-square analyses. Main outcomes and results: Three clusters were characterized by deficits in: (1) inhibition, flexibility and focused attention; (2) inhibition, flexibility, working memory and focused attention; and (3) no expressive executive deficits. Clusters did not differ in clinical or demographical variables. Conclusions: The first cluster replicated findings of previous studies on TBI EF profiles. IT is suggested that TBI rehabilitation studies of EF must select participants by their EF profile rather than for clinical or demographical variables.

This devastating chronic condition generates a huge social and economic burden and accounts for 11.2% of years of disability. The increase in lifespan has contributed to the increase in dementia prevalence; however, there is currently no curative treatment for most causes of dementias. This paper reviews evidence-based strategies to build, enhance, and preserve cognition over the lifespan by examining approaches that work best, proposing when in the life course they should be implemented, and in which population group(s). Recent work shows a tendency to decreased age-specific prevalence and incidence of cognitive problems and dementia among people born later in the first half of the 20th century, citing higher educational levels, improvements in lifestyle, and better handling of vascular risk factors. This implies that we can target modifiable environmental, lifestyle, and health risk factors to modify the trajectory of cognitive decline before the onset of irreversible dementia. Because building cognitive reserve and prevention of cognitive decline are of critical importance, interventions are needed at every stage of the life course to foster cognitive stimulation, and enable healthy eating habits and physical activity throughout the lifespan. Preventive interventions to decrease and delay cognitive decline and its consequences in old age will also require collaboration and action on the part of policy-makers at the political and social level.

An undue emphasis on single approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to have retarded the pace of translation in the field, and there is much frustration in the public about the lack of an effective treatment. We critically reviewed past literature (1990-2014), analyzed numerous data, and discussed key issues at a consensus conference on Brain Ageing and Dementia to identify and overcome roadblocks in studies intended for translation. We highlight various factors that influence the translation of preclinical research and highlight specific preclinical strategies that have failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. The field has been hindered by the domination of the amyloid hypothesis in AD pathogenesis while the causative pathways in disease pathology are widely considered to be multifactorial. Understanding the causative events and mechanisms in the pathogenesis are equally important for translation. Greater efforts are necessary to fill in the gaps and overcome a variety of confounds in the generation, study design, testing, and evaluation of animal models and the application to future novel anti-dementia drug trials. A greater variety of potential disease mechanisms must be entertained to enhance progress.

In order to determine the neural mechanism by which APOE polymorphisms affect white matter (WM) structure, we investigated the diffusion characteristics of WM tracts in carriers and non-carriers of the APOE epsilon 4 and epsilon 2 alleles using an unbiased whole brain analysis technique (Tract Based Spatial Statistics) in a healthy young adolescent (14 years) cohort. A large sample of healthy young adolescents (n = 575) were selected from the European neuroimaging-genetics IMAGEN study with available APOE status and accompanying diffusion imaging data. MR Diffusion data was acquired on 3T systems using 32 diffusion-weighted (DW) directions and 4 non-DW volumes (b-value = 1,300 s/mm(2) and isotropic resolution of 2.4x2.4x2.4 mm). No significant differences in WM structure were found in diffusion indices between carriers and non-carriers of the APOE epsilon 4 and epsilon 2 alleles, and dose-dependent effects of these variants were not established, suggesting that differences in WM structure are not modulated by the APOE polymorphism. In conclusion, our results suggest that microstructural properties of WM structure are not associated with the APOE epsilon 4 and epsilon 2 alleles in young adolescence, suggesting that the neural effects of these variants are not evident in 14-year-olds and may only develop later in life.

Insufficient somatosensory SG has been found in the aged adults, particularly in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). However, it remains unclear which variables leading to the age-related somatosensory SG decline. There has been evidence showing a relationship between brain oscillations and cortical evoked excitability. Thus, this study used whole-head magnetoencephalography to record responses to paired-pulse electrical stimulation to the left median nerve in healthy young and elderly participants to test whether insufficient stimulus 1- (S1-) induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) contributes to a less-suppressed stimulus 2- (S2-) evoked response. Our analysis revealed that the minimum norm estimates showed age-related reduction of SG in the bilateral SII regions. Spectral power analysis showed that the elderly demonstrated significantly reduced alpha ERD in the contralateral SII (SIIc). Moreover, it was striking to note that lower S1-induced alpha ERD was associated with higher S2-evoked amplitudes in the SIIc among the aged adults. Conclusively, our findings suggest that age-related decline of somatosensory SG is partially attributed to the altered S1-induced oscillatory activity.

METHODS: Community-dwelling individuals with TBI having completed a post-acute TBI rehabilitation program. The TBI sample consisted of 16 men (42.1%) and 22 women (57.9%), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 9.9) and 12.8 years of education (SD = 2.8). They were on average 2.6 years post-injury (SD = 1.4). Glasgow coma scale at admission was on average 12.6 (SD = 3.5). Participants completed a questionnaire adapted to individuals with TBI addressing experiences, attitudes, and needs regarding sexuality and service delivery. RESULTS: Individuals with TBI reported a low frequency of specific discussions with their treating clinician(s) about sexual and reproductive health issues, as well as many unmet needs regarding sexuality. None of the participants considered discussion about these issues to be inappropriate. They reported more favourable attitudes towards discussing sexual health topics compared to actual service delivery with family physicians, general practitioners, psychologists, and other health care professionals (p's < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with TBI desired more openness about discussing sexual concerns. Findings are discussed in terms of the clinical implications to meet the individuals' needs regarding sexual concerns after TBI.

In addition, they could serve as valuable tools when designing therapeutic studies of individuals at risk of AD. In this study, we combine (1) a novel method for grading medial temporal lobe structures with (2) robust cortical thickness measurements to predict AD among subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from a single T1-weighted MRI scan. Using AD and cognitively normal individuals, we generate a set of features potentially discriminating between MCI subjects who convert to AD and those who remain stable over a period of 3 years. Using mutual information-based feature selection, we identify 5 key features optimizing the classification of MCI converters. These features are the left and right hippocampi gradings and cortical thicknesses of the left precuneus, left superior temporal sulcus, and right anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus. We show that these features are highly stable in cross-validation and enable a prediction accuracy of 72% using a simple linear discriminant classifier, the highest prediction accuracy obtained on the baseline Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative first phase cohort to date. The proposed structural features are consistent with Braak stages and previously reported atrophic patterns in AD and are easy to transfer to new cohorts and to clinical practice.

There is substantial evidence indicating a disease onset years before clinical diagnosis, at which point no effective therapy has been found. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a new multi-target drug, M30, at relatively early stages of the AD-like amyloid pathology in a robust rat transgenic model. McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rats develop the full AD-like amyloid pathology in a progressive fashion, and have a minimal genetic burden. McGill rats were given 5 mg/kg M30 or vehicle per os, every 2 days for 4 months, starting at a stage where the transgenic animals suffer detectable cognitive impairments. At the completion of the treatment, cognitive functions were assessed with Novel Object Location and Novel Object Recognition tests. The brains were then analyzed to assess amyloid-beta (A beta) burden and the levels of key inflammatory markers. Long-term treatment with M30 was associated with both the prevention and the reversal of transgene-related cognitive decline. The effects on cognition were accompanied by a shift of the A beta-immunoreactive material toward an amyloid plaque aggregated molecular form, diminished molecular signs of CNS inflammation and a change in microglia morphology toward a surveying phenotype. This study is the first to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of M30 in a rat model of the AD amyloid pathology. It provides a rationale for further investigations with M30 and with potential multi-target approaches to delay, prevent or reverse the progression the AD pathology at early disease-stages.

For this reason, ANNs are employed extensively in drying applications because of their favorable characteristics, such as efficiency, generalization, and simplicity. This article presents a comprehensive review of numerous significant applications of the ANN technique to solve problems of nonlinear function approximation, pattern detection, data interpretation, optimization, simulation, diagnosis, control, data sorting, clustering, and noise reduction in drying technology. We summarize the use of the ANN approach in modeling various dehydration methods; e.g., batch convective thin-layer drying, fluidized bed drying, osmotic dehydration, osmotic-convective drying, infrared, microwave, infrared- and microwave-assisted drying processes, spray drying, freeze drying, rotary drying, renewable drying, deep bed drying, spout bed drying, industrial drying, and several miscellaneous applications. Generally, ANNs have been used in drying technology for modeling, predicting, and optimization of heat and mass transfer, thermodynamic performance parameters, and quality indicators as well as physiochemical properties of dried products. Moreover, a limited number of researchers have focused on control of drying systems to achieve desired product quality by online manipulating of the drying conditions using previously trained ANNs. Opportunities and limitations of the ANN technique for drying process simulation, optimization, and control are outlined to guide future R&D in this area.

Defensive Functioning Among Women With Breast Cancer and Matched Community Controls	PSYCHIATRY-INTERPERSONAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article							PERSONALITY-DISORDERS; HEALTH SURVEY; MECHANISMS; PSYCHOTHERAPY; REPRESSION; ANXIETY; TERM; INTERVIEW; SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN	Objective. The general theory of defense mechanisms posits that stress is associated with using defenses lower on the hierarchy of defensive adaptation. Some have observed that individuals with cancer use certain defenses, such as repression, denial, and immature defenses. This cross-sectional study examined four hypotheses about defensive functioning in a sample of women who are mothers with a recent history of breast cancer (BC), compared to a matched sample of healthy mothers in the community. Method. We rated defenses from interview transcripts about interpersonal vignettes, using the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales quantitative method. Measures of symptoms and functioning were also gathered. Results. The BC group displayed lower (z = 5.39, df = 1,231, p < .0001) overall defensive functioning than controls: 5.32 [95% CI: 5.13 to 5.51] versus 5.63 [95% CI: 5.50 to 5.76], which is equivalent to a medium effect size (0.62). Compared to controls, the BC group displayed more denial, idealization, displacement, isolation of affect, and splitting of others' images; conversely, they used less altruism, anticipation, intellectualization, and undoing. Controls used a mixture of high adaptive (35.5%), neurotic (43.0%), and immature defenses (21.4%). In contrast, the BC group used fewer high adaptive (30.7%) and neurotic (38.8%) and more immature defenses (30.5%). Both groups scored in relatively healthy ranges on other measures. Correlations with other measures supported the hierarchy of defense adaptiveness. Conclusions. The relationships among stress, defensive functioning, and adaptation were largely as predicted. Future studies should examine defenses in the process of seeking care, diagnosis, and treatment response for breast cancer.	[Perry, J.

Asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia were enrolled prospectively; and the presence and extent of brain injury were scored on each MRI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured in the basal ganglia, in the white matter and in the cortical grey matter. Sixty-one asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia had a total of 126 ADC and FA maps. Asphyxiated newborns developing brain injury eventually had significantly decreased ADC values on days 2-3 of life and decreased FA values around day 10 and 1 month of life compared with those not developing brain injury. Despite hypothermia treatment, asphyxiated newborns may develop brain injury that still can be detected with advanced neuroimaging techniques such as DWI and DTI as early as days 2-3 of life. A study of ADC and FA values over time may aid in the understanding of how brain injury develops in these newborns despite hypothermia treatment.

This study investigates if it is possible to distinguish these two groups of patients retrospectively at the time of the first episode, in a pediatric population. For each patient, the method consists in fitting an individual brain growth curve using multiple follow-up time-points, and using this curve to predict 4 metrics at the first attack: brain volume, brain growth rate, thalamus volume normalized by the brain volume (called normalized thalamus) and normalized thalamus growth rate. These metrics were compared to age-and-sex matched healthy controls by computing z-scores. In this study, 85 patients were scanned up to 8 years after the first attack. During this follow-up period, 23 patients were subsequently diagnosed with MS (MS group). Among the 62 patients with a transient illness, 9 suffered from monophasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM group). The 53 remaining formed the non-ADEM monophasic (MONO) group. The normalized thalamus growth rate was the only metric that distinguished patient groups: the z-scores were significantly smaller for MS than for the MONO group (p<0.01). Whereas 93% of monophasic subjects were correctly classified with a linear discriminant analysis, only 13% of the MS subjects were correctly classified, due to a large inter-individual variability in this group.

Nonapeptide influences on social behaviour: effects of vasotocin and isotocin on shoaling and interaction in zebrafish	BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						grouping; isotocin; vasotocin; nonapeptides; fish; shoaling; zebrafish; Danio rerio	MONOGAMOUS CICHLID FISH; ARGININE VASOTOCIN; DANIO-RERIO; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; OXYTOCIN; VASOPRESSIN; AGGRESSION; NEUROPEPTIDES; RESPONSES; DOMINANT	Nonapeptides are important regulators of social behaviour across vertebrate taxa. While their role in simple grouping behaviour has been explored in estrildid finches, other taxa are understudied, prompting us to investigate nonapeptide influences on shoaling behaviour in zebrafish. Subjects received injections of isotocin, an isotocin antagonist, vasotocin, a vasotocin antagonist, or saline, followed by a test of grouping behaviour. Vasotocin decreased social interaction with the shoal. Unexpectedly, the vasotocin antagonist also reduced social interaction with the shoal, as well as general shoaling behaviour. Isotocin and its antagonist had minimal effects on grouping behaviours. These results suggest social interaction and shoaling are discrete aspects of sociality differentially influenced by vasotocin, although we cannot discount possible anxiogenic effects of vasotocin. Contrasting these results with studies in other systems demonstrates that each nonapeptide's role in social behaviour varies across taxa, and cautions against a simplistic characterisation of nonapeptides as prosocial regulators of behaviour.

Since the 1970s, numerous accounts have promoted electroencephalography-neurofeedback as a viable treatment for a host of mental disorders. Today, while the number of health care providers referring patients to neurofeedback practitioners increases steadily, substantial methodological and conceptual caveats continue to pervade empirical reports. And yet, nascent imaging technologies (e.g., real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging) and increasingly rigorous protocols are paving the road towards more effective applications and a better scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we outline common neurofeedback methods, illuminate the tenuous state of the evidence, and sketch out future directions to further unravel the potential merits of this contentious therapeutic prospect.

Short-term monocular patching boosts the patched eye's response in visual cortex	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Monocular patching; eye dominance plasticity; intrinsic plasticity; contrast-gain; steady-state visual evoked potentials; visual cortex	OCULAR DOMINANCE PLASTICITY; STEADY-STATE VEPS; RECEPTIVE FIELDS; STRIATE CORTEX; ADULT; MECHANISMS; MASKING; VISION	Purpose: Several recent studies have demonstrated that following short-term monocular deprivation in normal adults, the patched eye, rather than the unpatched eye, becomes stronger in subsequent binocular viewing. However, little is known about the site and nature of the underlying processes. In this study, we examine the underlying mechanisms by measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as an index of the neural contrast response in early visual areas. Methods: The experiment consisted of three consecutive stages: a pre-patching EEG recording (14 minutes), a monocular patching stage (2.5 hours) and a post-patching EEG recording (14 minutes; started immediately after the removal of the patch). During the patching stage, a diffuser (transmits light but not pattern) was placed in front of one randomly selected eye. During the EEG recording stage, contrast response functions for each eye were measured. Results: The neural responses from the patched eye increased after the removal of the patch, whilst the responses from the unpatched eye remained the same. Such phenomena occurred under both monocular and dichoptic viewing conditions. Conclusions: We interpret this eye dominance plasticity in adult human visual cortex as homeostatic intrinsic plasticity regulated by an increase of contrast-gain in the patched eye.

Emerging evidence of the association between cognitive deficits and arm motor recovery after stroke: A meta-analysis	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Motor learning; upper limb; cognition; rehabilitation	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; UPPER-LIMB; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; MOVEMENT THERAPY; BRAIN-DAMAGE; POST STROKE; REHABILITATION; POSTSTROKE; FEEDBACK; QUALITY	Purpose: Motor and cognitive impairments are common and often coexist in patients with stroke. Although evidence is emerging about specific relationships between cognitive deficits and upper-limb motor recovery, the practical implication of these relationships for rehabilitation is unclear. Using a structured review and meta-analyses, we examined the nature and strength of the associations between cognitive deficits and upper-limb motor recovery in studies of patients with stroke. Methods: Motor recovery was defined using measures of upper limb motor impairment and/or activity limitations. Studies were included if they reported on at least one measure of cognitive function and one measure of upper limb motor impairment or function. Results: Six studies met the selection criteria. There was a moderate association (r = 0.43; confidence interval; CI: 0.09-0.68, p = 0.014) between cognition and overall arm motor recovery. Separate meta-analyses showed a moderately strong association between executive function and motor recovery (r = 0.48; CI: 0.26-0.65; p < 0.001), a weak positive correlation between attention and motor recovery (r = 0.25; CI: 0.04-0.45; p = 0.023), and no correlation between memory and motor recovery (r = 0.42; CI: 0.16-0.79; p = 0.14). Conclusion: These results imply that information on the presence of cognitive deficits should be considered while planning interventions for clients in order to design more personalized interventions tailored to the individual for maximizing upper-limb recovery.

We have identified CLCF-1 as a potential injurious factor in the human renal disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). We investigated its effects on renal cells and renal function in in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods include measurement of the effect of CLCF-1 on phosphorylation of target molecules of the JAK/STAT pathway, on cytoskeleton and cell morphology in cultured podocytes, on albumin permeability of isolated rat glomeruli, and on tissue phosphorylation and urine albumin after acute or chronic CLCF-1 injection. In addition, cell sorting was performed to determine the presence of cells expressing CLCF-1 in spleen and bone marrow of normal mice and the effect of CLCF-1 infusion on splenic B-cell populations. CLCF-1 increased phosphorylation of STAT3 in multiple cell types, activated podocytes leading to formation of lamellipodia and decrease in basal stress fibers, increased glomerular albumin permeability, and increased STAT3 phosphorylation of peripheral blood cells and renal cortex. CLCF-1 increased urine albumin/creatinine ratio in mice and increased B-cell expression of IgG in mouse spleen. We conclude that CLCF-1 has potentially important systemic effects, alters podocyte function, and may contribute to renal dysfunction and albuminuria.

However, it is underdiagnosed in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This study examined the effectiveness of the self-administered Nine-ItemScreener (Nine-ItemScreener-SA), the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), the 3-Item Migraine Screener, and the Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) at discriminating between mTBI patients with (n = 23) andwithout (n = 20) migraines. The Nine-Item Screener demonstrated significant differences between migraine patients with and without migraine on nearly every question, especially on Question 9 (disability), sensitivity: 0.95 and specificity: 0.65 (95% CI, 0.64-0.90). The HIT-6 demonstrated significant differences between migraine and no-migraine patients on disability and pain severity, with disability having a sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.54-0.83). Only Question 3 of the 3-Item ID Migraine Screener (photosensitivity) showed significant differences between migraine and no-migraine patients, sensitivity: 0.84 and specificity: 0.55 (CI, 0.52-0.82). The RPQ did not reveal greater symptoms in migraine patients compared with those without. Among headache measures, the Nine-Item Screener-SA best differentiated between mTBI patients with and without migraine. Disability may best identify migraine sufferers among the TBI population.

We propose a novel assessment method that represents local complexity as the difference between the observed distributions of local surface topology to its best-fit basic topology model within a given local neighborhood. This distribution difference is estimated via Earth Move Distance (EMD) over the histogram within the local neighborhood of the surface topology quantified via the Shape Index (SI) measure. The EMD scores have a range from simple complexity (0.0), which indicates a consistent local surface topology, up to high complexity (1.0), which indicates a highly variable local surface topology. The basic topology models are categorized as 9 geometric situation modeling situations such as crowns, ridges and fundi of cortical gyro and sulci. We apply a geodesic kernel to calculate the local SI histogram distribution within a given region. In our experiments, we obtained the results of local complexity that shows generally higher complexity in the gyral/ sulcal wall regions and lower complexity in some gyral ridges and lowest complexity in sulcal fundus areas. In addition, we show expected, preliminary results of increased surface complexity across most of the cortical surface within the first years of postnatal life, hypothesized to be due to the changes such as development of sulcal pits.

The causes of MS are not known; however, the incidence of MS is increasing, thereby suggesting that changes in lifestyle and/or environmental factors may be responsible. On this background, the Environmental Risk Factors in MS Study or EnvIMS study was designed to further explore the etiology of MS. The design and methodology are described, providing details to enable investigators to (i) use our experiences to design their own studies; (ii) take advantage of, and build on the methodological work completed for, the EnvIMS study; (iii) become aware of this data source that is available for use by the research community. Methods: EnvIMS is a multinational case-control study, enrolling 2,800 cases with MS and 5,012 population-based controls in Canada, Italy, Norway, Serbia and Sweden. The study was designed to investigate the most commonly implicated risk factors for MS etiology using a self-report questionnaire. Results/Conclusions:The use of a common methodology to study MS etiology across several countries enhances the comparability of results in different geographic regions and research settings, reduces the resources required for study design and enhances the opportunity for data harmonization.

J	Najem, S; Grant, M				Najem, Sara; Grant, Martin			Coupling actin dynamics to phase-field in modeling neural growth	SOFT MATTER			English	Article								In this paper we model the growth of a neural cell together with the actin dynamics taking place at its growing region by constructing a phase-field model. This is done by assigning auxiliary fields to different constituents of the cell in order to differentiate them. Specifically, the inner and outer regions of the neural cell are described by phi = 1 and phi = 0 respectively, whereas the inside and outside of its leading edge are portrayed by psi = 1 and psi = 0. This formulation inherently locates the boundary, which is required to determine the evolution of the underlying actin dynamics. Therefore, it provides an alternative to boundary tracking algorithms. Then the equations governing the molecular workings of the cell specifically those of actin are modified in order to satisfy their corresponding boundary conditions.

Design: This is a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials. Data Sources: Trials were identified with the help of PubMed, the Cochrane Dementia Group database, the Center for Collaborative Neurosciences, and references from reviews; no language restrictions were applied. Study Selection: All randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies on 30 ml/day of Cerebrolysin in mild-to-moderate AD were included. Results: There were 6 eligible randomized controlled trials comparing Cerebrolysin with placebo. For all studies, either individual patient data and/or published data (aggregate data) were available. Analyses were based on the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomized global clinical change and for safety criteria, on the standardized mean difference (SMD) for pooling of cognitive function, and on the Mann-Whitney statistic (MW) for multivariate analysis of 'global benefit' (combined effect of global clinical change and cognitive function). Cerebrolysin was significantly more effective than placebo at 4 weeks regarding cognitive function (4 weeks: SMD -0.40 points; 95% CI -0.66 to -0.13; p = 0.0031; 6 months: SMD -0.37 points; 95% CI -0.90 to 0.16; p = 0.1710), at 4 weeks and 6 months regarding global clinical change (4 weeks: OR 3.32; 95% CI 1.20-9.21; p = 0.0212; 6 months: OR 4.98; 95% CI 1.37-18.13; p = 0.0150), and at 4 weeks and 6 months regarding 'global benefit' (combined efficacy criteria; 4 weeks: MW 0.57, 95% CI 0.53-0.61; p = 0.0006; 6 months: MW 0.57; 95% CI 0.53-0.61; p = 0.0010). The safety aspects of Cerebrolysin were comparable to placebo. Conclusion: This meta-analysis provides evidence that Cerebrolysin has an overall beneficial effect and a favorable benefit-risk ratio in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Cerebrolysin as a therapeutic agent should be considered by clinicians seeking treatment options for mild-to-moderate AD. (C) 2015 S.

Three axis linear stages combined with a sectioning vibratome allows to cut thru the entire biological tissue and to image every section at a microscopic resolution. After acquisition, each OCT volume and confocal image are re-stitched with adjacent acquisitions to obtain a reconstructed, digital volume of the imaged tissue. This imaging platform was used to investigate correlations between white matter and microvasculature changes in aging mice. Three age groups were used in this study (4, 12, 24 months). At sacrifice, mice were transcardially perfused with a FITC containing gel. The dual imaging capability of the system allowed to reveal different contrast information: OCT imaging reveals changes in refractive indices giving contrast between white and grey matter in the mouse brain, while transcardial perfusion of a FITC shows microsvasculature in the brain with confocal imaging.

In order to better understand the fundamental mechanisms that regulate diseases of the CNS, a fast fluorescence hyperspectral imaging platform was designed to track simultaneously various neurotransmitter receptors trafficking in and out of synapses. With this hyperspectral imaging platform, it was possible to image simultaneously five different synaptic proteins, including subtypes of glutamate receptors (mGluR, NMDAR, AMPAR), postsynaptic density proteins, and signaling proteins. This new imaging platform allows fast simultaneous acquisitions of at least five fluorescent markers in living neurons with a high spatial resolution. This technique provides an effective method to observe several synaptic proteins at the same time, thus study how drugs for CNS impact the spatial dynamics of these proteins.

Methods: Data were retrospectively collected on patients (n = 1812) who were admitted post-TBI to the McGill University Health Centre-Montreal General Hospital from 2000-2011. The cohort was composed of four groups over 65 years old (65-75; 76-85; 86-95; and 96 and more). Outcome measures used were the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) as well as discharge destination. Results: As the patients got older, the odds of having a poor outcome increased (OR = 2.344 for those 75-85 years old, 4.313 for those 86-95 years of age and 3.465 for those aged 96 years of age or older). Also, the proportion of patients going home or going home with out-patient rehabilitation decreased as age increased (p = 0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). In contrast, the proportion of patients being discharged to long-term care facilities increased significantly as age increased (p<0.001). Conclusion: This descriptive study provides a better understanding of characteristics and outcome of different age groups of patients with TBI all over 65 years old in Montreal, Canada.

There are many ways that the dysregulation of the HPA axis can be assessed: by sampling diurnal basal secretion and/or in response to a stress task, pharmacological challenge, and awakening. Here, we focus on the association between cortisol awakening response (CAR), as one index of HPA axis function, and MDD, given that the nature of this association is particularly unclear. Indeed, in the following selective review, we attempt to reconcile sometimes-divergent evidence of the role of CAR in the pathway to depression. We first examine association of CAR with psychological factors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to develop depression. Then, we summarize the findings regarding the CAR profile in those with current depression, and evaluate evidence for the role of CAR following depression resolution and continued vulnerability. Finally, we showcase longitudinal studies showing the role of CAR in predicting depression onset and recurrence. Overall, the studies reveal an important, but complex, association between CAR and vulnerability to depression.

J	Fakhoury, M				Fakhoury, Marc			Role of Immunity and Inflammation in the Pathophysiology of Neurodegenerative Diseases	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES			English	Review						Blood-brain barrier; Central nervous system; Immune system; Inflammation; Neurodegenerative diseases	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; T-LYMPHOCYTES; TNF-ALPHA; MODEL; DYSFUNCTION	Neurodegenerative diseases are the result of progressive loss of neurons and axons in the central nervous system (CNS), which can lead to cognition and motor dysfunction. It is well known that CNS inflammation and immune activation play a major role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Although the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is able to protect the CNS from immune activation, it becomes more permeable during inflammation, which renders the brain vulnerable to infections. A better understanding of the interaction between inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, and the activated immune response, including astrocytes and microglia, is critical for the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. This review first describes the role of innate immune activation in neurodegenerative diseases and illustrates the factors that contribute to the communication between the CNS and the immune system. A closer look is given at the role of the BBB in inflammation and immunity, as well as at the animal models used to study inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, this review outlines the key pathways and biological mechanisms involved in CNS diseases, with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging Enabled by Spatial Frequency Domain Optical-Property Mapping in the Sub-diffusive Regime for Surgical Guidance	MOLECULAR-GUIDED SURGERY: MOLECULES, DEVICES, AND APPLICATIONS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Molecular-Guided Surgery - Molecules, Devices, and Applications	FEB 07-08, 2015	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, Intuit Surg Inc, LI COR Inc, Novadaq Technologies Inc		quantitative fluorescence; protoporphyrin IX; image guidance; neurosurgery; spatial frequency domain imaging; sub-diffusive regime; hyperspectral imaging	ACID	Intraoperative fluorescence guidance enables maximum safe resection of, for example, glioblastomas by providing surgeons with real-time tumor optical contrast. Specifically, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence guided resection can improve surgical outcomes by better defining tumor margins and identifying satellite tumor foci. However, visual assessment of PpIX fluorescence is subjective and limited by the distorting effects of light attenuation (absorption and scattering) by tissue and background tissue autofluorescence. We have previously shown, using a point fluorescence-reflectance fiberoptic probe, that non-invasive measurement of the absolute PpIX concentration, [PpIX], further improves sensitivity and specificity, leading to the demonstration that the technique can also detect low-grade gliomas as well as otherwise undetectable residual tumor foci in high-grade disease. Here, we extend this approach to wide-field quantitative fluorescence imaging (qFI) by implementing spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to recover the tissue optical absorption and transport scattering coefficients across the field of view. We report on the performance of this approach to determine the intrinsic fluorescence intensity in tissue-simulating phantoms in both the fully diffusive (i.e. scatter-dominated) and sub-diffusive (low transport albedo) regimes, for which higher spatial frequencies are used. The performance of qFI is compared to a Born-normalization correction scheme, as well as to the values obtained using the fiberoptic probe on homogeneous tissue phantoms containing PpIX.

Gliomas are a class of brain cancer which invade into the normal brain. If left unresected, these invasive cancer cells are the source of glioma recurrence. Moreover, these invasion areas do not show up on standard-of-care pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This inability to fully visualize invasive brain cancers results in subtotal surgical resections, negatively impacting patient survival. To address this issue, we have demonstrated the efficacy of single-point in vivo Raman spectroscopy using a contact hand-held fiber optic probe for rapid detection of cancer invasion in 8 patients with low and high grade gliomas. Using a supervised machine learning algorithm to analyze the Raman spectra obtained in vivo, we were able to distinguish normal brain from the presence of cancer cells with sensitivity and specificity greater than 90%. Moreover, by correlating these results with pre-operative MRI we demonstrate the ability to detect low density cancer invasion up to 1.5cm beyond the cancer extent visible using MRI. This represents the potential for significant improvements in progression-free and overall patient survival, by identifying previously undetectable residual cancer cell populations and preventing the resection of normal brain tissue. While the importance of maximizing the volume of tumor resection is important for all grades of gliomas, the impact for low grade gliomas can be dramatic because surgery can even be curative. This convenient technology can rapidly classify cancer invasion in real-time, making it ideal for intraoperative use in brain tumor resection.

Interestingly, when the brain is exposed to adverse conditions, both astrocytes and microglia acquire specialized 'reactive' or 'activated' phenotypes that relate to the characteristics of the insult. In most cases they become important perpetrators of inflammation and potentially neuronal dysfunction. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, the reciprocal interactions between microglia and astrocytes may be particularly important for the development of neuronal pathology and disease states. An important challenge is to understand how microglia and astrocytes inter-communicate at different stages of disease and the importance of this crosstalk on the physiology of surrounding neurons. In this review we focus on the potential roles that microglia and astrocytes fulfill in early to late stages of AD and how their synergistic actions may shape the progression of AD pathology to affect brain health.

Methods: The WheelCon-M was translated from English to French using the Translation and Cultural Adaptation of Patient Reported Outcomes Measures - Principles of Good Practice guidelines. We used a test-retest design to examine the validity of the WheelCon-M-F with 24 community dwelling, experienced manual wheelchair users who had a variety of musculoskeletal and neurological diagnoses. Results: The mean +/-SD WheelCon-M-F score was 63.8 +/- 19.9. All WheelCon-M-F items were either identical or similar in meaning to the WheelCon-M items. Clarification issues were identified with 27/63 items. Cronbach's alpha was 0.98 and the retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.87. The standard error of measurement and smallest real difference were 7.2 and 19.9, respectively. There were no floor or ceiling effects. WheelCon-M-F correlations with social support and participation were r = 0.54 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: The WheelCon-M-F is a valid outcome measure for assessing manual wheelchair confidence in the French-Canadian population.

Numerous studies have suggested that the modulation of APOE epsilon 4 affects cognition and brain structure and function in healthy populations, particularly in the hippocampus, a key area associated with AD pathology. However, the effect of APOE epsilon 4 allele on cognitive performance, hippocampal structural morphology, and specifically on functional characteristics in patients with AD remains poorly understood. Here, we employed a neuropsychological battery test and multi-modal structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI dataset to systematically investigate cognitive performance, hippocampal structural volume, and functional properties (including local low-frequency oscillating amplitude, intra-regional functional synchrony, and inter-regional functional connectivity) in 16 APOE epsilon 4-carriers and 26 non-carriers at early stages of AD. Compared to non-carriers, APOE epsilon 4-carriers exhibited poorer performance on recognition performance, but performed better on the late item generation of the verbal fluency task (associated with executive function). Structural imaging analysis revealed that APOE epsilon 4-carriers exhibited smaller left hippocampal volumes compared to non-carriers, and the result remains significant after correcting for effects of brain size. Functional imaging analysis revealed that APOE epsilon 4-carriers exhibited decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left hippocampus, non-significant changes in intra-regional synchronization within the hippocampus and decreased hippocampal functional connectivity predominantly in components of the default-mode network including the medial frontal and parietal cortices and the lateral temporal cortical regions. Taken together, our results showed APOE genotypic effects on the cognitive profile and hippocampal structural and functional characteristics in patients at early stages of AD, thus providing empirical evidence for the modulation of the APOE genotype on disease phenotype.

The goal of the current study was to describe the course of each measured BPSD over a period of 6 months. A secondary explorative objective was to identify which BPSD are associated with as-needed (PRN) antipsychotic drug use. This secondary analysis study of 146 nursing home residents was drawn from a prospective, observational, multisite (N = 7) cohort study. Results showed that BPSD lasted for an average of 2.3 months, and the BPSD saying things that do not make sense had the longest duration, with 3.6 months. PRN antipsychotic drug administration was associated with nocturnal BPSD and requesting help unnecessarily. Within 3 months, most BPSD were resolved by usual care; use of PRN antipsychotic medication was not associated with behaviors that put the residents or their caregivers at risk.

The delicate balance between microbial growth and containment is controlled by the immune system. However, this balance is disrupted in cases of chronic viral infections such as HIV. This virus is capable of drastically altering the immune system and gastrointestinal environment leading to significant changes to the gut microbiota and mucosal permeability resulting in microbial translocation from the gut into the peripheral blood. The changes made locally in the gut have far-reaching consequences on the other organs of the body starting in the liver, where microbes and their products are normally filtered out, and extending to the blood and even brain. Microbial translocation and their downstream effects such as increased indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme expression and activity create a self-sustaining feedback loop which enhances HIV disease progression and constitute a vicious cycle of inflammation and immune activation combining viral and bacterial factors.

Accordingly, a multidisciplinary Canadian and international group of clinical, research and knowledge-transfer experts attended a workshop in Montreal, Quebec. The workshop had two aims: to identify new pathways for innovative diagnosis and management of chronic orofacial pain states; and to identify opportunities for further collaborative orofacial pain research and education in Canada. Three topics related to chronic orofacial pain were explored: biomarkers and pain signatures for chronic orofacial pain; misuse of analgesic and opioid pain medications for managing chronic orofacial pain; and complementary alternative medicine, topical agents and the role of stress in chronic orofacial pain. It was determined that further research is needed to: identify biomarkers of chronic orofacial post-traumatic neuropathic pain, with a focus on psychosocial, physiological and chemical-genetic factors; validate the short-and long-term safety (ie, no harm to health, and avoidance of misuse and addiction) of opioid use for two distinct conditions (acute and chronic orofacial pain, respectively); and promote the use of topical medications as an alternative treatment in dentistry, and further document the benefits and safety of complementary and alternative medicine, including stress management, in dentistry. It was proposed that burning mouth syndrome, a painful condition that is not uncommon and affects mainly postmenopausal women, should receive particular attention.

Host cell invasion is a two-step process consisting of adherence followed by invasion. There are two general mechanisms of host cell invasion, induced endocytosis and active penetration. Furthermore, fungi can traverse epithelial or endothelial cell barriers either by proteolytic degradation of intercellular tight junctions or via a Trojan horse mechanism in which they are transported by leukocytes. Although these mechanisms of host cell invasion have been best studied using Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, it is probable that other invasive fungi also use one or more of these mechanisms to invade host cells. Identification of these invasion mechanisms holds promise to facilitate the development of new approaches to inhibit fungal invasion and thereby prevent disease.

There is no consensus definition of agitation and no widespread agreement on what elements should be included in the syndrome. The International Psychogeriatric Association formed an Agitation Definition Work Group (ADWG) to develop a provisional consensus definition of agitation in patients with cognitive disorders that can be applied in epidemiologic, non-interventional clinical, pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic interventional, and neurobiological studies. A consensus definition will facilitate communication and cross-study comparison and may have regulatory applications in drug development programs. Methods: The ADWG developed a transparent process using a combination of electronic, face-to-face, and survey-based strategies to develop a consensus based on agreement of a majority of participants. Nine-hundred twenty-eight respondents participated in the different phases of the process. Results: Agitation was defined broadly as: (1) occurring in patients with a cognitive impairment or dementia syndrome; (2) exhibiting behavior consistent with emotional distress; (3) manifesting excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, or physical aggression; and (4) evidencing behaviors that cause excess disability and are not solely attributable to another disorder (psychiatric, medical, or substance-related). A majority of the respondents rated all surveyed elements of the definition as "strongly agree" or "somewhat agree" (68-88% across elements). A majority of the respondents agreed that the definition is appropriate for clinical and research applications. Conclusions: A provisional consensus definition of agitation has been developed. This definition can be used to advance interventional and non-interventional research of agitation in patients with cognitive impairment.

It is offered to elderly individuals without known or diagnosed cognitive impairment by volunteers or community practitioners over ten weekly sessions. This paper describes the protocol of a quasi-experimental study designed to evaluate Jog Your Mind. Methods: Community responsible to recruit participants were either assigned to the experimental group (participating in the Jog Your Mind program) or to the control group (one-year waiting list). All participants were interviewed at baseline (T1), after the program (T2), and 12 months after the baseline (T3). Primary outcomes were the use of everydaymemory strategies and aids and subjective memory functioning in daily life. Secondary outcomes included attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors related to cognitive vitality and cognitive abilities (memory and executive functions). Program delivery, organizational and environmental variables were recorded to document the implementation process. Results: Twenty-three community organizations recruited 294 community-dwelling elderly individuals in total at T1. Between T1 and T3, an attrition rate of 15.2% was obtained. Conclusions: Jog Your Mind is one of the only programs targeting cognition among older adults being offered in community settings by community practitioners. The protocol described was designed with a focus on maximizing broad generalizations of the results while achieving scientific rigor. It can serve as an example to guide future research aiming to evaluate health interventions under natural conditions.

This paper reviews some seminal and recent studies using these approaches to improve cognition and physical functioning in healthy older adults and in patients suffering from non-neurological chronic medical conditions. Results from cognitive training studies suggest that despite performance improvement in trained tasks, transfer effects appeared very limited. Surprisingly though, computerized dual-task training has been shown to improve balance and postural control in tests of physical functioning, suggesting that broad transfer can sometimes be observed. Physical exercise intervention studies generally found significant and large improvements in physical capacity, in some cognitive domains, and in quality of life. The benefits seem to be equivalent between frail and nonfrail participants. Overall, results reviewed here support the notion that cognitive plasticity for attentional control, as induced by cognitive training or physical activity and exercise, is preserved in late adulthood. Moreover, results of studies with patients at risk of cognitive decline also suggest that cognitive training and exercise interventions are promising nonpharmaceutical tools to help improve cognition in older at-risk individuals.

Neuronal oscillations as a mechanistic substrate of auditory temporal prediction	NEUROSCIENCES AND MUSIC V: COGNITIVE STIMULATION AND REHABILITATION	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Neurosciences and Music V	MAY 29-JUN 01, 2014	Dijon, FRANCE			perception; sensorimotor; expectation; neurophysiology; active sensing	CORTICAL RESPONSES; SPATIAL EXPECTATIONS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; TIME-ESTIMATION; NEURAL SYSTEMS; SPEECH; CORTEX; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	Neuronal oscillations are comprised of rhythmic fluctuations of excitability that are synchronized in ensembles of neurons and thus function as temporal filters that dynamically organize sensory processing. When perception relies on anticipatory mechanisms, ongoing oscillations also provide a neurophysiological substrate for temporal prediction. In this article, we review evidence for this account with a focus on auditory perception. We argue that such "oscillatory temporal predictions" can selectively amplify neuronal sensitivity to inputs that occur in a predicted, task-relevant rhythm and optimize temporal selection. We elaborate this argument for a prototypic example, speech processing, where information is present atmultiple time scales, with delta, theta, and low-gamma oscillations being specifically and simultaneously engaged, enabling multiplexing. We then consider the origin of temporal predictions, specifically the idea that the motor system is involved in the generation of such prior information. Finally, we place temporal predictions in the general context of internal models, discussing how they interact with feature-based or spatial predictions.

At a macroscopic observer-environment level, these three types of interactions produce locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC), whose dynamics are evaluated in this paper. A formal analysis of LRC is presented, exploiting tools from synchronization theories and nonlinear dynamics. The results of two recent studies, in which participants were instructed to cycle or exhale at a natural frequency or in synchrony with an external rhythmic sound, are discussed. The metronome was either absent or present (study 1) and close to or far from the natural frequency of the cycling and breathing systems (study 2). The results evidenced a stabilization of cycling, breathing, and LRC when sound was present compared to when it was absent. A decrease in oxygen consumption was also observed, accompanying the increase in sound-induced LRC stabilization. These results obtained with a simple rhythmic metronome beat have consequences for exercising while listening to music; the consequences are further explored here.

Dance provides a unique opportunity to investigate brain plasticity and its interaction with behavior. Several studies have investigated the behavioral correlates of dance, but less is known about the brain basis of dance. Studies on dance observation suggest that long- and short-term dance training affect brain activity in the action observation and simulation networks. Despite methodological challenges, the feasibility of conducting neuroimaging while dancing has been demonstrated, and several brain regions have been implicated in dance execution. Preliminary work from our laboratory suggests that long-term dance training changes both gray and white matter structure. This article provides a critical summary of work investigating the neural correlates of dance. It covers functional neuroimaging studies of dance observation and performance as well as structural neuroimaging studies of expert dancers. To stimulate ongoing dialogue between dance and science, future directions in dance and brain research as well as implications are discussed. Research on the neuroscience of dance will lead to a better understanding of brain-behavior relationships and brain plasticity in experts and nonexperts and can be applied to the development of dance-based therapy programs.

Neuroimaging studies show that the reward system of the human brain is central to this experience. Specifically, the dorsal and ventral striatum release dopamine when listening to pleasurable music, and activity in these structures also codes the reward value of musical excerpts. Moreover, the striatum interacts with cortical mechanisms involved in perception and valuation of musical stimuli. Recent studies have begun to explore individual differences in the way that this complex system functions. Development of a questionnaire for music reward experiences has allowed the identification of separable factors associated with musical pleasure, described as music-seeking, emotion-evocation, mood regulation, sensorimotor, and social factors. Applying this questionnaire to a large sample uncovered approximately 5% of the population with low sensitivity to musical reward in the absence of generalized anhedonia or depression. Further study of this group revealed that there are individuals who respond normally both behaviorally and psychophysiologically to rewards other than music (e.g., monetary value) but do not experience pleasure from music despite normal music perception ability and preserved ability to identify intended emotions in musical passages. This specific music anhedonia bears further study, as it may shed light on the function and dysfunction of the reward system.

The blood vessels that vascularize the central nervous system (CNS) possess unique properties, termed the blood-brain barrier, which allow these vessels to tightly regulate the movement of ions, molecules, and cells between the blood and the brain. This precise control of CNS homeostasis allows for proper neuronal function and also protects the neural tissue from toxins and pathogens, and alterations of these barrier properties are an important component of pathology and progression of different neurological diseases. The physiological barrier is coordinated by a series of physical, transport, and metabolic properties possessed by the endothelial cells (ECs) that form the walls of the blood vessels, and these properties are regulated by interactions with different vascular, immune, and neural cells. Understanding how these different cell populations interact to regulate the barrier properties is essential for understanding how the brain functions during health and disease.

At the cellular level, neuronal death is accompanied by the proteolytic cleavage, misfolding and aggregation of huntingtin. Abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is a characteristic feature of a class of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. As a number of studies have reported tau pathology in HD patients, we investigated whether HD pathology may promote tau hyperphosphorylation and if so tackle some of its underlying mechanisms. For that purpose, we used the R6/2 mouse, a well-characterized model of HD, and analyzed tau phosphorylation before and after the onset of HD-like symptoms. We found a significant increase in tau hyperphosphorylation at the PHF-1 epitope in pre-symptomatic R6/2 mice, whereas symptomatic mice displayed tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple tau phosphoepitopes (AT8, CP13, PT205 and PHF-1). There was no activation of major tau kinases that could explain this observation. However, when we examined tau phosphatases, we found that calcineurin/PP2B was downregulated by 30% in pre-symptomatic and 50% insymptomatic R6/2 mice, respectively. We observed similar changes in tau phosphorylation and calcineurin expression in Q175 mice, another HD model. Calcineurin was also reduced in Q111 compared with Q7 cells. Finally, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of endogenous calcineurin was sufficient to promote tau hyperphosphorylation in neuronal cells. Taken together, our data suggest that mutant huntingtin can induce abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation in vivo, via the deregulation of calcineurin.

However, the degenerative process in PD is not limited to the dopaminergic system and also affects serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons. Because they can increase monoamine levels throughout the brain, monoamine reuptake inhibitors (MAUIs) represent potential therapeutic agents in PD. However, they are seldom used in clinical practice other than as antidepressants and wake-promoting agents. This review article summarises all of the available literature on use of 50 MAUIs in PD. The compounds are divided according to their relative potency for each of the monoamine transporters. Despite wide discrepancy in the methodology of the studies reviewed, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) selective serotonin transporter (SERT), selective noradrenaline transporter (NET), and dual SERT/NET inhibitors are effective against PD depression; (2) selective dopamine transporter (DAT) and dual DAT/NET inhibitors exert an anti-Parkinsonian effect when administered as monotherapy but do not enhance the anti-Parkinsonian actions of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA); (3) dual DAT/SERT inhibitors might enhance the anti-Parkinsonian actions of L-DOPA without worsening dyskinesia; (4) triple DAT/NET/SERT inhibitors might exert an anti-Parkinsonian action as monotherapy and might enhance the anti-Parkinsonian effects of L-DOPA, though at the expense of worsening dyskinesia.

PCP defects were associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) that are the most common central nervous system anomalies. PCP signaling is highly dosage sensitive and exhibits an antagonistic relationship with the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Diversin, encoded by Ankrd6, is an ankyrin repeat protein that activates the non canonical PCP signaling and simultaneously inhibits the canonical pathway. Methods: In this study, we analyzed this dual role of ANKRD6 in NTDs. We sequenced its coding region in 473 NTD patients and 150 controls, and we validated the effect of the identified variants on Wnt signaling using reporter assays in mammalian cells. RESULTS: We identified four rare missense mutations in 0.8% of the NTD patients and two rare missense mutations in 1.3% of the controls. Notably, when all six mutations were validated, only two mutations identified in NTD patients, p.Pro548Leu, p.Arg632His, significantly altered DIVERSIN activity in Wnt signaling assays in a hypomorphic manner. Conclusion: Rare missense mutations in ANKRD6 could affect a balanced reciprocal antagonism between both Wnt pathways in neurulation and act as predisposing factors to NTDs in a subset of patients.

Both genetic and nongenetic factors are involved in the etiology of NTD. Planar cell polarity (PCP) genes plays a critical role in neural tube closure in model organisms. Studies in humans have identified nonsynonymous mutations in PCP pathway genes, including the VANGL genes, that may play a role as risk factors for NTD. Methods: Here, we present the results of VANGL1 and VANGL2 mutational screening in a series of 53 NTD patients and 27 couples with a previous NTD affected pregnancy. Results: We identified three heterozygous missense variants in VANGL1, p.Ala187Val, p.Asp389His, and p.Arg517His, that are absent in controls and predicted to be detrimental on the protein function and, thus, we expanded the mutational spectrum of VANGL1 in NTD cases. We did not identify any new variants having an evident pathogenic effect on protein function in VANGL2. Moreover, we reviewed all the rare nonsynonymous or synonymous variants of VANGL1 and VANGL2 found in patients and controls so far published and re-evaluated them for their pathogenic role by in silico prediction tools. Association tests were performed to demonstrate the enrichment of deleterious variants in reviewed cases versus controls from Exome Variant Server (EVS). Conclusion: We showed a significant (p=7.0E-5) association between VANGL1 rare genetic variants, especially missense mutations, and NTDs risk. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Materials & methods: SPIONs of different sizes and surface charges were exposed to fetal bovine serum. The structure/composition and biological effects of the protein corona-SPION complexes were probed. Results & discussion: The affinity and level of adsorption of specific proteins is strongly dependent on the size and surface charge of the SPIONs. In vivo experiments on the mouse blood-brain barrier model revealed that nontargeted SPIONs containing specific proteins will enter the brain endothelial barrier cells. Conclusion: Some commercially available nanoparticles used for target-specific applications may have unintended uptake in the body (e.g., brain tissue) with potential cytotoxity.

Left-Dominant Temporal-Frontal Hypercoupling in Schizophrenia Patients With Hallucinations During Speech Perception	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						schizophrenia; inner speech; speech perception; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional connectivity	AUDITORY VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INNER SPEECH; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; COGNITIVE THERAPY; DEFAULT NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY; VOICES; THOUGHT; BRAIN	Task-based functional neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia have not yet replicated the increased coordinated hyperactivity in speech-related brain regions that is reported with symptom-capture and resting-state studies of hallucinations. This may be due to suboptimal selection of cognitive tasks. In the current study, we used a task that allowed experimental manipulation of control over verbal material and compared brain activity between 23 schizophrenia patients (10 hallucinators, 13 nonhallucinators), 22 psychiatric (bipolar), and 27 healthy controls. Two conditions were presented, one involving inner verbal thought (in which control over verbal material was required) and another involving speech perception (SP; in which control verbal material was not required). A functional connectivity analysis resulted in a left-dominant temporal-frontal network that included speech-related auditory and motor regions and showed hypercoupling in past-week hallucinating schizophrenia patients (relative to nonhallucinating patients) during SP only. These findings replicate our previous work showing generalized speech-related functional network hypercoupling in schizophrenia during inner verbal thought and SP, but extend them by suggesting that hypercoupling is related to past-week hallucination severity scores during SP only, when control over verbal material is not required. This result opens the possibility that practicing control over inner verbal thought processes may decrease the likelihood or severity of hallucinations.

Plasma near-infrared spectroscopy for diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease: the SPIN-PD study	BIOMARKERS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						biomarker; diagnosis; near-infrared spectroscopy; oxidative stress; Parkinson's disease; plasma	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; HEME OXYGENASE-1; BIOMARKERS; CRITERIA	Aim: There are no established chemical biomarkers of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). The results of a prior metabolomics-based biomarker study suggested that near-infrared spectroscopy of blood plasma samples may distinguish idiopathic PD from neurologically normal controls. Methods: Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to detect and quantify substrate modifications in blood plasma samples derived from 71 PD subjects enrolled in the PostCEPT observational study and 68 normal control subjects. Results: Near-infrared spectra values were significantly higher in the PD group compared with the control group when adjusted for age and gender (PD: adjusted mean 0.49 [95% CI: 0.45-0.53]; control: adjusted mean 0.40 [95% CI: 0.36-0.44]; p = 0.004, multiple regression). Conclusion: Near-infrared spectra of blood plasma in early-stage idiopathic PD differ from those of non-neurological control subjects. However, the degree of overlap between the groups limits the use of this technique in its present form as a PD biomarker for routine clinical practice.

Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) fail to meet the suggested levels of physical activity and that targeted interventions do not always improve this behavior. One validated treatment for motor symptoms in PD is subthalamic stimulation (STN DBS). Objective: Assess whether motor symptom improvement following STN DBS translated into increased physical activity behavior. Methods: Twenty patients with PD scheduled for bilateral STN DBS filled-out the Phone-FITT physical activity questionnaire and the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire prior to surgery and 6 to 9 months postoperatively. Data were compared to age-and gender-matched healthy controls. Results: Our results demonstrate that PD patients' quality of life is significantly lower than healthy controls. While STN DBS improves motor symptoms in the intermediate term, it only improves some aspects of quality of life related to physical function. Furthermore, STN DBS does not modify physical activity behavior measured by the Phone-FITT, whether for household or recreational activities. Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that the motor improvements observed after STN DBS do not lead to systematic improvements in all aspects of quality of life or increased levels of physical activity. This highlights the need to develop and implement intervention strategies to promote an active lifestyle in this population, even if clinical improvement is evident following surgery.

Caspases, the enzymes intimately linked with cell death and inflammation, are cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases. The measurement of caspase activity requires assays that can provide data with specificity, precision and sensitivity. Several nanoparticle-based assays are now beginning to emerge. This article will first provide a brief discussion of conventional methods of measuring caspase activity and their limitations, followed by an overview of the advantages and limitations of nanoparticle-based strategies for sensing caspase enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo.

We review evidence showing how these risks, in addition to inadequate psychosocial stimulation, prevent children from developing expected cognitive and language abilities. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 interventions aimed at enhancing stimulation and 18 interventions that provided better nutrition-all conducted since 2000-revealed that stimulation had a medium effect size of 0.42 and 0.47 on cognitive and language development, respectively, whereas nutrition by itself had a small effect size of 0.09. The implementation processes of these interventions are described and compared. A number of unresolved issues are outlined and discussed, including ways to maximize parental health behavior change, assess mediators that account for intervention effects, and expand the assessment of young children's brain functions that underlie language and cognition and are affected by nutrition and stimulation.

Evidence from animal studies suggests undoubtedly that bi-directional signalling between the immune system and the nervous system contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain. Non-neuronal cells, including peripheral immune cells, CNS/PNS glial cells and endothelial cells play important roles in the neuroimmune interaction and subsequent persistent hypersensitivity. Various cytokines and chemokines have been identified as key signalling molecules in the crosstalk. However, majority evidence showing inflammation in neuropathic pain was generated from animal models at acute phase. Whether and to what extent inflammation or non-neuronal cells are involved at chronic stage of neuropathic pain needs to be further explored, and evidence of inflammation in chronic pain from human studies is still largely awaited. Therapeutic agents targeting inflammation provide an exciting prospect. Yet, considering the heterogeneous conditions presented in neuropathic pain, no matter the etiologies, or the pathophysiology during different stages of the disease; and the complexity of the immune response to the damage on the nervous system, it appears that finely tuned strategies of modulating inflammation are essential to warrant an effective treatment for neuropathic pain. We want to reduce pain; we also want to promote tissue repair and functional recovery.	[Zhang, Ji; Echeverry, Stefania; Lim, Tony K.

We investigated the relationship between behavioural reading speed for stimuli thought to rely on either the ventral-lexical, dorsal-sublexical, or both streams and white matter via fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) using DTI tractography. Participants (N = 32) overtly named exception words (e.g., 'one', ventral-lexical), regular words (e.g., 'won', both streams), nonwords ('wum', dorsal-sublexical) and pseudohomophones ('wun', dorsal-sublexical) in a behavioural lab. Each participant then underwent a brain scan that included a 30-directional DTI sequence. Tractography was used to extract FA and MD values from four tracts of interest: inferior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Median reaction times (RTs) for reading exception words and regular words both showed a significant correlation with the FA of the uncinate fasciculus thought to underlie the ventral processing stream, such that response time decreased as FA increased. In addition, RT for exception and regular words showed a relationship with MD of the uncinate fasciculus, such that response time increased as MD increased. Multiple regression analyses revealed that exception word RT accounted for unique variability in FA of the uncinate over and above regular words. There were no robust relationships found between pseudohomophones, or nonwords, and tracts thought to underlie the dorsal processing stream. These results support the notion that word recognition, in general, and exception word reading in particular, rely on ventral-lexical brain regions.

The objective of the current study was to measure total mercury levels in cord blood and maternal blood from 95 mother-newborn pairs recruited from hospitals in Nnewi, Nigeria. The secondary aims of the study were to explore if demographic and dietary factors were associated with blood mercury levels, and to explore if mercury levels were associated with any self-reported health outcome and childbirth outcome. Maternal blood mercury levels averaged 3.6 mu g L-1 and ranged from 1.1 mu g L-1 to 9.5 mu g L-1. Cord blood mercury averaged 5.1 mu g L-1 and ranged from 1.2 mu g L-1 to 10.6 mu g L-1. The mean ratio of mercury in paired cord blood to maternal blood was 1.5 and it ranged from 0.4 to 3.2. Mercury in maternal and cord blood were significantly correlated (r = 0.471). More than one-third of mothers reported eating fish at least once per day, and a weak (p = 0.08) fish consumption-related increase in blood mercury was found. Cord blood mercury was positively and significantly associated with birth weight and length, and head and chest circumference. Mercury levels in 36% of the participants exceeded the biomonitoring guideline associated with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) reference dose for mercury. The study shows that Pregnant women and their newborns are exposed to methylmercury and that their exposures are higher compared to general populations sampled from other regions of the world.

To take full advantage of these, current algorithms should be significantly enhanced. We present here a new brain registration method driven simultaneously by the structural intensity and the total diffusion information of MRI scans. Using the two modalities together allows for a better alignment of general and specific aspects of the anatomy. Furthermore, keeping the full diffusion tensor in the cost function, rather than only some of its scalar measures, will allow for a thorough statistical analysis once the Jacobian of the transformation is obtained.

However, relatively few studies have investigated this phenomenon in light of lexical speech production abilities, which have not been systematically found to benefit from neurofunctional reorganization during verbal fluency tasks. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess overt self-paced semantic and orthographic verbal fluency tasks performed by healthy younger and older adults within a mixed block/event-related fMRI design. Behavioral results indicated similarly high levels of performance between tasks and age groups, while whole brain analysis revealed significant task-related differences in patterns of brain activity, but no significant effect of age or task-by-age interaction across the speech conditions. Only local activity differences were found between age groups. These marginal neurofunctional changes in high-performing older adults are discussed in terms of task demands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Emotional detachment in psychopathy: Involvement of dorsal default-mode connections	CORTEX			English	Article						Psychopathy; Emotional detachment; Default-mode network; Cingulum; Diffusion MRI	MATTER MICROSTRUCTURAL ABNORMALITIES; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY-DISORDER; CALLOUS-UNEMOTIONAL TRAITS; FRONTAL WHITE-MATTER; GRAY-MATTER; RESPONSE REVERSAL; BRAIN-FUNCTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ACQUIRED SOCIOPATHY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Criminal psychopathy is defined by emotional detachment [Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R) factor 1], and antisocial behaviour (PCL-R factor 2). Previous work has associated antisocial behaviour in psychopathy with abnormalities in a ventral temporo-amygdala-orbitofrontal network. However, little is known of the neural correlates of emotional detachment Imaging studies have indicated that the 'default-mode network' (DMN), and in particular its dorsomedial (medial prefrontal - posterior cingulate) component, contributes to affective and social processing in healthy individuals. Furthermore, recent work suggests that this network may be implicated in psychopathy. However, no research has examined the relationship between psychopathy, emotional detachment, and the white matter underpinning the DMN. We therefore used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography in 13 offenders with psychopathy and 13 non-offenders to investigate the relationship between emotional detachment and the microstructure of white matter connections within the DMN. These included the dorsal cingulum (containing the medial prefrontal - posterior cingulate connections of the DMN), and the ventral cingulum (containing the posterior cingulate - medial temporal connections of the DMN). We found that fractional anisotropy (FA) was reduced in the left dorsal cingulum in the psychopathy group (p = .024). Moreover, within this group, emotional detachment was negatively correlated with FA in this tract portion bilaterally (left: r = -.61, p = .026; right: r = -.62, p = .023). These results suggest the importance of the dorsal DMN in the emotional detachment observed in individuals with psychopathy. We propose a 'dual-network' model of white matter abnormalities in the disorder, which incorporates these with previous findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The longitudinal sample, drawn from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, included children who were 6 to 9 years old in Cycle 1 who were followed-up biennially in Cycles 2 and 3 (N = 3476). The associations between NDDs and/or EBPs, child and family socio-demographic characteristics and parenting behaviors (consistency and ineffective parenting), were examined across several measures of child psychosocial functioning: peer relationships, general self-esteem, prosocial behavior and anxiety-emotional problems. Results: Children with NDDs, EBPs, and both NDDs and EBPs self-reported lower scores on general self-esteem. Children with NDDs and both NDDs and EBPs reported lower scores on peer relationships and prosocial behavior. Lastly, children with both NDDs and EBPs self-reported higher scores on anxiety-emotional behaviors. After considering family socio-demographic characteristics and parenting behaviors, these differences remained statistically significant only for children with both NDDs and EBPs. Child age and gender, household income and parenting behaviors were important in explaining these associations. Conclusions: Psychosocial functioning differs for children with NDDs and/or EBPs. Children with both NDDs and EBPs appear to report poorer psychosocial functioning compared to their peers with neither condition. However, it is important to consider the context of socio-demographic characteristics, parenting behaviors and their interactions to understand differences in children's psychosocial functioning.

In periphery, MCs crosstalk with neurons via purinergic signals and participate in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. Whether extracellular ATP, an important purine in purinergic signaling, of MCs and neurons could be modulated by irradiation remains unknown. In this study, effects of red-laser irradiation on extracellular ATP content of MCs and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons were investigated and underlying mechanisms were explored in vitro. Our results show that irradiation led to elevation of extracellular ATP level in the human mast cell line HMC-1 in a dose-dependent manner, which was accompanied by elevation of intracellular ATP content, an indicator for ATP synthesis, together with [Ca2+](i) elevation, a trigger signal for exocytotic ATP release. In contrast to MCs, irradiation attenuated the extracellular ATP content of neurons, which could be abolished by ARL 67156, a nonspecific ecto-ATPases inhibitor. Our results suggest that irradiation potentiates extracellular ATP of MCs by promoting ATP synthesis and release and attenuates extracellular ATP of neurons by upregulating ecto-ATPase activity. The opposite responses of these two cell types indicate complex mechanisms underlying LLLT.

Culture modulates the brain response to human expressions of emotion: Electrophysiological evidence	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Cross-cultural studies; ERP; Stroop; Facial expression; Emotional prosody	AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; SPONTANEOUS ATTENTION; RECOGNIZING EMOTIONS; ERP EVIDENCE; TIME-COURSE; PROSODY; WORD; VOICE; N400; PERCEPTION	To understand how culture modulates on-line neural responses to social information, this study compared how individuals from two distinct cultural groups, English-speaking North Americans and Chinese, process emotional meanings of multi-sensory stimuli as indexed by both behaviour (accuracy) and event-related potential (N400) measures. In an emotional Stroop-like task, participants were presented face-voice pairs expressing congruent or incongruent emotions in conditions where they judged the emotion of one modality while ignoring the other (face or voice focus task). Results indicated that while both groups were sensitive to emotional differences between channels (with lower accuracy and higher N400 amplitudes for incongruent face-voice pairs), there were marked group differences in how intruding facial or vocal cues affected accuracy and N400 amplitudes, with English participants showing greater interference from irrelevant faces than Chinese. Our data illuminate distinct biases in how adults from East Asian versus Western cultures process socio-emotional cues, supplying new evidence that cultural learning modulates not only behaviour, but the neurocognitive response to different features of multi-channel emotion expressions.

Activation of Parallel Fiber Feedback by Spatially Diffuse Stimuli Reduces Signal and Noise Correlations via Independent Mechanisms in a Cerebellum-Like Structure	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; NEURONAL SPIKE TRAINS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEM; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; REDUNDANCY REDUCTION; SENSORY SIGNALS	Correlations between the activities of neighboring neurons are observed ubiquitously across systems and species and are dynamically regulated by several factors such as the stimulus' spatiotemporal extent as well as by the brain's internal state. Using the electrosensory system of gymnotiform weakly electric fish, we recorded the activities of pyramidal cell pairs within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) under spatially localized and diffuse stimulation. We found that both signal and noise correlations were markedly reduced (>40%) under the latter stimulation. Through a network model incorporating key anatomical features of the ELL, we reveal how activation of diffuse parallel fiber feedback from granule cells by spatially diffuse stimulation can explain both the reduction in signal as well as the reduction in noise correlations seen experimentally through independent mechanisms. First, we show that burst-timing dependent plasticity, which leads to a negative image of the stimulus and thereby reduces single neuron responses, decreases signal but not noise correlations. Second, we show trial-to-trial variability in the responses of single granule cells to sensory input reduces noise but not signal correlations. Thus, our model predicts that the same feedback pathway can simultaneously reduce both signal and noise correlations through independent mechanisms. To test this prediction experimentally, we pharmacologically inactivated parallel fiber feedback onto ELL pyramidal cells. In agreement with modeling predictions, we found that inactivation increased both signal and noise correlations but that there was no significant relationship between magnitude of the increase in signal correlations and the magnitude of the increase in noise correlations. The mechanisms reported in this study are expected to be generally applicable to the cerebellum as well as other cerebellum-like structures. We further discuss the implications of such decorrelation on the neural coding strategies used by the electrosensory and by other systems to process natural stimuli.

However, it remains unclear whether physiological aging affects the functional integrity of pre-attentive phonological discrimination. The neuromagnetic cortical responses during automatic change detection of speech sounds (/ba/versus/da/) were recorded in 24 young and 21 aged male adults. We used minimum norm estimate of source reconstruction to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of magnetic mismatch responses (MMNm). Distributed activations to phonetic changes were identified in the temporal, frontal and parietal regions. Compared to younger participants, elderly volunteers exhibited a significant reduction of cortical responses to phonetic-MMNm, except for the left orbitofrontal cortex and anterior inferior temporal gyrus. However, among the identified regions of interest, we did not observe significant between-group differences in the hemispheric asymmetry of phonetic-MMNm. Conclusively, our results suggest an altered phonetic processing at the perceptual level during physiological aging. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Robust biomarkers for AD do not yet exist, although changes in the cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau and A beta represent promising candidates in addition to brain imaging and genetic risk profiling. Although concentrations of soluble A beta(42) correlate with symptoms of AD, less is known about the biological activities of A beta peptides which are generated from the amyloid-beta protein precursor. An unbiased DNA microarray study showed that A beta(42), at sub-lethal concentrations, specifically increases expression of several genes in neuroblastoma cells, notably the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3 and 5 (IGFBP3/5), the transcription regulator inhibitor of DNA binding, and the transcription factor Lim only domain protein 4. Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that mRNA levels of the identified candidate genes were exclusively increased by the potentially neurotoxic A beta(42) wild-type peptide, as both the less toxic A beta(40) and a non-toxic substitution peptide A beta(42) G33A did not affect mRNA levels. In vivo immunohistochemistry revealed a corresponding increase in both hippocampal and cortical IGFBP5 expression in an AD mouse model. Proteomic analyses of human AD cerebrospinal fluid displayed increased in vivo concentrations of IGFBPs. IGFBPs and transcription factors, as identified here, are modulated by soluble A beta(42) and may represent useful early biomarkers.

J	Valle-Leija, P				Valle-Leija, Pablo			Odorant Receptors Signaling Instructs the Development and Plasticity of the Glomerular Map	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							MOUSE OLFACTORY-BULB; FEEDBACK-REGULATION ENSURES; SENSORY NEURONS; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSGENIC MICE; SYSTEM; ORGANIZATION; RAT; REPRESENTATIONS; PROJECTIONS	The olfactory system provides a great opportunity to explore the mechanisms that underlie the formation and function of neural circuits because of the simplicity of its structure. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) located in the peripheral olfactory epithelium (OE) take part in the initial formation and function of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB) inside the central nervous system. Glomeruli are key in the process of transduction of olfactory information, as they constitute a map in the OB that sorts the different types of odorant inputs. This odorant categorization allows proper olfactory perception, and it is achieved through the anatomical organization and function of the different glomerular circuits. Once formed, glomeruli keep the capacity to undergo diverse plasticity processes, which is unique among the different neural circuits of the central nervous system. In this context, through the expression and function of the odorant receptors (ORs), OSNs perform two of the most important roles in the olfactory system: transducing odorant information to the nervous system and initiating the development of the glomerular map to organize olfactory information. This review addresses essential information that has emerged in recent years about the molecular basis of these processes.

Relationships between acute imaging biomarkers and theory of mind impairment in post-acute pediatric traumatic brain injury: A prospective analysis using susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Child; Brain injuries; Magnetic resonance imaging; Theory of Mind; Neurobiology	DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; SOCIAL BRAIN; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; FAMILY ENVIRONMENT; CHILDREN; LESIONS; CHILDHOOD; DEFICITS; EMOTION; ADOLESCENTS	Theory of Mind (ToM) forms an integral component of socially skilled behavior, and is critical for attaining developmentally appropriate goals. The protracted development of ToM is mediated by increasing connectivity between regions of the anatomically distributed 'mentalizing network', and may be vulnerable to disruption from pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study aimed to evaluate the post-acute effects of TBI on first-order ToM, and examine relations between ToM and both local and global indices of macrostructural damage detected using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). 104 children and adolescents with TB! and 43 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging including a susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence 2-8 weeks post-injury and were assessed on cognitive ToM tasks at 6-months after injury. Compared to TD controls and children with mild-moderate injuries, children with severe TBI showed significantly poorer ToM. Moreover, impairments in ToM were related to diffuse neuropathology, and parietal lobe lesions. Our findings support the vulnerability of the immature social brain network to disruption from TBI, and suggest that global macrostructural damage commonly associated with traumatic axonal injury (TAI) may contribute to structural disconnection of anatomically distributed regions that underlie ToM. This study suggests that SWI may be a valuable imaging biomarker to predict outcome and recovery of social cognition after pediatric TBI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic disorder that appears to affect primarily pitch and melody perception. Pitch is normally conveyed by the spectro-temporal fine structure of low harmonics, but some pitch information is available in the temporal envelope produced by the interactions of higher harmonics. Using 10 amusic subjects and 10 matched controls, we tested the hypothesis that amusics suffer exclusively from impaired processing of spectro-temporal fine structure. We also tested whether the inability of amusics to process acoustic temporal fine structure extends beyond pitch by measuring sensitivity to interaural time differences, which also rely on temporal fine structure. Further tests were carried out on basic intensity and spectral resolution. As expected, pitch perception based on spectrotemporal fine structure was impaired in amusics; however, no significant deficits were observed in amusics' ability to perceive the pitch conveyed via temporal-envelope cues. Sensitivity to interaural time differences was also not significantly different between the amusic and control groups, ruling out deficits in the peripheral coding of temporal fine structure. Finally, no significant differences in intensity or spectral resolution were found between the amusic and control groups. The results demonstrate a pitch-specific deficit in fine spectro-temporal information processing in amusia that seems unrelated to temporal or spectral coding in the auditory periphery. These results are consistent with the view that there are distinct mechanisms dedicated to processing resolved and unresolved harmonics in the general population, the former being altered in congenital amusia while the latter is spared.

Dietary Antioxidant Intake and Its Association With Cognitive Function in an Ethnically Diverse Sample of US Adults	PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE			English	Article						antioxidants; cognitive function; depressive symptoms; midlife	INCIDENT ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; MULTIPLE-PASS METHOD; POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; C SUPPLEMENT USE; VITAMIN-E LEVELS; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; OLDER-ADULTS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CACHE COUNTY	Background Dietary antioxidants can inhibit reactions accompanying neurodegeneration and thus prevent cognitive impairment. We describe associations of dietary antioxidants with cognitive function in a large biracial population, while testing moderation by sex, race, and age and mediation by depressive symptoms. Methods This was a cross-sectional analysis of 1274 adults (541 men and 733 women) aged 30 to 64 years at baseline (mean [standard deviation] = 47.5 [9.3]) in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Lifespan Study, Baltimore city, MD. Cognitive performance in the domains of memory, language/verbal, attention, spatial, psychomotor speed, executive function, and global mental status were assessed. The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. Dietary intake was assessed with two 24-hour recalls, estimating daily consumption of total carotenoids and vitamins A, C, and E per 1000 kcal. Results Among key findings, 1 standard deviation (approximate to 2.02 mg/1000 kcal) higher vitamin E was associated with a higher score on verbal memory, immediate recall ( = +0.64 [0.19], p = .001), and better language/verbal fluency performance ( = +0.53 [0.16], p = .001), particularly among the younger age group. Women with higher vitamin E intake ( = +0.68 [0.21], p = .001) had better performance on a psychomotor speed test. The vitamin E-verbal memory association was partially mediated by depressive symptoms (proportion mediated = 13%-16%). Conclusions In sum, future cohort studies and dietary interventions should focus on associations of dietary vitamin E with cognitive decline, specifically for domains of verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed.

Interobserver Agreement in the Interpretation of Outpatient Head CT Scans in an Academic Neuroradiology Practice	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							DIAGNOSTIC-PROCEDURES; DISCREPANCY MEETINGS; RADIOLOGY; ACCURACY; RATES	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The repeatability of head CT interpretations may be studied in different contexts: in peer-review quality assurance interventions or in interobserver agreement studies. We assessed the agreement between double-blind reports of outpatient CT scans in a routine academic practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outpatient head CT scans (119 patients) were randomly selected to be read twice in a blinded fashion by 8 neuroradiologists practicing in an academic institution during 1 year. Nonstandardized reports were analyzed to extract 4 items (answer to the clinical question, major findings, incidental findings, recommendations for further investigations) from each report, to identify agreement or discrepancies (classified as class 2 [mentioned or not mentioned or contradictions between reports], class 1 [mentioned in both reports but diverging in location or severity], 0 [concordant], or not applicable), according to a standardized data-extraction form. Agreement regarding the presence or absence of clinically significant or incidental findings was studied with kappa statistics. RESULTS: The interobserver agreement regarding head CT studies with positive and negative results for clinically pertinent findings was 0.86 (0.77-0.95), but concordance was only 75.6% (67.2%-82.5%). Class 2 discrepancy was found in 15.1%; class 1 discrepancy, in 9.2% of cases. The kappa value for reporting incidental findings was 0.59 (0.45-0.74), with class 2 discrepancy in 29.4% of cases. Most discrepancies did not impact the clinical management of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies in double-blind interpretations of head CT examinations were more common than reported in peer-review quality assurance programs.	[Guerin, G.; Soto, C.

More controversial is radiotherapy deferral. This study reports on children treated with gross total resection who did not receive upfront adjuvant radiotherapy. We conducted a retrospective review of children with intracranial ependymoma in 12 Canadian centers. Patients who had GTR of their tumor and no upfront radiotherapy were identified. Immunostaining was performed for Ki-67, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and EZH2 on archived tissue. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed and compared with those who had GTR followed by radiation. Twenty-six children were identified treated with GTR alone at diagnosis; 12 posterior fossa ependymoma (PFE) WHO grade II, and 14 supratentorial ependymoma (STE). Progression-free survival (PFS) in ependymoma treated with GTR alone at diagnosis was inferior in those with high Ki-67 or positive EZH2 immunostaining. Survival was inferior for patients less than 2 years old at diagnosis (p = 0.002). Survival was comparable to PFE WHO grade II and STE who had GTR followed by radiation (p = 0.62). Five-year PFS and overall survival (OS) of those treated with GTR alone were 60 and 70 % respectively for PFE and 45 and 70 % respectively for STE (p = 0.2; 0.55). This study suggests that there is a subset of children with certain biologic features who, in the setting of a prospective clinical trial, might be candidates for observation following GTR. Good risk factors for this approach include age of 2 years or older, low Ki-67, and negative EZH2. If relapse occurs, it may be confined to the primary site, allowing for possible salvage with GTR followed by XRT.

ANG4043, a Novel Brain-Penetrant Peptide-mAb Conjugate, Is Efficacious against HER2-Positive Intracranial Tumors in Mice	MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							HUMAN-BREAST-CANCER; DELIVERY VECTOR ANGIOPEP-2; RECEPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN-1; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY; XENOGRAFT MODEL; DRUG-DELIVERY; GROWTH-FACTOR; MOUSE-BRAIN	Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been shown to reduce tumor size and increase survival in patients with breast cancer, but they are ineffective against brain metastases due to poor brain penetration. In previous studies, we identified a peptide, known as Angiopep-2 (An2), which crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) efficiently via receptor-mediated transcytosis, and, when conjugated, endows small molecules and peptides with this property. Extending this strategy to higher molecular weight biologics, we now demonstrate that a conjugate between An2 and an anti-HER2 mAb results in a new chemical entity, ANG4043, which retains in vitro binding affinity for the HER2 receptor and antiproliferative potency against HER2-positive BT-474 breast ductal carcinoma cells. Unlike the native mAb, ANG4043 binds LRP1 clusters and is taken up by LRP1-expressing cells. Measuring brain exposure after intracarotid delivery, we demonstrate that the new An2-mAb conjugate penetrates the BBB with a rate of brain entry (Kin) of 1.6 x 10(-3) mL/g/s. Finally, in mice with intracranially implanted BT-474 xenografts, systemically administered ANG4043 increases survival. Overall, this study demonstrates that the incorporation of An2 to the anti-HER2 mAb confers properties of increased uptake in brain endothelial cells as well as BBB permeability. These characteristics of ANG4043 result in higher exposure levels in BT-474 brain tumors and prolonged survival following systemic treatment. Moreover, the data further validate the An2-drug conjugation strategy as a way to create brain-penetrant biologics for neuro-oncology and other CNS indications. (C) 2014 AACR.

Care4Rare Canadaz	Mutations in PNPLA6 are linked to photoreceptor degeneration and various forms of childhood blindness	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							NEUROPATHY TARGET ESTERASE; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; HUMAN HAIR-GROWTH; ACID; MICE; GENE; PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE; MAINTENANCE; DISRUPTION; DROSOPHILA	Blindness due to retinal degeneration affects millions of people worldwide, but many disease-causing mutations remain unknown. PNPLA6 encodes the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 6, also known as neuropathy target esterase (NTE), which is the target of toxic organophosphates that induce human paralysis due to severe axonopathy of large neurons. Mutations in PNPLA6 also cause human spastic paraplegia characterized by motor neuron degeneration. Here we identify PNPLA6 mutations in childhood blindness in seven families with retinal degeneration, including Leber congenital amaurosis and Oliver McFarlane syndrome. PNPLA6 localizes mostly at the inner segment plasma membrane in photo-receptors and mutations in Drosophila PNPLA6 lead to photoreceptor cell death. We also report that lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidic acid levels are elevated in mutant Drosophila. These findings show a role for PNPLA6 in photoreceptor survival and identify phospholipid metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for some forms of blindness.

Dissociable contributions of the prefrontal cortex to hippocampus-and caudate nucleus-dependent virtual navigation strategies	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Navigation strategies; Spatial memory; Stimulus-response; fMAI; VBM; Prefrontal cortex; Orbitofrontal cortex; Hippocampus	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MORRIS WATER MAZE; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SPATIAL MEMORY; DECISION-MAKING; MACAQUE MONKEYS; FIMBRIA-FORNIX; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTEX	The hippocampus and the caudate nucleus are critical to spatial- and stimulus-response-based navigation strategies, respectively. The hippocampus and caudate nucleus are also known to be anatomically connected to various areas of the prefrontal cortex. However, little is known about the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in these processes. In the current study, we sought to identify the prefrontal areas involved in spatial and response learning. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and voxel-based morphometry to compare the neural activity and grey matter density of spatial and response strategy users. Twenty-three healthy young adults were scanned in a 1.5 T MRI scanner while they engaged in the Concurrent Spatial Discrimination Learning Task, a virtual navigation task in which either a spatial or response strategy can be used. In addition to increased BOLD activity in the hippocampus, spatial strategy users showed increased BOLD activity and grey matter density in the ventral area of the medial prefrontal cortex, especially in the orbitofrontal cortex. On the other hand, response strategy users exhibited increased BOLD activity and grey matter density in the dorsal area of the medial prefrontal cortex. Given the prefrontal cortex's role in reward-guided decision-making, we discuss the possibility that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex, supports spatial learning by encoding stimulus-reward associations, while the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex supports response learning by encoding action-reward associations.

Given that the inflammatory microenvironment is a hallmark signature of solid tumor development, anti-inflammatory targeting strategies have been envisioned as preventing glioblastoma initiation or progression. Consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with reduced risk of developing cancers, a chemopreventive effect that is, in part, attributed to their high content of phytochemicals with potent antiinflammatory properties. We explored whether luteolin, a common flavonoid in many types of plants, may inhibit interleukin (IL)-1 beta function induction of the inflammation biomarker cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. We found that IL-1 beta triggered COX-2 expression in U-87 glioblastoma cells and synergized with luteolin to potentiate or inhibit that induction in a biphasic manner. Luteolin pretreatment of cells inhibited IL-1 beta-mediated phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa B, nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase in a concentration-dependent manner. Luteolin also inhibited ART phosphorylation and survivin expression, while it triggered both caspase-3 cleavage and expression of glucose-regulated protein 78. These effects were all potentiated by IL-beta, in part through increased nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p65. Finally, luteolin was able to reduce IL-1 receptor gene expression, and treatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist or gene silencing of IL-1 receptor prevented IL-1 beta /luteolin-induced COX-2 expression. Our results document a novel adaptive cellular response to luteolin, which triggers anti-survival and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that contribute to the chemopreventive properties of this diet-derived molecule.

Systemic insecticides (neonicotinoids and fipronil): trends, uses, mode of action and metabolites	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Neonicotinoid; Fipronil; Trends; Mechanismof action; Agriculture; Seed treatment; Systemic insecticides; Metabolites	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER; BEMISIA-TABACI HOMOPTERA; APHIS-GOSSYPII HOMOPTERA; MYZUS-PERSICAE HEMIPTERA; ANTENNAL LOBE NEURONS; MOUSE-LIVER TUMORS; ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN; BINDING-SITE	Since their discovery in the late 1980s, neonicotinoid pesticides have become the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide, with large-scale applications ranging from plant protection (crops, vegetables, fruits), veterinary products, and biocides to invertebrate pest control in fish farming. In this review, we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000 tonnes active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of insecticides (i. e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3) they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects. The toxicity persists for a variable period of timedepending on the plant, its growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. Awide variety of applications are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all environmental compartments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while fipronil inhibits neuronal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate neurons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all insecticides, they can also have lethal and sublethal impacts on non-target organisms, including insect predators and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate, coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose serious risks of undesirable environmental impacts.

Hearts and minds: linking vascular rigidity and aerobic fitness with cognitive aging	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Healthy aging; Executive functions; Cardiorespiratory fitness; Aortic rigidity; Cerebrovascular function; Cerebrovascular reactivity; VO2 max; Stroop	WHITE-MATTER HYPERINTENSITIES; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE; HEALTHY OLDER-ADULTS; PULSE-WAVE VELOCITY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CEREBROVASCULAR REACTIVITY; ARTERIAL STIFFNESS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS; RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS	Human aging is accompanied by both vascular and cognitive changes. Although arteries throughout the body are known to become stiffer with age, this vessel hardening is believed to start at the level of the aorta and progress to other organs, including the brain. Progression of this vascular impairment may contribute to cognitive changes that arise with a similar time course during aging. Conversely, it has been proposed that regular exercise plays a protective role, attenuating the impact of age on vascular and metabolic physiology. Here, the impact of vascular degradation in the absence of disease was investigated within 2 groups of healthy younger and older adults. Age-related changes in executive function, elasticity of the aortic arch, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cerebrovascular reactivity were quantified, as well as the association between these parameters within the older group. In the cohort studied, older adults exhibited a decline in executive functions, measured as a slower performance in a modified Stroop task (1247.90 +/- 204.50 vs. 898.20 +/- 211.10 ms on the inhibition and/or switching component, respectively) than younger adults. Older participants also showed higher aortic pulse wave velocity (8.98 +/- 3.56 vs. 3.95 +/- 0.82 m/s, respectively) and lower VO2 max (29.04 +/- 6.92 vs. 42.32 +/- 7.31 mL O-2/kg/min, respectively) than younger adults. Within the older group, faster performance of the modified Stroop task was associated with preserved aortic elasticity (lower aortic pulse wave velocity; p = 0.046) and higher cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 max; p = 0.036). Furthermore, VO2 max was found to be negatively associated with blood oxygenation level dependent cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 in frontal regions involved in the task (p = 0.038) but positively associated with cerebrovascular reactivity in periventricular watershed regions and within the postcentral gyrus. Overall, the results of this study support the hypothesis that cognitive status in aging is linked to vascular health, and that preservation of vessel elasticity may be one of the key mechanisms by which physical exercise helps to alleviate cognitive aging.

Recently, attenuation in stress reactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and cardiovascular system have been related to the number of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). We set out to investigate the association of ACE duration and age of ACE occurrence on stress reactivity. Methods: 104 women in the age range 18-25 years (mean = 21.7) free of mental and physical illness underwent psychosocial stress testing with the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST). Free saliva cortisol and heart rate were assessed repeatedly before and after the MIST. Results: Number of ACEs was associated with attenuated cortisol and heart rate responses to stress in a dose-response relationship. Whereas overall duration of ACEs was significantly associated with an attenuated cortisol response, the specific age of first ACE occurrence did not contribute further to the dampened stress response. Conclusions: ACEs are associated with blunted endocrine and cardiovascular stress reactivity in young and healthy women. Adverse life events in childhood, particularly if they occur repeatedly and chronically, show a strong association with alterations in stress reactivity in adulthood, potentially predisposing for later mental or physical disorders.

This intuitive notion suggests that combining attentional control processes might reflect a fundamentally novel way in which attention supports complex behavior. Using an established paradigm, here we show that joint recruitment in multiple attention control systems leads to corresponding combined increases in behavior and underlying sensory processing of attended targets. Moreover, our data also revealed that the nature of the combined effect depends on a flexible allocation of attentional resources to individual component processes, which change dynamically as a function of task demands. Together, these data provide a new conceptual framework for characterizing the role of attention in behavior and suggest important extensions to the prevailing theories of attention.

However, contrary to smell and taste, we lack a thorough understanding of the trigeminal processing of mixtures. We, therefore, investigated trigeminal perception using mixtures of 3 relatively receptor-specific agonists together with one control odor in different proportions to determine basic perceptual dimensions of trigeminal perception. We found that 4 main dimensions were linked to trigeminal perception: sensations of intensity, warmth, coldness, and pain. We subsequently investigated perception of binary mixtures of trigeminal stimuli by means of these 4 perceptual dimensions using different concentrations of a cooling stimulus (eucalyptol) mixed with a stimulus that evokes warmth perception (cinnamaldehyde). To determine if sensory interactions are mainly of central or peripheral origin, we presented stimuli in a physical "mixture" or as a "combination" presented separately to individual nostrils. Results showed that mixtures generally yielded higher ratings than combinations on the trigeminal dimensions "intensity," "warm," and "painful," whereas combinations yielded higher ratings than mixtures on the trigeminal dimension "cold." These results suggest dimension-specific interactions in the perception of trigeminal mixtures, which may be explained by particular interactions that may take place on peripheral or central levels.

LRRK2 localizes to endosomes and interacts with clathrin-light chains to limit Rac1 activation	EMBO REPORTS			English	Article						clathrin; Drosophila melanogaster; endosomes; Parkinson's disease; Rac1	KINASE 2 LRRK2; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DROSOPHILA; PROTEIN; PATHWAY; PHOSPHORYLATION; TRAFFICKING; LYSOSOMES; MUTATIONS; HOMOLOG	Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of dominant-inherited Parkinson's disease (PD), and yet we do not fully understand the physiological function(s) of LRRK2. Various components of the clathrin machinery have been recently found mutated in familial forms of PD. Here, we provide molecular insight into the association of LRRK2 with the clathrin machinery. We report that through its GTPase domain, LRRK2 binds directly to clathrin-light chains (CLCs). Using genome-edited HA-LRRK2 cells, we localize LRRK2 to endosomes on the degradative pathway, where it partially co-localizes with CLCs. Knockdown of CLCs and/or LRRK2 enhances the activation of the small GTPase Rac1, leading to alterations in cell morphology, including the disruption of neuronal dendritic spines. In Drosphila, a minimal rough eye phenotype caused by overexpression of Rac1, is dramatically enhanced by loss of function of CLC and LRRK2 homologues, confirming the importance of this pathway in vivo. Our data identify a new pathway in which CLCs function with LRRK2 to control Rac1 activation on endosomes, providing a new link between the clathrin machinery, the cytoskeleton and PD.

Canadian Neonatal Network	Association of Early Caffeine Administration and Neonatal Outcomes in Very Preterm Neonates	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; CLINICAL-OUTCOMES; PREMATURITY; APNEA; THERAPY; MORTALITY; NICU	IMPORTANCE Advantages of caffeine for apnea of prematurity have prompted clinicians to use it prophylactically even before apnea. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of early initiation of caffeine therapy on neonatal outcomes in very preterm infants born in Canada. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort studywas conducted. Patients included preterm neonates born at less than 31 weeks' gestation admitted to 29 participating Canadian Neonatal Network neonatal intensive care units between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. EXPOSURES Neonates who received caffeine were divided into 2 groups based on the following timing of caffeine initiation: within the first 2 days after birth (early) and on or after the third day following birth (late). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE A composite of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. RESULTS Of 5517 eligible neonates, 5101 (92.5%) received caffeine (early: 3806 [74.6%]; late: 1295 [25.4%]). There was no difference in weight or gestational age at birth between the groups. Neonates in the early group had decreased odds of a composite outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98) and patent ductus arteriosus (AOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89). There was no difference between the groups in mortality (AOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.70-1.37), necrotizing enterocolitis (AOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.65-1.20), severe neurological injury (AOR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-1.01), or severe retinopathy of prematurity (AOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.56-1.10). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In very preterm neonates, early (prophylactic) caffeine use was associated with a reduction in the rates of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia and patent ductus arteriosus. No adverse impact on any other outcomes was observed.

From a developmental perspective, studies have provided more insight into how 5-HT dysfunctions acquired in utero or early in life may modulate brain development. This paper discusses the relevance of the developmental role of 5-HT for the understanding of psychopathology. We review developmental milestones of the 5-HT system, how genetic and environmental 5-HT disturbances could affect brain development and the potential role of DNA methylation in 5-HT genes for brain development. Methods: Studies were identified using common databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) and reference lists. Results: Despite the widely supported view that the 5-HT system matures in early life, different 5-HT receptors, proteins and enzymes have different developmental patterns, and development is brain region-specific. A disruption in 5-HT homeostasis during development may lead to structural and functional changes in brain circuits that modulate emotional stress responses, including subcortical limbic and (pre) frontal areas. This may result in a predisposition to psychopathology. DNA methylation might be one of the underlying physiologic mechanisms. Limitations: There is a need for prospective studies. The impact of stressors during adolescence on the 5-HT system is understudied. Questions regarding efficacy of drugs acting on 5-HT still remain. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary and longitudinal approach in designing studies on the role of 5-HT in psychopathology pathology might help to bring us closer to the understanding of the role of 5-HT in psychopathology.

It is a complex behaviour that involves the brain reward system and is regulated by genetic and environmental factors, such as the opioid receptor mu-1 gene (OPRM1) and prenatal exposure to maternal ciga-rette smoking (PEMCS). We examined whether OPRM1 and PEMCS interact in influencing fat intake and whether exposure-associated epigenetic modifications of OPRM1 may mediate this gene-environment interaction. Methods: We studied adolescents from a French Canadian genetic founder population, half of whom were exposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking. Fat intake was assessed with a 24-hour food recall in the form of a structured interview conducted by a trained nutritionist. The OPRM1 variant rs2281617 was genotyped for the whole sample with the Illumina Human610-Quad and HumanOmniExpress BeadChips. Methylation of blood DNA was assessed at 21 CpGs across OPRM1 in a subset of the sample using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Results: We included 956 adolescents in our study. In the whole sample, OPRM1 (T carrier in rs2281617) was associated with lower fat intake (-1.6%, p = 0.017), and PEMCS was associated with higher fat intake (+ 1.6%, p = 0.005). OPRM1 and PEMCS interacted with each other (p = 0.003); the "protective" (fat intake-lowering) allele of OPRM1 was associated with lower fat intake in nonexposed (-3.2%, p < 0.001) but not in exposed individuals (+0.8%, p = 0.42). Further, PEMCS was associated with lower DNA methylation across multiple CpGs across OPRM1 in exposed versus nonexposed individuals (p = 0.031). Limitations: A limitation of our study was its cross-sectional design. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PEMCS may interact with OPRM1 in increasing fat preference. Silencing of the protective OPRM1 allele in exposed adolescents might be related to epigenetic modification of this gene.	[Lee, Ken W.

To enhance our understanding for how QOL emerges from the sequelae of stroke during the recovery period, the aim was to empirically test a biopsychosocial conceptual model of HRQL for people recovering from stroke. We present a multi-site longitudinal study of an inception cohort of 678 persons recruited at stroke onset and studied at key intervals over the first post-stroke year. As the most pronounced recovery after stroke occurs in the first 3 months, this time frame was chosen as the focus of this analysis. The measures for this study were chosen for their relevance to key constructs of stroke impact and for their optimal psychometric properties. Multiple measures for each of the W-C rubrics were available from instruments such as the Stroke Impact Scale, RAND-36, HUI, and EQ-5D, among others. A structural equation model (SEM) was fit using MPlus. To minimize potential bias arising from the missing data, multiple imputation was performed on the longitudinal data using SAS proc MI. Of the 678 subjects who entered the cohort, 618 were interviewed at 1 month post-stroke and 533 at 3 months (486 and 454 had data at 6 and 12 months, respectively). A 3-month model with paths from biological factors to symptoms and symptoms to function fits well (CFI:0.966, RMSEA:0.044), though one model with paths from function to health perception did not (CFI:0.934, RMSEA:0.058). Allowing additional paths across non-adjacent rubrics improved fit considerably (CFI:0.962, RMSEA:0.044). A final model included emotional well-being under the symptom rubric (CFI:0.955, RMSEA:0.047). Including social support as an environmental factor had little impact on the model. Total variance in health perception explained was 76.3 %. These results emphasize that to optimize overall HRQL during the crucial first 3 months of recovery, interventions need to continue to focus on comorbid health conditions and on reducing stroke impairments. A function-only focus too soon in the recovery process may not produce the desired impact to optimize HRQL.

In the present report, we searched for brain epigenetic mechanisms that possibly underlie this increase. For that, we examined the expression of the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 and of the histone deacetylases HDAC2 and HDAC3, as well as the acetylation status of histone H3 and H4 in mesolimbic structures of adult maternally deprived rats, using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. A long-lasting increase in MeCP2 expression was found throughout the striatum of deprived rats. Enhanced HDAC2 expression and increased nuclear HDAC activity in the nucleus accumbens of deprived rats were associated with lower acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4. Treatment for 3 weeks with the HDAC inhibitor sodium valproate abolished HDAC activation together with the decrease in the acetylation levels of histone H4, and was accompanied with normalized oral morphine consumption. The data indicate that epigenetic mechanisms induced by early adverse environment memorize life experience to trigger greater opiate vulnerability during adult life. They suggest that sodium valproate may lessen vulnerability to opiate intake, particularly in subgroups of individuals subjected to adverse postnatal environments.

Cross-Disorder Genome-Wide Analyses Suggest a Complex Genetic Relationship Between Tourette's Syndrome and OCD	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ASSOCIATION SCANS; GENERALIST GENES; VARIANTS; TICS	Objective: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette's syndrome are highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders that are thought to share genetic risk factors. However, the identification of definitive susceptibility genes for these etiologically complex disorders remains elusive. The authors report a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Tourette's syndrome and OCD. Method: The authors conducted a GWAS in 2,723 cases (1,310 with OCD, 834 with Tourette's syndrome, 579 with OCD plus Tourette's syndrome/chronic tics), 5,667 ancestry-matched controls, and 290 OCD parent-child trios. GWAS summary statistics were examined for enrichment of functional variants associated with gene expression levels in brain regions. Polygenic score analyses were conducted to investigate the genetic architecture within and across the two disorders. Results: Although no individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) achieved genome-wide significance, the GWAS signals were enriched for SNPs strongly associated with variations in brain gene expression levels (expression quantitative loci, or eQTLs), suggesting the presence of true functional variants that contribute to risk of these disorders Polygenic score analyses identified a significant polygenic component for OCD (p=2x10(-4)), predicting 3.2% of the phenotypic variance in an independent data set. In contrast, Tourette's syndrome had a smaller, nonsignificant polygenic component, predicting only 0.6% of the phenotypic variance (p=0.06). No significant polygenic signal was detected across the two disorders, although the sample is likely underpowered to detect a modest shared signal. Furthermore, the OCD polygenic signal was significantly attenuated when cases with both OCD and co-occurring Tourette's syndrome/chronic tics were included in the analysis (p=0.01). Conclusions: Previous work has shown that Tourette's syndrome and OCD have some degree of shared genetic variation. However, the data from this study suggest that there are also distinct components to the genetic architectures of these two disorders. Furthermore, OCD with co-occurring burette's syndrome/chronic tics may have different underlying genetic susceptibility compared with OCD alone.

Contaminant-associated disruptions to animal behavior and reproduction, both of which are regulated by the nervous system, provide decision makers with compelling evidence of harm, but such apical endpoints are of limited predictive or harm-preventative value. Neurochemical biomarkers, which may be used to indicate subtle changes at the subcellular level, may help overcome these limitations. Neurochemical biomarkers have been used for decades in the human health sciences and are now gaining increased attention in the environmental realm. In the present review, the applications and implications of neurochemical biomarkers to the field of ecotoxicology are discussed. The review provides a brief introduction to neurochemistry, covers neurochemical-based adverse outcome pathways, discusses pertinent strengths and limitations of neurochemical biomarkers, and provides selected examples across invertebrate and vertebrate taxa (worms, bivalves, fish, terrestrial and marine mammals, and birds) to document contaminant-associated neurochemical disruption. With continued research and development, neurochemical biomarkers may increase understanding of the mechanisms that underlie injury to ecological organisms, complement other measures of neurological health, and be integrated into risk assessment practices.

De Novo Mutations in the Motor Domain of KIF1A Cause Cognitive Impairment, Spastic Paraparesis, Axonal Neuropathy, and Cerebellar Atrophy	HUMAN MUTATION			English	Article						KIF1A; intellectual disability; spastic paraparesis; axonal neuropathy; de novo mutations	SUPERFAMILY PROTEIN KIF1A; MISSENSE MUTATIONS; SYNAPTIC VESICLES; LIPRIN-ALPHA; KINESIN; TRANSPORT; DIMERIZATION; ACTIVATION; DIAGNOSIS; LOOPS	KIF1A is a neuron-specific motor protein that plays important roles in cargo transport along neurites. Recessive mutations in KIF1A were previously described in families with spastic paraparesis or sensory and autonomic neuropathy type-2. Here, we report 11 heterozygous de novo missense mutations (p.S58L, p.T99M, p.G102D, p.V144F, p.R167C, p.A202P, p.S215R, p.R216P, p.L249Q, p.E253K, and p.R316W) in KIF1A in 14 individuals, including two monozygotic twins. Two mutations (p.T99M and p.E253K) were recurrent, each being found in unrelated cases. All these de novo mutations are located in the motor domain (MD) of KIF1A. Structural modeling revealed that they alter conserved residues that are critical for the structure and function of the MD. Transfection studies suggested that at least five of these mutations affect the transport of the MD along axons. Individuals with de novo mutations in KIF1A display a phenotype characterized by cognitive impairment and variable presence of cerebellar atrophy, spastic paraparesis, optic nerve atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and epilepsy. Our findings thus indicate that de novo missense mutations in the MD of KIF1A cause a phenotype that overlaps with, while being more severe, than that associated with recessive mutations in the same gene.

A higher feeding innovation rate has previously been reported in habitat generalist birds from North America. By allowing them to exploit new resources, this higher feeding innovation rate might explain the generalists' advantage. This result might be due to generalists being more likely to find new resources because they are exposed to more diverse environmental conditions. Alternatively, they might differ from specialists in other traits, in particular cognitive skills that might allow them to innovate more complex food searching and handling techniques. To test these hypotheses, we separated avian feeding innovations into a technical' (novel searching and handling behaviour) and a food type' (incorporation of a new food in a species' diet) category. Technical innovations, but not food type innovations, have previously been shown to correlate with avian brain size, suggesting they reflect cognitive ability. We used a world-wide data base of 2339 feeding innovations recorded in the literature, covering a total of 765 avian species and assessed the correlations between brain size and feeding innovation rates on one side and habitat and diet generalism on the other. Habitat generalism was positively related with food type innovation rate, but not technical innovation rate or brain size. This suggests that habitat generalist species are more likely to incorporate new food types in their diet because of higher chances to find new food resources in their environment, or of a higher opportunism, but not enhanced cognitive skills. In contrast, diet generalist species had higher food type and technical innovation rates, as well as larger brains, suggesting that cognitive skills might help species expand their diet breadth or that an increase in diet breadth might favour the evolution of enhanced cognitive abilities. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the generalists' advantage in the face of environmental changes, and suggest that dietary and habitat generalism are different, but convergent, routes to feeding flexibility and adaptation to changed environments.

To gain insight how this lesion influences the motor outcome and responds to rehabilitative training, we used circumscribed photothrombotic capsular infarct models on 36 Sprague-Dawley rats (24 experimental and 12 sham-operated). We used 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]-fluoro-D-glucose-micro positron emission tomography (FDG-microPET) to assess longitudinal changes in resting-state brain activity (rs-BA) and daily single-pellet reaching task (SPRT) trainings to evaluate motor recovery. Longitudinal FDG-microPET results showed that capsular infarct resulted in a persistent decrease in rs-BA in bilateral sensory and auditory cortices, and ipsilesional motor cortex, thalamus, and inferior colliculus (P < 0.0025, false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05). The decreased rs-BA is compatible with diaschisis and contributes to manifest the malfunctions of lesion-specific functional connectivity. In contrast, capsular infarct resulted in increase of rs-BA in the ipsilesional internal capsule, and contralesional red nucleus and ventral hippocampus in recovery group (P < 0.0025, FDR q < 0.05), implying that remaining subcortical structures have an important role in conducting the recovery process in capsular infarct. The SPRT training facilitated motor recovery only in rats with an incomplete destruction of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) (Pearson's correlation, P < 0.05). Alternative therapeutic interventions are required to enhance the potential for recovery in capsular infarct with complete destruction of PLIC.

Exposures to adversity during the prenatal period, including prenatal depression, can influence the development of dysregulation, and a number of candidate genes have been suggested as moderators of prenatal exposure, including polymorphisms in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). We examined whether prenatal depression and child 5-HTTLPR interact to predict childhood dysregulation. MethodSample of N=213 mother-child pairs from the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) project. Mothers reported the IBQ-R at 3 and 6months, and the ECBQ at 18 and 36months, from which measures of dysregulation were extracted. Mothers' self-reported symptoms of depression on the CES-D at 24-36weeks of gestation, and at 6, 12, 24 and 36months postnatal. 5-HTTLPR genotype was extracted from buccal swabs. Mixed-model and confirmatory analyses were conducted. ResultsPrenatal depression and 5-HTTLPR interacted to predict dysregulation from 3 to 36months, within a model of strong differential susceptibility. ConclusionChildren with S or L-G alleles, when exposed to prenatal depression, have higher levels of dysregulation, and when exposed to lower or little prenatal depression, have higher capacity for regulation. Our findings support efforts to identify, support and treat prenatal depression.

The aim of this study was to explore how radiological features observed in CF reflect the clinical picture and mechanism of injury in such cases. METHODS Radiological data for patients with skull base fracture admitted to the Montreal General Hospital between February 2002 and October 2012 were obtained from the Quebec Trauma Registry and reviewed for CF. Identified CF was categorized by orientation and quality. Injury mechanism, clinical presentation, and follow-up outcome were obtained through retrospective chart review. RESULTS Of the 1738 patients with skull base fractures, 65 exhibited CF, representing 1.2% of the 5416 patients with traumatic brain injuries admitted during the period studied. Thirty-nine (60%) of the 65 CFs were obliquely oriented, 17 (26.2%) were longitudinal, and 9 (14%) were transverse. Twenty-nine (45%) of the 65 patients demonstrated linear fracture, 17 (26%) hairline, 10(15%) diastatic, and 9 (14%) displaced. Cranial nerve deficits and vascular injury occurred in 18.8% and 7.7% of cases, respectively. Twenty-five patients (38.5%) died in hospital. The long-term Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score was significantly lower in transverse compared with longitudinal and oblique fractures (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively) and lower in diastatic compared with displaced fractures (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study provides information on the largest CF population studied to date, expands the current CF classification to include fracture quality as well as orientatidn, and underscores the existence of significant differences in pathogenesis and clinical presentation of CF subtypes.

In view of this, an emphasis has been placed on understanding how iGluRs activate and desensitize in functional and structural terms. Early structural models of iGluRs suggested that the strength of the agonist response was primarily governed by the degree of closure induced in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). However, recent studies have suggested a more nuanced role for the LBD with current evidence identifying the iGluR LBD interface as a hotspot regulating agonist behaviour. Such ideas remain to be consolidated with recently solved structures of full-length iGluRs to account for the global changes that underlie channel activation and desensitization.	[Dawe, G.

If not accounted for, frequency and phase drifts will result in artifactual broadening of spectral peaks, distortion of spectral lineshapes, and a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present herein a new method for estimating and correcting frequency and phase drifts in in vivo MRS data. MethodsWe used a simple method of fitting each spectral average to a reference scan (often the first average in the series) in the time domain through adjustment of frequency and phase terms. Due to the similarity with image registration, this method is referred to as spectral registration. Using simulated data with known frequency and phase drifts, the performance of spectral registration was compared with two existing methods at various SNR levels. ResultsSpectral registration performed well in comparison with the other methods tested in terms of both frequency and phase drift estimation. ConclusionsSpectral registration provides an effective method for frequency and phase drift correction. It does not involve the collection of navigator echoes, and does not rely on any specific resonances, such as residual water or creatine, making it highly versatile. Magn Reson Med 73:44-50, 2015.

This study was conducted to investigate sources of this discrepancy through correlation of volumetric and cortical thickness (CT) neuroimaging values with performance and questionnaire measures of working memory (WM). Methods: Using longitudinal data from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development (Volumes, N = 347, 54.3% female; CT, N = 350, 54.6% female; age range: 6 to 16.9 years), scores on the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) WM, Emotional Control (EC) and Inhibition (INH) scales; Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children-III Digit Span; and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Battery Spatial Working Memory (CANTAB SWM) were correlated with each other and with morphometric measurements using mixed effects linear regression models. Results: BRIEF WM was correlated with CANTAB SWM (p < .001). With whole brain correction, BRIEF WM and EC were both correlated with CT of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), EC on the right side only. Performance measures of WM were unrelated to lobar volumes or CT, but were associated with volumes of hippocampus and amygdala. Conclusions: The known role of PHG in contextual learning suggests that the BRIEF WM assesses contextualized learning/memory, potentially explaining its loose correspondence to the decontextualized performance measures. Observational measures can be useful and valid functional metrics, complementing performance measures. Labels used to characterize scales should be interpreted with caution, however.

Development of a whole arm wearable robotic exoskeleton for rehabilitation and to assist upper limb movements	ROBOTICA			English	Article						Robotic exoskeleton; Nonlinear control; Physical disability; Passive rehabilitation; Upper limb impairment	STROKE THERAPY; DESIGN; SYSTEM; NEUROREHABILITATION; RECOVERY; MOTION	To assist physically disabled people with impaired upper limb function, we have developed a new 7-DOF exoskeleton-type robot named Motion Assistive Robotic-Exoskeleton for Superior Extremity (ETS-MARSE) to ease daily upper limb movements and to provide effective rehabilitation therapy to the superior extremity. The ETS-MARSE comprises a shoulder motion support part, an elbow and forearm motion support part, and a wrist motion support part. It is designed to be worn on the lateral side of the upper limb in order to provide naturalistic movements of the shoulder (vertical and horizontal flexion/extension and internal/external rotation), elbow (flexion/extension), forearm (pronation/supination), and wrist joint (radial/ulnar deviation and flexion/extension). This paper focuses on the modeling, design, development, and control of the ETS-MARSE. Experiments were carried out with healthy male human subjects in whom trajectory tracking in the form of passive rehabilitation exercises (i.e., pre-programmed trajectories recommended by a therapist/clinician) were carried out. Experimental results show that the ETS-MARSE can efficiently perform passive rehabilitation therapy.	[Rahman, M. H.; Rahman, M. J.; Cristobal, O. L.; Saad, M.; Kenne, J.

Identifying ligand-specific signalling within biased responses: focus on delta opioid receptor ligands	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						opioid receptor; bias; regulation; operational model; functional selectivity	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; NEUROBLASTOMA-CELL-LINE; SK-N-BE; BETA(2) ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; HETEROTRIMERIC G-PROTEINS; FUNCTIONAL SELECTIVITY; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; INTRACELLULAR DOMAINS; DIRECTED TRAFFICKING; ALKALOID AGONISTS	Opioids activate GPCRs to produce powerful analgesic actions but at the same time induce side effects and generate tolerance, which restrict their clinical use. Reducing this undesired response profile has remained a major goal of opioid research and the notion of biased agonism' is raising increasing interest as a means of separating therapeutic responses from unwanted side effects. However, to fully exploit this opportunity, it is necessary to confidently identify biased signals and evaluate which type of bias may support analgesia and which may lead to undesired effects. The development of new computational tools has made it possible to quantify ligand-dependent signalling and discriminate this component from confounders that may also yield biased responses. Here, we analyse different approaches to identify and quantify ligand-dependent bias and review different types of confounders. Focus is on opioid receptor ligands, which are currently viewed as promising agents for chronic pain management.

First, all patients with heart failure and anemia should be investigated for reversible causes of anemia. Second, patients with chronic stable heart failure should undergo natriuretic peptide testing. Third, considerations should be given to treat selected patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and to treat patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction with an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, when the drug is approved. As with updates in previous years, the topics were chosen in response to stakeholder feedback. The 2014 Update includes recommendations, values and preferences, and practical tips to assist the clinicians and health care workers to best manage patients with heart failure.

Mutations in MFSD8, Encoding a Lysosomal Membrane Protein, Are Associated with Nonsyndromic Autosomal Recessive Macular Dystrophy	OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY; NEURONAL CEROID-LIPOFUSCINOSIS; LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS; STATIONARY NIGHT BLINDNESS; RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; RETINAL DEGENERATION; MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS; PROGRESSIVE CONE; GENE; DISEASE	Purpose: This study aimed to identify the genetic defects in 2 families with autosomal recessive macular dystrophy with central cone involvement. Design: Case series. Participants: Two families and a cohort of 244 individuals with various inherited maculopathies and cone disorders. Methods: Genome-wide linkage analysis and exome sequencing were performed in 1 large family with 5 affected individuals. In addition, exome sequencing was performed in the proband of a second family. Subsequent analysis of the identified mutations in 244 patients was performed by Sanger sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion. The medical history of individuals carrying the MFSD8 variants was reviewed and additional ophthalmic examinations were performed, including electroretinography (ERG), multifocal ERG (mfERG), perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence, and fundus photography. Main Outcome Measures: MFSD8 variants, age at diagnosis, visual acuity, fundus appearance, color vision defects, visual field, ERG, mfERG, fundus autofluorescence, and OCT findings. Results: Compound heterozygous variants in MFSD8, a gene encoding a lysosomal transmembrane protein, were identified in 2 families with macular dystrophy with a normal or subnormal ERG, but reduced mfERG. In both families, a heterozygous missense variant p.Glu336Gln was identified, which was predicted to have a mild effect on the protein. In the first family, a protein-truncating variant (p.Glu381*) was identified on the other allele, and in the second family, a variant (c.1102G>C) was identified that results in a splicing defect leading to skipping of exon 11 (p.Lys333Lysfs*3). The p.Glu336Gln allele was found to be significantly enriched in patients with maculopathies and cone disorders (6/488) compared with ethnically matched controls (35/18 682; P < 0.0001), suggesting that it may act as a genetic modifier. Conclusions: In this study, we identified variants in MFSD8 as a novel cause of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive macular dystrophy with central cone involvement. Affected individuals showed no neurologic features typical for variant late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (vLINCL), a severe and devastating multisystem lysosomal storage disease previously associated with mutations in MFSD8. We propose a genotype-phenotype model in which a combination of a severe and a mild variant cause nonsyndromic macular dystrophy with central cone involvement, and 2 severe mutations cause vLINCL.

Subsequently, UII was characterized in tetrapods including humans. Phylogenetic studies and synteny analysis indicate that UII and its paralogous peptide urotensin II-related peptide (URP) belong to the somatostatin/cortistatin superfamily. In mammals, the UII and URP genes are primarily expressed in cholinergic neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. UII and URP mRNAs are also present in various organs notably in the cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine systems. UII and URP activate a common G protein-coupled receptor, called UT, that exhibits relatively high sequence identity with somatostatin, opioid, and galanin receptors. The UT gene is widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral tissues including the retina, heart, vascular bed, lung, kidney, adrenal medulla, and skeletal muscle. Structure-activity relationship studies and NMR conformational analysis have led to the rational design of a number of peptidic and nonpeptidic UT agonists and antagonists. Consistent with the wide distribution of UT, UII has now been shown to exert a large array of biologic activities, in particular in the CNS, the cardiovascular system, and the kidney. Here, we review the current knowledge concerning the pleiotropic actions of UII and discusses the possible use of antagonists for future therapeutic applications.

How the 'message' encoded in carbohydrate 'letters' is 'read' and 'translated' can only be unraveled by interdisciplinary efforts. Scope of review: This review provides a didactic step-by-step survey of the concept of the sugar code and the way strategic combination of experimental approaches characterizes structure function relationships, with resources for teaching. Major conclusions: The unsurpassed coding capacity of glycans is an ideal platform for generating a broad range of molecular 'messages'. Structural and functional analyses of complex carbohydrates have been made possible by advances in chemical synthesis, rendering production of oligosaccharides, glycoclusters and neoglycoconjugates possible. This availability facilitates to test the glycans as ligands for natural sugar receptors (lectins). Their interaction is a means to turn sugar-encoded information into cellular effects. Glycan/lectin structures and their spatial modes of presentation underlie the exquisite specificity of the endogenous lectins in counterreceptor selection, that is, to home in on certain cellular glycoproteins or glycolipids.

Fabrication of injectable, cellular, anisotropic collagen tissue equivalents with modular fibrillar densities	BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						Dense collagen; Injectable; Anisotropic; Nerve; Mineralization; Osteoid	MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; PLASTIC COMPRESSION; IN-VITRO; FUNCTIONAL REPLACEMENT; HYBRID GELS; MINERALIZATION; BONE; SCAFFOLDS; MATRICES; ALIGNMENT	Technological improvements in collagen gel fabrication are highly desirable as they may enable significant advances in the formation of tissue-equivalent biomaterials for regenerative medicine, three-dimensional (3D) in vitro tissue models, and injectable scaffolds for cell and drug delivery applications. Thus, strategies to modulate collagen gel fibrillar density and organization in the mesostructure have been pursued to fabricate collagenous matrices with extracellular matrix-like features. Herein, we introduce a robust and simple method, namely gel aspiration-ejection (GAE), to engineer 3D, anisotropic, cell seeded, injectable dense collagen (I-DC) gels with controllable fibrillar densities, without the use of crosslinking. GAE allows for the hybridization of collagen gels with bioactive agents for increased functionality and supports highly aligned homogenous cell seeding, thus providing I-DC gels with distinct properties when compared to isotropic DC gels of random fibrillar orientation. The hybridization of I-DC with anionic fibroin derived polypeptides resulted in the nucleation of carbonated hydroxyapatite within the aligned nanofibrillar network upon exposure to simulated body fluid, yielding a 3D, anisotropic, mineralized collagen matrix. In addition, I-DC gels accelerated the osteoblastic differentiation of seeded murine mesenchymal stem cells (m-MSCs) when exposed to osteogenic supplements, which resulted in the cell-mediated, bulk mineralization of the osteoid-like gels. In addition, and upon exposure to neuronal transdifferentiation medium, I-DC gels supported and accelerated the differentiation of m-MSCs toward neuronal cells. In conclusion, collagen GAE presents interesting opportunities in a number of fields spanning tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to drug and cell delivery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the neural events occurring during emotional processing remain imprecise due to the limited combination of spatial and temporal resolution provided by these techniques. This study examines the modulations of high-frequency activity of intracranial electroencephalography recordings associated with affective picture valence, in epileptic patients awaiting neurosurgery. Recordings were obtained from subdural grids and depth electrodes in eight patients while they viewed a series of unpleasant, pleasant and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Broadband high-gamma (70-150 Hz) power was computed for separate 100-ms time windows and compared according to ratings of emotional valence. Compared to emotionally neutral or pleasant pictures, unpleasant stimuli were associated with an early and long-lasting (approximate to 200-1,000 ms) bilateral increase in high-gamma activity in visual areas of the occipital and temporal lobes, together with a late and transient (approximate to 500-800 ms) decrease found bilaterally in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Pleasant pictures were associated with increased gamma activity in the occipital cortex, compared to the emotionally neutral stimuli. Consistent with previous studies, our results provide direct evidence of emotion-related modulations in the visual ventral pathway during picture processing. Results in the lateral PFC also shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying its role in negative emotions processing. This study demonstrates the utility of intracranial high-gamma modulations to study emotional process with a high spatiotemporal precision. Hum Brain Mapp, 36:16-28, 2015..

A DTI-Based Tractography Study of Effects on Brain Structure Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure in Newborns	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						diffusion tensor imaging; tractography; prenatal alcohol exposure; newborns; white matter	MYELIN BASIC-PROTEIN; WHITE-MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; YOUNG-ADULTS; DIFFUSION; CHILDREN; MATURATION; CHILDHOOD; MRI; EXPRESSION	Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to have severe, long-term consequences for brain and behavioral development already detectable in infancy and childhood. Resulting features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders include cognitive and behavioral effects, as well as facial anomalies and growth deficits. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography were used to analyze white matter (WM) development in 11 newborns (age since conception <45 weeks) whose mothers were recruited during pregnancy. Comparisons were made with nine age-matched controls born to abstainers or light drinkers from the same Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community near Cape Town, South Africa. DTI parameters, T1 relaxation time, proton density and volumes were used to quantify and investigate group differences in WM in the newborn brains. Probabilistic tractography was used to estimate and to delineate similar tract locations among the subjects for transcallosal pathways, cortico-spinal projection fibers, and cortico-cortical association fibers. In each of these WM networks, the axial diffusivity was the parameter that showed the strongest association with maternal drinking. The strongest relations were observed in medial and inferior WM, regions in which the myelination process typically begins. In contrast to studies of older individuals with PAE, fractional anisotropy did not exhibit a consistent and significant relation with alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first DTI-tractography study of prenatally alcohol exposed newborns. Hum Brain Mapp, 36:170-186, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In 15-25% of cases, PCS persists beyond the usual 3-month recovery period, interfering with activities of daily living and responding poorly to pharmacotherapy. We tested the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for alleviating PCS. Fifteen eligible patients with mTBI and PCS>3 months postinjury consented to 20 sessions of rTMS (20x5-sec trains; 10 Hz at 110% threshold), with clinical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments before and after intervention and clinical assessment at 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were tolerability, safety, and efficacy, as measured with the PCS Scale. Secondary outcomes included the Cognitive Symptoms Questionnaire, neuropsychological test performance, and working memory task-associated activity as assessed with fMRI. Twelve patients completed all sessions. Three withdrew because of worsening symptoms or for an unrelated event. Stimulation intensity was increased gradually across sessions, and all subjects tolerated the protocol by the sixth session. Commonly reported side effects among completers were increased headache (n=3) and greater sleep disturbance (n=3). Participants also reported positive outcomes such as less sleep disturbance (n=3), and better mental focus (n=3). On average, PCS scores declined by 14.6 points (p=0.009) and fMRI task-related activation peaks in the DLPFC increased after rTMS. rTMS is safe, tolerated by most patients with mTBI, and associated with both a reduction in severity of PCS and an increase in task-related activations in DLPFC. Assessment of this intervention in a randomized, control trial is warranted.

Novel Uroflow Stop Test at Time of Catheter Removal Is a Strong Predictor of Early Urinary Continence Recovery Following Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Study	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						catheter removal; predictors; recovery of incontinence; Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy; urine incontinence	FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; EARLY RETURN; RHABDOSPHINCTER; RESTORATION; IMPACT	Aim To study whether the ability to completely stop urinary flow during voiding at time of catheter removal, measured objectively using uroflowmetry, can predict early recovery of urine continence following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Materials and Methods In this pilot study, 108 patients with a minimum of 2 years follow-up, operated by a single surgeon (AEH) were subjected to an uroflowmetry at the time of urethral catheter removal following RARP. Normal Saline (150ml) was instilled intravesically prior to catheter removal and patients were instructed to attempt to stop urine flow during voiding in uroflowmeter. Two groups were studied, group one with positive Stop Test (n=80) and group two with negative Stop Test (n=28). Covariates included age, BMI, IPSS score, PSA, tumor stage, prostate volume, nerve sparing status, and estimated blood loss. Results Basic characteristics were not statistically different between both groups. Early continence recovery was significantly higher in group one. Pad-free continence rates in group one and two at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were 62% vs. 7% (P<0.001), 85% vs. 28% (P<0.001), 93% vs. 67% (P 0.001), 93% vs. 82% (P 0.079), 97% vs. 82% (P 0.006), and 97% vs. 85% (P 0.023), respectively. Uroflow Stop Test was the only independent predictor of early urine continence recovery on univariate and multivariate regression analysis [OR 2.87 (95%CI 1.34-4.38, P=<0.001)]. Conclusion Novel use of uroflowmetry at time of urethral catheter removal is a simple, non-invasive study with independent ability to predict early continence recovery following RARP. Neurourol.
