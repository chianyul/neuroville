The enhanced pronociceptive actions of spinal pain-related molecules such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) may underlie this phenomenon and could be a promising target for intervention. We demonstrate here how CGRP regulates the development of morphine analgesic tolerance at the spinal level. A 7-day treatment with morphine led to tolerance to its analgesic effects and enhanced expression of CGRP and its receptor subunits calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). Activation of several cell-type-specific kinase transcription factor cascades is required to mediate this tolerance, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in neurons, p38 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) in microglia and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3 (Stat1/3) in astrocytes, because inhibitors of CaMKII, p38 and ERK pathways correspondingly reduced the increases in phosphorylated CREB, acetylated-NF kappa B and phosphorylated Stat1/3 levels and attenuated the development of tolerance. Interestingly, these cascades were linked to the regulation of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression. Chronic morphine-induced behavioural responses and biochemical events were all subjugated to modulation by disrupting CGRP receptor signaling. Together, these data suggest that CGRP contributes to the development of tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia by regulating the activation of the neuronal CaMKII-CREB, microglial p38-NF kappa B and astroglial ERK-Stat1/3 cascades. Targeting CGRP-associated signaling molecules may prolong or restore morphine's analgesic properties upon a chronic exposure. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.

To improve our understanding of brain functioning aft er sports-related concussion, advanced functional assessment techniques, namely event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have been recently used in research studies. Contrary to neuropsychological tests that measure verbal and/or motor responses, ERPs and fMRI assess the neural activities associated with cognitive/behavioral demands, and thus provide access to better comprehension of brain functioning. In fact, ERPs have excellent temporal resolution, and fMRI identifies the involved structures during a task. This article describes ERP and fMRI techniques and reviews the results obtained with these tools in sports-related concussion. Although these techniques are not yet readily available, they off er a unique clinical approach, particularly for complex cases (ie, athletes with multiple concussions, chronic symptoms) and objective measures that provide valuable information to guide management and return-to-play decision making.

Modulatory effects of stress on reactivated emotional memories	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Emotional memory; Stress; Stress hormones; Memory retrieval; Memory reactivation; Post-traumatic stress disorder	HEALTHY-YOUNG MEN; TERM DECLARATIVE MEMORY; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; CORTISOL TREATMENT; EPISODIC MEMORIES; LEARNING STRESS; ENHANCED MEMORY; FEAR MEMORY; RAT-BRAIN; RETRIEVAL	Previous studies have shown that stress, through secretion of stress hormones, increases the consolidation of memory while it exerts negative effects on memory retrieval. Other studies show that the process of memory retrieval serves as a reactivation mechanism whereby the memory trace that is reactivated during the retrieval process is once again sensitive to modifications by pharmacological or environmental manipulations. In this study, we assessed whether exposure to stress after retrieval of neutral and emotional information modulates the immediate and long-term recall of these reactivated memory traces. Three groups of participants (total N of 47) encoded on Day 1 a movie containing neutral and emotional information. Two days later (Day 2), one group was asked to retrieve (reactivate) the story before being exposed to a stressful condition (reactivation/stress group), while the second group was asked to retrieve the story and was not exposed to a stressful condition (reactivation/no stress group). A third group did not recall the story but was exposed to a stressful condition (no reactivation/stress group). All participants were asked to recall the story immediately after exposure to the stress/no stress condition (immediate recall) as well as 5 days later (delayed recall). Results show that immediate recall of emotional information was significantly increased in the reactivation/stress group when compared to the reactivation/no stress group while no effect of stress on reactivated neutral memories was found. Moreover, evidence suggests that the enhanced memory trace is maintained across time, suggesting a potential long-lasting effect of stress on reactivated memory traces. We also found that the enhanced emotional memory trace observed in the reactivation/stress group was not present in the no reactivation/stress group, showing that stress has the capacity to enhance memory only when the memory trace is acutely reactivated before exposure to stress. Altogether, these results suggest that stress differentially modulates reactivated emotional and neutral memory traces and that this effect is long-lasting. These results have important implications for the potential influence of acute stress on reactivated memories in individuals exposed to traumatic events. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the authors explore the potential value of re-imaging at 3.0 T patients with refractory partial epilepsy and negative 1.5 T MRI. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients with refractory partial epilepsy candidate for surgery who had undergone a 3.0 T MR study after a negative 1.5 T MR study. High-field 3.0 T MRIs were reviewed qualitatively by neuroradiologists experienced in interpreting epilepsy studies with access to clinical information. Relevance and impact on clinical management were assessed by an epileptologist. Results: Between November 2006 and August 2009, 36 patients with refractory partial epilepsy candidate for surgery underwent 3.0 T MR study after a 1.5 T MR study failed to disclose a relevant epileptogenic lesion. A potential lesion was found only in two patients (5.6%, 95% CI: 1.5-18.1%). Both were found to have hippocampal atrophy congruent with other presurgical localization techniques which resulted in omission of an invasive EEG study and direct passage to surgery. Conclusions: The frequency of detection of a new lesion by re-imaging at 3.0 T patients with refractory partial epilepsy candidate for surgery was found to be low, but seems to offer the potential of a significant clinical impact for selected patients. This finding needs to be validated in a prospective controlled study. (C) 2010 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Systematic review. Objective. The objective of this systematic review was to identify the unique features associated with pediatric spinal cord injury (SCI) with the intention of determining the most effective spinal stabilization methods and identifying the optimum treatment for post-traumatic spinal deformity in pediatric patients with a SCI. Summary of Background Data. Spinal injuries occur in 1.99/100,000 children, 10% are under 15 years, 60% to 80% occur in the cervical spine, and 5.4% to 34% in the thoracolumbar spine. The most frequent incident of spinal injury (50%-56%) occurs during motor vehicle accidents. Methods. A systematic review of the English language literature explored articles published between 1950 and 2009. Electronic databases (Medline and Embase) and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify unique features of pediatric SCI based on 2 questions: (1) "What is the most effective means to achieve spinal stabilization in pediatric patients with a SCI?" and (2) "What is the most effective treatment of post-traumatic spinal deformities in pediatric patients with a SCI?" Three Spinal Trauma Study Group faculty members assessed the level of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria and disagreements were resolved by a modified Delphi consensus. Results. No Level 1 or 2 evidence articles were discovered. Question 1 was addressed by 417 abstracts; from those 15 were selected for inclusion. This literature proved to be controversial, mostly focused on the adult population, pediatric series were retrospective, and most treatments were based on adult experience. The evidence supporting stabilization of the spine in the pediatric SCI population is very low for both the cervical and thoracic spinal regions. Question 2 was discussed in 517 abstracts; 8 relevant articles were selected. The principal key points, regarding the most effective treatment of post-traumatic spinal deformity in the pediatric SCI patients, suggest that the deformity should be prevented before the age of 10 to 12 years, younger SCI patients are unfavorable, nearly 100% of patients with SCI will develop a deformity, and brace treatment is generally recommended. Current evidence in support of brace use is very low. Conclusion. Despite the lack of well-designed prospective studies to establish the efficacy of instrumentation in these cases, there remains very low evidence that supports the use of instrumentation in unstable pediatric spines to prevent neurologic injury and maintain spinal alignment. The very low evidence of benefits from early bracing clearly outweighs the risks and complications associated with its use. Close monitoring should be initiated early so as to delay surgical correction as late as possible. There is very low evidence to support the use of surgery for the treatment of deformity triggered by a SCI. There may be evidence suggesting that the correction techniques used for neuromuscular deformities are useful for SCI patients. In conclusion, there is a strong recommendation for the use of instrumentation in the unstable pediatric spinal injured population, and there is a strong recommendation for traditional neuromuscular spinal deformity treatment techniques to be adopted as a treatment of progressive spinal deformities after a neurologic injury.

These associations include the recognition of cholesterol transporters apolipoprotein E (APOE), APOC1 and APOJ as major genetic risk factors for common AD and observations associating risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high midlife plasma cholesterol, diabetes, stroke, obesity and hypertension to dementia. Moreover, recent clinical findings lend support to the notion that progressive deterioration of cholesterol homeostasis in AD is a central player in the disease pathophysiology and is, therefore, a potential therapeutic target for disease prevention.

METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients treated for a ruptured BBA of the internal carotid artery (ICA) at Hopital Notre-Dame from 2005-2009. Clinicoradiologic data and intraoperative videos were analyzed. Outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). RESULTS: This series includes 7 patients (4 women and 3 men) with a mean age of 44.7 (range 30-61). All patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Four angiograms were initially negative. Diameter of BBA ranged from 1.1-8.2 mm. No intraoperative or postoperative aneurysm rupture occurred in this series. Although angiograms showed expected mild stenosis of the ICA after clipping, no clinical or radiologic cerebral infarctions were observed. The outcome was favorable in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of BBA is essential for proper management. An appropriate neurosurgical strategy has enabled a significant reduction in perioperative aneurysm rupture compared with previous reports and obtains excellent functional results.

Maternal Care and DNA Methylation of a Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 1 Promoter in Rat Hippocampus	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EARLY ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR GENE-EXPRESSION; GENOMIC TARGET SITES; NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; INTRACELLULAR MEDIATORS	Parenting and the early environment influence the risk for various psychopathologies. Studies in the rat suggest that variations in maternal care stably influence DNA methylation, gene expression, and neural function in the offspring. Maternal care affects neural development, including the GABAergic system, the function of which is linked to the pathophysiology of diseases including schizophrenia and depression. Postmortem studies of human schizophrenic brains have revealed decreased forebrain expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) accompanied by increased methylation of a GAD1 promoter. We examined whether maternal care affects GAD1 promoter methylation in the hippocampus of adult male offspring of high and low pup licking/grooming (high-LG and low-LG) mothers. Compared with the offspring of low-LG mothers, those reared by high-LG dams showed enhanced hippocampal GAD1 mRNA expression, decreased cytosine methylation, and increased histone 3-lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) of the GAD1 promoter. DNA methyltransferase 1 expression was significantly higher in the offspring of low-compared with high-LG mothers. Pup LG increases hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and nerve growth factor-inducible factor A (NGFI-A) expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed enhanced NGFI-A association with and H3K9ac of the GAD1 promoter in the hippocampus of high-LG pups after a nursing bout. Treatment of hippocampal neuronal cultures with either 5-HT or an NGFI-A expression plasmid significantly increased GAD1 mRNA levels. The effect of 5-HT was blocked by a short interfering RNA targeting NGFI-A. These results suggest that maternal care influences the development of the GABA system by altering GAD1 promoter methylation levels through the maternally induced activation of NGFI-A and its association with the GAD1 promoter.

Recently, the gene implicated in CRD was identified. The diagnosis is often delayed because symptoms are nonspecific. Treatment and follow-up remain poorly defined. The aim of this paper is to provide guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of children with CRD based on a literature overview and two pediatric centers 'experience. The diagnosis is based on a history of chronic diarrhea with fat malabsorption and abnormal lipid profile. Upper endoscopy and histology reveal fat-laden enterocytes whereas vitamin E deficiency is invariably present. Creatine kinase (CK) is usually elevated and hepatic steatosis is common. Genotyping identifies the Sar1b gene mutation. Treatment should be aimed at preventing potential complications. Vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal distension improve on a low-long chain fat diet. Failure to thrive is one of the most common initial clinical findings. Neurological and ophthalmologic complications in CRD are less severe than in other types of familial hypocholesterolemia. However, the vitamin E deficiency status plays a pivotal role in preventing neurological complications. Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency is especially severe early in life. Recently, increased CK levels and cardiomyopathy have been described in addition to muscular manifestations. Poor mineralization and delayed bone maturation do occur. A moderate degree of macrovesicular steatosis is common, but no cases of steatohepatitis cirrhosis. Besides a low-long chain fat diet made up uniquely of polyunsaturated fatty acids, treatment includes fat-soluble vitamin supplements and large amounts of vitamin E. Despite fat malabsorption and the absence of postprandial chylomicrons, the oral route can prevent neurological complications even though serum levels of vitamin E remain chronically low. Dietary counseling is needed not only to monitor fat intake and improve symptoms, but also to maintain sufficient caloric and EFA intake. Despite a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CRD, the diagnosis and management of the disease remain a challenge for clinicians. The clinical guidelines proposed will helpfully lead to an earlier diagnosis and the prevention of complications.

But under some conditions, the two processes interact, as when selective attention is solicited, and/or when a link is established between consecutive stimuli. To assess these assumptions during perceptual face processing, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used while subjects discriminated either familiarity or expression in a task-switching paradigm. Switched trials were designed with competitor priming, the unattended dimension being previously attended. The results indicate interactions appearing in the right hemisphere during the perceptual encoding stage (N170) when subjects processed either familiarity or expression during switched trials. These interactions gain both hemispheres during memory retrieval (P2) and in terms of accuracy. Altogether, these results confirm the critical role of the right hemisphere in perceiving faces and their expressions. Moreover, they suggest that familiarity and expression can interact in both directions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, gender differences and hemispheric asymmetries in global and regional human cerebellum gray matter (GM) were estimated in an age-matched sample (n=112) of young Chinese adults. An optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in spatial unbiased infratentorial template (SUIT) space together with an automated atlas-based volumetric approach were performed for mapping regional gray matter (GM) gender-related differences across the entire cerebellum. The two methods provided consistent findings on gender differences. The cerebellar GM volume was significantly larger in the anterior and middle posterior lobes of male group. In addition, a trend of greater GM volume in lateral posterior lobe of female group was observed. With the created symmetric cerebellar template, the asymmetric properties of cerebellar hemisphere were also assessed by VBM analysis, showing rightward asymmetry distributed in most cerebellar lobules and leftwards asymmetry distributed in the lobules around the medial posterior lobe. Gender differences in males showed higher leftward asymmetry sparsely within a few lobules and lower rightward asymmetry mainly within lobule Crus II, as compared with females. The acquired detailed morphologic knowledge of normal human cerebellum could establish a baseline for comparison with pathologic changes in the cerebellum. Moreover, our results might help to address controversies in the study of sexual dimorphisms and asymmetric patterns in human cerebellum. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shiller, DM; Gracco, VL; Rvachew, S				Shiller, Douglas M.; Gracco, Vincent L.; Rvachew, Susan			Auditory-Motor Learning during Speech Production in 9-11-Year-Old Children	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; ACOUSTIC CHARACTERISTICS; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; DISORDERED CHILDREN; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; ARTIFICIAL PALATE; DYNAMIC MEASURES; VOCAL INTENSITY	Background: Hearing ability is essential for normal speech development, however the precise mechanisms linking auditory input and the improvement of speaking ability remain poorly understood. Auditory feedback during speech production is believed to play a critical role by providing the nervous system with information about speech outcomes that is used to learn and subsequently fine-tune speech motor output. Surprisingly, few studies have directly investigated such auditory-motor learning in the speech production of typically developing children. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we manipulated auditory feedback during speech production in a group of 9-11-year old children, as well as in adults. Following a period of speech practice under conditions of altered auditory feedback, compensatory changes in speech production and perception were examined. Consistent with prior studies, the adults exhibited compensatory changes in both their speech motor output and their perceptual representations of speech sound categories. The children exhibited compensatory changes in the motor domain, with a change in speech output that was similar in magnitude to that of the adults, however the children showed no reliable compensatory effect on their perceptual representations. Conclusions: The results indicate that 9-11-year-old children, whose speech motor and perceptual abilities are still not fully developed, are nonetheless capable of auditory-feedback-based sensorimotor adaptation, supporting a role for such learning processes in speech motor development. Auditory feedback may play a more limited role, however, in the fine-tuning of children's perceptual representations of speech sound categories.

It has been suggested that resveratrol could exert its protective action by acting on specific plasma membrane polyphenol binding sites (Han Y. S., et al. (2006) J Pharmacol Exp Ther 318: 238-245). The purpose of this study was to investigate, in human skin, the possible existence of specific binding sites that mediate the protective action of resveratrol. Methods and Findings: Using human skin tissue, we report here the presence of specific [(3)H]-resveratrol binding sites (K(D) = 180 nM) that are mainly located in the epidermis. Exposure of HaCaT cells to the nitric oxide free radical donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.3-3 mM) resulted in cell death which was reduced by resveratrol (EC(50) = 14.7 mu M), and to a much lesser extent by the resveratrol analogue piceatannol (EC(50) = 95 mu M) and epigallocatechin gallate (EC(50) = 200 mu M), a green-tea derived polyphenol. The protective action of resveratrol likely relates to its anti-apoptotic effect since at the same range of concentration it was able to reduce both the number of apoptotic cells as well as mitochondrial apoptotic events triggered by SNP. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggest that resveratrol, by acting on specific polyphenol binding sites in epidermis, may be useful to prevent skin disorders associated with aging.

Using DNA microarray, we demonstrated the overexpression of quinone reductase 2 (QR2) in the hippocampus in two models of learning deficits, namely the aged memory impaired rats and the scopolamine-induced amnesia model. QR2 is a cytosolic flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of its substrate and enhances the production of damaging activated quinone and ROS. QR2-like immunostaining is enriched in cerebral structures associated with learning behaviors, such as the hippocampal formation and the temporofrontal cortex of rat, mouse, and human brains. In cultured rat embryonic hippocampal neurons, selective inhibitors of QR2, namely S26695 and S29434, protected against menadione-induced cell death by reversing its proapoptotic action. S26695 (8 mg/kg) also significantly inhibited scopolamine-induced amnesia. Interestingly, adult QR2 knock-out mice demonstrated enhanced learning abilities in various tasks, including Morris water maze, object recognition, and rotarod performance test. Other behaviors related to anxiety (elevated plus maze), depression (forced swim), and schizophrenia (prepulse inhibition) were not affected in QR2-deficient mice. Together, these data suggest a role for QR2 in cognitive behaviors with QR2 inhibitors possibly representing a novel therapeutic strategy toward the treatment of learning deficits especially observed in the aged brain.

We performed a prospective controlled study to evaluate if the DTI parameters tract volume (TV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients with acute subcortical infarcts are correlated with permanent PT damage and clinical outcome after 6 months. Methods: We acquired DTI in 18 stroke patients with subcortical ischemic infarcts either affecting the PT (PT group, n = 12) or not (non-PT group, n = 6) and in 7 age-and risk factor-matched controls at median times of 12 and 180 days. The PT was isolated using tractography and tract volume ratios (R TV) and FA ratios (R FA) were calculated (affected tract/unaffected tract). Ratios were compared within and between groups at initial and follow-up time points, as well as in tract portions above and below the infarcts, and were correlated to Rivermead Motor Function Test (RMFT) scores. Results: Mean R FA and R TV of the PT group were smaller than those of both non-PT and control groups initially and at follow-up (p < 0.01). Tract portions above the infarct had lower R TV than below (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in R FA and R TV over time for the whole tract or tract portions. R FA and R TV both were highly correlated with initial and follow-up RMFT scores. Conclusions: DTI parameters of PT integrity acquired within the first weeks after acute subcortical stroke measure permanent ischemic PT damage and are highly correlated with residual motor function in the acute and chronic stage.

Herein, we investigate HCV infectivity and effects on neuronal survival and neuroinflammation in conjunction with HIV infection. Methodology: Human microglia, astrocyte and neuron cultures were infected with cell culture-derived HCV or exposed to HCV core protein with or without HIV-1 infection or HIV-1 Viral Protein R (Vpr) exposure. Host immune gene expression and cell viability were measured. Patch-clamp studies of human neurons were performed in the presence or absence of HCV core protein. Neurobehavioral performance and neuropathology were examined in HIV-1 Vpr-transgenic mice in which stereotaxic intrastriatal implants of HCV core protein were performed. Principal Findings: HCV-encoded RNA as well as HCV core and non-structural 3 (NS3) proteins were detectable in human microglia and astrocytes infected with HCV. HCV core protein exposure induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in microglia (p<0.05) but not in astrocytes while increased chemokine (e. g. CXCL10 and interleukin-8) expression was observed in both microglia and astrocytes (p<0.05). HCV core protein modulated neuronal membrane currents and reduced both beta-III-tubulin and lipidated LC3-II expression (p<0.05). Neurons exposed to supernatants from HCV core-activated microglia exhibited reduced b-III-tubulin expression (p<0.05). HCV core protein neurotoxicity and interleukin-6 induction were potentiated by HIV-1 Vpr protein (p<0.05). HIV-1 Vpr transgenic mice implanted with HCV core protein showed gliosis, reduced neuronal counts together with diminished LC3 immunoreactivity. HCV core-implanted animals displayed neurobehavioral deficits at days 7 and 14 post-implantation (p<0.05). Conclusions: HCV core protein exposure caused neuronal injury through suppression of neuronal autophagy in addition to neuroimmune activation. The additive neurotoxic effects of HCV- and HIV-encoded proteins highlight extrahepatic mechanisms by which HCV infection worsens the disease course of HIV infection.

BrunoL1 regulates endoderm proliferation through translational enhancement of cyclin A2 mRNA	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Xenopus; Pancreas; Proliferation; Endoderm; RNA binding protein; BrunoL1; Cyclin A2; Translational enhancement	INDUCED NEURAL TISSUE; BINDING-PROTEIN; PANCREAS DEVELOPMENT; XENOPUS EMBRYOS; GENE-EXPRESSION; CELL-CYCLE; EDEN-BP; LIVER; DIFFERENTIATION; SPECIFICATION	Developmental control of proliferation relies on tight regulation of protein expression. Although this has been well studied in early embryogenesis, how the cell cycle is regulated during organogenesis is not well understood. Bruno-Like RNA binding proteins bind to consensus sequences in the 3'UTR of specific mRNAs and repress protein translation, but much of this functional information is derived from studies on mainly two members, Drosophila Bruno and vertebrate BrunoL2 (CUGBP1). There are however, six vertebrate and three Drosophila Bruno family members, but less is known about these other family members, and none have been shown to function in the endoderm. We recently identified BrunoL1 as a dorsal pancreas enriched gene, and in this paper we define BrunoL1 function in Xenopus endoderm development. We find that, in contrast to other Bruno-Like proteins, BrunoL1 acts to enhance rather than repress translation. We demonstrate that BrunoL1 regulates proliferation of endoderm cells through translational control of cyclin A2 mRNA. Specifically BrunoL1 enhanced translation of cyclin A2 through binding consensus Bruno Response Elements (BREs) in its 3'UTR. We compared the ability of other Bruno-Like proteins, both vertebrate and invertebrate, to stimulate translation via the cyclin A2 3'UTR and found that only Drosophila Bru-3 had similar activity. In addition, we also found that both BrunoL1 and Bru-3 enhanced translation of mRNAs containing the 3'UTRs of Drosophila oskar or cyclin A, which have been well characterized to mediate repression. Lastly, we show that it is the Linker region of BrunoL1 that is both necessary and sufficient for this activity.

J	Zlatkina, V; Petrides, M				Zlatkina, Veronika; Petrides, Michael			Morphological Patterns of the Postcentral Sulcus in the Human Brain	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						sulcal variability; sulcal patterns; parietal cortex; stereotaxic space; MRI	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ANTERIOR INTRAPARIETAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; FUNCTIONAL TOPOGRAPHY; SURFACE ORIENTATION; CORTICAL AREAS; REPRESENTATION; FMRI	The morphological structure of the postcentral sulcus and its variability were investigated in 40 structural magnetic resonance images of the human brain registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) proportional stereotaxic space. This analysis showed that the postcentral sulcus is not a single sulcus, but rather a complex of sulcal segments separated by gyri, which merge their banks at distinct locations. Most of these gyri are submerged deep within the sulcus and can be observed only by examining the depth of the sulcus, although a small proportion may be observed from the surface of the brain. In the majority of the examined cerebral hemispheres (73.75%), the postcentral sulcus is separated into two or three segments or, less frequently, into four or five segments (12.5%), or it remains continuous (13.75%). Examination of the in-depth relationship between the postcentral sulcus and the intraparietal sulcus revealed that these two sulci may appear to join on the surface of the brain but they are in fact always separated by a gyrus in the cortical depth. In 32.5% of the examined hemispheres, a dorsoventrally oriented sulcus, the transverse postcentral sulcus, is located anterior to the postcentral sulcus on the lower part of the postcentral gyrus. Systematic examination of the morphology of the postcentral sulcus in the proportional stereotaxic space that is used in functional neuroimaging studies is the first step toward the establishment of anatomical-functional correlations in the anterior parietal lobe.

Autism Genome Project Consortium	Disruption at the PTCHD1 Locus on Xp22.11 in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							LINKED MENTAL-RETARDATION; X-CHROMOSOME; SPINAL-CORD; GENE; MUTATIONS; FAMILY; ASSOCIATION; EXPRESSION; PHENOTYPE; IL1RAPL1	Autism is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex mode of inheritance. It is one of the most highly heritable of the complex disorders, although the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown. Here, we report mutations in the X-chromosome PTCHD1 (patched-related) gene in seven families with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and in three families with intellectual disability. A 167-kilobase microdeletion spanning exon 1 was found in two brothers, one with ASD and the other with a learning disability and ASD features; a 90-kilobase microdeletion spanning the entire gene was found in three males with intellectual disability in a second family. In 900 probands with ASD and 208 male probands with intellectual disability, we identified seven different missense changes (in eight male probands) that were inherited from unaffected mothers and not found in controls. Two of the ASD individuals with missense changes also carried a de novo deletion at another ASD susceptibility locus (DPYD and DPP6), suggesting complex genetic contributions. In additional males with ASD, we identified deletions in the 5' flanking region of PTCHD1 that disrupted a complex non-coding RNA and potential regulatory elements; equivalent changes were not found in male control individuals. Thus, our systematic screen of PTCHD1 and its 5' flanking regions suggests that this locus is involved in similar to 1% of individuals with ASD and intellectual disability.

Prospective case control study. Objective. This study investigated preoperative presumed adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients with right thoracic curves to determine which clinical and radiographic findings correlate with neural axis abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Summary of Background Data. Neural axis abnormalities on MRI are not uncommon in patients with left thoracic curves, increased thoracic kyphosis, and in children less than 10 years old. For adolescents with right thoracic curves, less is known regarding which clinical and/or radiographic characteristics accompany neural axis abnormalities. Methods. A total of 529 presumed AIS patients with Lenke 1-4 right thoracic curve patterns had MRI evaluation before surgery. Thirty-six of these patients had abnormal MRIs (syrinx, Chiari malformation, and/or tethered cord). To differentiate between those with normal MRIs (n = 493) and those with abnormal MRIs (n = 36), the following preoperative clinical parameters were evaluated: age, gender, height, weight, asymmetric abdominal reflexes, thoracic rotation (scoliometer), coronal balance, trunk shift, shoulder elevation, and the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-30 questionnaire. Radiographically, thoracic curve magnitude, thoracic rotation (Nash-Moe), coronal balance, trunk shift, length of thoracic curve, location of curve apex, sagittal balance, thoracic kyphosis (T2-T12), and lumbar lordosis were evaluated. Results. Neural axis abnormalities were found in 6.8%. Those with abnormal MRI findings had significantly greater clinical thoracic rotation (mean difference, 2.4 degrees) and significantly greater radiographic thoracic kyphosis (mean difference 5.9 degrees). However, there were no significant differences in: age (14.9 vs. 14.7 years), height for age (when adjusted for gender), asymmetric abdominal reflexes (3.5% normal MRI group vs. 6.1% abnormal group), coronal balance (clinical or radiographic), trunk shift(clinical or radiographic), shoulder elevation, thoracic curve magnitude (61.4 degrees normal MRI group vs. 63.6 degrees abnormal group), length of thoracic curves (7.0 segments normal group vs. 7.2 segments abnormal group), location of curve apexes, radiographic sagittal balance, or any domains of the preoperative SRS-30 questionnaire. Conclusion. Of preoperative presumed AIS patients with right thoracic curves who underwent MRI evaluation of the neural axis, 6.8% were found to have neural axis abnormalities, with those having increased rotation and/or increased kyphosis at higher risk. Surgeons should use this information when deciding whether a preoperative MRI is indicated in those with right thoracic AIS curve patterns.	[Richards, B.

Method: This was achieved by scanning 12 MCI persons and 10 age- and education-matched healthy controls while encoding words and while retrieving them in a recognition test. Results: Behaviorally, there was no significant group difference on recognition performance. However, MCI and healthy controls showed different patterns of cerebral activation during encoding. While most of these differences demonstrated reduced activation in the MCI group, there were areas of increased activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Reduced activation was found in brain areas known to be either structurally compromised or hypometabolic in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, very few group differences were associated with retrieval. Correlation analyses indicated that increased disease severity, as measured with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, was associated with smaller activation of the right middle and superior temporal gyri. In contrast, recognition success in MCI persons was associated with larger activation of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the encoding phase. Conclusion: Overall, our results indicate that most of the memory-related cerebral network changes in MCI persons occur during the encoding phase. They also suggest that a prefrontal compensatory mechanism could occur in parallel with the disease-associated reduction of cerebral activation in temporal areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Srl.

J	Yu, L; Zhou, YT; Cheng, ST; Rao, Y				Yu, Li; Zhou, Yating; Cheng, Songting; Rao, Yong			Plexin A-Semaphorin-1a Reverse Signaling Regulates Photoreceptor Axon Guidance in Drosophila	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSMEMBRANE SEMAPHORIN; VISUAL-SYSTEM; PROTEIN; RECEPTOR; REPULSION; INTERACTS; NEURONS; BIND; CUE; 1A	While it is well established that Semaphorin family proteins function as axon guidance ligands in invertebrates and vertebrates, several recent studies indicate that the Drosophila Semaphorin-1a (Sema1a), a transmembrane Semaphorin, can also function as a receptor during neural development. The regulator of Sema1a reverse signaling, however, remains unknown. In this study, we show that like Sema1a, the well known Semaphorin receptor Plexin A (PlexA), is required for the proper guidance of photoreceptor ( R cell) axons in the Drosophila visual system. Loss of PlexA, like loss of semala, disrupted the association of R-cell growth cones in the optic lobe. Conversely, overexpression of PlexA, like overexpression of sema1a, induced the hyperfasciculation of R-cell axons. Unlike Sema1a, however, the cytoplasmic domain of PlexA is dispensable. Epistasis analysis suggests that PlexA functions upstream of semala. And PlexA and sema1a interact genetically with Rho1. We propose that PlexA regulates Semala reverse signaling in the Drosophila visual system.

Headache and sleep: guidance in recognition	DOULEUR ET ANALGESIE			French	Review						Sleep; Headache; Migraine; Arousal; Circadian rhythm; Brain trauma	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; INSOMNIA; PAIN; MIGRAINE	Sleep is a physiological and behavioral state where the person is partly isolated from the external environment. In the presence of sleep intrusions such as pain, sleep becomes fragmented. The non REM to REM ultradian oscillations, occurring every 90 to 110 minutes, are then disrupted by several brief and transient arousals (rise in cardiac, brain, muscle, and respiratory activities). The pain reports from these individuals tend to be exacerbated by the loss of sleep continuity. Tension headache, migraine, and cluster headache may occur before sleep (delaying sleep onset), during sleep (e.g., migraine, hypnic headache, cluster headache, and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania), or upon awakening (e.g., breathing disorder, bruxism, pain medication overuse, and arterial hypertension). Minor traumatic brain injury is frequently associated with headache and circadian sleep disturbances. Little is known on how to manage sleep-related headaches. A polygraphic search for breathing disturbances or periodic limb movements is recommended if the complaints are recurrent and associated with daytime somnolence. Use of breathing or oral devices is helpful if an upper airway resistance is present or if apneahypopnea is observed. Cognitive and behavioral approaches related to sleep hygiene and lifestyle are valuable. Hypnotic medications probably have limited long-term value.	[Lavigne, G.; Khoury, S.; Carra, M.

CASE SUMMARY: A 63-year-old morbidly obese male polytrauma patient with PD and type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to our intensive care unit postoperatively. Enteral feeds were administered per nasogastric tube and provided 0.88 g/kg/day of protein based on ideal body weight (IBW). His PD medications (pramipexole, entacapone, and immediate-release levodopa/carbidopa 100 mg/25 mg, 1.5 tablets 4 times daily) were administered via nasogastric tube. To achieve better glycemic control, his enteral feeds were changed to a formula that provided 1.8 g/kg/day of protein based on IBW. In the following 24 hours, the patient's mental status deteriorated and he was reintubated. He developed a high fever (40.5 degrees C), leukocytosis, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) (480-1801 units/L), and acute renal impairment. His enteral nutrition was changed to decrease protein intake to 1.0 g/kg/day based on IBW and he was given bromocriptine 5 mg 3 times daily via nasogastric tube. Within 24 hours, the patient's mental status improved, his temperature and CK decreased, and his renal function began to improve; the values returned to baseline levels on the 18th day of admission. DISCUSSION: Withdrawal or dose reduction of levodopa in patients with PD has been reported to precipitate NMLS, which is potentially fatal. Because dietary protein can decrease the absorp0tion of levodopa, a potential for an interaction between levodopa and enteral feedings exists, although published reports of such an interaction are limited. In this patient, the likelihood that a drug-nutrient interaction occurred between levodopa and enteral feedings is considered to be probable based on the Naranjo probability scale and the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Health-care professionals should be aware of the interaction between levodopa and protein content of enteral nutrition to avoid the occurrence of NMLS in patients with PD.

Little is known concerning the natural evolution of QoL following diagnosis. Psychological factors contributing to QoL improvement, such as psychological distress and self-efficacy remain to be explored. The objective of this study is to examine whether QoL changes 2 months and 6 months following head-up tilt (HUT) testing as well as to determine whether psychological factors are predictive of changes in QoL. Seventy-three patients undergoing HUT for recurrent syncope were interviewed 1 month before as well as 2 months and 6 months following HUT, using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Pre-HUT QoL was significantly worse than at the 2-month (p=0.000) and 6-month follow-ups (p=0.000). Psychological distress at baseline was associated with worse QoL 2 months post-HUT (Beta=.280; p=.024), independently of socio-demographic and clinical factors. Improved self-efficacy at follow-up predicted improvements in QoL (Beta=-.186; p=.023). Two and 6 months post-HUT, QoL is mproved in patients with recurrent syncope. Better QoL is predicted by low psychological distress and a heightened sense of self-efficacy following HUT. Strategies for enhancing self-efficacy and reducing psychological distress could be an efficient way to promote QoL in patients suffering from recurrent syncope.

Design Cohort study. Patients Infants born at <= 28 weeks and admitted in three hospital centres in Quebec, Canada (n=254). Main outcome measures Neurodevelopmental outcomes and healthcare use from neonatal discharge to 18 months CA. Results Re-hospitalisation rates occurred in 57% of children born at 23-25 weeks and in 49% of those born at 26-28 weeks. In these two age groups, by 18 months, 61% vs 59% were followed in physical or occupational therapy, 29% vs 17% were enrolled in a long-term rehabilitation program, 38% vs 28% used prescribed medication, and 59% vs 33% required medical assistive devices, respectively. Risk of re-hospitalisation was related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), severe brain injury, use of home oxygen or an apnoea monitor and older age at neonatal discharge. Multiple births, BPD, severe brain injury, older age at neonatal discharge and single parenthood were associated with risk of using out-patient health services above average (>2 services). Conclusion Extremely preterm children are frequently re-hospitalised during infancy and use a substantial amount of healthcare resources. These results highlight the importance of resource allocation to preterm infants for medical and rehabilitation services after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit.

Previously it was thought that only bivalent ligands could be agonistic, whereas monovalent ligands should be antagonistic. This notion changed after the demonstration that monovalent ligands can be agonistic, including our report of a small molecule monovalent ligand "D3" that is a partial agonist of the NGF receptor TrkA. A bivalent "D3-linker-D3" was expected to increase agonism. Methods: Dimeric analogs were synthesized and tested in binding, biochemical, and biological assays. Results: One analog, 1-ss, binds TrkA with higher affinity than D3 and induces or stabilizes receptor dimers. However, 1-ss exhibited antagonistic activity, through two mechanisms. One mechanism is that 1-ss blocks NGF binding, unlike D3 which is non-competitive. Inhibition of NGF binding may be due to the linker of 1-ss filling the inter-receptor space that NGF traverses before docking. In a second mechanism, 1-ss acts as a pure antagonist, inhibiting NGF-independent TrkA activity in cells over-expressing receptors. Inhibition is likely due to 1-ss "freezing" the TrkA dimer in the inactive state. Conclusions: Dimerization of an RTK can result in antagonism, through two independent mechanisms. General significance: we report a small molecule monovalent agonist being converted to a bivalent antagonist. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We previously showed that apoD mRNA expression is induced in growth-arrested cells and demonstrated the specific binding of nuclear proteins to the region -514 to -475 of the promoter. Such region contains a pair of Serum Responsive Elements (SRE), an Ets-Binding Site (EBS) and a Glucocorticoid Responsive Element (GRE). In this study, we show that Parp-1, HnRNP-U, CBF-A, BUB-3, Kif4, APEX-1 and Ifi204 bind these regulatory elements of the apoD promoter. Specific binding of HnRNP-U and Parp-1 was confirmed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). In a biotin pull-down assay, Kif4 and BUB-3 bind preferentially the SRE1 and the EBS-GRE sites, respectively, while APEX-1 seems recruited indirectly to these elements. We found that the mRNA expression of some of these binding factors is upregulated in growth-arrested cells and that these proteins also transactivate the apoD promoter. In agreement with these results, mutants of APEX-1 and of Parp-1 defective for their DNA-binding and catalytic activities could not transactivate the promoter. The knockdown of Parp-1 and HnRNP-U and the use of specific inhibitors of MEK1/2 and of Parp-1 also inhibited the induction of apoD gene expression. Moreover, ERK1/2 was found activated in a biphasic manner post serum-starvation and the inhibition of Parp-1 causes a sustained activation of ERK2 but not ERK1 for up to 2 h. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of Parp-1, APEX-1 and ERK1/2 catalytic activities in the growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Superoxide is an associated signal for apoptosis in axonal injury	BRAIN			English	Article						retinal ganglion cells; axonal injury; superoxide; optic neuropathy; intracellular signalling	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; IN-VIVO; INTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; MICROGLIAL CELLS; AXOTOMY; DEATH; RAT; HYDROETHIDINE; SURVIVAL	Optic neuropathy is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, and a paradigm for central nervous system axonal disease. The primary event is damage to retinal ganglion cell axons, with subsequent death of the cell body by apoptosis. Trials of neuroprotection for these and other neuronal diseases have mostly failed, primarily because mechanisms of neuroprotection in animals do not necessarily translate to humans. We developed a methodology for imaging an intracellular transduction pathway that signals neuronal death in the living animal. Using longitudinal confocal scanning multilaser ophthalmoscopy, we identified the production of superoxide within retrograde-labelled rat retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve transection. Superoxide was visualized by real-time imaging of its reaction product with intravitreally administered hydroethidine and confirmed by differential spectroscopy of the specific product 2-hydroxyethidium. Retinal ganglion cell superoxide increased within 24 h after axotomy, peaking at 4 days, and was not observed in contralateral untransected eyes. The superoxide signal preceded phosphatidylserine externalization, indicating that superoxide generation was an early event and preceded apoptosis. Intravitreal pegylated superoxide dismutase blocked superoxide generation after axotomy and delayed retinal ganglion cell death. Together, these results are consistent with superoxide being an upstream signal for retinal ganglion cell apoptosis after optic nerve injury. Early detection of axonal injury with superoxide could serve as a predictive biomarker for patients with optic neuropathy.

We assessed whether this musical disorder exists among speakers of Mandarin Chinese who use pitch to alter the meaning of words. Using the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, we tested 117 healthy young Mandarin speakers with no self-declared musical problems and 22 individuals who reported musical difficulties and scored two standard deviations below the mean obtained by the Mandarin speakers without amusia. These 22 amusic individuals showed a similar pattern of musical impairment as did amusic speakers of non-tonal languages, by exhibiting a more pronounced deficit in melody than in rhythm processing. Furthermore, nearly half the tested amusics had impairments in the discrimination and identification of Mandarin lexical tones. Six showed marked impairments, displaying what could be called lexical tone agnosia, but had normal tone production. Our results show that speakers of tone languages such as Mandarin may experience musical pitch disorder despite early exposure to speech-relevant pitch contrasts. The observed association between the musical disorder and lexical tone difficulty indicates that the pitch disorder as defining congenital amusia is not specific to music or culture but is rather general in nature.

The Measurement of Sociomoral Reasoning in Adolescents With Traumatic Brain Injury: A Pilot Investigation	BRAIN IMPAIRMENT			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; moral reasoning; aggression		Moral reasoning skills are crucial for appropriate and adaptive social functioning. Impairments in moral reasoning have been associated with aggressive and violent behaviours. Traditional measures of moral reasoning may provide limited insight into daily behavioural functioning as these measures are dependent on several higher order cognitive skills and, as such, may be limited in their utility with certain clinical populations. In Study 1, new measures of sociomoral reasoning and maturity, the So-Moral and So-Mature, were described. Further, the psychometric properties of the So-Moral and So-Mature were investigated in a sample of 50 adolescents aged 11 to 19 (mean age = 14.5, SD = 2.6 years, 25 male). Preliminary support was found for the validity and reliability of both tasks. In Study 2, the clinical applicability of the So-Moral and So-Mature were examined in a sample 25 adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI; mean age = 13.8, SD = 2.3 years, 15 male). Response trends suggested that adolescents with TBI generated less developmentally mature responses to sociomoral dilemmas and those with more severe injuries performed most poorly. The sociomoral reasoning tasks described promote participant's emotional involvement and investment as well as being appropriate for use with clinical populations.

Biotransformed blueberry juice protects neurons from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						Neuroprotection; Blueberry juice; Oxidative stress; Catalase; Mitogen-activated protein kinases	INDUCED CELL-DEATH; VACCINIUM-ANGUSTIFOLIUM; POLYPHENOLIC COMPOUNDS; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; N2A CELLS; BEHAVIOR; PC12; DNA; NEURODEGENERATION	A growing body of evidence supports the therapeutic effects of blueberry in neurodegenerative disorders. Biotransformation of blueberry juice by Serratia vaccinii bacteria increases its phenolic content and antioxidant activity. In neuronal cell culture, biotransformed blueberry juice (BJ) significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, namely catalase and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, BJ protected neurons against H2O2-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. This associated with the upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family enzymes p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, as well as with the protection of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK1/2) activity loss induced by H2O2. The present studies demonstrate that BJ can protect neurons against oxidative stress possibly by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and activating p38- and JNK-dependent survival pathways while blocking MEK1/2- and ERK1/2-mediated cell death. Thus, BJ may represent a novel approach to prevent and to treat neurodegenerative disorders, and it may represent a source of novel therapeutic agents against these diseases.

The optimal management for BCVI has not been standardized. At our institution, 64-slice multi-detector computed tomographic angiography (CTA) has been used as the initial screening exam for BCVI in patients who met predefined screening criteria. The purpose of this study is to review the incidence of CTA-diagnosed BCVI in at-risk patients and to evaluate the treatment and clinical outcome of patients with BCVI. Methods: This study included trauma patients with a positive diagnosis of BCVI on CTA during a 41-month study period. The medical records and relevant radiographic findings were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Twenty seven of 222 blunt trauma patients evaluated with CTA had a positive diagnosis of BCVI, with an occurrence rate of 12.2%. Traumatic brain injury (72.2%) and basal skull fractures (55.6%) were the most frequent associated injuries with carotid trauma while 100% of blunt vertebral injuries occurred in the setting of cervical fractures. Fourteen (51.8%) patients received medical therapy; Eleven (40.7%) patients received conservative treatment. Endovascular treatment was attempted in a single case of vertebral arteriovenous fistula. BCVI-related stroke was found in four patients (14.8%), one of whom developed an infarct while on medical treatment. Conclusions: BCVI is found in a significant portion of blunt trauma patients with identifiable risk factors, and screening CTA has high diagnostic yield in detecting these lesions. Medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment at our institution; however, BCVI-related stroke may occur despite treatment.

However, they are now emerging in the immunocompetent population and have an affinity for the central nervous system. They represent a therapeutic challenge, since they are highly resistant to most antifungal medications. Methods: We report the case of an immunocompetent patient with multiple cerebral abscesses secondary to Scedosporium apiospermum following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and review the literature about this challenging cerebral infection. Results: A previously healthy 33-year-old male admitted to the hospital for a community-acquired pneumonia requiring ECMO subsequently developed multiple cerebral abscesses. He was empirically treated with caspofungin, which was changed to voriconazole once surgical aspiration revealed Scedosporium apiospermum. Despite multiple aspirations, decompressive craniectomy to alleviate intracranial pressure, and an appropriate antifungal agent, the patient did not survive this aggressive infection. Conclusion: Brain abscesses with Scedosporium apiospermum present a therapeutic challenge. High clinical suspicion leading to early appropriate antifungal therapy and combined surgical interventions might improve the prognosis.

Available data indicate they lack impact on the progressive phases of disease; the more potent systemic immune-directed agents predispose to development of infectious or neoplastic disorders. Development of new agents that enhance disease stage related efficacy and limit systemic toxicity will need to consider the underlying mechanisms related to each phase of the clinical disorder, namely relapses, remission, and progression. This report focuses on disease related mechanisms ongoing within the CNS that contribute to the different phases of MS and how these may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Such mechanisms include CNS compartment specific immunologic properties especially as related to the innate immune system and neural cell-related properties that are determinants of the extent of actual tissue injury and repair (or lack thereof).

Which cognitive skills and to what extent the cerebrocerebellar loops contribute remain unclear, however. Among other reasons, this may be explained by the fact that authors have studied patients with extracerebellar lesions. The goal of this study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in cognition and affect in patients with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ARCA-1), a newly described inherited cerebellar disease characterised by middle-age onset of ataxia as well as pure, severe and diffuse cerebellar atrophy. To this end, the performance of 21 ARCA-1 patients was compared to that of 21 normal controls paired for age and education on a 3-h battery of attention, executive, visuospatial and memory skills. Results indicated similar IQ, naming and declarative memory abilities between groups. ARCA-1 patients showed significant deficits in attention (attention span, speed of information processing, sustained attention), verbal working memory and visuospatial/visuoconstructional skills (3-D drawings, copy of a complex figure). Functional brain imaging in a subset of patients showed diffuse severe cerebellar hypometabolism associated with a small area of right parietal hypometabolism. None of the patients presented a significant affective syndrome. Correlational analyses suggested that cognitive deficits could not be explained by the severity of motor deficits, duration of disease or mood. Altogether, this study confirms that pure cerebellar damage as seen in ARCA-1 is associated with significant cognitive impairments but not with psychiatric comorbidity. These deficits are correlated with an overall moderate impact on patient's autonomy. Our data favour an indirect participation of the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortical areas to the cerebrocerebellar circuit.

Further, they are one of the best-studied effectors of heterotrimeric G proteins in general and G beta gamma subunits in particular. However, our understanding of the roles of multiple G beta gamma binding sites on Kir3 channels is still rudimentary.

Negative responses are also occasionally seen and have not been explained. Recent studies describe BOLD signal changes before focal EEG spikes. We aimed to systematically study if the undershoot of a preceding positive response might explain the negative BOLD seen in the focus. Methods: Eighty-two patients with focal epilepsy who underwent EEG-fMRI at 3T were retrospectively studied. Studies with a focal negative BOLD response in the region of the spike field were reanalyzed using models with hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) peaking from -9 to +9 s around the spike. Results: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria, showing negative BOLD responses in the spike field on standard analysis. None had positive BOLD responses immediately adjacent to the areas of deactivation. Regions of deactivation were found to have congruent preceding positive responses in two cases. These early activations were seen at the combined maps of -5 to -9 s. Discussion: This study indicates that in a small proportion of patients with focal epilepsy in whom the standard analysis reveals focal negative responses, an earlier positive BOLD response is probably the cause. The origin of negative BOLD signal changes in the focus as a result of an epileptic event remains, however, unexplained in most of the patients in whom it occurs.

In the present study, we investigated the roles of the area postrema (AP), subfornical organ (SFO) and vagus nerve in mediating the anorectic effect of PYY using PYY(3-36) conjugated to human serum albumin (PYY(3-36)-HSA) in rats. PYY(3-36)-HSA is a large molecule that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and thus provides a useful tool to discriminate between the central (brain) and peripheral actions of this peptide. PYY(3-36)-HSA induced significant reductions in food and body weight gain up to 24 h after administration. The anorectic effect of PYY(3-36)-HSA was delayed for 2 h in rats in which both AP and SFO were ablated, while lesion of either of these circumventricular organs in isolation did not influence the feeding responses to PYY(3-36)-HSA. The PYY(3-36)-HSA-induced anorectic effect was also reduced during the 3- to 6-h period following subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. Lesions of AP, SFO and AP/SFO as well as subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blunted PYY(3-36)-HSA-induced expression of c-fos mRNA in specific brain structures including the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central amygdala, lateral-external parabrachial nucleus and medial nucleus of the solitary tract. In addition, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy inhibited the neuronal activation induced by PYY(3-36)-HSA in AP and SFO. These findings suggest that the anorectic effect and brain neuronal activation induced by PYY(3-36)-HSA are dependent on integrity of AP, SFO and subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.

Widespread deficits in adult neurogenesis precede plaque and tangle formation in the 3xTg mouse model of Alzheimer's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amyloid precursor protein; hippocampus; stem cells; subventricular zone; tau	NEURAL STEM-CELLS; AMYLOID-BETA-PEPTIDE; TRIPLE-TRANSGENIC MODEL; A-BETA; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID; DENTATE GYRUS; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; PROGENITOR CELLS; TAU PATHOLOGIES	Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects cognitive modalities that are known to be regulated by adult neurogenesis, such as hippocampal- and olfactory-dependent learning and memory. However, the relationship between AD-associated pathologies and alterations in adult neurogenesis has remained contentious. In the present study, we performed a detailed investigation of adult neurogenesis in the triple transgenic (3xTg) mouse model of AD, a unique model that generates both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark pathologies of AD. In both neurogenic niches of the brain, the hippocampal dentate gyrus and forebrain subventricular zone, we found that 3xTg mice had decreased numbers of (i) proliferating cells, (ii) early lineage neural progenitors, and (iii) neuroblasts at middle age (11 months old) and old age (18 months old). These decreases correlated with major reductions in the addition of new neurons to the respective target areas, the dentate granule cell layer and olfactory bulb. Within the subventricular zone niche, cytological alterations were observed that included a selective loss of subependymal cells and the development of large lipid droplets within the ependyma of 3xTg mice, indicative of metabolic changes. Temporally, there was a marked acceleration of age-related decreases in 3xTg mice, which affected multiple stages of neurogenesis and was clearly apparent prior to the development of amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. Our findings indicate that AD-associated mutations suppress neurogenesis early during disease development. This suggests that deficits in adult neurogenesis may mediate premature cognitive decline in AD.	[Hamilton, Laura K.; Aumont, Anne; Vadnais, Alexandra; Fernandes, Karl J.

Directed attention alters the temporal activation patterns of back extensors during trunk flexion-extension in individuals with chronic low back pain	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Chronic low back pain; Electromyography; Directed attention; Sex differences; Trunk muscles; Temporal recruitment strategies	GENDER-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; SEX-DIFFERENCES; RELAXATION PHENOMENON; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; EXPERIMENTAL MUSCLE; LUMBAR SPINE; DISTRACTION; CONTRACTIONS	In chronic low back pain patients (CLBP), neuromuscular and pain intensity have been identified as contributing factors in the disability of the individual. However, it is unclear whether pain intensity influences neuromuscular activation and if directed attention mediates this relationship. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of directed attention in individuals with different pain intensities on back extensor activation profiles. Fifty-four CLBP patients were separated into either high- or low-pain groups. Surface electromyograms were recorded from back muscles while the subjects performed a trunk flexion motion for four different attention conditions. Pattern recognition and repeated measures ANOVAs were used to examine the effect of sex, attention and pain intensity on temporal muscle activation patterns. The results showed that there was a significant sex x attention x pain interaction. The largest changes in muscle timing were observed in the low-pain group when their attention was focused on their pain, but the pattern of muscle activation differed between sexes. For males, a rapid decline in activation at mid-extension occurred, whereas females showed delayed activation at the beginning of extension. Overall, this study demonstrated that directed attention on pain had an effect on trunk muscle temporal recruitment, and that this relationship differed between sexes and pain groups. This suggests that sex-specific mechanisms may alter the neuromuscular control of the spine in CLBP patients for different pain levels.	[Butler, Heather L.; Sullivan, Michael J.

However, there is no such evidence in human. The aim of the present study was to assess this question in Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurological condition known for its dopamine depletion in the striatum. Eleven PD patients were tested under their usual levodopa medication (ON state), and following a 12-h levodopa withdrawal (OFF state). Patients were compared with 12 healthy participants on a motor learning sequencing task, requiring pressing fourteen buttons in the correct order, which was determined by visual stimuli presented on a computer screen. Learning was assessed from three blocks of 20 trials administered successively. Chunks of movements were intrinsically created by each participant during this learning period. Then, the sequence was shuffled according to the participant's own chunks, generating two new sequences, with either preserved or broken chunks. Those new motor sequences had to be performed separately in a fourth and fifth blocks of 20 trials. Results showed that execution time improved in every group during the learning period (from blocks 1 to 3). However, while motor chunking occurred in healthy controls and ON-PD patients, it did not in OFF-PD patients. In the shuffling conditions, a significant difference was seen between the preserved and the broken chunks conditions for both healthy participants and ON-PD patients, but not for OFF-PD patients. These results suggest that movement chunking during motor sequence learning is a dopamine-dependent process in human.

Oral Appliances and the Management of Sleep Bruxism in Adults: A Century of Clinical Applications and Search for Mechanisms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS			English	Article							MASTICATORY MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; NOCTURNAL BRUXISM; OCCLUSAL SPLINT; TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDERS; ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; MYOFASCIAL PAIN; CANINE GUIDANCE; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; EFFICACY	The phenomenon of sleep bruxism (SB) has been recognized and described for centuries, including literary references to the gnashing of teeth. Early etiologic explanations were generally focused on mechanistic factors, but later, attention was focused on psychologic issues such as stress and anxiety; by the end of the 20(th) century, most opinions combined these two ideas. However, recently, the study of the SB phenomena has occurred primarily in sleep laboratories in which patients could be observed and monitored over several nights. Various other physiologic systems were also studied in sleep laboratories, including brain activity, muscle activity, cardiac function, and breathing. As a result of these studies, most authorities now consider SB to be a primarily sleep-related movement disorder, and specific diagnostic criteria have been established for the formal diagnosis of that condition. All of these changes in the understanding of the SB phenomena have led to a corresponding change in thinking about how oral appliances (OAs) might be used in the management of SB. Originally, they were thought to be a temporary measure that could help dentists analyze improper dental relationships. Unfortunately, this often led to dental procedures to "improve" these relationships, including equilibrations, orthodontics, bite opening, or even major restorative dentistry. However, it is now understood that the proper role for OAs is to protect the teeth and hopefully to diminish muscle activity during sleep. This paper reviews these evolutionary changes in the understanding of SB and how this affects concepts of designing and using OAs. Int J Prosthodont 2010; 23: 453-462.

NPI-C Res Grp	The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale (NPI-C): reliability and validity of a revised assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia	INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS			English	Article						dementia; Alzheimer's disease; neuropsychiatric symptoms; depression; apathy; agitation; neuropsychiatric inventory	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; NURSING-HOME RESIDENTS; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CACHE COUNTY; BEHAVIORAL DISTURBANCES; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; APATHY; DISORDERS	Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect almost all patients with dementia and are a major focus of study and treatment. Accurate assessment of NPS through valid, sensitive and reliable measures is crucial. Although current NPS measures have many strengths, they also have some limitations (e. g. acquisition of data is limited to informants or caregivers as respondents, limited depth of items specific to moderate dementia). Therefore, we developed a revised version of the NPI, known as the NPI-C. The NPI-C includes expanded domains and items, and a clinician-rating methodology. This study evaluated the reliability and convergent validity of the NPI-C at ten international sites (seven languages). Methods: Face validity for 78 new items was obtained through a Delphi panel. A total of 128 dyads (caregivers/patients) from three severity categories of dementia (mild = 58, moderate = 49, severe = 21) were interviewed separately by two trained raters using two rating methods: the original NPI interview and a clinician-rated method. Rater 1 also administered four additional, established measures: the Apathy Evaluation Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Index, and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Intraclass correlations were used to determine inter-rater reliability. Pearson correlations between the four relevant NPI-C domains and their corresponding outside measures were used for convergent validity. Results: Inter-rater reliability was strong for most items. Convergent validity was moderate (apathy and agitation) to strong (hallucinations and delusions; agitation and aberrant vocalization; and depression) for clinician ratings in NPI-C domains. Conclusion: Overall, the NPI-C shows promise as a versatile tool which can accurately measure NPS and which uses a uniform scale system to facilitate data comparisons across studies.

Uri			An Agonistic TrkB mAb Causes Sustained TrkB Activation, Delays RGC Death, and Protects the Retinal Structure in Optic Nerve Axotomy and in Glaucoma	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							MOLECULE PEPTIDOMIMETIC LIGANDS; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTORS; GANGLION-CELL SURVIVAL; IN-VIVO; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; RETROGRADE TRANSPORT; NEURONAL SURVIVAL; AXONAL-TRANSPORT	PURPOSE. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptors TrkB and p75(NTR) are expressed in the retina. However, exogenous BDNF does not provide retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with long-lasting neuroprotection in vivo during optic nerve axotomy or in glaucoma rat models of neurodegeneration. The authors set out to answer the hypothesis that a selective TrkB agonist might afford more efficient neuroprotection. METHODS. Animal models of acute neurodegeneration (complete optic nerve axotomy) and chronic neurodegeneration (ocular hypertension, glaucoma) were used. After intravitreal delivery of test agents or controls, surviving RGCs were quantified. Transient or sustained activation of TrkB receptors in vivo was quantified by Western blot analysis retinal samples for TrkB-phosphotyrosine. Time-dependent changes to the neuronal retinal layers were quantified longitudinally by Fourier domain-optical coherence tomography. RESULTS. The authors show that a selective TrkB agonist caused long-lived TrkB activation and significantly delayed RGC death in these models of acute and chronic retinal injury in vivo. Importantly, using noninvasive retinal imaging, they also show that a selective TrkB agonist caused preservation of the retinal structure in both animal models, with maintenance of the layers comprising neurons and neuronal fibers. CONCLUSIONS. In animal models of acute and chronic neurodegeneration, a TrkB agonist affords long-lasting neuroprotection by causing sustained TrkB activation. The use of structural end points could have prognostic value to evaluate neuroprotection. This work contributes to the understanding of neurotrophic mechanisms underlying RGC death in glaucoma and optic nerve axotomy.

The imaging work-up with radiographs, CT and MRI must be adapted to each individual case. In the setting of minor trauma, standard radiographs are obtained when clinically indicated. In all other cases of high energy trauma, spinal trauma with neurological deficit or incomplete or difficult standard radiographic evaluation. CT will be indicated for osseous injuries while MRI will provide optimal evaluation of soft tissues. Dislocations require immediate treatment. The imaging work-up should by no means delay management.

This article presents a review of eight animal models: four models of isolated occlusion of the vessels of the neck (group 1), one model of combined tracheal and vessel occlusion (group 2), and three models of true animal hanging (group 3). Occlusion of the airway passages in group 2 did not accelerate respiratory arrest compared to group 1. Cessation of cerebral blood flow, rather than airway obstruction, seems to be the main cause of respiratory decline. In general, muscular movements ceased after 1-3.5 min and early generalized tonic-clonic convulsions were described. Complete circulatory collapse seems to occur between 4 and 8.5 min. These observations from animal models of hanging are compared with the data collected from filmed human hangings. Avenues to improve animal models are discussed.

Design: Retrospective study with historical controls. Participants: Twenty-seven patients with sTBI tracheostomized before implementation of the tracheostomy team approach and 34 patients followed by the team. Setting: A regional level 1 tertiary care trauma center, McGill University Health Centre-Montreal General Hospital. Main outcome measures: Time to decannulation, length of stay (LOS), Passy-Muir speaking valve use, and extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) scores given at acute care discharge. Results: The groups were similar for injury severity, age, and premorbid health conditions. Postteam patients had a significantly shorter LOS (P = .025) and more of them used Passy-Muir speaking valves (P = .004). Furthermore, there was a trend toward decreased time to decannulation in the postteam group. GOS-E scores did not differ significantly between groups (P > .05). Conclusion: Implementation of the tracheostomy team appears to have had positive clinical benefits for this population.

To provide a sample of public response in the media, this paper reports the results of a content analysis of letters to editors published in the four most prolific American newspapers for the Schiavo controversy. Opinions expressed in the letters sampled strongly supported the use of living wills and strongly condemned public attention to the case as well as political interventions. Letters tended to be against withdrawal of life support, proxy consent and associated procedures as well as against court decisions and legal procedures. In comparison with reports written by journalists, letters to editors contained fewer controversial claims about Schiavo"s neurological condition and behavioural repertoire but similar loaded language to describe withdrawal of life support. Distinct public discourses can be encountered in different stakeholders suggesting complex and extensive pluralism even within the media.

Numerous experimental studies with dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, an animal model for the disease, have demonstrated that extrasynaptic upregulation of utrophin, an analogue of dystrophin, can prevent muscle fibre deterioration and reduce or negate the dystrophic phenotype. A different approach for ectopic expression of utrophin relies on augmentation of CT-GalNAc transferase in muscle fibre. We investigated whether CT-GalNAc transferase overexpression in adult mice influence appearance of utrophin in the extrasynaptic sarcolemma. After electrotransfer of plasmid DNA carrying an expression cassette of CT-GalNAc transferase into tibialis anterior muscle of wild type and dystrophic mice, muscle sections were examined by immunofluorescence. CT-GalNAc transgene expression augmented sarcolemmal carbohydrate glycosylation and was accompanied by extrasynaptic utrophin. A 6-week time course study showed that the highest efficiency of utrophin overexpression in a plasmid harboured muscle fibres was 32.2% in CD-1 and 52% in mdx mice, 2 and 4 weeks after CT-GalNAc gene transfer, respectively. The study provides evidence that postnatal CT-GalNAc transferase overexpression stimulates utrophin upregulation that is inherently beneficial for muscle structure and strength restoration. Thus CT-GalNAc may provide an important therapeutic molecule for treatment of dystrophin deficiency in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Treatment for many of these patients includes surgery, chemotherapy and rarely radiation therapy. Many clinical trials have been performed in an attempt to establish the best treatment for these patients. Patients enrolled on clinical trials contribute to the establishment of the best therapy. We performed a national survey of all children less than the age of three with brain tumours and examined the contribution these patients made to clinical trials. A data bank was established using data collected from Canadian pediatric oncology centers on children less than age 3 diagnosed with brain tumours between 1990 and 2005. Data were collected on the use of adjunctive treatment after surgery, treatment on a protocol, reasons patients were not registered on a protocol, and reasons for discontinuation of therapy. From the 579 cases in the data bank, 302 (52%) patients were treated with further therapy after surgery. The use of further therapy after surgery was significantly higher in patients with cerebellar and brain stem tumors, patients who were over 1 year of age, patients with ependymal and embryonal tumors, and patients with high grade malignant tumors. Only 62 (21%) patients were enrolled on a protocol for therapy. No factor was significant for being enrolled on a protocol. Reasons for not being registered on a protocol were mainly that there was no open COG/POG/CCG study or the study was not open at the institution. The therapy was stopped because of completion of the protocol in 50% and because of disease progression in 34%. In Canada, about half of children under the age of 36 months with brain tumors are undergoing therapy following surgery for their malignancy but only a small fraction of them are enrolled on a clinical trial. There needs to be improved availability of clinical trials for these patients so that novel therapies can be evaluated and survival improved.

However, it remains unclear whether tau becomes phosphorylated at these epitopes in the somato-dendritic compartment and/or in the axon. In primary hippocampal neurons where human tau was over-expressed both in the somato-dendritic compartment and the axon, the pathological epitopes recognized by the antibodies AT8 (S199/S202/T205), AT100 (T212/S214/T217), and AT180 (T231/S235) were found in the somato-dendritic compartment but not in the axon where tau was either not phosphorylated (T205 and T217) or not simultaneously phosphorylated (T231 and S235) at sites included in the above epitopes. When transfected neurons were treated with the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, AT8, AT100 and AT180 epitopes were observed in the axon, indicating that tau was dephosphorylated at selective sites of pathological epitopes in this compartment. Expression of tau mutants where one phosphorylation site included in the above epitopes was mutated in alanine showed that the formation of one of these epitopes was not required for the formation of the two others in primary hippocampal neurons. All together our results indicate that in the somato-dendritic compartment, the kinase and phosphatase activity does not prevent the formation of pathological epitopes whereas in the axon, the amount of tau phosphorylated at the pathological epitopes is regulated by phosphatase activity, most likely that of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase 2A, the major tau phosphatase. This indicates that if the pathological epitopes are initially formed in the axon in Alzheimer's disease brain, the activation of phosphatases could be an efficient way to abolish their generation.

Clinical prediction of Parkinson's disease: planning for the age of neuroprotection	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							SLEEP BEHAVIOR DISORDER; REM-SLEEP; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDER; TRANSCRANIAL ULTRASOUND; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION; ALPHA-SYNUCLEINOPATHY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; INVITED ARTICLE	As a chronic progressive disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) has a presymptomatic interval; that is, a period during which the pathological process has begun, but motor signs required for the clinical diagnosis are absent. The ability to identify this preclinical stage may be critical in the development and eventual use of neuroprotective therapy. Recently proposed staging systems of PD have suggested that degeneration may occur initially in areas outside the substantia nigra, suggesting that non-motor manifestations may be markers of presymptomatic PD. Decreased olfaction has recently been demonstrated to predict PD in prospective pathological studies, although the lead time may be relatively short, and the positive predictive value is low. Idiopathic RBD has a very high predictive value, with approximately 50% of affected individuals developing PD or dementia within 10 years. This implies that idiopathic RBD patients are ideal candidates to test potential preclinical markers. However, the specificity of symptom screens for RBD is not established, not all persons with PD develop RBD, and there are only limited ways to predict which RBD patients will develop PD. Other simple screens based upon autonomic symptoms, depression and personality changes, quantitative motor testing and other sleep disorders may also be useful markers, but have not been extensively tested. Other more expensive measures such as detailed autonomic testing, cardiac MIBG-scintigraphy, dopaminergic imaging and transcranial ultrasound may be especially useful in defining disease risk in those identified through primary screening.

Only small numbers of fetal OPCs grown in defined medium expressed the oligodendroglial lineage markers Olig2 and O4. The combination of platelet-derived growth factor-AA and basic fibroblast growth factor enhanced proliferation of Olig2-positive and O4-positive cells; a combination of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor 1 promoted O4-positive cell differentiation, galactocerebroside expression, and morphological complexity. Coculturing with rodent dorsal root ganglion neurons in defined medium alone enhanced OPC differentiation and myelin basic protein expression. The addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/insulin-like growth factor 1 further enhanced differentiation, axonal attachment and ensheathment, and clustering of the contactin-associated protein Caspr and Na(+) channels. By contrast, most adult OPCs were O4 positive and Olig2 positive in defined medium; both brain-derived neurotrophic factor/insulin-like growth factor 1 and platelet-derived growth factor-AA/basic fibroblast growth factor promoted their myelin basic protein expression and membrane sheet formation; coculture with dorsal root ganglion neurons further increased myelin basic protein expression. Growth factors also enhanced attachment of adult OPCs to axons, but their capacity to ensheath axons was lower than that of fetal OPCs. These results demonstrate that fetal and adult OPCs show measurable responses to selected growth factors and axon signals that correlate with their capacity for axon ensheathment. The distinct properties of fetal and adult OPCs may be related to differences in their chronological age and initial differentiation states.

Somatosensory Contribution to Motor Learning Due to Facial Skin Deformation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							STRAIN SENSITIVITY; SPEECH; MOVEMENT; MECHANORECEPTORS; DYNAMICS; REFLEX; MUSCLES; LIP; STIMULATION; INFORMATION	Ito T, Ostry DJ. Somatosensory contribution to motor learning due to facial skin deformation. J Neurophysiol 104: 1230-1238, 2010. First published June 30, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00199.2010. Motor learning is dependent on kinesthetic information that is obtained both from cutaneous afferents and from muscle receptors. In human arm movement, information from these two kinds of afferents is largely correlated. The facial skin offers a unique situation in which there are plentiful cutaneous afferents and essentially no muscle receptors and, accordingly, experimental manipulations involving the facial skin may be used to assess the possible role of cutaneous afferents in motor learning. We focus here on the information for motor learning provided by the deformation of the facial skin and the motion of the lips in the context of speech. We used a robotic device to slightly stretch the facial skin lateral to the side of the mouth in the period immediately preceding movement. We found that facial skin stretch increased lip protrusion in a progressive manner over the course of a series of training trials. The learning was manifest in a changed pattern of lip movement, when measured after learning in the absence of load. The newly acquired motor plan generalized partially to another speech task that involved a lip movement of different amplitude. Control tests indicated that the primary source of the observed adaptation was sensory input from cutaneous afferents. The progressive increase in lip protrusion over the course of training fits with the basic idea that change in sensory input is attributed to motor performance error. Sensory input, which in the present study precedes the target movement, is credited to the target-related motion, even though the skin stretch is released prior to movement initiation. This supports the idea that the nervous system generates motor commands on the assumption that sensory input and kinematic error are in register.

J	Todd, KJ; Darabid, H; Robitaille, R				Todd, Keith J.; Darabid, Houssam; Robitaille, Richard			Perisynaptic Glia Discriminate Patterns of Motor Nerve Activity and Influence Plasticity at the Neuromuscular Junction	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; RECEPTOR-MEDIATED INHIBITION; A(2A) ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; MOSSY FIBER SYNAPSES; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; A(1) RECEPTOR; PRESYNAPTIC CALCIUM; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE	In the nervous system, the induction of plasticity is coded by patterns of synaptic activity. Glial cells are now recognized as dynamic partners in a wide variety of brain functions, including the induction and modulation of various forms of synaptic plasticity. However, it appears that glial cells are usually activated by stereotyped, sustained neuronal activity, and little attention has been given to more subtle changes in the patterns of synaptic activation. To this end, we used the mouse neuromuscular junction as a simple and useful model to study glial modulation of synaptic plasticity. We used two patterns of motor nerve stimulation that mimic endogenous motor-neuronal activity. A continuous stimulation induced a post-tetanic potentiation and a phasic Ca(2+) response in perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at this synapse. A bursting pattern of activity induced a post-tetanic depression and oscillatory Ca(2+) responses in PSCs. The different Ca(2+) responses in PSCs indicate that they decode the pattern of synaptic activity. Furthermore, the chelation of glial Ca(2+) impaired the production of the sustained plasticity events indicating that PSCs govern the outcome of synaptic plasticity. The mechanisms involved were studied using direct photo-activation of PSCs with caged Ca(2+) that mimicked endogenous plasticity. Using specific pharmacology and transgenic knock-out animals for adenosine receptors, we showed that the sustained depression was mediated by A1 receptors while the sustained potentiation is mediated by A(2A) receptors. These results demonstrate that glial cells decode the pattern of synaptic activity and subsequently provide bidirectional feedback to synapses.

We used C-11-PK11195 PET to image AMG in vivo after stroke in humans in a prospective longitudinal study to investigate the temporal dynamics of AMG and relate local and remote AMG activity to pyramidal tract (PT) damage using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Eighteen patients underwent DTI-MRI, C-11-PK11195 PET, and behavioral testing within 2 wk and 6 mo of acute subcortical stroke. In 12 patients, the PT was affected by the stroke (PT group), and in 6 patients it was not (non-PT group). Standardized volumes of interest (VOIs) were placed along the PT at the level of the brain stem, semioval center, and infarct. Tracer uptake ratios (ipsilateral to contralateral) were calculated for each VOI and related to tract damage (measured as fractional anisotropy ratio) and clinical outcome. Six controls underwent the same protocol but only once. Results: In both patient groups, local AMG activity in the infarct was increased initially and significantly decreased over the follow-up period. In contrast, remote AMG was detected only in the PT group in the brain stem along the affected tract and persisted during follow-up. No AMG was observed retrograde to the lesion at any time. Remote AMG activity along the affected PT in the brain stem correlated with initial PT damage as measured by DTI in the same tract portion. Local AMG activity in the infarct correlated with anterograde PT damage only at follow-up. After controlling for PT damage, initial AMG activity in the brain stem showed a positive correlation with clinical outcome, whereas persisting AMG activity in the infarct tended to be negatively correlated. Conclusion: DTI-guided C-11-PK11195 PET in acute subcortical stroke demonstrates differential temporal dynamics of local and remote AMG. Activity of both types related to anterograde PT damage as measured by DTI and might contribute differently to clinical outcome.

Significant progress has been made in the understanding of physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of human sexual functioning through preclinical research in animal models. Aim. To provide an evidence-based documentation of the experimental models evaluating male and female sexual function for useful clinical translation. Methods. Consensus discussion over the past 18 months leading to summarized views of seven experts from six countries. Main Outcome Measure. Report was based on the critical analysis of scientific information available in literature and subcommittee presentations, discussions, and exchanges of ideas and feedback. Results. Fundamental research in animal models has led to considerable understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying desire, arousal, genital, and other sexual responses and the design of rational pharmacological treatments for certain sexual dysfunctions in the male and female. Tissue and cellular in vitro systems have provided critical information on the in vivo interactions and modulations in the presence and absence of chemical, biological, vascular, neurologic, endocrine, and genetic inputs. The animal models seem indispensable for elucidating the biophysiological and etiopathological aspects of male and female sexual disorders. Conclusions. Useful insights into the human experience have been derived from basic research in ways that are far more difficult to obtain in humans, both scientifically and ethically. The animal model with a good predictive value can be used as a successful preclinical tool so long as the functional end points are homologous or analogous. The key issue is whether further evaluations are warranted to extrapolate the results in a clinical setting. Giuliano F, Pfaus J, Balasubramanian S, Hedlund P, Hisasue S, Marson L, and Wallen K.

This study evaluated the effects of age, sex and topography on SWA dissipation. The sleep electroencephalogram of 48 young [22 women, 26 men; mean = 23.3 years; standard deviation (SD) = 2.4] and 39 middle-aged (21 women, 18 men; mean = 51.9 years; SD = 4.6) healthy volunteers was analysed. Spectral analysis (0.5-22.0 Hz) was performed per non-rapid eye movement period for Fp1, F3, C3, P3 and O1. SWA (1.0-5.0 Hz) dissipation was modelled using linear and exponential decay functions applied to each age and sex subgroup data set for each derivation. The relative adequacy of both functions was compared using Akaike's information criterion. Results suggest that the exponential model provides a better data fit than the linear fit independently of age, gender and brain location. In women, age reduced the span (distance between the y intercept and the asymptote) of SWA decay in Fp1, F3, P3 and O1. In men, however, the effect of age on the span of SWA decay was limited to Fp1 and F3. In all age and sex subgroups, anterior regions showed a higher span than posterior regions. The asymptote was lower in anterior regions in young but not in middle-aged subjects. These results suggest that the homeostatic process operates on a larger scale in anterior regions. Importantly, ageing reduced the scale of homeostatic dissipation in both sexes, but this effect was more widespread across the brain in women.

A Study of Smoking Reduction	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							DEPRESSIVE EXPERIENCES QUESTIONNAIRE; DISTRESS TOLERANCE; NEURAL CIRCUITRY; CRITICISM; CESSATION; NEUROENDOCRINE; VULNERABILITY; DEPENDENCY; MEDITATION; REVISION	Self-compassion has been found to promote well-being but research has yet to examine whether training in self-compassion improves self-regulation (Gilbert, 2005, 2009; Neff, 2003). The present study sought to examine the impact and moderators of a self-compassion intervention on the self-regulation of cigarette smoking. One hundred and twenty-six smokers seeking to quit were randomly assigned to one of four interventions, of which one involved engaging in self-compassionate imagery and self-talk at every urge to smoke. Multilevel modeling revealed that over three weeks, the self-compassion intervention reduced daily smoking more quickly than a baseline self-monitoring condition but at the same rate as two other imagery-based self-talk interventions. Moderators of self-compassion training emerged. The self-compassion intervention reduced smoking more rapidly if participants were low in readiness to change; were high in the trait of self-criticism; and had vivid imagery during the intervention exercises. Findings suggest that training oneself to self-regulate from a self-compassionate stance might be especially effective for individuals who are able to visualize a compassionate image and whose personality and motivation would be expected to undermine the impact of traditional treatments.

A PET supersets data framework for exploitation of known motion in image reconstruction	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						PET; motion; wobble; motion correction; motion exploitation; reconstruction; super-resolution; superset; motion modeling	EM ALGORITHM; ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; HEAD MOVEMENT; RESOLUTION; SUPERRESOLUTION; COMPENSATION; TOMOGRAPHY; EMISSION; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Purpose: Motion during PET data acquisition is either introduced by design (e.g., couch wobble to enrich data sampling) or through unintentional motion of the object under study (e.g., subject head motion). Prior to this present work, such effects have been considered within distinctly different frameworks in PET imaging, with a rather basic approach having been devised for the cases of intentional motion (such as couch wobble or bed translation) in contrast to the relatively advanced modeling approaches devised for object motion. This article unifies the treatment of these different types of acquisition motion within a generalized framework through the use of the PET supersets data format. From this general framework, a range of conventional motion-compensation methods can be examined as special cases, permitting a revealing investigation into both the suboptimality of commonly adopted approximations, as well as the beneficial impact of known acquisition motion on image quality. Methods: The PET superset data format is a data representation ideally suited for the (potentially lossless) combination of conventional PET data with complementary motion information. Different practical implementations for the reconstruction from PET superset data involving varying levels of approximation to facilitate computation are identified and their impact on the final reconstructed image quality is assessed. Three main simulated case studies are investigated: (i) Motion compensation for subject head motion for (18)F-FDG imaging, (ii) motion exploitation using either couch wobble or random motion, and (iii) motion exploitation using involuntary object motion both with and without couch wobble occurring. The motion exploitation case study goes beyond merely correcting for motion: The motion is directly modeled by the iterative reconstruction to exploit the increased sampling which is available to the benefit of reconstructed image quality. Results: Reconstruction from superset data was successfully demonstrated for the case of motion correction for a (18)F-FDG brain phantom simulation. Building on this success, the methodology was then applied to the case of motion exploitation. The case study resulted in three important findings. First, only reconstruction implementations which model the motion directly within the iterative reconstruction can succeed in significantly improving image resolution and contrast recovery for a given reconstructed noise level. Therefore, the commonly adopted approximation of binning the motion-adjusted data (which is the only method reported to date in the literature) is suboptimal and underestimates the beneficial impact of methods such as wobble during acquisition. Second, similar improvements were found for both types of motion patterns: Periodic wobble motion as well as random motion. Finally, for the case of simulated realistic involuntary object motion, similar resolution improvements were found (both with and without couch wobble). Conclusions: The proposed superset framework allows comprehensive analysis of the commonly adopted approximations when considering motion in PET reconstruction. The findings demonstrate that the supersets data format successfully unify reconstruction in the presence of different sources of known acquisition motion into one framework, and as a result leads to hitherto unreported image quality improvements for all the cases tested where the object motion is accurately known.

The absence of expression of the QKI-6 and QKI-7 cytoplasmic isoforms in oligodendrocytes (OLs) during CNS myelination causes the qk(v) mouse phenotype. The QKI RNA-binding proteins are known to regulate RNA metabolism of cell cycle proteins and myelin components in OLs; however, little is known of their role in reorganizing the cytoskeleton or process outgrowth during OL maturation and differentiation. Here, we identify the actin-interacting protein (AIP)-1 mRNA as a target of QKI-6 by using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis. The AIP-1 mRNA contains a consensus QKI response element within its 3'-untranslated region that, when bound by QKI-6, decreases the half-life of the AIP-1 mRNA. Although the expression of QKI-6 is known to increase during OL differentiation and CNS myelination, we show that this increase is paralleled with a corresponding decrease in AIP-1 expression in rat brains. Furthermore, qk(v)/qk(v) mice that lack QKI-6 and QKI-7 within its OLs had an increased level of AIP-1 in OLs. Moreover, primary rat OL precursors harboring an AIP-1 small interfering RNA display defects in OL process outgrowth. Our findings suggest that the QKI RNA-binding proteins regulate OL differentiation by modulating the expression of AIP-1.

Here we seek to provide a unifying framework that incorporates the key aspects of entrainment as it has been studied in these varying domains. We propose that there are a number of types of entrainment that build upon pre-existing adaptations that allow organisms to perceive stimuli as rhythmic, to produce periodic stimuli, and to integrate the two using sensory feedback. We suggest that social entrainment is a special case of spatiotemporal coordination where the rhythmic signal originates from another individual. We use this framework to understand the function and evolutionary basis for coordinated rhythmic movement and to explore questions about the nature of entrainment in music and dance. The framework of entrainment presented here has a number of implications for the vocal learning hypothesis and other proposals for the evolution of coordinated rhythmic behavior across an array of species.

Details on the interactions between the hippocampus proper and parahippocampal networks during ictogenesis remain, however, unclear. In addition, recent findings have shown that epileptic limbic networks maintained in vitro are paradoxically less responsive than non-epileptic control (NEC) tissue to application of the convulsant drug 4-aminopyridine (4AP). Field potential recordings allowed us to establish here the effects of 4AP in brain slices obtained from NEC and pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats; these slices included the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas such as entorhinal and perirhinal cortices and the amygdala. First, we found that both types of tissue generate epileptiform discharges with similar electrographic characteristics. Further investigation showed that generation of robust ictal-like discharges in the epileptic rat tissue is (i) favored by decreased hippocampal output (ii) reinforced by EC-subiculum interactions and (iii) predominantly driven by amygdala networks. We propose that a functional switch to alternative synaptic routes may promote network hyperexcitability in the epileptic limbic system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Most functional neuroimaging studies to date examined the effect of modafinil only on information processing underlying executive cognition, but cognitive enhancers in general have been shown to have pronounced effects on emotional behavior, too. We examined the effect of modafinil on neural circuits underlying affective processing and cognitive functions. Healthy volunteers were enrolled in this double-blinded placebo-controlled trial (100 mg/day for 7 days). They underwent BOLD fMRI while performing an emotion information-processing task that activates the amygdala and two prefrontally dependent cognitive tasks-a working memory (WM) task and a variable attentional control (VAC) task. A clinical assessment that included measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the profile of mood state (POMS) questionnaire was also performed on each test day. BOLD fMRI revealed significantly decreased amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli on modafinil compared with the placebo condition. During executive cognition tasks, a WM task and a VAC task, modafinil reduced BOLD signal in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate. Although not statistically significant, there were trends for reduced anxiety, for decreased fatigue-inertia and increased vigor-activity, as well as decreased anger-hostility on modafinil. Modafinil in low doses has a unique physiologic profile compared with stimulant drugs: it enhances the efficiency of prefrontal cortical cognitive information processing, while dampening reactivity to threatening stimuli in the amygdala, a brain region implicated in anxiety.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE FOR SYNAPTIC RELEASE OF GLUTAMATE FROM OREXIN TERMINALS IN THE LOCUS COERULEUS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						GABA; PSD-95; rat; synaptophysin; VGluT; VGAT	VESICULAR GLUTAMATE; HYPOCRETIN NEURONS; NARCOLEPSY; TRANSPORTER; INNERVATION; RECEPTORS; DOPAMINE; PROTEINS; VESICLES; MUTATION	Orexin (Orx or hypocretin) is critically important for maintaining wakefulness, since in its absence, narcolepsy with cataplexy occurs. In this role, Orx-containing neurons can exert their influence upon multiple targets through the brain by release of Orx but possibly also by release of other neurotransmitters. Indeed, evidence was previously presented to suggest that Orx terminals could utilize glutamate (Glu) in addition to Orx as a neurotransmitter. Using fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we investigated whether Orx varicosities contain the presynaptic markers for synaptic release of Glu or GABA and come into contact with postsynaptic markers for excitatory synapses within the locus coeruleus of the rat brain. We found that a proportion of the Orx+ varicosities were immunostained for the vesicular transporter for Glu, VGluT2. None were immunostained for vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) or VGluT3 or for the vesicular transporter for GABA, vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Among the Orx+ varicosities, 4% of all and 28% of large varicosities contained VGluT2. A similar proportion of the large Orx+ varicosities contained synaptophysin (Syp), a presynaptic marker for synaptic vesicles. Orx+ varicosities also contacted elements immunostained for postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD)-95, a postsynaptic marker for glutamatergic synapses. We thus conclude that synaptic release of Glu occurs from Orx terminals within the locus coeruleus and can thus be important for the engagement of noradrenergic neurons in stimulating and maintaining arousal.

By incorporating an allostatic load index representing neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular system functioning, numerous studies have demonstrated greater prediction of morbidity and mortality over and beyond traditional detection methods employed in biomedical practice. This article reviews theoretical and empirical work using the allostatic load model vis-a-vis the effects of chronic stress on physical and mental health. Specific risk and protective factors associated with increased allostatic load are elucidated and policies for promoting successful aging are proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Decompressive Craniectomy Is Not an Independent Risk Factor for Communicating Hydrocephalus in Patients With Increased Intracranial Pressure	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Cerebrovascular accident; Cranioplasty; Decompressive craniectomy; Hemicraniectomy; Hydrocephalus; Intracranial pressure; Malignant middle cerebral artery territory infarction	ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; SINUS THROMBOSIS; HEMICRANIECTOMY; INFARCTION	BACKGROUND: It was recently suggested that communicating hydrocephalus is an almost universal finding after hemicraniectomy and that early cranioplasty may prevent the need for permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a study in an attempt to verify these findings. METHODS: The medical records of all patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy for medically refractory elevated intracranial pressure between 2001 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, or head trauma were excluded. Hydrocephalus was classified as internal or external and as clinically significant or asymptomatic. RESULTS: The patient population consisted of 17 patients, 8 men and 9 women, with a median age of 44 years (range, 27-53 years). Etiologies included malignant middle cerebral artery territory infarction in 12 patients, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic cerebrovascular accident in 2 patients, dural sinus thrombosis in 2 patients, and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident in 1 patient. The extent of craniectomy ranged from a large bone flap in 4 patients to a standard hemicraniectomy in 13 patients. Two patients died and 1 was lost to follow-up during the acute stage. The remaining 14 patients underwent cranioplasty after a median interval of 21 days (range, 3-42 days). In none of these patients did clinically significant hydrocephalus develop requiring cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Asymptomatic extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid collections developed in 2 patients that resolved spontaneously after cranioplasty. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, contrary to some beliefs, hydrocephalus does not frequently occur after decompressive craniectomy.

Alteration of infant attention and activity by polychlorinated biphenyls: Unravelling critical windows of susceptibility using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling	NEUROTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Polychlorinated biphenyls; Behaviour; Infants; Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling; Prenatal; Postnatal	PRENATAL PCB EXPOSURE; ASSESSMENT SCALE NBAS; POSTNATAL EXPOSURE; LEAD-EXPOSURE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ARCTIC QUEBEC; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIOR	Pre- and postnatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can impair behavioural function in animal models at doses within the range at which humans are commonly exposed. Yet, epidemiologic studies conducted in the US and Europe are inconsistent with regard to the developmental effects of lactational exposure to these chemicals. This inconsistency may be due to limitations in the current methodological approaches for assessing postnatal exposure to PCBs. Our study used a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to simulate blood PCB levels during specific pre- and postnatal periods and to evaluate the relation of those levels to infant behaviour. A previously validated PBPK model was used to simulate infant blood PCB-153 levels at delivery and on a month-by-month basis during the first year of life for Inuit infants enrolled in a longitudinal birth cohort. Infant behaviour was assessed using the Behaviour Rating Scales (BRS) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II) at 11 months of age and video coding of inattention and activity measured during the administration of the mental development subscale of the BSID-II. The estimated pre- and postnatal PCB exposure measures predicted significant increases in inattention and activity at 11 months. Whereas inattention was related to prenatal exposure, activity level, measured by non-elicited activity, was best predicted by postnatal exposure, with the strongest association obtained for simulated PCB levels during the 4th month of life. These findings are consistent with previous reports indicating PCB-induced behavioural alteration in attention and activity level. Simulated infant toxicokinetic profiles for the first year of life revealed windows of susceptibility during which PCBs may impair infant attention and activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Incidence of self-limiting back pain in children following caudal blockade: an exploratory study	PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA			English	Article						caudal blockade; back pain; pediatric regional anesthesia	EPIDURAL-ANESTHESIA; REGIONAL ANESTHESIA	P>Background: Currently, in pediatric anesthesia, there is no evidence-based information available to pediatric patients and their parents regarding the incidence of back pain after neuraxial injections performed for postoperative analgesia. Back pain postepidural blockade has been reported in numerous studies with adult patients; however, it has not been investigated in children. The main objective of this study is to examine the incidence of back pain symptoms after caudal blockade (early and late onset) in children. Methods: Patients under the age of 18 years, who received caudal blockade at the Montreal Children's Hospital between July 2006 and December 2008 were recruited in this prospective observational study. Back pain was measured prospectively by patient self-report and parental observation during the 15-day postoperative period. Patients, or their parents, were contacted by phone on postoperative day 2 (POD2) and postoperative day 15 (POD15) to answer a seven-item symptom questionnaire. Results: In a sample of 135 children, the incidence of back pain symptoms was 4.7% and 1.1% on POD2 and POD15, respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study provide support that transient self-limiting back pain after caudal blockade does occur in pediatric patients. Clinically, this is useful information for physicians to provide to their patients. An exploration of factors that may be associated with back pain following caudal blockade in children is an interesting area of future research.

Mice Doubly-Deficient in Lysosomal Hexosaminidase A and Neuraminidase 4 Show Epileptic Crises and Rapid Neuronal Loss	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							INDUCED INTRACEREBRAL HEMATOMA; TAY-SACHS-DISEASE; TARGETED DISRUPTION; SANDHOFF-DISEASES; MOLECULAR-CLONING; MOUSE MODELS; HEXA GENE; SIALIDASE; NEU4; EXPRESSION	Tay-Sachs disease is a severe lysosomal disorder caused by mutations in the HexA gene coding for the a-subunit of lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase A, which converts G(M2) to G(M3) ganglioside. Hexa(-/-) mice, depleted of beta-hexosaminidase A, remain asymptomatic to 1 year of age, because they catabolise G(M2) ganglioside via a lysosomal sialidase into glycolipid G(A2), which is further processed by beta-hexosaminidase B to lactosyl-ceramide, thereby bypassing the b-hexosaminidase A defect. Since this bypass is not effective in humans, infantile Tay-Sachs disease is fatal in the first years of life. Previously, we identified a novel ganglioside metabolizing sialidase, Neu4, abundantly expressed in mouse brain neurons. Now we demonstrate that mice with targeted disruption of both Neu4 and Hexa genes (Neu4(-/-); Hexa(-/-)) show epileptic seizures with 40% penetrance correlating with polyspike discharges on the cortical electrodes of the electroencephalogram. Single knockout Hexa(-/-) or Neu4(-/-) siblings do not show such symptoms. Further, double-knockout but not single-knockout mice have multiple degenerating neurons in the cortex and hippocampus and multiple layers of cortical neurons accumulating G(M2) ganglioside. Together, our data suggest that the Neu4 block exacerbates the disease in Hexa(-/-) mice, indicating that Neu4 is a modifier gene in the mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease, reducing the disease severity through the metabolic bypass. However, while disease severity in the double mutant is increased, it is not profound suggesting that Neu4 is not the only sialidase contributing to the metabolic bypass in Hexa(-/-) mice.

In the last 10 years, several user-friendly predictive tools have been developed to help clinicians in decision-making process before and after radical prostatectomy. OBJECTIVE. To review the most known and used predictive models in pre-operative and post-operative setting. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION. A structured, comprehensive literature review was performed using data retrieved from recent review articles, original articles, and abstracts. Used keywords were predictive models, nomograms, look-up tables, classification and regression-tree analysis, artificial neural networks, and radical prostatectomy. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS. A great amount of predictive models has been provided in oncology setting: nomograms, look-up tables, classification and regression-tree analysis, propensity scores, risk-group stratification models, and artificial neural networks. Pre-surgery predictive tools offer the opportunity of getting the most evidence-based and individualized selection of available treatment alternatives. Post-operative predictive models usually provide higher accuracy relative to the pre-surgery models. CONCLUSIONS. Decisions and treatment should be tailored to each individual patient and to the specific characteristics of patients. A number of available predictive models represent a tool to provide accurate prediction of cancer natural history and to improve patients' care. Prostate 70: 1371-1378, 2010.

Toward a Model of Cognitive Insight in First-Episode Psychosis: Verbal Memory and Hippocampal Structure	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						awareness of illness; cognition; magnetic resonance imaging; neuroimaging; first-episode schizophrenia; overconfidence	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POOR INSIGHT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; METAANALYSIS; DISORDERS; UNAWARENESS; DEPRESSION; DELUSIONS; ILLNESS	Our previous work has linked verbal learning and memory with cognitive insight, but not clinical insight, in individuals with a first-episode psychosis (FEP). The current study reassessed the neurocognitive basis of cognitive and clinical insight and explored their neural basis in 61 FEP patients. Cognitive insight was measured with the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) and clinical insight with the Scale to assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). Global measures for 7 domains of cognition were examined. Hippocampi were manually segmented in to 3 parts: the body, head, and tail. Verbal learning and memory significantly correlated with the BCIS composite index. Composite index scores were significantly associated with total left hippocampal (HC) volume; partial correlations, however, revealed that this relationship was attributable largely to verbal memory performance. The BCIS self-certainty subscale significantly and inversely correlated with bilateral HC volumes, and these associations were independent of verbal learning and memory performance. The BCIS self-reflectiveness subscale significantly correlated with verbal learning and memory but not with HC volume. No significant correlations emerged between the SUMD and verbal memory or HC volume. These results strengthen our previous assertion that in individuals with an FEP cognitive insight may rely on memory whereby current experiences are appraised based on previous ones. The HC may be a viable location among others for the brain system that underlies aspects of cognitive insight in individuals with an FEP.

The purpose of the present study was to examine potential sex differences in performance and pattern of brain activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients relative to control participants. Methods: Thirty three schizophrenia patients (17 women and 16 men) were compared to thirty five healthy control participants (17 women and 18 men), while performing a classic mental rotation task (3-D figures). Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar images were acquired on a 3-Tesla Siemens TRIO system. Random-effect analyses were performed using SPM5 (UK Wellcome Institute). Results: Behavioural data revealed a diagnosis-by-sex interaction with healthy men (HM) performing significantly better than schizophrenia men (SZ-M) and no significant difference between healthy women (HW) and schizophrenia women (SZ-W). fMRI results revealed an overall similar pattern of extensive cerebral activations (in the parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex) and deactivations (in the medial prefrontal cortex) in HM and SZ-W during performance of the mental rotation versus control task. In contrast, both HW and SZ-M showed much more restricted activations and no significant deactivations. Conclusions: Sex differences in performance and cerebral activations during mental rotation in schizophrenia patients deviated significantly from what we observed in healthy volunteers. This finding supports and extends existing evidence of a disturbed sexual dimorphism in schizophrenia. Moreover, the results emphasize the importance of including both sexes in neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More specifically, significantly smaller hippocampal volumes but not amygdala volumes have been identified at onset in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients. However, volumetric differences (namely, in the hippocampus) exhibit an ambiguous relationship with long-term outcome. So, we examined the relationship between hippocampus and amygdala volumes and early remission status. Methods: We compared hippocampus and amygdala volumes between 40 non-remitted and 17 remitted FES patients and 57 healthy controls. Amygdala and hippocampus were manually traced with the hippocampus additionally segmented into three parts: body, head, and tail. Remission was defined as mild or less on both positive and negative symptoms over a period of 6 consecutive months as per the 2005 Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group criteria. Results: A significant [group x structure x side] interaction revealed outcome groups differed in hippocampus tail volumes; significantly on the left (non-remitted = 694 +/- 175 mm(3); remitted = 855 +/- 133 mm(3); p = 0.001) with a trend difference on the right (non-remitted = 723 +/- 162 mm(3); remitted = 833 +/- 126 mm(3); p = 0.023). Groups did not differ in body, head, or amygdala volumes bi-laterally. Conclusions: A smaller hippocampal tail volume may represent a neural marker in FES patients who do not achieve early remission after the first 6 months of treatment. The early identification of patients with poor outcome with respect to the hippocampus tail may encourage the search for new, more target-specific, medications in hope of improving outcome and moving us towards a better understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

In most cases, these conditions derive from mechanical or dynamic compression of a segment of a nerve within a narrow osteofibrous tunnel, an opening in a fibrous structure, or a passageway close to a ligament or a muscle. Although the evaluation of nerve disorders primarily relies on neurological examination and electrophysiology, diagnostic imaging is currently used as a complement to help define the site and etiology of nerve compression and exclude other disease possibly underlying the patient' symptoms. In this article, a review of the anatomical and pathological features of nerve entrapments in the distal lower extremity is presented on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, according to the nerve involved.

This article proposes the dynamic c (DME) method to characterize viscoelasticity of small homogeneous soft tissues, as well as the adaptation of the method for vascular applications [vascular dynamic micro-elastography (VDME)]. The technique is based on the generation of relatively high-frequency (240-1100 Hz) monochromatic or transient plane shear waves within the medium and the tracking of these waves from radio-frequency (RF) echoes acquired at 25 MHz with an ultrasound biomicroscope (Vevo 770, Visualsonics). By employing a dedicated shear wave gated strategy during signal acquisition, postprocessed RF sequences could achieve a very high frame rate (16,000 images per s). The proposed technique successfully reconstructed shear wave displacement maps at very high axial (60 rho m) and lateral (250 mu m) spatial resolutions for motions as low as a few mm. An inverse problem formulated as a least-square minimization, involving analytical simulations (for homogenous and vascular geometries) and experimental measurements were performed to retrieve storage (G') and loss (G '') moduli as a function of the shearing frequency. Viscoelasticity measurements of agar-gelatin materials and of a small rat liver were proven feasible. Results on a very thin wall (3 mm thickness) mimicking artery enabled to validate the feasibility and the reliability of the vascular inverse problem formulation. Subsequently, the G' and G '' of a porcine aorta showed that both parameters are strongly dependent on frequency, suggesting that the vascular wall is mechanically governed by complex viscoelastic laws.

Intrinsic optical imaging (IOI) and laser speckle provides measures of deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)) concentrations, blood volume (BV) and blood flow (BF) at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study we used IOI and laser speckle to characterize the hemodynamic response to neuronal activation in the lumbar spinal cord of anaesthetized rats (N = 9). We report consistent temporal variations of HbR, HbO(2), BV and BF located ipsilaterally at L3-L5. Responses were significantly higher when stimulation intensity was increased. Vascular changes extended several millimetres from the epicenter, supporting the venous drainage observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we report proportionally normalized alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan brain trapping constant (alpha-[C-11]MTrp K-N*), an index of serotonin synthesis, in 25 medication-free individuals with MDD and in 25 gender- and age-matched healthy subjects who were studied using positron emission tomography (PET). Comparisons of alpha-[C-11]MTrp K-N* values between the men and women were conducted at the voxel and cluster levels using Statistical Parametric Mapping 2 (SPM2) analysis. In addition, the alpha-[C-11]MTrp K-N* values on both sides of the brain were extracted and compared to identify the left to right differences, as well as the gender differences. Women with MDD displayed higher alpha-[C-11]MTrp K-N* than men in the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, superior parietal lobule, and occipital lingual gyrus. In a matched group of normal subjects the gender differences were opposite from those found in MDD patients. Significant hemispheric differences in fronto-limbic structures between men and women with MDD were also observed. The K-N* extracted from the volumes identified in MDD patients and in male and female normal subjects suggested no significant differences between males and females. In conclusion, depressed women have higher serotonin synthesis in multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system involved with mood regulation, as compared with depressed men. Gender differences in brain serotonin synthesis may be related to higher risk for MDD in women. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because increased expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has been associated with increased neuronal activity we used immediate early gene expression to evaluate the effects of parturition plus interaction with pups during and immediately after delivery to investigate patterns of neural activation in a number of brain areas including Cg2. In the first experiment, we compared levels of immunoreactivity of two immediate early genes: c-Fos and egr-1, among three groups of animals: Cycling, Late Pregnant, and rats perfused 1.5 h postpartum. The average number of Fos and egr-1-ir cells/section were calculated for the Parietal Cortex (ParCx), nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial amygdala (MEA), medial preoptic area (MPOA), supraoptic area (SON) and Cg2. In a second experiment, Fos-ir induction was compared between cycling rats and rats at hour 3 postpartum. Contrary to our hypothesis no changes in expression of either immediate early gene were observed in Cg2. In Experiment 1 however, an upregulation in both early genes was seen in the ParCx, and, of Fos-ir only in the MPOA of postpartum animals. A decrease in Fos-ir was seen in the NAc of late pregnant animals and no significant differences were seen in either immediate early gene expression within the MEA. Interestingly, areas that showed a significant increase in neuronal activation project to Cg2. The possibility of an interaction between these changes and glial cells in Cg2 is discussed.

CRITICAL ROLES FOR THE NETRIN RECEPTOR DELETED IN COLORECTAL CANCER IN DOPAMINERGIC NEURONAL PRECURSOR MIGRATION, AXON GUIDANCE, AND AXON ARBORIZATION	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synaptogenesis; UNC5A; UNC5C; Parkinson's disease; drug addiction; schizophrenia	EMBRYONIC SPINAL-CORD; RAT SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; MICE LACKING; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DCC; GROWTH; EXPRESSION; PATHWAY; UNC-5; CELLS	DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), a receptor for the axon guidance cue netrin-1, is highly expressed by mesencephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons during development; however, the contribution of DCC to DA development remains largely uncharacterized. DA neurons in ventral mesencephalic nuclei also express UNC5 homologue netrin receptors from late embryogenesis to adulthood, raising the possibility that DA axons could be attracted or repelled by netrins. Examining newborn dcc null mice, we report that loss of DCC function results in profound alterations of DA circuitry, including DA progenitor cell migration defects, reduced numbers of DA cells in midbrain nuclei, an anomalous DA ventral commissure, malformed DA innervation of the ventral striatum, and reduced DA innervation of the cerebral cortex. Caspase-3 activation was detected in inappropriately localized DA cells, consistent with apoptosis contributing to reduced cell numbers. Dcc heterozygous mice express reduced levels of DCC protein. Although less severely disrupted than dcc nulls, newborn and adult dcc heterozygotes also have fewer DA neurons in ventral mesenscephalic nuclei. Despite the reduced numbers of DA neurons, newborn dcc heterozygotes and nulls exhibit similar DA innervation density as wild-type littermates in the nucleus accumbens core, and adult dcc heterozygotes exhibit increased DA innervation in medial prefrontal cortex. A trend towards increased innervation of medial prefrontal cortex was detected in newborn dcc heterozygotes, but did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that the increase in adult heterozygotes results from enhanced DA arborization during postnatal development. Consistent with the hypothesis that DCC regulates DA axonal projections, disrupting DCC function in culture inhibits netrin-1 induced DA axon extension and axon branching. Furthermore, disrupting DCC function in isolated DA neurons grown as micro-island cultures reduces the number of autaptic synapses per cell. We conclude that DCC regulates appropriate precursor cell migration, axon guidance, and terminal arborization by DA neurons. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Physiographic, land cover and weather-related variables are used to predict the date of positive temperature onset for 191 station-years at 48 locations in Canada and in Northern US. Preliminary correlation analysis is performed in order to test the relationships between the physiographic/land cover/weather variables and the date of positive temperature onset. Moreover, several different subsets of variables are tested as inputs to each model type. Artificial neural networks can predict the date of positive temperature onset for a given station-year. given its longitude, lake coverage of its drainage basin, and two January-February daily temperature indices, with a split-sample validation root mean square error (RMSE) similar to 8.8 days. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression models allow to predict the onset date with RMSE similar to 9.5 days, given the station's latitude, longitude, lake coverage and one January-February daily temperature index. OLS regression models adjusted on canonical variates combining 13 physiographic/land cover and weather variables achieve prediction performance similar to 9.1 days. The precipitation does not impact much on the onset date prediction for all tested models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Daigle, Anik; Ouarda, Taha B. M.

Little is known on the effects of sound cues on visually-guided hand movements. Methodology/Principal Findings: We recorded the sound produced by the fingers upon contact as participants grasped stimulus objects which were covered with different materials. Then, in a further session the pre-recorded contact sounds were delivered to participants via headphones before or following the initiation of reach-to-grasp movements towards the stimulus objects. Reach-to-grasp movement kinematics were measured under the following conditions: (i) congruent, in which the presented contact sound and the contact sound elicited by the to-be-grasped stimulus corresponded; (ii) incongruent, in which the presented contact sound was different to that generated by the stimulus upon contact; (iii) control, in which a synthetic sound, not associated with a real event, was presented. Facilitation effects were found for congruent trials; interference effects were found for incongruent trials. In a second experiment, the upper and the lower parts of the stimulus were covered with different materials. The presented sound was always congruent with the material covering either the upper or the lower half of the stimulus. Participants consistently placed their fingers on the half of the stimulus that corresponded to the presented contact sound. Conclusions/Significance: Altogether these findings offer a substantial contribution to the current debate about the type of object representations elicited by auditory stimuli and on the multisensory nature of the sensorimotor transformations underlying action.

By employing short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene silencing, here we demonstrate that murine Klf7 gene expression is required for in vitro differentiation of neuroectodermal and mesodermal cells. Specifically, we show a correlation of Klf7 silencing with down-regulation of the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2) and the nerve growth factor (NGF) tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA) using the PC12 neuronal cell line. Similarly, KLF7 inactivation in Klf7-null mice decreases the expression of the neurogenic marker brain lipid-binding protein/fatty acid-binding protein 7 (BLBP/FABP7) in neural stem cells (NSCs). We also report that KIF silencing is detrimental to neuronal and cardiomyocytic differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in addition to altering the adipogenic and osteogenic potential of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Finally, our results suggest that genes that are key for self-renewal of undifferentiated ESCs repress Klf7 expression in ESCs. Together with previous findings, these results provide evidence that KLF7 has a broad spectrum of regulatory functions, which reflect the discrete cellular and molecular contexts in which this transcription factor operates.

Challenges include biological differences between animal models and human diseases, high discordance between DNA and protein expression data and a lack of experimental models to study human complex diseases. To overcome some of these limitations, we developed an integrative approach using animal models, postmortem human material and a combination of high-throughput microarray methods to identify novel molecular markers of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We used laser capture microdissection coupled with microarrays to identify early transcriptome changes occurring in spinal cord motor neurons or surrounding glial cells. Two models of familial motor neuron disease, SOD1(G93A) and TAU(P301L), transgenic mice were used at the presymptomatic stage. Identified gene expression changes were predominantly model-specific. However, several genes were regulated in both models. The relevance of identified genes as clinical biomarkers was tested in the peripheral blood transcriptome of presymptomatic SOD1(G93A) animals using custom-designed ALS microarray. To confirm the relevance of identified genes in human sporadic ALS (SALS), selected corresponding protein products were examined by high-throughput immunoassays using tissue microarrays constructed from human postmortem spinal cord tissues. Genes that were identified by these experiments and located within a linkage region associated with familial ALS/frontotemporal dementia were sequenced in several families. This large-scale gene and protein expression study pointing to distinct molecular mechanisms of TAU- and SOD1-induced motor neuron degeneration identified several new SALS-relevant proteins (CNGA3, CRB1, OTUB2, MMP14, SLK, DDX58, RSPO2) and putative blood biomarkers, including Nefh, Prph and Mgll.

N-cadherin expression levels decrease as precursors differentiate into Schwann cells. In this study, we investigated the distribution of N-cadherin in the developing postnatal and adult rat peripheral nervous system. N-cadherin was found primarily in ensheathing glia throughout development, concentrated at neuron glial or glial glial contacts of the sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and myenteric plexi. In the sciatic nerve, N-cadherin decreases with age and progress of myelination. In adult animals, N-cadherin was found exclusively in nonmyelinating Schwann cells. The distribution of N-cadherin in developing E17 DRG primary cultures is similar to what was observed in vivo. Functional studies of N-cadherin in these cultures, using the antagonist peptide INPISGQ, show a disruption of the attachment between Schwann cells, but no interference in the initial or long-term contact between Schwann cells and axons. We suggest that N-cadherin acts primarily in the adhesion between glial cells during postnatal development. It may form adherents/junctions between nonmyelinating glia, which contribute to the stable tubular structure encapsulating thin caliber axons and thus stabilize the nerve structure as a whole.

Haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 Causes Brachydactyly Mental Retardation Syndrome, with Brachydactyly Type E, Developmental Delays, and Behavioral Problems	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							ALBRIGHT HEREDITARY OSTEODYSTROPHY; CONTROLS CHONDROCYTE HYPERTROPHY; SMITH-MAGENIS-SYNDROME; 2Q37.3 DELETION; AUTISM; DIFFERENTIATION; DELINEATION; PROTEINS; CBFA1; MEF2	Brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR) is associated with a deletion involving chromosome 2q37. BDMR presents with a range of features, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, behavioral abnormalities, sleep disturbance, craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities (including brachydactyly type E), and autism spectrum disorder. To date, only large deletions of 2q37 have been reported, making delineation of a critical region and subsequent identification of candidate genes difficult. We present clinical and molecular analysis of six individuals with overlapping deletions involving 2q37.3 that refine the critical region, reducing the candidate genes from >20 to a single gene, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). Driven by the distinct hand and foot anomalies and similar cognitive features, we identified other cases with clinical findings consistent with BDMR but without a 2q37 deletion, and sequencing of HDAC4 identified de novo mutations, including one intragenic deletion probably disrupting normal splicing and one intragenic insertion that results in a frameshift and premature stop codon. HDAC4 is a histone deacetylase that regulates genes important in bone, muscle, neurological, and cardiac development. Reportedly, Hdac4(-/-) mice have severe bone malformations resulting from premature ossification of developing bones. Data presented here show that deletion or mutation of HDAC4 results in reduced expression of RAI1, which causes Smith-Magenis syndrome when haploinsufficient, providing a link to the overlapping findings in these disorders. Considering the known molecular function of HDAC4 and the mouse knockout phenotype, taken together with deletion or mutation of HDAC4 in multiple subjects with BDMR, we conclude that haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 results in brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome.

Local Neural Processing and the Generation of Dynamic Motor Commands within the Saccadic Premotor Network	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; EXCITATORY BURST NEURONS; ALERT SQUIRREL-MONKEY; BRAIN-STEM AFFERENTS; FIELD POTENTIALS; ABDUCENS NUCLEUS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; OMNIPAUSE NEURONS; DISJUNCTIVE SACCADES	The ability to accurately control movement requires the computation of a precise motor command. However, the computations that take place within premotor pathways to determine the dynamics of movements are not understood. Here we studied the local processing that generates dynamic motor commands by simultaneously recording spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) in the network that commands saccades. We first compared the information encoded by LFPs and spikes recorded from individual premotor and motoneurons (saccadic burst neurons, omnipause neurons, and motoneurons) in monkeys. LFP responses consistent with net depolarizations occurred in association with bursts of spiking activity when saccades were made in a neuron's preferred direction. In contrast, when saccades were made in a neuron's nonpreferred direction, neurons ceased spiking and the associated LFP responses were consistent with net hyperpolarizations. Surprisingly, hyperpolarizing and depolarizing LFPs encoded movement dynamics with equal robustness and accuracy. Second, we compared spiking responses at one hierarchical level of processing to LFPs at the next stage. Latencies and spike-triggered averages of LFP responses were consistent with each neuron's place within this circuit. LFPs reflected relatively local events (<500 mu m) and encoded important features not available from the spiking train (i.e., hyperpolarizing response). Notably, quantification of their time-varying profiles revealed that a precise balance of depolarization and hyperpolarization underlies the production of precise saccadic eye movement commands at both motor and premotor levels. Overall, simultaneous recordings of LFPs and spiking responses provides an effective means for evaluating the local computations that take place to produce accurate motor commands.

It ends quite abruptly'), and (ii) the distinction between reference to events/situations and entities/individuals in the real/actual world versus in hypothetical possible worlds. Cross-sentential referential dependencies are disrupted when the antecedent for a pronoun is embedded in a sentence introducing hypothetical entities (e.g. 'John is considering writing a novel. It ends quite abruptly'). An earlier event-related potential reading study showed such disruptions yielded a P600-like frontal positivity. Here we replicate this effect using auditorily presented sentences and discuss the implications for our understanding of discourse-level language processing.

Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric illness with a varied clinical presentation that has both environmental and genetic origins and that may result from insults to the nervous system that occur throughout development. In line with this, several endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external) nongenetic factors of pregnancy and birth have been related to an increased risk for schizophrenia in later life. These factors include maternal diabetes, low birth weight, older paternal age, winter birth, and prenatal maternal stress, among others. Although each of these nongenetic factors alone slightly increases the risk for schizophrenia, risk increases when these factors combine with each other and with other risk factors. The mechanisms that link each specific risk factor with the occurrence of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. In order to build better models of the illness, researchers will have to address the question of how environmental and genetic risk factors work together in increasing risk and explore to what extent certain underlying risk factors may explain different aspects of the disease.

We have recently shown that functional presynaptic boutons can be formed when neuronal cells are cocultured with surface-modified artificial substrates including poly(D-lysine)-coated beads and supported lipid bilayer-coated beads (Lucido et al. (2009) J. Neurosci. 29, 12449-12466; Gopalakrishnan et al. (2010) ACS Chem. Neurosci. I, 86-94). We demonstrate here, using confocal microscopy combined with immunocytochemistry, that it is possible to isolate such in 14110 presynaptic endings in an exclusive fashion onto glass substrates through a simple "sandwich/lift-off" technique (Perez et al. (2006) Adv. Funct. Mater. 16, 306-312). Isolated presynaptic complexes are capable of releasing and recycling neurotransmitter in response to an external chemical trigger. These bead presynaptic complexes are facile to prepare and are readily dispersible in solution. They are thus compatible with many experimental methods whose focus is the study of the neuronal presynaptic compartment.

Predicting chronic left ventricular dysfunction 90 days after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: An Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction (APEX-AMI) Substudy	AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL			English	Article							PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; END-SYSTOLIC VOLUME; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; MAJOR DETERMINANT; HEART-FAILURE; TRIAL; SIZE; REPERFUSION; MORTALITY	Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of 90-day left ventricular function following acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using variables from clinical presentation, biomarker testing, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Background Identifying patients with acute STEMI who experience adverse remodeling and develop left ventricular dysfunction 3 months post-MI is a priority for guiding subsequent therapy. Methods The Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial tested pexelizumab treatment in STEMI patients presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset who were to undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We studied 64 patients within this trial according to a prespecified substudy that included paired core laboratory delayed-enhancement CMR at days 3 and 90 as well as plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; in picograms per milliliter) measured at randomization and 24 hours. A multivariable model predicting day 90 left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was developed from clinical, biomarker, and imaging findings. Results Patients had a median age of 60 years (52-68), 89% were male, and 60% had anterior STEMI. Time from symptom onset to percutaneous coronary intervention was 3 hours. The median baseline LVEF was 48% (38%-56%) and was 50% (40%-54%) at 90 days: 7 patients (11%) had an LVEF <35% at 90 days. Patients with a lower 90-day LVEF (as a continuous variable) had a higher 24-hour NT-proBNP (P = .02) and a larger baseline infarct size by CMR (median 15% LV [8%-20% LV]) (P < .01). Microvascular obstruction (no reflow) was greater as measured by CMR (median 2.8% [1.4%-6.1%]) in patients with a lower 90-day LVEF (P < .01). Median baseline and 24-hour NT-proBNP levels were 94 pg/mL (54-292 pg/mL) and 1,448 pg/mL (958-2,599 pg/mL), respectively. In a multivariable model with clinical, biomarker, and imaging variables, only 3 variables independently predicted 90-day LVEF: 24-hour NT-proBNP, baseline CMR infarct size, and microvascular obstruction. Conclusions Three key pathophysiologic variables of the post-STEMI myocardium measuring baseline infarct size and the extent of microvascular obstruction on CMR and wall tension (24-hour NT-proBNP) independently predicted 90-day LVEF. Further studies linking these measures with earlier use of clinical therapies may be warranted. (Am Heart J 2010;160:272-8.)

Cardiac oxytocin receptor blockade stimulates adverse cardiac remodeling in ovariectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 299: H265-H274, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00487.2009.-An increasing amount of evidence demonstrates the beneficial role of oxytocin (OT) in the cardiovascular system. Similar actions are attributed to genistein, an isoflavonic phytoestrogen. The treatment with genistein activates the OT system in the aorta of ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low doses of genistein on the OT-induced effects in rat hypertension. The hypothesis tested was that treatment of OVX spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with genistein improves heart structure and heart work through a mechanism involving the specific OT receptor (OTR). OVX SHRs or SD rats were treated with genistein (in mu g/g body wt sc, 10 days) in the presence or absence of an OT antagonist (OTA) [d(CH(2))(5), Tyr(Me)(2), Orn(8)]-vasotocin or a nonspecific estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI-182780). Vehicle-treated OVX rats served as controls. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that left ventricular (LV) OTR, downregulated by ovariectomy, increased in response to genistein. In SHRs or SD rats, this effect was blocked by OTA or ICI-182780 administration. The OTR was mainly localized in microvessels expressing the CD31 marker and colocalized with endothelial nitric oxide synthase. In SHRs, the genistein-stimulated OTR increases were associated with improved fractional shortening, decreased blood pressure (12 mmHg), decreased heart weight-to-body weight ratio, decreased fibrosis, and lowered brain natriuretic peptide in the LV. The prominent finding of the study is the detrimental effect of OTA treatment on the LV of SHRs. OTA treatment of OVX SHRs resulted in a dramatic worsening of ejection fractions and an augmented fibrosis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cardiac OTRs are involved in the regulation of cardiac function of OVX SHRs. The decreases of OTRs may contribute to cardiac pathology following menopause.

While several phase II studies have been finalized or are in progress, no definitive prospective randomized studies comparing HSCT versus alternative therapies for MS have been completed. In this conference report of North American and European experts who are involved in the care of MS patients, including neurologists and HSCT physicians, and representatives of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), we ( I) critically review progress to date in HSCT for MS; (2) describe current registry based projects including long-term follow-up studies in HSCT for MS and harmonization of the MS disease-specific research forms that will be used in future by both databases; (3) discuss challenges in study design for a prospective randomized clinical trial of HSCT versus alternative therapy for MS such as feasibility, and the importance of multidisciplinary clinical teams, need for a large sample size and duration of observation required for outcomes assessment; and (4) address future directions in HSCT therapy for MS. To undertake a definitive multicenter clinical trial in autologous HSCT for MS, it will be important to begin well in advance to assemble the team, evaluate proposals for study design, and consider options for the infrastructure and logistical support that will be needed. International collaboration, including partnership with the CIBMTR and EBMT, may be desirable and may in fact be critical for successful completion of a definitive comparative study.

In this work, an injectable subcutaneous organogel system based on safflower oil and a modified-tyrosine organogelator was evaluated in vivo for the delivery of rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Different implant formulations were injected and the plasmatic drug concentration was assayed for up to 35 days. In parallel, the inhibition of AChE in different brain sections and the biocompatibility of the implants were monitored. The pharmacokinetic profiles were found to be influenced by the gel composition, injected dose and volume of the implant. The sustained delivery of rivastigmine was accompanied by a significant prolonged inhibition of AChE in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in memory. The implant induced only a minimal to mild chronic inflammation and fibrosis, which was comparable to poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) in situ-forming implants. These findings suggest that tyrosine-based organogels could represent an alternative approach to current formulations for the sustained delivery of cholinesterase inhibitors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Medicinal chemistry efforts have identified a quinolinone class of potent NPSR antagonists that readily cross the blood-brain barrier. We detail here optimization efforts resulting in the identification of a potent NPSR antagonist which dose-dependently and specifically inhibited (125)I-NPS binding in the CNS when administered to rats.

Neural Tube Defects Induced by Folate Deficiency in Mutant Curly Tail (Grhl3) Embryos Are Associated with Alteration in Folate One-Carbon Metabolism but Are Unlikely to Result from Diminished Methylation	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART A-CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR TERATOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Neural Tube Defects	SEP 12-15, 2009	Burlington, VT	Natl Ctr Dis Control & Prevention, Natl Inst Hlth, Texas A&M Inst Genomic Med, Spectrum Hlth Hosp		neural tube defects; folate; methylation; curly tail; inositol	METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY; LOW DIETARY-FOLATE; MOUSE EMBRYOS; SPLOTCH MICE; SPINA-BIFIDA; FOLIC-ACID; MODEL; POLYMORPHISMS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; NEURULATION	BACKGROUND: Folate one-carbon metabolism has been implicated as a determinant of susceptibility to neural tube defects (NTDs), owing to the preventive effect of maternal folic acid supplementation and the higher risk associated with markers of diminished folate status METHODS: Folate one-carbon metabolism was compared in curly tall (ct/ct) and genetically matched congenic (+(ct)/+(ct)) mouse strains using the deoxyuridine suppression test in embryonic fibroblast cells and by quantifying s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in embryos using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A possible genetic interaction between curly tail and a null allele of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) was investigated by generation of compound mutant embryos RESULTS: There was no deficit in thymidylate biosynthesis in ct/ct cells, but incorporation of exogenous thymidine was lower than in +(ct)/+(ct) cells. in +(ct)/+(ct) embryos the SAM/SAH ratio was diminished by dietary folate deficiency and normalized by folic acid or myo-mositol treatment, in association with prevention of NTDs. In contrast, folate deficiency caused a significant increase in the SAM/SAH ratio in ct/ct embryos. Loss of MTHFR function in curly tail embryos significantly reduced the SAM/SAH ratio but did not cause cranial NTDs or alter the frequency of caudal NTDs. CONCLUSIONS: Curly tall fibroblasts and embryos, in which Grhl3 expression is reduced, display alterations in one-carbon metabolism, particularly in the response to folate deficiency, compared to genetically matched congenic controls in which Grhl3 is unaffected. However, unlike folate deficiency, diminished methylation potential appears to be insufficient to cause cranial NTDs in the curly tail strain, nor does it increase the frequency of caudal NTDs Birth Defects Research (Part A) 88:612-618,2010.

This study sought to examine psychology graduate student training in the area of developmental disability across Canada. We invited students from every Canadian Psychological Association accredited Clinical Psychology, Clinical Neuropsychology, and Counselling Psychology program to participate in an online survey, distributed through university email lists. Three hundred and three students reported on the developmental disability content within their training and coursework, their perception of the adequacy of that content, and their ideas for program improvement. Results indicated that the majority of students believed it important to have training in developmental disability, yet struggled to obtain adequate didactic and experiential opportunities. The lack of sufficient training was most pronounced for students whose training was adult-focused, but was also high for students with a life span or child focus. We discuss different possibilities for increasing developmental disability training opportunities, including integrating its content within courses on assessment and diagnosis, psychotherapy, and ethics, and providing students with supervision from psychologists who work with this population.

Neurochemical effects of benzodiazepine and morphine on freshwater mussels	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Benzodiazepines; Morphine; Dopamine; Serotonin; Glutamate; GABA; Acetylcholinesterase; Oxidative stress; Municipal effluents; Mussels	MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS; ELLIPTIO-COMPLANATA; ESTROGENIC CONTAMINATION; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; PHAGOCYTIC-ACTIVITY; BIVALVE MOLLUSKS; WASTE-WATER; SEROTONIN; TISSUES; CARBAMAZEPINE	The purpose of this study was to examine the neurochemical effects of morphine, diazepam, a common benzodiazepine, and an effluent concentrate on the endemic freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed to the drugs and to the solid-phase concentrate of a municipal effluent and left to stand at 15 degrees C for 48h. Neurochemical effects were determined by monitoring changes in dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the visceral mass (containing the nerve ganglia) of mussels. The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), dopamine and serotonin-dependent adenylyl cyclase (ADC) were also determined in the mussels. Oxidative stress was determined by tracking changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions. The results revealed that the drugs and the effluent extract were biologically active in mussels. Morphine reduced serotonin and increased dopamine in mussel tissues while reducing AChE activity and increasing GABA levels. This suggests the induction of a relaxation state in mussels. Diazepam also reduced serotonin levels but produced no change in dopamine levels. However, dopamine-sensitive ADC activity was readily activated, indicating the potential effect on opiate signaling. Diazepam increased glutamate levels slightly, but AChE remained stable. The increase in both dopamine ADC activity and glutamate concentrations was also associated with greater oxidative stress on the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions in cells. A comparison of the global response pattern of these drugs with those of the effluent extract revealed only a relative proximity to morphine. In conclusion, the data warrant more studies on the analysis of opiates and benzodiazepines in municipal effluents to better address the potential environmental hazard of these neuroactive drug classes to aquatic organisms.

A major mechanism for this is through altering the amount of proteins by regulating their translation. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the elucidation of the mechanisms by which neurons regulate translation during synaptic plasticity. Particular focus will be on the different transduction mechanisms that selectively target distinct elements of the mRNA in the regulation of translation during plasticity.

This review will focus mainly on recent findings concerning graph theoretical analysis of human brain networks with a variety of imaging modalities, including structural MRI, diffusion MRI, functional MRI, and EEG/MEG. Recent findings Recent studies have utilized graph theoretical approaches to investigate the organizational principles of brain networks. These studies have consistently shown many important statistical properties underlying the topological organization of the human brain, including modularity, small-worldness, and the existence of highly connected network hubs. Importantly, these quantifiable network properties were found to change during normal development, aging, and various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Moreover, several studies have also suggested that these network properties correlate with behavioral and genetic factors. Summary The exciting research regarding graph theoretical analysis of brain connectivity yields truly integrative and comprehensive descriptions of the structural and functional organization of the human brain, which provides important implications for health and disease. Future research will most likely involve integrative models of brain structural and functional connectivity with multimodal neuroimaging data, exploring whether graph-based brain network analysis could yield reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment.

We aimed to assess the long-term outcome in children with severe unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia (UCH). Method As part of a retrospective study we describe neuroimaging features, clinical findings, and cognitive outcomes of seven children with UCH (five males, two females; age at first magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]: median 1y 3mo, range 9d-8y 10mo; age at latest follow-up: median 6y 6mo, range 2y 3mo-14y 11mo). Results One child had abnormalities on prenatal MRI at 21 weeks' gestation. The left cerebellar hemisphere was affected in five children, and the right hemisphere in two children. The vermis was involved in five children. The volume of the posterior fossa was variable. At the latest follow-up, neurological findings included truncal ataxia and muscular hypotonia in five children, limb ataxia in three patients, and head nodding in two patients. Three children had learning disability*, five had speech and language disorders, and one had a severe behavioural disorder. Interpretation Severe UCH is a residual change after a disruptive prenatal cerebellar insult, most likely haemorrhagic. The outcome is variable, ranging from almost normal development to marked developmental impairment. Ataxia is a frequent but not a leading sign. It seems that involvement of the cerebellar vermis is often, but not consistently, associated with a poorer cognitive outcome, whereas an intact vermis is associated with normal outcome and no truncal ataxia.

The neurological status as assessed by the Amiel-Tison Neurological Assessments (ATNA) has been proposed as one such potential marker. However, the stability of the ATNA has never been formally assessed. Aim: This study aimed to assess the stability of the ATNA. Study design: A total of 89 infants born preterm with a gestational age ranging from 29 0/7 to 37 0/7 weeks inclusively and a birth weight below 2500 g were followed during their first two years of life (term age, 4, 8, 12 and 24 months corrected age) in a clinical context. Results: Of these, 62 children (69.7%) were classified in the same category on the five assessments while 14 (15.7%) had only one divergent result and 13 (14.6%) had two divergent results over the follow-up. The neurological status throughout the assessments remains stable according to Cochran's Q Conclusion: As the neurological status identified by the ATNA remained stable throughout repeated measurements in a regular clinical context and has been shown to correlate with later developmental performances, it should be included as a criterion to target children at risk and used during follow-up.

The excitotoxic mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of interneurons have not been identified but could involve group I metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes (mGluR1/5), which have generally proconvulsive actions and activate prominent cationic currents and calcium responses specifically in O/A-INs. Methods: In this study, we examine the role of mGluR1/5 in interneurons during epileptiform activity using whole-cell recordings from CA1 O/A-INs and selective antagonists of mGluR1 alpha (LY367385) and mGluR5 (MPEP) in a disinhibited rat hippocampal slice model of epileptiform activity. Results: Our data indicate more prominent epileptiform burst discharges and paroxysmal depolarizations (PDs) in O/A-INs than in interneurons located at the border of strata radiatum and lacunosum/moleculare (R/LM-INs). In addition, mGluR1 and mGluR5 significantly contributed to epileptiform responses in O/A-INs but not in R/LM-INs. Epileptiform burst discharges in O/A-INs were partly dependent on mGluR5. PDs and associated postsynaptic currents were dependent on both mGluR1 alpha and mGluR5. These receptors contributed differently to postsynaptic currents underlying PDs, with mGluR5 contributing to the fast and slow components and mGluR1 alpha to the slow component. Discussion: These findings support interneuron subtype-specific activation and differential contributions of mGluR1 alpha and mGluR5 to epileptiform activity in O/A-INs, which could be important for their selective vulnerability in TLE.

The location of the absence seizures generators in IGEs is thought to involve interplay between various components of thalamocortical circuits; we have recently postulated that medication resistance may, in part, be related to the location of the GSWD generators [Szaflarski JP, Lindsell CJ, Zakaria T, Banks C, Privitera MD. Epilepsy Behav. 2010;17:525-30]. In the present study we hypothesized that patients with medication-refractory IGE (R-IGE) and continued absence seizures may have GSWD generators in locations other than the thalamus, as typically seen in patients with IGE. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the location of the GSWD generators in patients with R-ICE using EEG/fMRI. Eighty-three patients with ICE received concurrent EEG/fMRI at 4 T. Nine of them (aged 15-55) experienced absence seizures during EEG/fMRI and were included; all were diagnosed with R-IGE. Subjects participated in up to three 20-minute EEG/fMRI sessions (400 volumes, TR = 3 seconds) performed at 4 T. After removal of fMRI and ballistocardiographic artifacts, 36 absence seizures were identified. Statistical parametric maps were generated for each of these sessions correlating seizures to BOLD response. Timing differences between brain regions were tested using statistical parametric maps generated by modeling seizures with onset times shifted relative to the GSWD onsets. Although thalamic BOLD responses peaked approximately 6 seconds after the onset of absence seizures, other areas including the prefrontal and dorsolateral cortices showed brief and nonsustained peaks occurring similar to 2 seconds prior to the maximum of the thalamic peak. Temporal lobe peaks occurred at the same time as the thalamic peak, with a cerebellar peak occurring similar to 1 second later. Confirmatory analysis averaging cross-correlation between cortical and thalamic regions of interest across seizures corroborated these findings. Finally, Granger causality analysis showed effective connectivity directed from frontal lobe to thalamus, supporting the notion of earlier frontal than thalamic involvement. The results of this study support our original hypothesis and indicate that in the patients with R-IGE studied, absence seizures may be initiated by widespread cortical (frontal and parietal) areas and sustained in subcortical (thalamic) regions, suggesting that the examined patients have cortical onset epilepsy with propagation to thalamus.

The anatomical connectivity of these areas with parietal and temporal cortical regions was recently examined in an autoradiographic tract-tracing study in the macaque monkey. Studies suggest strong correspondence between human resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data and experimentally demonstrated anatomical connections in non-human primates. Accordingly, we hypothesized that areas 6, 44 and 45 of the human brain would exhibit patterns of RSFC consistent with patterns of anatomical connectivity observed in the macaque. In a primary analysis, we examined the RSFC associated with regions-of-interest placed in ventrolateral frontal areas 6, 44 and 45, on the basis of local sulcal and gyral anatomy. We validated the results of the primary hypothesis-driven analysis with a data-driven partitioning of ventrolateral frontal cortex into regions exhibiting distinct RSFC patterns, using a spectral clustering algorithm. The RSFC of ventrolateral frontal areas 6, 44 and 45 was consistent with patterns of anatomical connectivity shown in the macaque. We observed a striking dissociation between RSFC for the ventral part of area 6 that is involved in orofacial motor control and RSFC associated with Broca's region (areas 44 and 45). These findings indicate rich and differential RSFC patterns for the ventrolateral frontal areas controlling language production, consistent with known anatomical connectivity in the macaque brain, and suggest conservation of connectivity during the evolution of the primate brain.

GABAergic neurons intermingled with orexin and MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus discharge maximally during sleep	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						arousal; paradoxical sleep; rapid eye movement sleep; rat; slow-wave sleep; vesicular GABA transporter	BASAL FOREBRAIN NEURONS; C-FOS EXPRESSION; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; LOCUS-COERULEUS; HYPOCRETIN/OREXIN NEURONS; NORADRENERGIC NEURONS; WAKE CYCLE; REM-SLEEP; GABA; RAT	The lateral hypothalamus (LH), where wake-active orexin (Orx)-containing neurons are located, has been considered a waking center. Yet, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-containing neurons are codistributed therein with Orx neurons and, in contrast to them, are active during sleep, not waking. In the present study employing juxtacellular recording and labeling of neurons with Neurobiotin (Nb) in naturally sleeping-waking head-fixed rats, we identified another population of intermingled sleep-active cells, which do not contain MCH (or Orx), but utilize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter. The 'sleep-max' active neurons represented 53% of Nb-labeled MCH-(and Orx) immunonegative (-) cells recorded in the LH. For identification of their neurotransmitter, Nb-labeled varicosities of the Nb-labeled/MCH- neurons were sought within sections adjacent to the Nb-labeled soma and immunostained for the vesicular transporter for GABA (VGAT) or for glutamate. A small proportion of sleep-max Nb+/MCH- neurons (19%) discharged maximally during slow-wave sleep (called 'S-max') in positive correlation with delta electroencephalogram activity, and from VGAT staining of Nb-labeled varicosities appeared to be GABAergic. The vast proportion of sleep-max Nb+/MCH- neurons (81%) discharged maximally during paradoxical sleep (PS, called 'P-max') in negative correlation with electromyogram amplitude, and from Nb-labeled varicosities also appeared to be predominantly GABAergic. Given their discharge profiles across the sleep-wake cycle, P-max together with S-max GABAergic neurons could thus serve to inhibit other neurons of the arousal systems, including local Orx neurons in the LH. They could accordingly dampen arousal with muscle tone and promote sleep, including PS with muscle atonia.

Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Three tertiary level NICUs in Canada. Participants: 114 neonates, 25-40 weeks gestational age (GA) undergoing painful procedures. Main Outcome Measures: Physical and behavioural pain indicators and pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain interventions. Results: 114 neonates at high (Cohort A, n = 35), moderate (Cohort B, n = 25) and low (Cohort C, n = 54) risk of NI were observed during 254 painful procedures performed by 147 health professionals. Physical pain indicators were used more frequently by health professionals to assess pain with Cohorts A and B than C (p < .05). Behavioural pain indicators were used similarly across Cohorts. Nonpharmacological interventions were implemented most frequently for pain management. Physical interventions were used with 84% of procedures across Cohorts; particularly for the most invasive procedures. Infants with the highest NI risk (Cohort A) received the most behavioural interventions (p < .05) irrespective of procedural invasiveness. Pharmacological interventions were implemented with 23.2% of procedures; Cohort B received pharmacological interventions most frequently (Cohort B > A, B > C, p < .05) and for increasingly invasive procedures (p < .05). Conclusions: Health professionals use multidimensional indicators to assess neonatal pain. Nonpharmacological interventions dominate pain management. NI risk status and procedure invasiveness are important contextual factors in neonatal pain assessment and management.

In humans, there is preliminary evidence showing that 5-HT is involved in the FM pathophysiology. In the current endophenotyping study, we sought to investigate, for the first time in humans, the relationships between the serotonin transporter promoter region (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism and experimentally-induced pain perception/inhibition in healthy controls (HC) and FM patients. Methods: Participants were 58 FM patients and 60 HC, who did not differ in age, sex or menstrual cycle. Thermal stimuli were used to measure pain thresholds. Pain inhibition was elicited using a tonic thermal test (Peltier thermode) administered before and after activation of the diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) by means of a cold-pressor test (CPT). Results: Thermal pain thresholds were higher in HC compared to FM patients. Pain ratings during the CPT were lower in HC, relative to FM patients. Also, DNIC efficacy was stronger in HC compared to FM patients. However, there was no relationship between 5-HTTLPR and experimentally-induced pain perception/inhibition. Discussion: Our results further confirm that FM is associated with thermal hyperalgesia and deficient DNIC. However, we found no evidence showing that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism influences pain perception and DNIC. Potential reasons for this negative result will be discussed. Further endophenotyping studies of 5-HT-related gene polymorphisms are required to ascertain the potential relationships between 5-HT and human pain perception/inhibition.

J	Norouzi-Gheidari, N; Archambault, P				Norouzi-Gheidari, Nahid; Archambault, Philippe			Absence of equifinality of hand position in a double-step unloading task	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Equifinality; Unloading; EMG; Equilibrium point hypothesis; Perturbation; Motor control	EQUILIBRIUM-POINT HYPOTHESIS; MOTOR CONTROL; HUMAN ARM; REACHING MOVEMENTS; COMPLIANT CHARACTERISTICS; HETEROGENIC REFLEXES; FORCE PERTURBATIONS; POSTURAL CONTROL; UNEXPECTED LOAD; STRETCH REFLEX	Equifinality, during arm reaching movements, relates to the capacity of the neuromuscular system to attain the same final position in the presence or absence of transient perturbations. There have been several controversies regarding equifinality in the literature. A brief elastic perturbation, applied during a fast arm movement or just before its initiation, typically does not affect final arm position. On the other hand, several experiments have shown that velocity-dependent perturbations, such as Coriolis force or negative damping, while transient in nature, have a significant effect on final arm position when compared to unperturbed movements. In this study, an unloading paradigm was used to study the role of reflexes with respect to equifinality. The effects on final arm position of suddenly decreasing a static load maintained by fourteen subjects were analyzed. Subjects maintained an initial load produced by a double-joint manipulandum moving in the horizontal plane. The load was suddenly decreased, either in one or in two successive steps with different time intervals, resulting in a rapid reflex-mediated change in arm position. Unloading led to short-latency changes in the activity of shoulder and elbow muscles and significant variations in tonic activity. It was found that the final hand position was shorter for double- versus single-step unloading if the time between two successive changes in load was greater than 100 ms. With a shorter time interval, the final hand positions were the same. This difference in final hand positions was inversely proportional to the hand velocity at the time of the second change in load. Further, agonist/antagonist co-activation increased in double-step unloading. Thus, the change in both the load and the movement velocity may influence the magnitude of the unloading reflex. This may be indicative of a dependence of stretch reflexes on velocity. Perturbation may cause a reflex-mediated increase in joint stiffness, which could explain why equifinality is not preserved after some perturbations, such as velocity-dependant external forces.

Children generally display characteristic cranio-facial dysmorphology and represent typical severe cases of foetal alcohol syndrome. Binge-like rodent model systems have concluded that third trimester equivalent ethanol exposure results in widespread apoptosis in the visual system from the retina to the visual cortex. Neither clinical nor animal studies address the consequences of more moderate prenatal ethanol exposure on the visual system. The current study uses a naturalistic and voluntary consumption approach in non-human primates (Chlorocebus sabeus) in order to more closely model prenatal ethanol consumption patterns in humans. Pregnant vervet monkeys voluntarily drank on average 2.418 +/- A 0.296 g etoh/kg/day four times a week during the third trimester. Using unbiased stereology, we estimated the neuronal and glial population of the parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) following foetal alcohol exposure (FAE) in infant subjects. Layer volume and total number of neurons and glia in the LGN of the FAE subjects were not significantly different from age-matched control subjects. The M neuronal soma size of FAE subjects, however, was significantly reduced to resemble the size of the P-neurons. These results suggest that alterations at the level of morphology and anatomy of the M-neurons may lead to behavioural deficits associated with the integrity of the dorsal visual pathway.	[Papia, M.

Gesture imitation in musicians and non-musicians	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Action-imitation; Mirror neuron system; Observational learning; Musical training	HAND ACTIONS; MOTOR; FMRI; ABILITIES; EXPERTISE	Imitation plays a crucial role in the learning of many complex motor skills. Recent behavioral and neuroimaging evidence suggests that the ability to imitate is influenced by past experience, such as musical training. To investigate the impact of musical training on motor imitation, musicians and non-musicians were tested on their ability to imitate videoclips of simple and complex two-handed gestures taken from American Sign Language. Participants viewed a set of 30 gestures, one at a time, and imitated them immediately after presentation. Participants' imitations were videotaped and scored off-line by raters blind to participant group. Imitation performance was assessed by a rating of performance accuracy, where the arm, hand, and finger components of the gestures were rated separately on a 5-point scale (1 = unrecognizable; 5 = exact imitation). A global accuracy score (PAglobal) was calculated by summing the three components. Response duration compared to the model (%MTdiff), and reaction time (RT) were also assessed. Results indicated that musicians were able to imitate more accurately than non-musicians, reflected by significantly higher PAglobal and lower %MTdiff scores. Furthermore, the greatest difference in performance was for the fine-motor (finger) gesture component. These findings support the view that the ability to imitate is influenced by experience. This is consistent with generalist theories of motor imitation, which explain imitation in terms of links between perceptual and motor action representations that become strengthened through experience. It is also likely that musical training contributed to the ability to imitate manual gestures by influencing the personal action repertoire of musicians.

The Contrast Dependence of the Cortical fMRI Deficit in Amblyopia; a Selective Loss at Higher Contrasts	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						amblyopia; cortex; fMRI; contrast sensitivity; spatial frequency mapping; spatial deficit; low-spatial frequency; tuning	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; SPATIAL LOCALIZATION DEFICIT; VISUAL-CORTEX; STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY MEG; GANGLION-CELLS; GLOBAL MOTION; NEURAL BASIS; PERCEPTION; HUMANS	Although there is general agreement that the fMRI cortical response is reduced in humans with amblyopia, the deficit is subtle and has little correlation with threshold-based psychophysics. From a purely contrast sensitivity perspective, one would expect fMRI responses to be selectively reduced for stimuli of low contrasts. However, to date, all fMRI stimuli used in studies of amblyopia have been of high contrast. Furthermore, if the deficit is selective for low contrasts, one would expect it to reflect a selective M-cell loss, because M-cells have much higher contrast gain than P-cells and make a larger contribution to the threshold detection of stimuli of low spatial and medium temporal frequencies. To test these two predictions, we compared % BOLD response between the eyes of normals and amblyopes for low- and high-contrast stimuli using a phase-encoded design. The results suggest that the fMRI deficit in amblyopia depends upon stimulus contrast and that it is greater at high contrasts. This is consistent with a selective P-cell contrast deficit at a precortical or early cortical site. Hum Brain Mapp 31:1233-1248, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

By using the fixed point theory and Liapunov functional, we prove that a recurrent neural network might have a unique equilibrium point which is unstable. This particular type of instability, combined with the boundedness of the solutions of the system, will force the network to generate a permanent oscillation. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for these oscillations are obtained. Simple and practical criteria for fixing the range of parameters in this network are also derived. Typical simulation examples are presented.

The variational model is adapted using an estimated background according to the availability of the verso side of the document image. Furthermore, for the latter case, a more advanced model based on a global control, the flow field, is introduced. The solution of each resulting model is obtained using wavelet shrinkage or a time-stepping scheme, depending on the complexity and nonlinearity of the models. When both sides of the document are available, the proposed model uses the reverse diffusion process for the enhancement of double-sided document images. The results of experiments with real and synthesized samples are promising. The proposed model, which is robust with respect to noise and complex background, can also be applied to other fields of image processing.

Trospium chloride has no effect on memory testing and is assay undetectable in the central nervous system of older patients with overactive bladder	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article							BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; TOLTERODINE; OXYBUTYNIN; DARIFENACIN; SLEEP; DRUGS	P>Background: Muscarinic receptors in the brain play an important role in cognitive function, especially memory, and there is growing awareness that specific antimuscarinic drugs for overactive bladder (OAB) may have adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects. Selection of an antimuscarinic OAB drug with reduced potential for CNS effects could be especially beneficial in the elderly people, in whom even the modest cognitive impairment may negatively affect independence. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to determine if trospium chloride is assay detectable in the CNS of older adults with OAB and to assess whether deterioration of memory occurs in these individuals. Methods: Twelve cognitively intact older adults (>= 65-75 years old) with OAB were given extended-release trospium chloride 60 mg once daily over a 10-day period to achieve plasma steady-state levels. Standardised memory testing (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised) was performed predose and postdose. Cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were drawn on day 10 and assayed for trospium chloride. Predose (day 0) and postdose (day 10) results on the memory tests were compared using a reliable change index to assess a meaningful change in learning or memory. Results: Trospium chloride levels in all the CSF samples (n = 72) of all participants were assay undetectable (< 40 pg/ml) on day 10 at steady-state peak plasma concentration concurrent with measureable peak plasma values (C(max) = 925 pg/ml). Repeat memory testing revealed no significant net drug effect on learning or recall. Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate for the presence of an OAB antimuscarinic in the human brain, performed by assaying for concentrations of trospium chloride and correlating with simultaneous clinical cognitive safety measures. The results of both pharmacological and neuropsychological testing support the hypothesis of a lack of detectable CNS penetration for the quaternary amine trospium chloride.

Design: A prospective cohort study. Methods: Patients who received platinum chemotherapy were identified through review of the pharmacy records from 2000 to 2005. Audiograms pre- and post-treatment with cisplatin were noted. The patients were brought back long after treatment for a repeat audiogram and a questionnaire to assess the impact of ototoxicity on their quality of life. Results: Forty-nine patients received platinum chemotherapy. Patients' exclusion: two had no pre-chemo audiograms, one had retinoblastoma with congenital hearing loss, three were lost to follow up, five deceased, and seven refused participation. The total number of patients included was 31 with long-term follow up total of 21 patients. The follow up period ranged from 1.5 to 6.6 years (median of 3.4 years). Fourty-two percent (13/31) of the patients suffered from otoxicity (3 mild, 3 moderate, 7 severe-profound). Thirty-three (7/21) of audiograms worsened on long-term follow up. Questionnaire revealed 70% subjective hearing loss with 40% requiring hearing aids. Conclusion: Ototoxicity after platinum chemotherapy can present or worsen years after completion of therapy. Therefore, we recommend long-term follow up. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enhanced Islet Expansion by beta-Cell Proliferation in Young Diabetes-Prone Rats Fed a Protective Diet	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PANCREATIC-CELLS; TRANSGENIC MICE; NUCLEAR ANTIGEN; PROTEIN INGAP; ADULT HUMAN; BB RATS; NEOGENESIS; MASS; EXPRESSION; REPLICATION	Type I diabetes is inhibited in diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats fed a low-antigen hydrolyzed casein (HC) diet. In cereal-fed BBdp rats, islet expansion is defective accompanied by a futile upregulation of islet neogenesis without increased islet mass, due to a subtle blockage in islet cell cycle. We hypothesized that islet growth is enhanced before insulitis in HC-fed young BBdp rats and that islet neogenesis could be stimulated by a trophic factor, islet neogenesis-associated protein (INGAP). beta-Cell homeostasis was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, morphometry, laser capture microdissection and RT-PCR in BBdp rats fed HC or cereal diets. beta-cell proliferation in small and medium islets, and the number and area fraction of medium and large islets were increased in HC-fed animals. In situ islet cell cycle analysis revealed an increased proportion of proliferating S + G2 cells in medium and large islets of 25-45 day HC-fed rats. Expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, p16(INK4a) correlated with islet size and the percentage of p16(INK4a+) beta-cells increased in HC-fed BBdp rats, likely reflecting an increase in large islet area fraction. In HC-fed rats, extra-islet insulin(+) clusters (EIC), insulin(+) duct cells, large islet area fraction, and beta-cell mass were increased. Neurogenin-3 and Pdx-I, markers of beta-cell progenitors, were increased in EIC of weanling HC-fed rats. Daily injection of INGAP (30-45 days) increased the number of small islets, total islets, and insulin(+) cells in small ducts. Thus, in BBdp rats fed a protective HC diet, beta-cell expansion is enhanced through increased beta-cell proliferation and stimulation of islet neogenesis. J. Cell. Physiol. J. Cell.

This study presents in vivo (Positron Emission Tomography (PET)) and in vitro (autoradiography) measurements of mGluR5 densities in the same rats and evaluates both noninvasive and blood-dependent pharmacokinetic models for the quantification of [C-11]ABP688 binding. Eleven rats underwent [C-11]ABP688 PET scans. In five animals, baseline scans were compared with blockade experiments with the antagonist 1,2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), and arterial blood samples were drawn and corrected for metabolites. Afterward, saturation-binding autoradiography was performed. Blocking with MPEP resulted in an average decrease of the total distribution volume (V-T) between 43% and 58% (thalamus and caudate-putamen, respectively) but had no significant effect on cerebellar V-T (mean reduction: -0.01%). Comparing binding potential (BPND) based on the V-T with noninvasively determined BPND revealed an average negative bias of 0.7% in the caudate-putamen and an average positive bias of 3.1% in the low-binding regions. Scan duration of 50 minutes is required. The cerebellum is a suitable reference region for the quantification of mGluR(5) availability as measured with [C-11]ABP688 PET in rats. Blood-based and reference region-based PET quantification shows a significant linear relationship to autoradiographic determinations.

Although there is some preliminary evidence that atypical antipsychotic agents may be effective in treating substance dependence, results have been mixed, with some studies demonstrating positive and others negative or no effect. The present study was aimed at determining whether this disparity originates from that reviewers separately discussed trials in patients with (DD) and without (SD) comorbid psychosis. Using electronic databases, we screened the relevant literature, leaving only studies that used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled or case-control design that had a duration of 4 weeks or longer. A total of 43 studies were identified; of these, 23 fell into the category of DD and 20 into the category of SD. Studies in the DD category suggest that atypical antipsychotic agents, especially clozapine, may decrease substance use in individuals with alcohol and drug (mostly cannabis) use disorders. Studies in the SD category suggest that atypical antipsychotic agents may be beneficial for the treatment of alcohol dependence, at least in some subpopulations of alcoholics. They also suggest that these agents are not effective at treating stimulant dependence and may aggravate the condition in some cases.

Kinematic features of continuous hand reaching movements under simple and complex rhythmical constraints	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article						Rhythmical structures; Hand kinematics; Auditory cues; Spatiotemporal coupling	AUDITORY-STIMULATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ARM MOVEMENTS; GAIT; MOTOR; BEAT; SYNCHRONIZATION; REHABILITATION; COORDINATION; FACILITATION	Background: Auditory cues are known to alter movement kinematics in healthy people as well as in people with neurological conditions (e. g., Parkinson's disease or stroke). Pacing movement to rhythmical constraints is known to change both the spatial and temporal features of movement. However, the effect of complexity of pacing on the spatial and temporal kinematic properties is still poorly understood. The current study investigated spatial and temporal aspects of movement (path and speed, respectively) and their integration while subjects followed simple isochronous or complex non-isochronous rhythmical constraints. Spatiotemporal decoupling was expected under the latter constraint. Methods: Ten subjects performed point-to-point hand movements towards visual targets on the surface of a hemisphere, while following continuous auditory cues of different pace and meter. The spatial and temporal properties of movement were compared to geodesic paths and unimodal bell-shaped speed profiles, respectively. Multiple two-way RM-ANOVAs (pace [1-2 Hz] x meter [duple-triple]) were performed on the different kinematic variables calculated to assess hand deviations from the model data (p <= 0.05). Results: As expected, increasing pace resulted in straighter hand paths and smoother speed profiles. Meter, however, affected only the path (shorter and straighter under triple) without significantly changing speed. Such an effect was observed at the slow pace only. Conclusions: Under simple rhythmic cues, an increase in pace causes spontaneous adjustments in spatial features (straighter hand paths) while preserving temporal ones (maximally-smoothed hand speeds). Complex rhythmical cues in contrast perturb spatiotemporal coupling and challenge movement control. These results may have important practical implications in motor rehabilitation.

Objective: To evaluate the rate of treatment failure associated with prochlorperazine used in children with severe migraine in a pediatric ED. Methods: This study was a retrospective chart review of patients < 18 years of age who visited the ED of a tertiary care pediatric hospital between November 2005 and June 2007. All patients diagnosed with migraine by the emergency physicians were included in the study. Charts were evaluated by a data abstractor blinded to the study hypothesis using a standardized datasheet. Inter-rater agreement was measured. Prochlorperazine treatment failure was defined as either administration of further rescue therapy, a hospitalization, or a return visit to the ED within 48 h for symptom recurrence or side effects from the medication. Results: Prochlorperazine was administered in 92 episodes of migraine, including 43 confirmed by a pediatric neurologist; all received diphenhydramine to prevent akathisia. A total of 13 (14%) of these patients had a treatment failure: 8 patients received one or more further rescue therapies after the administration of prochlorperazine; 5 patients were hospitalized, including 3 who had received further rescue therapy; and 3 patients returned to the ED within 48 h due to symptom recurrence. Conclusion: There was a treatment failure rate of 14% with the use of prochlorperazine in association with diphenhydramine for severe migraine in children seen in a pediatric ED.

In the current study, we studied the effect of anti-GAPDH and anti-TPI CSF IgG on the glycolytic enzyme activity of GAPDH and TPI after exposure to intrathecal IgG from 10 patients with MS and 34 patients with other neurologic diseases. The degree of inhibition of GAPDH activity by CSF anti-GAPDH IgG in the seven MS samples tested varied from 13 to 98%, which seemed to correlate with the percentage of anti-GAPDH IgG in the CSF IgG (1-45%). Inhibition of GAPDH activity (18 and 23%) by CSF IgG was seen in two of the 34 patients with other neurologic diseases, corresponding to the low percentage of CSF anti-GAPDH IgG (1 and 8%). In addition, depletion of anti-GAPDH IgG from CSF IgG, using immobilized GAPDH, removed the inhibitory effect of the IgG on GAPDH. No inhibition of GAPDH activity was seen with CSF samples not containing anti-GAPDH IgG. No inhibition of TPI activity was seen with any purified CSF IgG sample. These findings demonstrate an increased percentage of anti-GAPDH Abs in the CSF of patients with MS that can inhibit GAPDH glycolytic enzyme activity and may contribute to neuroaxonal degeneration.

When we move to a particular point in space, a cloud of final limb positions is observed around the target. Previously we noted that patterns of variability at the end of movement to a circular target were not circular, but instead reflected patterns of limb stiffness-in directions where limb stiffness was high, variability in end position was low, and vice versa. Here we examine the determinants of variability at movement end in more detail. To do this, we have subjects move the handle of a robotic device from different starting positions into a circular target. We use position servocontrolled displacements of the robot's handle to measure limb stiffness at the end of movement and we also record patterns of end position variability. To examine the effect of change in posture on movement variability, we use a visual motor transformation in which we change the limb configuration and also the actual movement target, while holding constant the visual display. We find that, regardless of movement direction, patterns of variability at the end of movement vary systematically with limb configuration and are also related to patterns of limb stiffness, which are likewise configuration dependent. The result suggests that postural configuration determines the base level of movement variability, on top of which control mechanisms can act to further alter variability.

The recovery of voluntary quadrupedal locomotion after an incomplete spinal cord injury can involve different levels of the CNS, including the spinal locomotor circuitry. The latter conclusion was reached using a dual spinal lesion paradigm in which a low thoracic partial spinal lesion is followed, several weeks later, by a complete spinal transection (i.e., spinalization). In this dual spinal lesion paradigm, cats can express hindlimb walking 1 day after spinalization, a process that normally takes several weeks, suggesting that the locomotor circuitry within the lumbosacral spinal cord had been modified after the partial lesion. Here we detail the evolution of the kinematic locomotor pattern throughout the dual spinal lesion paradigm in five cats to gain further insight into putative neurophysiological mechanisms involved in locomotor recovery after a partial spinal lesion. All cats recovered voluntary quadrupedal locomotion with treadmill training (3-5 days/wk) over several weeks. After the partial lesion, the locomotor pattern was characterized by several left/right asymmetries in various kinematic parameters, such as homolateral and homologous interlimb coupling, cycle duration, and swing/stance durations. When no further locomotor improvement was observed, cats were spinalized. After spinalization, the hindlimb locomotor pattern rapidly reappeared, but left/right asymmetries in swing/stance durations observed after the partial lesion could disappear or reverse. It is concluded that, after a partial spinal lesion, the hindlimb locomotor pattern was actively maintained by new dynamic interactions between spinal and supraspinal levels but also by intrinsic changes within the spinal cord.

Rehabilitation following spinal cord injury is likely to depend on recovery of corticospinal systems. Here we investigate whether transmission in the corticospinal tract may explain foot drop (inability to dorsiflex ankle) in persons with spinal cord lesion. The study was performed in 24 persons with incomplete spinal cord lesion (C1 to L1) and 15 healthy controls. Coherence in the 10- to 20-Hz frequency band between paired tibialis anterior muscle (TA) electromyographic recordings obtained in the swing phase of walking, which was taken as a measure of motor unit synchronization. It was significantly correlated with the degree of foot drop, as measured by toe elevation and ankle angle excursion in the first part of swing. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the TA. The amplitude of the MEPs at rest and their latency during contraction were correlated to the degree of foot drop. Spinal cord injured participants who exhibited a large foot drop had little or no MEP at rest in the TA muscle and had little or no coherence in the same muscle during walking.

J	Harvey, PO; Armony, J; Malla, A; Lepage, M				Harvey, Philippe-Olivier; Armony, Jorge; Malla, Ashok; Lepage, Martin			Functional neural substrates of self-reported physical anhedonia in non-clinical individuals and in patients with schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Anhedonia; Functional neuroimaging; Schizophrenia; Hedonic processing	SOCIAL ANHEDONIA; EMOTIONAL VALENCE; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; REWARD; DEPRESSION; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; EXPERIENCE; PSYCHOSIS; RESPONSES	Background: Anhedonia is a negative symptom of schizophrenia that has a detrimental impact on functioning and quality of life. Anhedonia also represents a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia when measured in non-clinical individuals. The investigation of the neural correlates of anhedonia in schizophrenia and non-clinical individuals could provide key insights on the pathophysiology of negative symptoms, as well as on the characterization of neural markers of vulnerability. Methods: Thirty patients with schizophrenia and twenty-six non-clinical individuals were recruited. We used an event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging paradigm involving an emotional picture viewing task. For each group, separately, we correlated the regional BOLD signal changes during hedonic processing with the Chapman Physical Anhedonia Scale scores. An interaction analysis identified the neural correlates of anhedonia specific to schizophrenia. Results: We found that anhedonia severity in both groups was inversely correlated with the activity of a limited number of emotion-related regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex. The orbitofrontal cortex and putamen/ventral striatum activity was negatively correlated with anhedonia severity in people with schizophrenia only. Conclusions: The data first suggest that anhedonia severity is linked to a poor modulation of emotional/attentional brain regions during the processing of hedonic information. The link between anhedonia and the activity of the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex found in schizophrenia could reflect the specific impairment of indirect factors, such as reward anticipation deficits, that influence the measurement of anhedonia severity through self-report questionnaires.

Little is known about their clinical significance. Measuring phantosmia and parosmia is still not possible. Today, assessment of parosmia or phantosmia relies mainly upon the patient's interview and the physician's experience. Therefore, we investigated the clinical usefulness of four structured questions in comparison to the patient's history regarding their accuracy in terms of the presence of odor distortions. Study Design: Tertiary care center outpatient clinic analyses. Methods: Responses from 193 patients were analyzed. All patients underwent full olfactory work-up (ear, nose, and throat examination, Sniffin' Sticks testing, structural brain imaging) and filled in a questionnaire with four parosmia questions and six questions regarding characteristics and severity of the parosmia. These responses formed the bases of a numerical parosmia score. Results: Patients with parosmia showed significantly lower parosmia scores (P<.001) when compared to either patients with phantosmia or patients without odor distortions. Two questions could be identified that showed a high association to the presence or absence of parosmia. Conclusions: The present results confirm reports on the high frequency of parosmia and phantosmia among patients suffering from olfactory disorders. A parosmia score could be established that distinguishes between patients with or without odor distortions. The score provides valuable information regarding the presence or absence of parosmia, thus helping the physician during the patient's evaluation.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of quantitative magnetization-transfer imaging parameter estimates in healthy subjects. Magnetization-transfer-weighted and T-1 relaxometry data were acquired in five healthy subjects at multiple time points, and the variability of the resulting fitted magnetization-transfer parameters was evaluated. The impact of subsampling the magnetization-transfer data and correcting field inhomogeneities was also evaluated. The key parameters measured in this study had an average variability, across time points, of 4.7% for the relative size of the restricted pool (F), 7.3% for the forward exchange constant (k(f)), 1.9% for the free pool spin-lattice relaxation constant (R-1f), 4.5% for the T-2 of the free pool (T-2f), and 2.3% for the T-2 of the restricted pool (T-2r). Our findings show that serial quantitative magnetization-transfer imaging experiments can be performed reliably, with good reproducibility of the model parameter estimates, and demonstrate the reproducibility of acquisition schemes with fewer magnetization-transfer contrasts. This establishes the feasibility of this technique for monitoring patients affected by degenerative white matter diseases while providing critical data to estimate the statistical power of such studies.

The relative low absorption of near-infrared light enables measurements of hemoglobin changes at depths reaching the first centimeter of the cortex. The rapid rate of acquisition and the access to both oxy and deoxy-hemoglobin leads to new challenges when trying to uncouple physiology from the signal of interest. In particular, recent work provided evidence of the presence of a 1/f noise structure in optical signals and showed that a general linear model based on wavelets can be used to decorrelate the structured noise and provide a superior estimator of response amplitude when compared with conventional techniques. In this work the wavelet techniques are extended to recover the full temporal shape of the hemodynamic responses. A comparison with other models is provided as well as a case study on finger-tapping data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lina, J.

However, the role of GPR103 in regulating peripheral metabolic pathways has not yet been explored. The present study aimed to investigate the role of GPR103 in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism using 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. Our results show that differentiated 3T3-L1 cells expressed the GPR103b subtype mRNA and protein, as well as QRFP mRNA. QRFP-43 and -26 induced an increase in triglyceride accumulation of 50 and 41%, respectively, and elicited a dose-dependent increase in fatty acid uptake, by up to approximately 60% at the highest concentration, in 3T3-L1-differentiated cells. QRFP-43 and -26 inhibited isoproterenol (ISO)-induced lipolysis in a dose-dependent manner, with IC(50)s of 2.3 +/- 1.2 and 1.1 +/- 1.0 nM, respectively. The expression of genes involved in lipid uptake (FATP1, CD36, LPL, ACSL1, PPAR-gamma, and C/EBP-alpha), was increased by 2- to 3-fold after treatment with QRFP. The effects of QRFP on ISO-induced lipolysis and fatty acid uptake were abolished when GPR103b was silenced. In a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, the expression of GPR103b in epididymal fat pads was elevated by 16-fold whereas that of QRFP was reduced by 46% compared to lean mice. Furthermore, QRFP was bioactive in omental adipocytes from obese individuals, inhibiting ISO-induced lipolysis in these cells. Our results suggest that GPR103b and QRFP work in an autocrine/paracrine manner to regulate adipogenesis.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of this natural product on the growth of human glioma U-87 cells xenografted into athymic mice. We show here that curcumin administration exerted significant anti-tumor effects on subcutaneous and intracerebral gliomas as demonstrated by the slower tumor growth rate and the increase of animal survival time. While investigating the mechanism of its action in vivo, we observed that curcumin decreased the gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Furthermore, treatment with curcumin inhibited glioma-induced angiogenesis as indicated by the decrease of endothelial cell marker from newly formed vessels and by the diminution of the concentration of hemoglobin in curcumin-treaded tumors. We also demonstrate, using an in vitro model of blood-brain barrier, that curcumin can cross the blood-brain barrier to a high level. These are the first results showing that curcumin suppresses tumor growth of gliomas in xenograft models. The mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects of curcumin were related, at least partly, to the inhibition of glioma-induced angiogenesis.

Murine or rat MrgC receptors exhibit high similarities with hMrgX1 in terms of expression pattern, sequence homology, and binding profile. Therefore, rodents have been used as an in vivo model to explore the physiological functions and pharmacodynamics of the hMrgX1. Agonist-promoted receptor endocytosis significantly affects the pharmacodynamics of a GPCR but is not yet investigated for hMrgX1. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of prolonged agonist exposure on cell surface protein levels of hMrgX1 and murine or rat MrgC in human embryonic kidney 293, Cos, F11, and ND-C cells. We observed that hMrgX1 are resistant and both MrgC are prone to agonist-promoted receptor endocytosis. In Cos cells, coexpression of beta-arrestins strongly enhanced endocytosis of murine MrgC but did not alter cell surface expression of hMrgX1 receptors. These data define the hMrgX1 as one of the few members within the superfamily of GPCRs whose signaling is not regulated by agonist-promoted endocytosis and reveal species-specific differences in the regulation of Mrg receptor signaling. Given the importance of receptor endocytosis for the pharmacodynamics of a given ligand, our results may have a strong impact on the development of future drugs that suppose to control pain in humans but were tested in rodents.

Twenty-four regional cortical volumes and 34 cortical thicknesses were measured with automated image processing software at baseline. Twenty-one subjects converted from MCI to AD determined with the cognitive tests at baseline and 1 year later. The hippocampus, amygdala, and caudate volumes were significantly smaller in progressive MCI subjects than in controls and stable MCI subjects. The cortical volumes achieved higher predictive accuracy than did cognitive tests or cortical thickness. Combining the volumes, thicknesses, and cognitive tests did not improve the accuracy. The volume of amygdala and caudate were independent variables in predicting conversion from MCI to AD. We conclude that regional cortical volume measures are more powerful than those common cognitive tests we used in identifying AD patients at the very earliest stage of the disease.

Apoplectic macroadenomas: The outcome of the residual pituitary gland	NEUROCHIRURGIE			French	Article						Apoplectic adenomas; Residual pituitary gland (RPG); Hypophyseal function	PRECIPITATING FACTORS; INTRASELLAR PRESSURE; TUMOR APOPLEXY; HEMORRHAGE; ADENOMAS; NECROSIS; HYPOPITUITARISM; MANAGEMENT; FEATURES; MRI	Background and purpose. - The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the MRI aspects and the function of the residual pituitary gland (RPG) after surgical decompression of an apoplectic pituitary macroadenoma, and to attempt to answer the question of whether an intra-adenomatous apoplexy necessarily leads to hypophyseal apoplexy. Methods. - Between 1992 and 2008, 150 pituitary macroadenomas were surgically treated via the trans-sphenoidal approach, 19 of which presented an apoplectic feature (13 %). They were subdivided into three groups: pure hemorrhage, hemorrhagic infarction, and ischemic infarction. The imaging was studied after surgery to identify the RPG and establish a correlation with the endocrine status. Results. - After surgery five of 19 patients had normal adenohypophyseal function (27%), eight (42%) had panhypopituitarism, and six (31 %) complete or partial corticotropic hypopituitarism. The RPG was identified on MRI in 13 patients (69 %), four of them (31 %) with normal adenohypophyseal function. The RPG was clearly identified intraoperatively in nine patients (47 %), four of whom (44%) had normal adenohypophyseal function. One patient presented preoperative diabetes insipidus, which disappeared immediately after surgery, and two other patients developed postoperative diabetes insipidus: in one patient it quickly declined and in the other one it persisted, requiring replacement. According to the radiological classification of Hardy and Vezina modified by the Mohr (Mohr et Hardy, 1982) grade, the patients were subdivided up as follows: one grade II-0, four grade II-A, 11 grade II-B, two grade C, and one grade IV-B + D. Conclusion. - The repercussions of adenomatous apoplexy on the RPG is significant: only 27% of the patients retained normal pituitary function. Furthermore, although the RPG was identified on the MRI in more than two-thirds of the cases, more than half had adenohypophyseal failure: therefore, the visualization of a RPG does not mean that its functions are preserved. The involvement of the neurohypophysis is much rarer: one patient of 19 (5 %). The implications of the ischemic or compressive damage on the normal pituitary gland are discussed.

Some investigators suggest that these associations reflect the effects of stress on the neural circuits that support cognitive control. However, very few prior studies have examined the associations between ES, cognitive control, and underlying neural architecture. The present study compares adolescents with a documented history of ES to typical adolescents on a cognitive control task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve ES adolescents who were adopted because of early caregiver deprivation (9 females, age = 13 years +/- 2.58) and 21 healthy control adolescents without a history of ES (10 females, age =13 years +/- 1.96) who resided with their biological parents performed the change task (Nelson, Vinton et al., 2007)- a variant of the stop task - during fMRI. Behaviourally, ES adolescents took longer to switch from a prepotent response ("go") to an alternative response ("change") than control adolescents. During correct "change" responses vs. correct "go" responses, this behavioural group difference was accompanied by higher activation in ES subjects than controls. These differences were noted in regions involved in primary sensorimotor processes (pre- and postcentral gyri), conflict monitoring (dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus), inhibitory and response control (inferior prefrontal cortex and striatum), and somatic representations (posterior insula). Furthermore, correct "change" responses vs. incorrect "change" responses recruited the inferior prefrontal cortex (BA 44/46) more strongly in ES subjects than controls. These data suggest impaired cognitive control in youth who experienced ES. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Hearing loss severity: Impaired processing of formant transition duration	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Deafness; Stop consonant; Auditory system; Time perception; Sound duration; Hearing aids	STOP CONSONANTS; SPEECH RECOGNITION; COCHLEAR IMPLANTS; AUDITORY-NERVE; PERCEPTION; LISTENERS; CHILDREN; LANGUAGE; SOUNDS; COARTICULATION	Normal hearing listeners exploit the formant transition (FT) detection to identify place of articulation for stop consonants. Neuro-imaging studies revealed that short FT induced less cortical activation than long FT. To determine the ability of hearing impaired listeners to distinguish short and long formant transitions (FT) from vowels of the same duration, 84 mild to severe hearing impaired listeners and 5 normal hearing listeners were asked to detect 10 synthesized stimuli with long (200 ms) or short (40 ms) FT among 30 stimuli of the same duration without FT. Hearing impaired listeners were tested with and without hearing aids. The effect of the difficulty of the task (short/long FT) was analysed as a function of the hearing loss with and without hearing aids. Normal hearing listeners were able to detect every FT (short and long). For hearing impaired listeners, the detection of long FT was better than that of short ones irrespective of their degree of hearing loss. The use of hearing aids improved detection of both kinds of FT; however, the detection of long FT remained much better than the detection of the short ones. The length of FT modified the ability of hearing impaired patients to detect FT. Short FT had access to less cortical processing than long FT and cochlea damages enhanced this specific deficit in short FT brain processing. These findings help to understand the limit of deafness rehabilitation in the time domain and should be taken into account in future devices development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This was done using an adapted Landolt-C technique where C-optotypes were defined by either luminance or texture information, the latter necessitating extra-striate neural processing to be perceived. Typically developing children were placed in one of 4 school-age groups (6, 8, 10 and 12-year olds): an adult group was also assessed. The contrast threshold for the correct identification of gap-opening-orientation for C-optotypes defined by either texture- or luminance-contrast was measured. All participants were presented with C-optotypes with gap-openings presented in one of 4 orientations (up, down, left or right). An adaptive staircase procedure was used to measure gap-opening-identification thresholds (minimum luminance- or texture-contrast modulation) for all three conditions and ages. As expected, gap-opening identification sensitivity (1/threshold) increased with age for all conditions. For both luminance-defined conditions, adult-like performance was manifested by 12 years of age. By comparison, at 12 years of age, the sensitivity to texture-defined C-optotypes was significantly lower than that of adults, having increased steadily from the age of 6 years. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying static form perception mature at different ages depending on the physical attribute defining the form. Luminance-defined form perception appears to reach adult-like levels (or plateau) earlier than for texture-defined information, suggesting that the development of mechanisms mediating higher-order form perception persist into adolescence.

This study examines the relation of developmental exposure to these contaminants to information processing assessed with event-related potentials (ERPs) in school-aged Inuit children from Nunavik (Arctic Quebec). In a prospective longitudinal study on child development, exposure to contaminants was measured at birth and 11 years of age. An auditory oddball protocol was administered at 11 years to measure ERP components N1 and P3b. Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of levels of the contaminants to auditory oddball performance (mean reaction time, omission errors and false alarms) and ERP parameters (latency and amplitude) after control for potential confounding variables. A total of 118 children provided useable ERP data. Prenatal MeHg exposure was associated with slower reaction times and fewer false alarms during the oddball task. Analyses of the ERP parameters revealed that prenatal MeHg exposure was related to greater amplitude and delayed latency of the N1 wave in the target condition but not to the P3b component. MeHg effects on the N1 were stronger after control for seafood nutrients. Prenatal PCB exposure was not related to any endpoint for sample as a whole but was associated with a decrease in P3b amplitude in the subgroup of children who had been breast-fed for less than 3 months. Body burdens of MeHg and PCBs at 11 years were not related to any of the behavioural or ERP measures. These data suggest that prenatal MeHg exposure alters attentional mechanisms modulating early processing of sensory information. By contrast, prenatal PCB exposure appears to affect information processing at later stages, when the information is being consciously evaluated. These effects seem to be mitigated in children who are breast-fed for a more extended period. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DRR drives brain cancer invasion by regulating cytoskeletal-focal adhesion dynamics	ONCOGENE			English	Article						brain cancer; cytoskeleton; cell invasion	CELL INVASION; MYOSIN-II; MIGRATION; MORPHOGENESIS; MICROTUBULES; SRC	Malignant glioma invasion is a primary cause of brain cancer treatment failure, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation remain elusive. We developed a novel functional-screening strategy and identified downregulated in renal cell carcinoma (DRR) as a regulator of invasion. We show that DRR drives invasion in vitro and in vivo. We found that while DRR is not expressed in normal glial cells, it is highly expressed in the invasive component of gliomas. Exploring underlying mechanisms, we show that DRR associates with and organizes the actin and microtubular cytoskeletons and that these associations are essential for focal adhesion (FA) disassembly and cell invasion. These findings identify DRR as a new cytoskeletal crosslinker that regulates FA dynamics and cell movement.

Cerebellar Injury in the Premature Infant Is Associated With Impaired Growth of Specific Cerebral Regions	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							CROSSED CEREBELLOCEREBRAL DIASCHISIS; PRETERM INFANTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HEMORRHAGE; INFARCTION; PRIMATE; SPECT; AGE	We have shown that cerebellar injury in the premature infant is followed by significant growth impairment of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere evident as early as term adjusted age. In this study, we hypothesize that this remote growth restriction is region specific in the cerebrum. In a prospectively enrolled cohort of 38 expreterm infants with isolated cerebellar injury by neonatal M RI, we performed follow-up volumetric MRI studies at a mean postnatal age of 35.5 +/- 13.8 mo. We measured volumes of cortical and subcortical gray matter, and cerebral white matter within eight parcellated regions for each cerebral hemisphere. Unilateral cerebellar injury (n = 24) was associated with significantly smaller volumes of cortical gray and cerebral white matter in the following regions of the contralateral (versus ipsilateral) cerebral hemisphere: dorsolateral prefrontal, premotor (PM), sensorimotor, and midtemporal regions (p < 0.001 for all except midtemporal cortical gray, p = 0.01), as well as subcortical gray matter in the PM region (p < 0.001). Conversely, in cases of bilateral cerebellar injury (n = 14), there was no significant interhemispheric difference in tissue volumes for any of the cerebral regions studied. These findings suggest that regional cerebral growth impairment results from interruption of cerebellocerebral connectivity and loss of neuronal activation critical for development.

Risk for PHACE Syndrome in Infants With Large Facial Hemangiomas	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						PHACE syndrome; hemangioma; vascular birthmark; neurocutaneous; cerebrovascular anomalies	CEREBRAL VASCULOPATHY; ASSOCIATION; MALFORMATIONS; ANOMALIES; FEATURES	OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of posterior fossae of the brain, arterial anomalies, cardiac anomalies, and eye anomalies (PHACE) in infants with large facial hemangiomas. The extracutaneous manifestations of PHACE may be associated with significant morbidity, and the prevalence of PHACE in patients with facial hemangiomas has not previously been reported. METHODS: A multicenter prospective study was conducted with 108 infants who had large facial hemangiomas and were systematically evaluated for manifestations of PHACE. The prevalence of PHACE and its extracutaneous manifestations in this cohort was calculated. The relationship between hemangioma distribution and the manifestations of PHACE was analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-three (31%) of 108 had PHACE. Thirty of the 33 patients with PHACE had >1 extracutaneous finding. The risk for PHACE syndrome was higher in infants with larger hemangiomas and in those with hemangiomas that encompassed >1 facial segment. The most common extracutaneous anomalies observed in infants with PHACE were of the arteries of the cerebrovasculature (91%) and cardiac anomalies (67%). Upper face (frontotemporal and frontonasal) hemangiomas were commonly observed in infants with PHACE; isolated maxillary hemangiomas were rarely associated with PHACE. CONCLUSIONS: In infants with large facial hemangiomas, one-third have extracutaneous manifestations consistent with the diagnosis of PHACE syndrome, most commonly cerebrovascular and cardiovascular anomalies. The high prevalence of arterial anomalies in this cohort has implications for clinical management and future research regarding the pathophysiology of PHACE.

UII and URP exert their actions by binding to the G-protein coupled receptor-14 known as UT. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a disease of progressive lung destruction resulting from the excessive growth of abnormal smooth muscle-like cells that exhibit markers of neural crest origin. LAM cells also exhibit inactivation of the tumor suppressor tuberin (TSC2), excessive activity of 'mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and dysregulated cell growth and proliferation. In the present study we examined the expression and distribution of UII and UT in the lungs of patients with LAM. There was abundant expression of UII, URP and UT proteins in the interstitial nodular lesions of patients with LAM. By immunohistochemistry, UII, URP and UT were co-localized with HMB45, a diagnostic marker of LAM. lmmunoreactivity for UII. URP and UT was also evident over the pulmonary epithelium, pulmonary vasculature and inflammatory cells. Western blotting revealed the presence of greater UT expression in the lungs of patients with LAM compared to normal human lungs. UT expression correlated with mTOR activity, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of S6 in LAM samples. These findings demonstrate for the first time the presence of UII. URP and their receptor in the lesions of patients with LAM, and suggest a possible role in the pathogenesis of the disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We addressed this question in the context of the myotopic map formed by limb muscles innervated by spinal lateral motor column (LMC) motor axons where the Eph receptor signals specifying growth cone trajectory are restricted by Foxp1 and Lhx1 transcription factors. We show that the localisation of LMC neuron cell bodies can be dissociated from axon trajectory choice by either the loss or gain of function of the Reelin signalling pathway. The response of LMC motor neurons to Reelin is gated by Foxp1 and Lhx1-mediated regulation of expression of the critical Reelin signalling intermediate Dab1. Together, these observations point to identical transcription factors that control motor axon guidance and soma migration and reveal the molecular hierarchy of myotopic organisation.

Mutation in the Gene Encoding Ubiquitin Ligase LRSAM1 in Patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-GENETICS; PROTEIN-DEGRADATION; NEUROPATHIES; DIAGNOSIS; CAPTURE; DISORDERS; GENOME; FORMS; MOTOR	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) represents a family of related sensorimotor neuropathies. We studied a large family from a rural eastern Canadian community, with multiple individuals suffering from a condition clinically most similar to autosomal recessive axonal CMT, or AR-CMT2. Homozygosity mapping with high-density SNP genotyping of six affected individuals from the family excluded 23 known genes for various subtypes of CMT and instead identified a single homozygous region on chromosome 9, at 122,423,730-129,841,977 Mbp, shared identical by state in all six affected individuals. A homozygous pathogenic variant was identified in the gene encoding leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif 1 (LRSAM1) by direct DNA sequencing of genes within the region in affected DNA samples. The single nucleotide change mutates an intronic consensus acceptor splicing site from AG to AA. Direct analysis of RNA from patient blood demonstrated aberrant splicing of the affected exon, causing an obligatory frameshift and premature truncation of the protein. Western blotting of immortalized cells from a homozygous patient showed complete absence of detectable protein, consistent with the splice site defect. LRSAM1 plays a role in membrane vesicle fusion during viral maturation and for proper adhesion of neuronal cells in culture. Other ubiquitin ligases play documented roles in neurodegenerative diseases. LRSAM1 is a strong candidate for the causal gene for the genetic disorder in our kindred.

The present study examined the acute effects of glucose ingestion on different attentional tasks in fasting healthy older adults. In a between-subjects design, 44 participants (60 years and older) were randomly assigned to a glucose (50 g) or saccharin (placebo) condition after 12 h of fasting. Participants were tested on neuropsychological tests of attention (trail A and B, modified Stroop) and on a computerized dual-task. Participants in the glucose group were faster than the placebo group to complete the switching condition of the modified Stroop test (p < 0.01) and showed a smaller dual-task cost in the divided attention task (p < 0.05). Glucose ingestion appears to momentarily enhance attentional performances in seniors who have fasted for 12 h in tasks requiring switching and dividing attention.

Characterization of Commercial Microbial Products by Polymorphic DNA Markers and Enzymatic Activity Diversity: Occurrence and Potential Effects on Freshwater Mussels exposed to Municipal Effluents	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bacteria; yeast; fungi; polymorphic DNA; hydrolytic enzyme activity profiles; mussels; municipal effluents	TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; WASTE-WATER; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; MYTILUS-EDULIS; IMMUNE	The increasing commercial applications of microbial products and consortia have raised concerns about their release to the environment and the potential for toxic effects on aquatic biota. This study characterized 25 bacteria, one yeast and one fungus using a combination of random amplified polymorphic DNA and 19 hydrolytic enzyme activities, with the purpose of determining their occurrence and potential effects on the immune systems of mussels exposed to a primary-treated municipal effluent for seven weeks. The amplification product (552-bp) of cpn60 gene by using universal primers was sequenced for each micro-organism and available in GenBank. The microbial community structures in the digestive gland of mussels were also characterized using 16s ribosomal gene analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The results revealed that each micro-organism was easily cultivated with usual growth media and the enzyme activity profiles permitted to propose an identification method using hierarchical tree and backpropagation neural networks classifications. The bacterial community structure based on DGGE of 16S rDNA in mussels changed with the concentration of the municipal effluent. This was also revealed by a characteristic change in enzyme activity profiles with increased frequency in acid and amide phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and beta-galactosidase in the isolated heterotrophic colonies in mussels. The analysis of heterotrophic bacteria colonies in unexposed mussels revealed that most colonies (6/10) were of unkown origin and only three bacterial colonies shared close similarities with B. subtilisis 11685, E. aerogenes, P. putida 12633. In mussels exposed to the municipal effluents, about half of the colonies were classified as unknowns while the other half was composed of bacteria showing close similarites with E. aerogenes, P. putida 12633 and 31800. These bacteria differed from those found in forming biofilms which was mainly associated to B. subtilis 11685 or P. fluorescens 13525 functional properties. The immune system of the mussels was also compromised with decreased hemocyte density, increased phagocytosis activity and cytotoxic activity. While no trend between phagocytosis activity and the enzyme activity profiles was found, the increased frequency in leucine aminopeptidase and acid phosphatase were negatively correlated with the hemocyte density and cytotoxic activity. In conclusion, a methodology to track for the occurrence, bioavailability and potential immunotoxic effects of commercial microorganisms is proposed based on a combination of genetic and phenotypic (enzyme activity) markers and immunocompetence assessment. Preliminary results indicate mussels contained only three bacteria out of 25 bacteria that bear high functional similarity and the characteristic pertubations with the enzyme activity profiles were associated with immunocompetence changes.

Neuropathological changes in the brain of pigs with acute liver failure	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						Acute liver failure; ammonia; blood-brain-barrier; cerebral edema; hepatic encephalopathy	MINIMAL HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; ARTERIAL AMMONIA; ALBUMIN DIALYSIS; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; BARRIER PERMEABILITY; TRANSPLANTATION; PRESSURE; EDEMA; INFLAMMATION; HYPOTHERMIA	Objective. Cerebral edema is a serious complication of acute liver failure (ALF), which may lead to intracranial hypertension and death. An accepted tenet has been that the blood-brain barrier is intact and that brain edema is primarily caused by a cytotoxic etiology due to hyperammonemia. However, the neuropathological changes in ALF have been poorly studied. Using a well characterized porcine model we aimed to investigate ultrastructural changes in the brain from pigs suffering from ALF. Materials and methods. Sixteen female Norwegian Landrace pigs weighing 27-35 kg were randomised into two groups: ALF (n = 8) and sham operated controls (n = 8). ALF was induced with an end-to-side portacaval shunt followed by ligation of the hepatic arteries. Biopsies were harvested from three different areas of the brain (frontal lobe, cerebellum, and brain stem) following eight hours of ALF and analyzed using electron microscopy. Results. Profound perivascular and interstitial edema were found in all three areas. Disruption of pericytic and astrocytic processes were seen, reflecting breakdown/lesion of the blood-brain barrier in animals suffering from ALF. Furthermore, neurons and axons were edematous and surrounded by vesicles. Severe damage to Purkinje neuron (necrosis) and damaged myelin were seen in the cerebellum and brain stem, respectively. Biopsies from sham operated animals were normal. Conclusions. Our data support the concept that vasogenic brain edema plays an important role in the development of intracranial hypertension in pigs with ALF.

Public interest and support for neuroscience research through initiatives like the Decade of the Brain project and increasingly diverse brain-related initiatives have created new interfaces between neuroscience and society. Against this backdrop of dynamic innovation, we set out to examine how different features of neuroscience are depicted in print media. We used the 'guided news' function of the LexisNexis Academic database with keyword searches to find news articles published between 1995 and 2004 in major U.S. and U.K. English-language news sources. We performed searches on headlines, lead paragraphs, and body terms to maximize search yields. All articles were coded for overall tone of coverage, details on reported studies, presence of ethical, legal, and social discussion as well as the emerging interpretations of neuroscience in the form of neuro-essentialism, neuro-realism, and neuro-policy. We found that print media coverage of the use of neurotechnology for diagnosis or therapy in neuropsychiatric disorders was generally optimistic. We also found that, even within articles that were identified as research reports, many did not provide details about research studies. We also gained additional insights into the previously identified phenomena of neuro-essentialism, neuro-realism, and neuro-policy showing some profound impacts of neuroscience on personal identity and policy-making. Our results highlight the implications of transfer of neuroscience knowledge to society given the substantial and authoritative weight ascribed to neuroscience knowledge in defining who we are. We also discuss the impact of these findings on neuroscience and on the respective contributions of the social sciences and the biological sciences in contemporary psychiatry and mental health policy.

Whether an immature progenitor/stem cell sub-population is present in the developing mammalian retina remains undefined. Deficiency in the polycomb group gene Bmi1 results in reduced proliferation and postnatal depletion of neural and hematopoietic stem cells. Here, we show that Bmi1 is required for the self-renewal of most immature RPCs and for postnatal retinal development. In the embryo, Bmi1 is highly enriched in a rare stage-specific embryonic antigen-1-positive RPC subpopulation expressing the stem cell markers Sox2, Lhx2, and Musashi. Gain-of-function experiments revealed that Bmi1 overexpression could convert RPCs having limited proliferation capacity into RPCs showing extensive proliferation and multiple differentiation capacities over time. At all developmental stages analyzed using the neurosphere assay, Bmi1 deficiency resulted in reduced proliferation and self-renewal of most immature RPCs. Reduced RPCs proliferation was also observed in the peripheral retina of Bmi1(-/-) fetus and newborn mice. The biological impact of these developmental anomalies was revealed by the reduced retinal diameter of Bmi1-deficient pups. P19(Arf) and p16(Ink4a) were upregulated in vivo and in vitro and coinactivation of p53, which lies downstream of p19(Arf), partially restored Bmi1-deficient RPCs self-renewal phenotype. Bmi1 thus distinguishes immature RPCs from the main RPC population and is required for normal retinal development.

This indicates that hMT+ is truly responsive to motion-related information regardless of visual experience and the sensory modality through which such information is carried to the brain. Here we determined whether the hMT+ complex responds to motion perception per se, that is, motion not perceived through the visual, haptic or aural modalities. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated brain responses in eight congenitally blind and nine sighted volunteers who had been trained to use the tongue display unit (TDU), a sensory substitution device which converts visual information into electrotactile pulses delivered to the tongue, to resolve a tactile motion discrimination task. Stimuli consisted of either static dots, dots moving coherently or dots moving in random directions. Both groups learned the task at the same rate and activated the hMT+ complex during tactile motion discrimination, although at different anatomical locations. Furthermore, the congenitally blind subjects showed additional activations within the dorsal extrastriate cortical pathway. These results extend previous data in support of the supramodal functional organization of hMT+ complex by showing that this cortical area processes motion-related information per se, that is, motion stimuli that are not visual in nature and that are administered to body structures that, in humans, are not primarily devoted to movement perception or spatial location, such as the tongue. In line with previous studies, the differential activations between sighted and congenitally blind individuals indicate that lack of vision leads to functional rearrangements of these supramodal cortical areas.

The posterior superior temporal sulcus is an important part of a network involved in biological motion processing. However, the underlying functional organization remains poorly understood. Several studies have suggested topographical representation of motion from different body parts within this region. However, other studies have shown that the posterior superior temporal sulcus responds equally to any body part. OBJECTIVE: Through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, the effects of socially relevant biological motion stimuli to activate a specific cortical area within posterior superior temporal sulcus, even if different body parts are involved in motion, will be analyzed. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A functional magnetic resonance imaging, block-design was performed at the Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Surgical Medical Investigation Center, Havana, Cuba between 2004 and 2005. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen healthy volunteers, from 19 to 55 years of age and comprising eight males and five females, were included in the study. METHODS: A conjunction analysis of responses to natural, dynamic, fearful, facial expressions and point-light, body-motion animations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The corresponding functionally specialized areas, as well as neural areas significant for both types of stimuli, were identified. RESULTS: One region within the posterior superior temporal sulcus of the right hemisphere was equally activated by facial and body complex motion. CONCLUSION: A site of common neural activity existed within the posterior superior temporal sulcus, which was not specific to a biological motion type. In addition, the activity was not related to a topographically organized body-part map, which suggested high-level visual representation of biological motion in this region.

However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using single-particle tracking of AMPARs, we show that CaMKII activation and postsynaptic translocation induce the synaptic trapping of AMPARs diffusing in the membrane. AMPAR immobilization requires both phosphorylation of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin and its binding to PDZ domain scaffolds. It does not depend on the PDZ binding domain of GluA1 AMPAR subunit nor its phosphorylation at Ser831. Finally, CaMKII-dependent AMPAR immobilization regulates short-term plasticity. Thus, NMDA-dependent Ca(2+) influx in the post-synapse triggers a CaMKII- and Stargazin-dependent decrease in AMPAR diffusional exchange at synapses that controls synaptic function.

Within these tumors, a CD133-positive cancer-initiating neural stem cell (NSC) population was shown to be resistant to gamma radiation through preferential activation of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response machinery, including the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase. The polycomb group protein BMI1 is enriched in CD133-positive GBM cells and required for their self-renewal in an INK4A/ARF-independent manner through transcriptional repression of alternate tumor suppressor pathways. We report here that BMI1 copurifies with DNA DSB response and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair proteins in GBM cells. BMI1 was enriched at the chromatin after irradiation and colocalized and copurified with ATM and the histone gamma H2AX. BMI1 also preferentially copurified with NHEJ proteins DNA-PK, PARP-1, hnRNP U, and histoneH1 in CD133-positive GBM cells. BMI1 deficiency in GBM cells severely impaired DNA DSB response, resulting in increased sensitivity to radiation. In turn, BMI1 overexpression in normal NSCs enhanced ATM recruitment to the chromatin, the rate of gamma H2AX foci resolution, and resistance to radiation. BMI1 thus displays a previously uncharacterized function in controlling DNA DSB response and repair. Pharmacological inhibition of BMI1 combined with radiation therapy may provide an effective mean to target GBM stem cells.

Neural Correlates of Motor Learning in the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex: Dynamic Regulation of Multimodal Integration in the Macaque Vestibular System	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PIG DEITERS NUCLEUS; HEAD GAZE SHIFTS; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; VOLUNTARY CANCELLATION; MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES; HIGH-ACCELERATION; FIRING BEHAVIOR	Motor learning is required for the reacquisition of skills that have been compromised as a result of brain lesion or disease, as well as for the acquisition of new skills. Behaviors with well characterized anatomy and physiology are required to yield significant insight into changes that occur in the brain during motor learning. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is well suited to establish connections between neurons, neural circuits, and motor performance during learning. Here, we examined the linkage between neuronal and behavioral VOR responses in alert behaving monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during the impressive recovery that occurs after unilateral vestibular loss. We show, for the first time, that motor learning is characterized by the dynamic reweighting of inputs from different modalities (i.e., vestibular vs extravestibular) at the level of the single neurons that constitute the first central stage of vestibular processing. Specifically, two types of information, which did not influence neuronal responses before the lesion, had an important role during compensation. First, unmasked neck proprioceptive inputs played a critical role in the early stages of this process demonstrated by faster and more substantial recovery of vestibular responses in proprioceptive sensitive neurons. Second, neuronal and VOR responses were significantly enhanced during active relative to passive head motion later in the compensation process (> 3 weeks). Together, our findings provide evidence linking the dynamic regulation of multimodal integration at the level of single neurons and behavioral recovery, suggesting a role for homeostatic mechanisms in VOR motor learning.

Chemokines are also implicated in the immune response to viral infections. Many viruses encode proteins that mimic or block chemokine actions, in order to evade host immune responses. The murine gammaherpesvirus-68 encodes a chemokine-binding protein called M3, which has unique biochemical features that enable it to bind to and inhibit an unusually broad range of chemokines. We applied a replication-defective adenoviral vector encoding M3 (AdM3) directly to the CNS to evaluate the capacity of this protein to inhibit neuroinflammation using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Treatment with the AdM3 vector significantly reduced the clinical severity of EAE, attenuated CNS histopathology. and reduced numbers of immune cells infiltrating the CNS. These results suggest that M3 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to neuroinflammatory disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The deregulation of the serotonergic (5-HT) system is implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. Buspirone is a partial agonist of 5-HT1A receptors and is used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to assess, in OBX rats and sham operated controls, the effect of chronic buspirone treatment on the densities of 5-HT2A and 5-HT1B receptors, as well as the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), which are all important mediators of 5-HT transmission. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-240 g) were used. Two weeks following the surgeries, the rats were assigned into the saline or treatment groups, receiving either saline, or 10 or 20 mg/kg day of buspirone, for 2 weeks by subcutaneous mini pump. Following the treatment, the rats were sacrificed. The autoradiographic experiments were performed ex vivo using [H-3]5-HT for the 5-HT1B receptors, [H-3]-ketanserin for the 5-HT2A receptors, and [H-3]-paroxetine for the 5-HTT binding. The receptors and 5-HTT densities were quantified in 38 brain regions as well as the pineal body. Chronic treatment with buspirone produced the following: 1) a decrease in the 5-HT1B densities, which was more pronounced in the Sham rats; 2) an increase in the 5-HT2A receptor densities, which was more pronounced in the Sham rats; and 3) an decrease in 5-HTT densities in both groups. The results indicate differential effects of chronic antidepressant treatment on the 5-HT system regulation in the OBX model of depression and normal rats. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hippocampal Activation During a Cognitive Task Is Associated With Subsequent Neuroendocrine and Cognitive Responses to Psychological Stress	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						fMRI; stress; hippocampus; cortisol; memory	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; BRAIN NETWORKS; NORADRENERGIC ACTIVATION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; CORTISOL RESPONSES; SALIVARY CORTISOL; DIVIDED ATTENTION	Increased activation of the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by increased secretion of cortisol, is a biological marker of psychological stress. It is well established that the hippocampus plays an important role in the regulation of HPA axis activity. The relationship between cortisol (stress-related elevation or exogenous administration) and the hippocampal-related cognitive function is often examined. However, few human studies to date have examined the effect of stress on hippocampal activity and the interactions between stress-induced activation of the HPA axis and hippocampal function during different phases of cognitive function. On the basis of our previous work, we hypothesized that group differences in stress-sensitivity relate to differences in hippocampal-related stress-integration. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional MRI study using tasks known to involve the hippocampal formation: novel-picture encoding, psychological stress, and paired-picture recognition. On the basis of their cortisol responses to stress, we divided subjects into stress-responders (increase in cortisol, n = 9) and nonresponders (decrease in cortisol, n = 10). Responders showed higher hippocampal deactivation during the stress task and lower recognition scores due to a larger number of misses. Intriguingly, stress-responders showed significant differences in hippocampal activation already prior to stress, with higher levels of hippocampal activity during the picture encoding. Although effects of both cortisol and hippocampal activation on recognition were present in responders, similar effects were absent in the nonresponder group. Our results indicate that hippocampus plays an important role in adaptive behavioral responses. We hypothesize that states of hippocampal activation prior to stress might reflect states of vigilance or anxiety, which might be important for determining interindividual differences in subsequent stress response and cognitive performance.

Here we show that the electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus can learn to recognize individual conspecifics based on a simple cue, the beat frequency of their summed sinusoidal electric organ discharges (EOD). Male fish produce transient communication signals (chirps) in response to mimic EODs. The chirp response habituates over repeated stimulus presentations within one experimental session, continues to habituate over successive daily sessions and is nearly extinguished after 5-7 days. Habituation of the chirp response was specific to the presented beat frequency. The conversion of short- to long-term habituation could be disrupted by cooling the head 30 minutes after the daily habituation trials. Consolidation of long-term memory in mammals is thought to involve induced expression of an immediate early gene, Egr-1. We cloned the Apteronotid homolog of the Egr-1 gene and found that chirp-evoking stimuli induced strong expression of its mRNA within the dorsal (Dd), central (DC), and lateral (DL) subdivisions of the dorsal telencephalon. Interestingly, the dorsolateral region is hypothesized to be homologous to the amniote hippocampal formation. We conclude that A. leptorhynchus can learn to identify individual conspecifics based on their EOD frequency and can remember these frequencies for several days. We hypothesize that this form of learning, as in primates and songbirds, requires a subset of dorsal telencephalic areas and involves a consolidation-like process that includes the expression of the transcription factor AptEgr-1.

For the first time with fMRI, we investigated repetition suppression (i.e., fMRI adaptation) for two orthogonal dimensions of sentence complexity: embedding position (right-branching vs. center-embedding) and movement type (subject vs. object). Two novel results were obtained: First, we found syntactic adaptation in Broca's area and second, this adaptation was structured. Anterior Broca's area (BA 45) selectively adapted to movement type, while posterior Broca's area (BA 44) demonstrated adaptation to both movement type and embedding position (as did left posterior superior temporal gyrus and right inferior precentral sulcus). The functional distinction within Broca's area is critical not only to an understanding of the functional neuroanatomy of language, but also to theoretical accounts of syntactic complexity, demonstrating its multi-dimensional nature. These results implicate that during syntactic comprehension, a large network of areas is engaged, but that only anterior Broca's area is selective to syntactic movement. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

To address this question we undertook a forward genetic screen in zebrafish (Danio rerio) to identify mutants exhibiting abnormal touch-evoked behaviors, despite the presence of sensory neurons and peripheral neurites. One family, subsequently named touche, was found to harbor a recessive mutation which produced offspring that were unresponsive to light touch, but responded to a variety of other sensory stimuli. The optogenetic activation of motor behaviors by touche mutant sensory neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 suggested that the synaptic output of sensory neurons was intact, consistent with a defect in sensory neuron activation. To explore sensory neuron activation we developed an in vivo preparation permitting the precise placement of a combined electrical and tactile stimulating probe upon eGFP-positive peripheral neurites. In wild-type larva electrical and tactile stimulation of peripheral neurites produced action potentials detectable within the cell body. In a subset of these sensory neurons an underlying generator potential could be observed in response to subthreshold tactile stimuli. A closer examination revealed that the amplitude of the generator potential was proportional to the stimulus amplitude. When assayed touche mutant sensory neurons also responded to electrical stimulation of peripheral neurites similar to wild-type larvae, however tactile stimulation of these neurites failed to uncover a subset of sensory neurons possessing generator potentials. These findings suggest that touche is required for generator potentials, and that cutaneous mechanoreceptors with generator potentials are necessary for responsiveness to light touch in zebrafish.

Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Dominant and Recessive GLRA1 Mutations in Hyperekplexia	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INHIBITORY GLYCINE RECEPTOR; BETA-SUBUNIT; COMPOUND HETEROZYGOSITY; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN; CHLORIDE CHANNELS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; STARTLE DISEASE; ALPHA-1 SUBUNIT; BINDING	Hyperekplexia is a rare, but potentially fatal, neuromotor disorder characterized by exaggerated startle reflexes and hypertonia in response to sudden, unexpected auditory or tactile stimuli. This disorder is primarily caused by inherited mutations in the genes encoding the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha 1 subunit (GLRA1) and the presynaptic glycine transporter GlyT2 (SLC6A5). In this study, systematic DNA sequencing of GLRA1 in 88 new unrelated human hyperekplexia patients revealed 19 sequence variants in 30 index cases, of which 21 cases were inherited in recessive or compound heterozygote modes. This indicates that recessive hyperekplexia is far more prevalent than previous estimates. From the 19 GLRA1 sequence variants, we have investigated the functional effects of 11 novel and 2 recurrent mutations. The expression levels and functional properties of these hyperekplexia mutants were analyzed using a high-content imaging system and patch-clamp electrophysiology. When expressed in HEK293 cells, either as homomeric alpha 1 or heteromeric alpha 1 beta GlyRs, subcellular localization defects were the major mechanism underlying recessive mutations. However, mutants without trafficking defects typically showed alterations in the glycine sensitivity suggestive of disrupted receptor function. This study also reports the first hyperekplexia mutation associated with a GlyR leak conductance, suggesting tonic channel opening as a new mechanism in neuronal ligand-gated ion channels.

However, the neural correlates of navigation in subjects lacking vision remain elusive. We therefore used functional MRI (fMRI) to explore the cortical network underlying successful navigation in blind subjects. We first trained congenitally blind and blindfolded sighted control subjects to perform a virtual navigation task with the tongue display unit (TDU), a tactile-to-vision sensory substitution device that translates a visual image into electrotactile stimulation applied to the tongue. After training, participants repeated the navigation task during fMRI. Although both groups successfully learned to use the TDU in the virtual navigation task, the brain activation patterns showed substantial differences. Blind but not blindfolded sighted control subjects activated the parahippocampus and visual cortex during navigation, areas that are recruited during topographical learning and spatial representation in sighted subjects. When the navigation task was performed under full vision in a second group of sighted participants, the activation pattern strongly resembled the one obtained in the blind when using the TDU. This suggests that in the absence of vision, cross-modal plasticity permits the recruitment of the same cortical network used for spatial navigation tasks in sighted subjects.

Mutations in Centrosomal Protein CEP152 in Primary Microcephaly Families Linked to MCPH4	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							MICROTUBULE GENERATION; PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; HUMAN BRAIN; ASPM GENE; SIZE; PREDICTION; EVOLUTION; SEQUENCE; SPINDLE	Primary microcephaly is a rare condition in which brain size is substantially diminished without other syndromic abnormalities. Seven autosomal loci have been genetically mapped, and the underlying causal genes have been identified for MCPH1, MCPH3, MCPH5, MCPH6, and MCPH7 but not for MCPH2 or MCPH4. The known genes play roles in mitosis and cell division. We ascertained three families from an Eastern Canadian subpopulation, each with one microcephalic child. Homozygosity analysis in two families using genome-wide dense SNP genotyping supported linkage to the published MCPH4 locus on chromosome 15q21.1. Sequencing of coding exons of candidate genes in the interval identified a nonconservative amino acid change in a highly conserved residue of the centrosomal protein CEP152. The affected children in these two families were both homozygous for this missense variant. The third affected child was compound heterozygous for the missense mutation plus a second, premature-termination mutation truncating a third of the protein and preventing its localization to centrosomes in transfected cells. CEP152 is the putative mammalian ortholog of Drosphila asterless, mutations in which affect mitosis in the fly. Published data from zebrafish are also consistent with a role of CEP152 in centrosome function. By RT-PCR, CEP152 is expressed in the embryonic mouse brain, similar to other MCPH genes. Like some other MCPH genes, CEP152 shows signatures of positive selection in the human lineage. CEP152 is a strong candidate for the causal gene underlying MCPH4 and may be an important gene in the evolution of human brain size.

Visual motion gradient sensitivity shows scale invariant spatial frequency and speed tuning properties	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Visual motion; Motion integration; Receptive field; Motion contrast; Velocity	AREA MT; TRANSPARENT MOTION; SELECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; NEURONS; CORTEX; INTEGRATION; VISIBILITY; MECHANISMS; DIRECTION	We investigated sensitivity to motion gradients psychophysically using a band-pass filtered white noise stimulus with two superimposed components moving in opposite directions and spatially modulated with out of phase periodic functions. An optimum sensitivity ratio of the carrier to the modulator frequency of about 11 was measured. Tuning for speed was also observed, with sensitivity falling off at higher speeds in a trend showing scale invariance, consistent with temporal frequency tuning. Similar tuning properties were observed for both luminance and motion contrast thresholds. These findings are consistent with local and global processes in striate and extra-striate cortex respectively and suggest the scale of second stage low frequency integration is broad and matched to the spatiotemporal scale of the sensitivity of first stage local filters. The finding of scale invariance over a large range in stimulus size of 4.6-37 degrees of visual angle suggest a general property of integrating neural mechanisms, which was identified here because of the use of narrowband stimuli.

The guidance cue netrin-1 organizes neuronal networks by attracting or repelling cellular processes through DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC-5 homologue (UNC5H) receptors, respectively. We have shown that variations in netrin-1 receptor levels lead to selective reorganization of mPFC DA circuitry, and changes in DA-related behaviors, in transgenic mice and in rats. Significantly, these effects are only observed after puberty, suggesting that netrin-1 mediated effects on DA systems vary across development. Here we report on the normal expression of DCC and UNC5H in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) by DA neurons from embryonic life to adulthood, in both mice and rats. We show a dramatic and enduring pubertal change in the ratio of DCC: UNC5H receptors, reflecting a shift toward predominant UNC5H function. This shift in DCC: UNC5H ratio coincides with the pubertal emergence of UNC5H expression by VTA DA neurons. Although the distribution of DCC and UNC5H by VTA DA neurons changes during puberty, the pattern of netrin-1 immunoreactivity in these cells does not. Together, our findings suggest that DCC: UNC5H ratios in DA neurons at critical periods may have important consequences for the organization and function of mesocorticolimbic DA systems.

After ANP stimulation, NPR1/GCA down-regulates the transcriptional activity of its gene via a cGMP-dependent mechanism. Because we previously identified a cis-acting element responsible for this cGMP sensitivity, we proceed here to explore novel putative protein binding to cGMP-response element (cGMP-RE). Using the yeast one-hybrid technique with a human kidney cDNA library, we identified a strong positive clone able to bind cGMP-RE. The clone was derived from 1083-bp-long cDNA of a gene of yet unknown function localized on human chromosome 1 (1p33.36). We named this new protein GREBP (for cGMP-response element-binding protein). DNA binding assays showed 18-fold higher cGMP-RE binding capacity than the controls, whereas an electromobility shift assay indicated a specific binding for the cGMP-RE, and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the binding of GREBP to the element under physiological conditions. By acting on cGMP-RE, GREBP inhibited the expression of a luciferase-coupled NPR1 promoter construct. In H295R cells, ANP heightened GREBP expression by 60% after just 3h of treatment while inhibiting NPR1/GCA expression by 30%. Silencing GREBP with specific small interfering RNA increased the activity of the luciferase-coupled NPR1 promoter and GCA/NPR1 mRNA levels. GREBP is a nuclear protein mainly expressed in the heart. We report here the existence of a human-specific gene that acts as a transcriptional repressor of the NPR1/GCA gene.

These successes have lead to the suggestion that BM's could significantly improve the safety and efficiency of space operations. Electroencephalography (EEG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based BMIs are most relevant for potential space applications due to their portability, non-invasiveness, and relative inexpensiveness. However, BMIs using these methods are limited in their speed, content, and accuracy of information transfer. In this paper, we suggest that the performance limitations of current BMIs may reflect the incomplete information of non-invasive signals rather than merely a lack of maturity of the technology. As an alternative to using BMIs for direct control, we describe how new research on monitoring spontaneously generated brain signals may be practically applied in space operations.

J	Gosselin, B; Sawan, M				Gosselin, Benoit; Sawan, Mohamad			A low-power integrated neural interface with digital spike detection and extraction	ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	DEC 11-14, 2007	Marrakech, MOROCCO	IEEE		Neural recording; Integrated neural interface; Spike detection; Bandwidth reduction; Low-power mixed-signal design	SYSTEM; CIRCUIT	We present the design of an integrated neural interface intended for multi-channel neural recording. The design features a mixed-signal part that handles neural signal conditioning, digitization, time-division multiplexing, and a digital module providing control, absolute threshold detection, extraction of spikes, and serial communications towards a host interface. The detection and extraction strategy preserves the entire neuronal spike waveshapes by means of synchronized internal data buffering. This bandwidth reduction scheme prompts for better waveform sorting results and improved performance in prosthetic applications. Both parts of the presented neural interface were fabricated separately in a CMOS 0.18 mu m process. The whole neural interface features 16 channels for validation, but, the proposed approach is scalable to larger channel counts. The performance of the implemented neural interface was validated on testbench with synthetic neural waveforms. It features a power consumption of 138 mu W per channel and a size of 2.304 mm(2), and achieves a bandwidth reduction factor of up to 48.

CASE SUMMARY: An 11-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital after presenting with facial diplegia; abdominal, forehead, and thigh pain; and acute cervical pain. He had received the Arepanrix H1N1 subcutaneous vaccine 13 days before symptom onset. The neurologic examination also revealed a symmetric bilateral paralysis of the VIIth cranial nerve and intense pain, proximal weakness of the shoulder girdles and pelvis, and preserved deep tendon reflexes. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an albuminocytologic dissociation. Therefore, a diagnosis of atypical GBS following vaccination against H1N1 influenza was made. DISCUSSION: Based on the clinical evaluation, laboratory test results, neurologic features, and the exclusion of alternative diagnoses, the Naranjo probability scale revealed a probable relationship between the clinical manifestations of GBS and the vaccine against influenza A (H1N1) received by the patient. This is the first published case for the 2009 influenza pandemic in children. CONCLUSIONS: While recent studies have found inconclusive results on the association between influenza vaccine and GBS, all suspected cases should be published for further evaluation.

The term autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been used to describe their variable presentation. Although the cause of these disorders is not yet known, studies strongly suggest a genetic basis with a complex mode of inheritance. More research is needed to explore environmental factors that could be contributing to the cause of these disorders. The occurrence of ASD has been increasing worldwide, with the most recent prevalence studies indicating that they are present in 6 per 1000 children. The objectives of this article are to provide physicians with relevant information needed to identify and refer children presenting with symptoms suggestive of ASDs to specialized centers early, and to make them feel comfortable in dealing with public concerns regarding controversial issues about the etiology and management of these disorders.

Objective: To identify plasma proteins associated with AD pathology using a combined proteomic and neuro-imaging approach. Design: Discovery-phase proteomics to identify plasma proteins associated with correlates of AD pathology. Confirmation and validation using immunodetection in a replication set and an animal model. Setting: A multicenter European study (AddNeuroMed) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants: Patients with AD, subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls with standardized clinical assessments and structural neuroimaging. Main Outcome Measures: Association of plasma proteins with brain atrophy, disease severity, and rate of clinical progression. Extension studies in humans and transgenic mice tested the association between plasma proteins and brain amyloid. Results: Clusterin/apolipoprotein J was associated with atrophy of the entorhinal cortex, baseline disease severity, and rapid clinical progression in AD. Increased plasma concentration of clusterin was predictive of greater fibrillar amyloid-beta burden in the medial temporal lobe. Subjects with AD had increased clusterin messenger RNA in blood, but there was no effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding clusterin with gene or protein expression. APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed increased plasma clusterin, age-dependent increase in brain clusterin, as well as amyloid and clusterin colocalization in plaques. Conclusions: These results demonstrate an important role of clusterin in the pathogenesis of AD and suggest that alterations in amyloid chaperone proteins may be a biologically relevant peripheral signature of AD.

Saliva samples were provided by 783 middle-aged male twins on one laboratory and two home days as part of the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Significant cortisol heritability estimates were found for laboratory measures only: awakening (.56); 30 min after awakening (.48); 1000 h (.42); mean output across the day (.43); and mean cortisol awakening response (.64). Twin correlations at home were low. In the laboratory, they were unchanged for fraternal twins, but increased for identical twins. Greater measurement error at home did not appear to account for home-laboratory differences. The results suggest that genetic factors influence cortisol responses to specific environmental stressors. Thus, cortisol levels are correlated in identical twins only when they undergo similar experiences.

Lumbar spinal stenosis: a brief review of the nonsurgical management	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Review							CAUDAL EPIDURAL INJECTIONS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; UNITED-STATES TRENDS; DOUBLE-BLIND; SALMON-CALCITONIN; MEDICARE POPULATION; PHYSICAL-THERAPY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RADICULAR PAIN; GABAPENTIN	The purpose of this brief narrative review is to summarize the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials pertaining to the nonsurgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The MEDLINE (January 1950 to the fourth week of January 2010) and EMBASE (January 1980 to 2009, week 53) databases, the MESH term "spinal stenosis", and the key words, "vertebral canal stenosis" and "neurogenic claudication", were searched. Results were limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted on human subjects, written in English, and published in peer-reviewed journals. Only RCTs pertaining to nonsurgical treatment were considered. Studies comparing conservative and surgical management or different surgical techniques were not included in the review. The search criteria yielded 13 RCTs. The average enrolment was 54 subjects per study. Blinded assessment and sample size justification were provided in 85% and 39% of RCTs, respectively. The available evidence suggests that parenteral calcitonin, but not intranasal calcitonin, can transiently decrease pain in patients with LSS. In the setting of epidural blocks, local anesthetics can improve pain and function, but the benefits seem short-lived. The available evidence does not support the addition of steroids to local anesthetic agents. Based on the limited evidence, passive physical therapy seems to provide minimal benefits in LSS. The optimal regimen for active physiotherapy remains unknown. Although benefits have been reported with gabapentin, limaprost, methylcobalamin, and epidural adhesiolysis, further trials are required to validate these findings. Because of their variable quality, published RCTs can provide only limited evidence to formulate recommendations pertaining to the nonsurgical treatment of LSS. In this narrative review, no study was excluded based on factors such as sample size justification, statistical power, blinding, definition of intervention allocation, or clinical outcomes. This aspect may represent a limitation as it may serve to overemphasize evidence derived from "weaker" trials. Further well-designed RCTs are warranted.	[Tran, De Q.

Here, we review recent evidence identifying a critical role for Slit/Robo signals to guide pioneer longitudinal axons in the embryonic brain stem. These studies indicate that Slit/Robo signals from the floor plate have dual functions: to repel longitudinal axons away from the ventral midline, and also to maintain straight longitudinal growth. These dual functions likely cooperate with other guidance cues to establish the major longitudinal tracts in the brain.	[Mastick, Grant S.; Farmer, W.

There are an increasing number of reports in the literature linking MPDs with cerebrovascular anomalies, including intracranial aneurysms and moyamoya. An 18-year-old female patient with SS and mental retardation was referred for spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. At the age of 3 years, she had suffered multifocal ischemic cerebrovascular accidents following an elective urological procedure. Cardiac, hematologic, and serologic workups were negative, and cerebral angiography was recommended but declined by the parents. Brain MRA and cerebral angiography showed bilateral narrowing of extracranial and intracranial internal carotid arteries (ICAs), obliteration of the right supraclinoid ICA without moyamoya collaterals, and multiple bilateral saccular aneurysms on the hypertrophied posterior cerebral arteries. Considering the patient's previous quality of life and the high risks of either endovascular or surgical treatment, all invasive treatments were withheld at the parents' request and only palliative care was offered. It appears that patients with MPD are prone to the development of cerebrovascular anomalies. Therefore, imaging of cerebral vessels should be performed when such patients present with cerebral ischemia or stroke.

Whereas Mthfr(-/-) BALB/c mice show growth retardation, developmental delay, and spermatogenic defects and infertility, C57BL/6 mice appear to have a less severe phenotype. In the present study, we investigated the effects of MTHFR deficiency on early germ cell development in both strains and assessed whether MTHFR deficiency results in DNA methylation abnormalities in sperm. The reproductive phenotype associated with MTHFR deficiency differed strikingly between the two strains, with BALB/c mice showing an early postnatal loss of germ cell number and proliferation that was not evident in the C57BL/6 mice. As a result, the BALB/c MTHFR-deficient mice were infertile, whereas the C57BL/6 mice had decreased sperm numbers and altered testicular histology but showed normal fertility. Imprinted genes and sequences that normally become methylated during spermatogenesis were unaffected by MTHFR deficiency in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, a genome-wide restriction landmark genomic scanning approach revealed a number of sites of hypo-and hypermethylation in the sperm of this mouse strain. These results showing strain-specific defects in MTHFR-deficient mice may help to explain population differences in infertility among men with common MTHFR polymorphisms.

Sensory inputs may thus have distinct impacts according to the state of activity of the central networks. Using an in-vitro isolated lamprey brainstem preparation, we investigated whether a brainstem locomotor center, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), modulates sensory transmission. The synaptic responses of brainstem reticulospinal (RS) cells to electrical stimulation of the sensory trigeminal nerve were recorded before and after electrical stimulation of the MLR. The RS cell synaptic responses were significantly reduced by MLR stimulation and the reduction of the response increased with the stimulation intensity of the MLR. Bath perfusion of atropine prevented the depression of sensory transmission, indicating that muscarinic receptor activation is involved. Previous studies have shown that, upon stimulation of the MLR, behavioral activity switches from a resting state to an active-locomotor state. Therefore, our results suggest that a state-dependent modulation of sensory transmission to RS cells occurs in the behavioral context of locomotion and that muscarinic inputs from the MLR are involved.

Sometimes we infer a meaning to an observed action based on integration of the actual percept with memories. Here, we conducted a series of experiments in healthy adults to investigate whether such inferred meanings can also modulate motor cortical outputs in specific ways. We show that brief observation of a neutral stimulus mimicking a hand does not significantly modulate motor cortical excitability (Study 1) although, after prolonged exposure, it can lead to a relatively nonspecific modulation (Study 2). However, when such a neutral stimulus is preceded by exposure to a hand stimulus, the latter appears to serve as a prime, perhaps enabling meaning to the neutral stimulus, which then modulates motor cortical excitability in accordance with mirror neuron-driving properties (Studies 2 and 3). Overall results suggest that a symbolic value ascribed to an otherwise neutral stimulus can modulate motor cortical outputs, revealing the influence of top-down inputs on the mirror neuron system. These findings indicate a novel aspect of the human mirror neuron system: an otherwise neutral stimulus can acquire specific mirror neuron-driving properties in the absence of a direct association between motor practice and perception. This significant malleability in the way that the mirror neuron system can code otherwise meaningless (i.e. arbitrarily associated) stimuli may contribute to coding communicative signals such as language. This may represent a mirror neuron system feature that is unique to humans.

Methods: All children with term intra-partum asphyxia encountered in a single pediatric neurology practice with at least two years follow-up and an abnormal neurologic outcome were identified. Results: A total of 40 children (28 males, 12 females) were identified. Twenty-four had moderate NE and sixteen severe NE. The mean number of non-specific non-essential diagnostic criteria (out of a possible 7) was 4.75 +/- 1.39 SD. Sixty percent had five or more criteria and all criteria were present in only 10% of newborns. The mean number of non-CNS organ systems affected was 2.88 +/- 1.96 SD (out of a possible 6). Ten percent of our sample showed no evident non-CNS organ injury acutely. Conclusion: Most asphyxiated neonates failed to consistently satisfy all elements of present consensus statements.

This manipulation must have costs. Here we explore the combined effects of three such costs on the amount of effort a parasite should expend on host manipulation. Manipulation can have direct costs to future reproductive success due to energy expended to manipulate the host. There may also be indirect costs if other parasites infect the host and profit from the manipulation without paying the cost of manipulation. These "free riders" may impose a third cost by competing with manipulators for resources within the host. Using game theory analysis and several different competition models we show that intrahost competition will decrease the investment that a parasite should make in manipulation but that manipulation can, under some circumstances, be a profitable strategy even in the presence of non-manipulating competitors. The key determinants of the manipulator's success and its investment in manipulation are the relatedness among parasites within the host, the ratio of the passive transmission rate to the efficiency of increasing transmission rate and the strength of competitive effects. Manipulation, when exploited by others, becomes an altruistic behaviour. Thus we suggest that our model may be generally applicable to cases where organisms can exploit the investment of others (possibly kin) while also competing with the organism whose investment they exploit.

Rhythm synchronization performance and auditory working memory in early- and late-trained musicians	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Sensitive period; Early-trained; Late-trained; Sensorimotor; Musicians; Rhythm synchronization; Working memory; Cognitive abilities	WHITE-MATTER DEVELOPMENT; SENSITIVE PERIODS; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT; COCHLEAR IMPLANTS; ABSOLUTE PITCH; HUMAN BRAIN; CHILDREN; INTELLIGENCE; NONMUSICIANS	Behavioural and neuroimaging studies provide evidence for a possible "sensitive" period in childhood development during which musical training results in long-lasting changes in brain structure and auditory and motor performance. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that adult musicians who begin training before the age of 7 (early-trained; ET) perform better on a visuomotor task than those who begin after the age of 7 (late-trained; LT), even when matched on total years of musical training and experience. Two questions were raised regarding the findings from this experiment. First, would this group performance difference be observed using a more familiar, musically relevant task such as auditory rhythms? Second, would cognitive abilities mediate this difference in task performance? To address these questions, ET and LT musicians, matched on years of musical training, hours of current practice and experience, were tested on an auditory rhythm synchronization task. The task consisted of six woodblock rhythms of varying levels of metrical complexity. In addition, participants were tested on cognitive subtests measuring vocabulary, working memory and pattern recognition. The two groups of musicians differed in their performance of the rhythm task, such that the ET musicians were better at reproducing the temporal structure of the rhythms. There were no group differences on the cognitive measures. Interestingly, across both groups, individual task performance correlated with auditory working memory abilities and years of formal training. These results support the idea of a sensitive period during the early years of childhood for developing sensorimotor synchronization abilities via musical training.

However, it seems that it has only been validated in children with cerebral palsy. Nevertheless, the parameters used to compute GGI are not specific to children population. Our aim is to demonstrate that GGI could also be used to evaluate adults gait abnormalities. 44 adults (25 healthy and 19 pathological) participated to this study. Pathological subjects had a diagnosis of central nervous system pathology (6 with spinal cord injury and 13 with brain injury). We first, compared the kinematic parameter values of our healthy adult group to healthy children group in previous studies. It appears that those parameters' variability is a bit lower in adults, which makes the GGI more sensitive. Moreover, the GGI in adults is too much dependent on one parameter among the 16 proposed by Schutte et al. (2000), the "Time of Peak Flexion". Finally, the Edinburgh Visual Gait Score (EVGS) is correlated to GGI in children. To emphasize the relevance of GGI in adults, we have evaluated the correlation between EVGS and GGI in our pathological group. Those two parameters are indeed highly correlated.

Gait parameters of 11 children with DMD were compared to those of 14 control children while considering the effect of gait velocity using 3D biomechanical analysis. Kinematic and kinetic gait parameters were measured using an Optotrak motion analysis system and AMTI force plates embedded in the floor. The data profiles of children with DMD walking at natural gait velocity were compared to those of the control children who walked at both natural and slow gait velocities. When both groups walked at similar velocity, children with DMD had higher cadence and shorter step length. They demonstrated a lower hip extension moment as well as a minimal or absent knee extension moment. At the ankle, a dorsiflexion moment was absent at heel strike due to the anterior location of the center of pressure. The magnitude of the medio-lateral ground reaction force was higher in children with DMD. Despite this increase, the hip abductor moment was lower. Hip power generation was also observed at the mid-stance in DMD children. These results suggest that most of the modifications observed are strategies used by children with DMD to cope with possible muscle weakness in order to provide support, propulsion and balance of the body during gait.

Regional Gray Matter Density Changes in Brains of Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome	GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						Neuroimaging; Voxel-Based Morphometry; VBM; Neural	CHRONIC BACK-PAIN; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; VISCERAL PAIN; MRI DATA; MIGRAINE; FIBROMYALGIA; INTENSITY; CORTEX; REGISTRATION	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several studies have examined structural brain changes associated with chronic pain syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but study sample sizes have been small and heterogeneous. METHODS: We used magnetic resonance imaging-based techniques, voxel-based morphometry, and cortical thickness analysis to examine brain anatomical differences in a relatively large, tightly screened sample of IBS patients (n = 55); we compared data with that from healthy persons (controls; n = 48). RESULTS: IBS was associated with decreased gray matter density (GMD) in widespread areas of the brain, including medial prefrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, ventral striatum, and thalamus. Compared with controls, we observed increased GMD in patients with IBS in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as trends in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, (para) hippocampus, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In accounting for anxiety and depression, we found that several of the regions involved in affective processing no longer differed between patients with IBS and controls, whereas the differences in prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices remained. The areas of decreased GMD associated with IBS were largely consistent across clinical subgroups, based on predominant bowel habit and pain predominance of symptoms. No overall or regional differences were observed in cortical thickness between patients with IBS and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in density of gray matter among regions involved in cognitive/evaluative functions are specifically observed in patients with IBS, whereas changes in other areas of the brain can be explained by levels of anxiety and depression.

We chose to investigate the two most widespread acquisition sequences for VBM, FLASH and MP-RAGE, at 1.5 and 3 T. We first evaluated image quality of the four acquisition protocols in terms of SNR and image uniformity. We then performed a VBM study on eight subjects scanned twice using the four protocols to evaluate differences in grey matter (GM) density and corresponding scan-rescan variability, and a power analysis for each protocol in the context a longitudinal and cross-sectional VBM study. As expected, the SNR increased significantly at 3 T for both FLASH and MP-RAGE. Image non-uniformity increased as well, in particular for MP-RAGE. The differences in CNR and contrast non-uniformity cause regional biases between protocols in the VBM results, in particular between sequences at 3 T. The power analysis results show an overall decrease in the number of subjects required in a longitudinal study to detect a difference in GM density at 3 T for MP-RAGE, but an increase for FLASH. The number of subjects required in a cross-sectional VBM study is higher at 3 T for both sequences. Our results show that each protocol has a distinct regional sensitivity pattern to morphometric change, which goes against the classical view of VBM as an unbiased whole brain analysis technique, complicates the combination of data within a VBM study and the direct comparison of VBM studies based on different protocols.

However, the anatomical correlates of these changes are not yet well understood. Here, we perform the first tensor-based morphometric analysis of voxel-wise volumetric differences in native signing prelingual and congenitally deaf subjects when compared with hearing controls. We obtained T1-weighted scans for 14 native signing prelingual and congenitally deaf subjects and 16 age- and gender-matched controls. We used linear and fluid registration to align each image to a common template. Using the voxel-wise determinant of the Jacobian of the fluid deformation, significant volume increases, of up to 20%, were found in frontal lobe white matter regions including Broca's area, and adjacent regions involved in motor control and language production. A similar analysis was performed on hand-traced corpora callosa. A strong trend for group differences was found in the area of the splenium considered to carry fibers connecting the temporal (and occipital) lobes. These anatomical differences may reflect experience-mediated developmental differences in myelination and cortical maturation associated with prolonged monomodal sensory deprivation.

It is enriched in primary sensory neurons and hence involved in nociception and neurogenic inflammation. Recent studies have shown that CGRP can be produced by immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages following inflammatory stimulation, suggesting a role in innate immunity. However, it is unclear how CGRP is up-regulated in macrophages and if it plays a role in macrophage functions such as the production of cytokines and chemokines. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex ELISA, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found to induce CGRP in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. LPS-induced inflammatory mediators such as nerve growth factor (NGF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signalling are involved in inducing CGRP, whereas the NGF receptor trkA and CGRP receptor signalling pathways are unexpectedly involved in suppressing LPS-induced CGRP, which leads to the fine-tune regulation of CGRP release. Exogenous CGRP and CGRP receptor antagonists, in a concentration-dependent manner, stimulated, inhibited or had no effect on basal or LPS-induced release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-10 in RAW macrophages. The ligand-concentration-dependent regulation of the production of inflammatory mediators by CGRP receptor signalling is a novel mechanism underlying the stimulating and suppressing role of CGRP in immune and inflammatory responses. Together, our data suggest that monocytes/macrophages are an important source of CGRP. Inflammation-induced CGRP has a positive or negative reciprocal effect on the production of other pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Thereby CGRP plays both facilitating and suppressing roles in immune and inflammatory responses.

In fact, it has been suggested that variables such as substance use and personality may mediate this relationship. Other variables, such as childhood physical abuse, might also be implicated in the etiology. In the current study, a sample of one hundred and eighteen participants with a primary diagnosis of psychosis were interviewed and prevalence rates for aggressive experiences were as follows: history of trouble with the law (45%), history of emotional abuse (9.6%), physical abuse (38.8%), and sexual abuse (60.2%). With regard to perpetration, 69.6% reported verbal or physical aggression (69.6%), and further, 61% reported problems with substances. Logistic regression procedures were used with a number of the variables under study and relationships were evidenced between psychopathy scores, history of abuse, and regular drug use. History of child abuse was related to violence history, with those who were victims of child abuse being more likely to be violent in later life. In addition higher scores on the psychopathy measure were linked with violence history. This study was a first step towards identifying persons suffering from a mental illness who may be at risk for violence by identifying who, among first episode clients. may be more likely to perpetrate violent behaviours. Targeted interventions and strategies may be further refined so that individuals receiving mental health services may be better served. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Fiori, LM; Turecki, G				Fiori, Laura M.; Turecki, Gustavo			Genetic and epigenetic influences on expression of spermine synthase and spermine oxidase in suicide completers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Polyamines; promoter variations; spermine oxidase; spermine synthase; suicide	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; POLYAMINE BIOSYNTHESIS; DNA METHYLATION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; HYPERMETHYLATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POPULATION; VARIANTS	Alterations in the levels of spermine synthase (SMS) and spermine oxidase (SMOX), two enzymes involved in polyamine metabolism, have previously been observed in brains of suicide completers. To characterize the roles played by genetic and epigenetic factors in determining expression levels of these genes, as well as to identify potential mechanisms by which to explain our findings in suicide completers, we (1) assessed the role of promoter polymorphisms in determining expression in the brain and in vitro, and (2) examined CpG methylation and levels of methylated histone H3 lysine-27 in the promoter regions of these genes in the prefrontal cortex of suicide completers and healthy controls. We identified several promoter haplotypes in SMS and SMOX, but found no consistent effects of haplotype on expression levels in either the brain or in reporter gene assays performed in three different cell lines. We also found no overall effects of epigenetic factors in determining expression, with the exception of a relationship between CpG methylation at one site in the promoter of SMOX and its expression in Brodmann area 8/9. In conclusion, the genetic and epigenetic factors examined in this study show little influence on the expression levels of SMS and SMOX, and do not appear to be responsible for the dysregulated expression of these genes in suicide completers.

Debate persists, despite many randomized trials, perhaps because BM patients are a heterogeneous population. The purpose of the present study was to identify significant diagnosis-specific prognostic factors and indexes (Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment [DS-GPA]). Methods and Materials: A retrospective database of 5,067 patients treated for BMs between 1985 and 2007 was generated from 11 institutions. After exclusion of the patients with recurrent BMs or incomplete data, 4,259 patients with newly diagnosed BMs remained eligible for analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors and outcomes by primary site and treatment were performed. The significant prognostic factors were determined and used to define the DS-GPA prognostic indexes. The DS-GPA scores were calculated and correlated with the outcomes, stratified by diagnosis and treatment. Results: The significant prognostic factors varied by diagnosis. For non small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer, the significant prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance status, age, presence of extracranial metastases, and number of BMs, confirming the original GPA for these diagnoses. For melanoma and renal cell cancer, the significant prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance status and the number of BMs. For breast and gastrointestinal cancer, the only significant prognostic factor was the Karnofsky performance status. Two new DS-GPA indexes were thus designed for breast/gastrointestinal cancer and melanoma/renal cell carcinoma. The median survival by GPA score, diagnosis, and treatment were determined. Conclusion: The prognostic factors for BM patients varied by diagnosis. The original GPA was confirmed for non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer.

Here we report longitudinal changes in cognition and quality of life, effects of patient factors and treatments on cognition, quality of life and survival, and prognostic implications of cognition and quality of life. Methods and Materials: Cognition was assessed by Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and quality of life by Brain-Quality of Life (B-QOL). Scores were analyzed for survivors and within 5 years of death. Shared parameter models evaluated MMSE/B-QOL with survival. Results: For survivors, MMSE and B-QOL scores were similar longitudinally and between treatments. For those who died, MMSE scores remained stable initially, whereas B-QOL slowly declined; both declined rapidly in the last year of life and similarly between arms. In the aggregate, scores decreased over time (p = 0.0413 for MMSE; p = 0.0016 for B-QOL) and were superior with age <50 years (p < (1001 for MMSE; p = 0.0554 for B-QOL) and Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) 80-100 (p < 0.001). Younger age and higher KPS were associated with longer survival. After adjusting for patient factors and drop-out, survival was longer after PCV + RT (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.49-0.9, p = 0.0084; HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.54-1.01, p = 0.0592) in models with MMSE and B-QOL. In addition, there were no differences in MMSE and B-QOL scores between arms (p = 0.4752 and p = 0.2767, respectively); higher scores predicted longer survival. Conclusion: MMSE and B-QOL scores held steady in the upper range in both arms for survivors. Younger, fitter patients had better MMSE and B-QOL and longer survival. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The p75NTR intracellular domain generated by neurotrophin-induced receptor cleavage potentiates Trk signaling	JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE			English	Article						Neurotrophin; NGF; BDNF; Cerebellar granule neuron; PC12 cell; Cell cycle	NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; AFFINITY NGF RECEPTOR; ALPHA-CONVERTING ENZYME; NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION; INDUCED DIFFERENTIATION; SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; PC12 CELLS; IN-VIVO; KINASE; ACTIVATION	The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) potentiates Trk signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Here, we examine the relationship between p75NTR cleavage and Trk signaling. We found that, in PC12 cells, nerve growth factor (NGF) induces rapid and robust alpha-secretase-and gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage of p75NTR, releasing the resulting intracellular domain into the cytosol. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor similarly induces p75NTR cleavage in primary cerebellar granule neurons. p75NTR cleavage occurs by means of Trk-dependent activation of MEK-Erk signaling and induction of alpha-secretase activity, and is independent of ligand binding to p75NTR. Neurons and PC12 cells lacking p75NTR display defects in neurotrophin-dependent Akt activation. Normal Akt activation is rescued using full-length p75NTR or the p75 intracellular domain, but not cleavage-resistant p75NTR. We then demonstrate that NGF-dependent growth arrest of PC12 cells requires p75NTR cleavage and generation of the intracellular domain. We conclude that generation of the soluble p75NTR intracellular domain by Trk-induced cleavage plays a fundamental role in Trk-dependent signaling events.

Materials and Methods: The de facto standard 32-echo spin-echo imaging sequence was used throughout, and data were analyzed using regularized non-negative least squares (NNLS) to produce T(2) distributions. Three studies were conducted in healthy subjects. First, two acquisition protocols were compared in 10 subjects. Second, variability of QT2 was evaluated over same-day scan-rescan experiments in 6 subjects. Finally, variability was quantified in a longitudinal study of 5 subjects. Results: A within-subject coefficient of variation (Coy) of 12% (range 4-25%) was observed for the MWF in brain white matter (WM) regions of interest (ROIs). The geometric mean T(2) was more stable, with a longitudinal Coy of 4% (range 1-6%). The choice of the geometry and repetition time of the acquisition protocol influenced the estimates of the MWF and T(2) values. The choice of integration range for the short-T(2) component had a significant effect on MWF estimates, but not on reproducibility. Conclusion: The reproducibility of QT2 measurements using existing methods is moderate and the method can be used in longitudinal studies, with careful consideration of the methodologic variability and an appropriate group size.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) regulate noxious stimulus-induced glutamate release in the spinal cord dorsal horn of rats with neuropathic and inflammatory pain	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						capsaicin; chronic constriction injury; complete Freund's adjuvant; excitatory amino acids; formalin; in vivo microdialysis	KNEE-JOINT INFLAMMATION; GROUP-II; PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION; IN-VIVO; MECHANICAL HYPERSENSITIVITY; NERVE LIGATION; MESSENGER-RNA; DIABETIC-RATS; AMINO-ACIDS; NEURONS	In rats with persistent pain, spinal group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activity has been shown to be pronociceptive, whereas spinal group II/III activity is anti-nociceptive. In brain, group I mGluR activity produces positive feedback effects on glutamate release, whereas group II/III activity produces negative feedback effects. It is unknown whether the nociceptive versus anti-nociceptive effects of spinal group I versus group II/III mGluR activity depend on differential regulation of spinal glutamate release. Here, we used behavioral nociceptive testing and in vivo microdialysis to assess the effect of intrathecal treatment with group I mGluR antagonists [cyclopropan[b] chromen-1a-carboxylate, (CPCCOEt), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP)] or groups II [aminopyrrolidine-2R,4R-dicarboxylate (APDC)] and III [L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4)] mGluR agonists or vehicle, on nociception and noxious stimulus-induced increases in glutamate release in the spinal cord dorsal horn of rats with a chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve or hind paw injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). None of the treatments significantly influenced basal spinal glutamate concentrations in either CCI or CFA rats. In CCI rats, formalin-induced nociception and increases in spinal glutamate concentrations were significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with CPCCOEt, MPEP, APDC, or L-AP4. In CFA rats, capsaicin-induced increases in nociception and spinal glutamate concentrations were significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with CPCCOEt, MPEP, or APDC, but not L-AP4. This study demonstrates that group I antagonists and group II/III mGluR agonists attenuated the enhanced nociception and noxious stimulus-induced glutamate release in spinal cord dorsal horn of CCI and/or CFA rats in vivo, and suggests a possible mechanism for their anti-hyperalgesic effects.

Neuroprotection against superoxide anion radical by metallocorroles in cellular and murine models of optic neuropathy	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						metallocorroles; neuroprotection; neurons; super-oxide; optic neuropathy	PEROXYNITRITE DECOMPOSITION CATALYSTS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; REACTIVE OXYGEN; IN-VIVO; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; GALLIUM CORROLES; ANTIOXIDANT; DISMUTASE; SCAVENGERS; PORPHYRIN	P>Corroles are tetrapyrrolic macrocycles that have come under increased attention because of their unique capabilities for oxidation catalysis, reduction catalysis, and biomedical applications. Corrole-metal complexes (metallocorroles) can decompose certain reactive oxygen species (ROS), similar to metalloporphyrins. We investigated whether Fe-, Mn-, and Ga-corroles have neuroprotective effects on neurons and correlated this with superoxide scavenging activity in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis was induced in retinal ganglion cell-5 neuronal precursor cells by serum deprivation. Cell death was measured with sodium 3'-[1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate and calcein-AM/propidium iodide assays. Fe- and Mn-corroles, but not the non-redox-active Ga-corrole used as control, reduced RGC-5 cell death after serum deprivation. Serum deprivation caused increased levels of intracellular superoxide, detected by an increase in the fluorescence intensity of 2-hydroxyethidium, and this was blocked by Fe- and Mn-corroles, but not Ga-corrole. In vivo real-time confocal imaging of retinas after optic nerve transection assessed the superoxide production within individual rat retinal ganglion cells. Fe- and Mn-corroles, but not Ga-corrole, scavenged neuronal superoxide in vivo. Given that the neuroprotective activity of metallocorroles correlated with superoxide scavenging activity, Fe- and Mn-corroles could be candidate drugs for delaying neuronal death after axonal injury in optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma.

The study method is a case series and included identification of patients from University of Montreal Health Centre archives database (1995-2007). All diagnoses were confirmed by neuroimaging or brain autopsy. Twelve individuals (25-66 years old) presented heterogeneous manifestations. Co-morbidities included diabetes insipidus (n = 2), haemodialysis (n = 1), cirrhosis (n = 3), gastroenteritis (n = 2) and potomania (n = 1). Aetiologies included rapid correction of severe hyponatremia (n = 6)/acute hypernatremia (n = 1); immediate (n = 2) or remote (n = 1 with recurrent cirrhosis) orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) with tacrolimus-induced immunosuppression (n = 3); and chronic alcoholism (n = 4, two with hyponatremia). Four individuals died acutely. Two were lost to follow-up. Six had good motor or cerebellar recovery. Neuropsychological evaluations (n = 5/6) revealed a subcortical/frontal dysfunction. Cognitive impairment represented the major remaining lasting sequel (n = 4). Three salient clinical syndromes were observed: (1) predominant cerebellar presentation in individuals with alcoholism (n = 4); (2) significant alteration of consciousness at presentation (n = 4), all resulting in death (OLT, n = 3); (3) seizures persisting after natremia correction (n = 2). Clinical presentation of CPEPM is heterogeneous and can even include seizures. Cognitive impairment should be screened as it is a significant factor limiting return to normal life.

Response competition in the primary motor cortex: Corticospinal excitability reflects response replacement during simple decisions. J Neurophysiol 104: 119-127, 2010. First published May 5, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00819.2009. It has been suggested that, during decisions about actions, multiple options are initially specified in parallel and then gradually eliminated in a competition for overt execution. To further test this hypothesis, we studied the modulation of human corticospinal excitability during the reaction time of the Eriksen flanker task. In the task, subjects responded with finger flexion or extension to a central arrow while ignoring congruent or incongruent flanker arrows. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over primary motor cortex (M1) at one of five different latencies after stimulus onset, and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured in the contralateral index finger. During the control (no flankers) and congruent conditions, MEP size in the agonist increased gradually over the course of reaction time, indicating an increase in corticospinal excitability. Conversely, when the same muscle acted as an antagonist, MEP size decreased, suggesting inhibition. Critically, in the incongruent condition, MEPs briefly increased in the muscle corresponding to an initial default response to the flanker arrows and were later replaced by MEPs corresponding to the correct response to the central arrow. Finally, we found that the gradually growing MEPs for the three conditions reached a constant maximum level just before movement initiation. We propose that this dynamic modulation in corticospinal excitability reflects the competition process, leading to the selection of one response and the rejection of the other. Our results suggest that response competition influences activity in primary motor cortex and that its timing directly influences motor output latency.

Generalization of Dynamics Learning Across Changes in Movement Amplitude	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							REACHING MOVEMENTS; INTERNAL-MODEL; VISUAL CUES; MOTOR; ARM; ADAPTATION; OBJECT; TASK	Mattar AAG, Ostry DJ. Generalization of dynamics learning across changes in movement amplitude. J Neurophysiol 104: 426-438, 2010. First published May 12, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00886.2009. Studies on generalization show the nature of how learning is encoded in the brain. Previous studies have shown rather limited generalization of dynamics learning across changes in movement direction, a finding that is consistent with the idea that learning is primarily local. In contrast, studies show a broader pattern of generalization across changes in movement amplitude, suggesting a more general form of learning. To understand this difference, we performed an experiment in which subjects held a robotic manipulandum and made movements to targets along the body midline. Subjects were trained in a velocity-dependent force field while moving to a 15 cm target. After training, subjects were tested for generalization using movements to a 30 cm target. We used force channels in conjunction with movements to the 30 cm target to assess the extent of generalization. Force channels restricted lateral movements and allowed us to measure force production during generalization. We compared actual lateral forces to the forces expected if dynamics learning generalized fully. We found that, during the test for generalization, subjects produced reliably less force than expected. Force production was appropriate for the portion of the transfer movement in which velocities corresponded to those experienced with the 15 cm target. Subjects failed to produce the expected forces when velocities exceeded those experienced in the training task. This suggests that dynamics learning generalizes little beyond the range of one's experience. Consistent with this result, subjects who trained on the 30 cm target showed full generalization to the 15 cm target. We performed two additional experiments that show that interleaved trials to the 30 cm target during training on the 15 cm target can resolve the difference between the current results and those reported previously.

Directional selectivity, in which neurons respond preferentially to one "preferred" direction of movement over the opposite "null" direction, is a critical computation that is found in the central nervous systems of many animals. Such responses are generated using two mechanisms: spatiotemporal convergence via pathways that differ in the timing of information from different locations on the receptor array and the nonlinear integration of this information. Previous studies have showed that various mechanisms may act as nonlinear integrators by suppressing the response in the null direction. Here we show, through a combination of mathematical modeling and in vivo intracellular recordings, that subthreshold membrane conductances can act as a nonlinear integrator by increasing the response in the preferred direction of motion only, thereby enhancing the directional bias. Such subthreshold conductances are ubiquitous in the CNS and therefore may be used in a wide array of computations that involve the enhancement of an existing bias arising from differential spatiotemporal filtering.

Amblyopia or lazy eye is the most common cause of uniocular blindness in adults and is caused by a disruption to normal visual development as a consequence of unmatched inputs from the two eyes in early life, arising from a turned eye (strabismus), unequal refractive error (anisometropia), or form deprivation (e.g., cataract). Using high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging in a group of human adults with amblyopia, we previously demonstrated that reduced responses are observable at a thalamic level, that of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Here we investigate the selectivity of this deficit by using chromatic and achromatic stimuli that are designed to bias stimulation to one or other of the three ascending pathways (the parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular). We find the greatest LGN deficit is for stimuli modulated along the chromatic, L/M cone opponent axis of color space, suggesting a selective loss of parvocellular function in the LGN. We also demonstrate a cortical deficit that involves all the visual areas studied (V1, V2, V3, VP, V3A, V4), and we find this is greatest for the two chromatic responses (S cone opponent and L/M cone opponent) versus the achromatic response, as might be expected from a loss of segregation of chromatic pathways in the cortex.

Effect of plyometric vs. dynamic weight training on the energy cost of running. J Strength Cond Res 24(7): 1818-1825, 2010-The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 2 strength training methods on the energy cost of running (Cr). Thirty-five moderately to well-trained male endurance runners were randomly assigned to either a control group (C) or 2 intervention groups. All groups performed the same endurance-training program during an 8-week period. Intervention groups added a weekly strength training session designed to improve neuromuscular qualities. Sessions were matched for volume and intensity using either plyometric training (PT) or purely concentric contractions with added weight (dynamic weight training [DWT]). We found an interaction between time and group (p < 0.05) and an effect of time (p < 0.01) for Cr. Plyometric training induced a larger decrease of Cr (218 6 16 to 203+/-13 ml.kg(-1).km(-1)) than DWT (207+/-15 to 199 +/- 12 ml.kg(-1).km(-1)), whereas it remained unchanged in C. Pre-post changes in C(r) were correlated with initial C(r) (r = -0.57, p < 0.05). Peak vertical jump height (VJH(peak)) increased significantly (p, 0.01) for both experimental groups (DWT = 33.4 +/- 6.2 to 34.9 +/- 6.1 cm, PT = 33.3 +/- 4.0 to 35.3 +/- 3.6 cm) but not for C. All groups showed improvements (p, 0.05) in Perf(3000) (C = 711+/-107 to 690+/-109 seconds, DWT = 755+/-87 to 724+/-77 seconds, PT = 748+/-81 to 712 6 76 seconds). Plyometric training were more effective than DWT in improving Cr in moderately to well-trained male endurance runners showing that athletes and coaches should include explosive strength training in their practices with a particular attention on plyometric exercises. Future research is needed to establish the origin of this adaptation.

A tonotopic, two-layer feedforward network model with one time constant for synaptic weight augmentation based on firing rate, and an independent time constant for synaptic weight decay was presented with classical continuity illusion stimuli. The results suggest that the continuity illusion could, in principle, be explained by basic, duration-dependent auditory circuit behavior, which could emerge at either early or later stages of processing.

J	Tian, ZG; Wong, LN; Safaei, N				Tian, Zhigang; Wong, Lorna; Safaei, Nima			A neural network approach for remaining useful life prediction utilizing both failure and suspension histories	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Remaining useful life; Prediction; Artificial neural networks; Suspension history; Bearing	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; RESIDUAL LIFE; MODEL; POLICY	Artificial neural network (ANN) methods have shown great promise in achieving more accurate equipment remaining useful life prediction. However, most reported ANN methods only utilize condition monitoring data from failure histories, and ignore data obtained from suspension histories in which equipments are taken out of service before they fail. Suspension history condition monitoring data contain useful information revealing the degradation of equipment, and will help to achieve more accurate remaining useful life prediction if properly used, particularly when there are very limited failure histories, which is the case in many applications. In this paper, we develop an ANN approach utilizing both failure and suspension condition monitoring histories. The ANN model uses age and condition monitoring data as inputs and the life percentage as output. For each suspension history, the optimal predicted life is determined which can minimize the validation mean square error in the training process using the suspension history and the failure histories. Then the ANN is trained using the failure histories and all the suspension histories with the obtained optimal predicted life values, and the trained ANN can be used for remaining useful life prediction of other equipments. The key idea behind this approach is that the underlying relationship between the inputs and output of ANN is the same for all failure and suspension histories, and thus the optimal life for a suspension history is the one resulting in the lowest ANN validation error. The proposed approach is validated using vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These variants were hypothesized to be pathogenic based mainly on genetic studies in a large cohort of NTD patients. In this study, we validate the potential pathogenic effect of these mutations in vivo by investigating their effect on convergent extension in zebrafish. Knocking down the expression of tri, the ortholog of Vangl2, using an antisense morpholino (MO), as shown previously, led to a defective convergent extension (CE) manifested by a shortened body axis and widened somites. Co-injection of the human VANGL1 with the tri-MO was able to partially rescue the tri-MO induced phenotype in zebrafish. In contrast, co-injection of two human VANGL1 variants, p.Val239Ile and p.Met328Thr, failed to rescue this phenotype. We next carried out overexpression studies where we measured the ability of the human VANGL1 alleles to induce a CE phenotype when injected at high doses in zebrafish embryos. While overexpressing the wild-type allele led to a severely defective CE, overexpression of either p.Val239Ile or p.Met328Thr variant failed to do so. Results from both tri-MO knockdown/rescue results and overexpression assays suggest that these two variants most likely represent "loss-of-function" alleles that affect protein function during embryonic development. Our study demonstrates a high degree of functional conservation of VANGL genes across evolution and provides a model system for studying potential variants identified in human NTDs.

Effect of sex and estrogen therapy on the aging brain: a voxel-based morphometry study	MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY			English	Article						Estrogen; Hormone therapy; Hippocampus; Parietal cortex; Striatum; Voxel-based morphometry	HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; AGE; RISK; DEMENTIA	Objective: It is still a matter of debate whether estrogen can have a protective effect on brain integrity and against age- and Alzheimer-related assaults. Evidence points toward selective sparing of gray matter (GM) in postmenopausal women using hormone therapy. In the current study, the effect of sex and estrogen therapy (ET) exposure on GM density using voxel-based morphometry was assessed. Methods: High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of 46 healthy participants were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. A total of 15 men and 31 healthy postmenopausal women were included: 15 ET-naive women (never users) and 16 current ET users with an average duration of use of 11 years. Results: Sex differences were found in fronto-temporo-parietal areas, with postmenopausal women having greater GM concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex, temporal cortices, angular gyrus, and precuneus, whereas the men had greater GM density in the superior frontal, inferior temporal gyri, and inferior parietal lobules. ET users compared with never users had greater GM density in the superior frontal gyrus and less GM density in the posterior part of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and angular gyri. In the group of ET users, a negative association was found between duration of ET use and posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal GM density, whereas a positive association was found in the hypothalamus, striatum, precunei, and inferior parietal lobules. Conclusions: These results point toward a potential regional-and duration-dependent estrogen exposure effect on cerebral areas known to be involved in age-related cognitive functions and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.

The central nervous system has been described as the coordinator of the inflammatory response to infection through the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and the autonomic nervous system. Brain lesions have been associated with impaired immunity and postoperative infections. We studied alterations of the inflammatory response in relation to neurohormonal patterns after neurosurgery for seizure. Methods. Nine patients were studied before, during and immediately after operation, and then on days 1, 2 and 4 post-operatively. Monocyte HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) expression and plasma interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12 and MIF were measured ex vivo and after an in vitro 6-h our lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of whole blood. Corticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, arginine vasopressin, prolactin, epinephrine and norepinephrine were quantified in plasma. The effect of plasma mediators on LPS stimulation was studied by replacing plasma with standard culture medium. Results. Surgery resulted in decreased ex vivo mHLA-DR expression, but no change in IL-10 or IL-12 plasma levels. mHLA-DR was low in LPS culture over the 4 postoperative days, whereas IL-10 release was increased and not counterbalanced by IL-12p40 production. The hormonal plasma pattern showed increased prolactin during anesthesia and peaks of cortisol, ACTH and arginine vasopressin during waking, but no alteration in catecholamine levels. mHLA-DR expression in LPS culture was not modified by plasma replacement, except immediately after surgery. Conclusion. Postoperatively, mHLA-DR expression was associated with an anti-inflammatory phenotype of whole blood. The anti-inflammatory profile was not related to the plasma mediators measured, suggesting that neural control might take place upstream in the circulation, at the level of progenitors in bone marrow.

New breakthroughs in brain cancer therapy have exploited that molecular signature and proved that efficient delivery of therapeutic agents involve LRP-mediated mechanisms. We performed gene expression profiling of CD133, a cell surface cancer stem cell marker, and of LRP in response to in vitro nutrient deprivation. We found that CD133 was selectively induced in serum-starved DAOY medulloblastoma cells but not in U87MG glioblastoma cells. Such CD133 induction was correlated to increases in LRP-1 and LRP-1b gene and protein expression. When a specific CD133(+) DAOY cell population was sorted from parental DAOY, we found increases in LRP-5 and LRP-8. Uptake of alpha(2)-macroglobulin, a specific LRP-1/1b ligand, was increased in serum-starved parental DAOY cells but not in CD133(+) DAOY cells, and receptor-associated protein (RAP), which binds to all cell surface LRPs, was able to compete for that uptake. Conversely, RAP binding was increased in serum-starved parental DAOY but alpha(2)-macroglobulin was unable to compete for such uptake. Strategies aiming at targeting cancer stem cell metabolic adaptative responses, such as that through LRP differential expression within the brain tissue microenvironmental niche, can now be envisioned.

The aim of this study was to assess the microglia activation induced by nanoparticles with different surfaces in (i) a transgenic mouse (Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2-luciferase (Luc) reporter) which allowed the biophotonic imaging of microglial activation/innate immune response after intranasal delivery of nanoparticles and (ii) in microglial dispersed cells in vitro. Cadmium selenide nanoparticles (quantum dots, QD), surface-exchanged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to form micelles, were tested to assess microglia activation and lipid droplet formation in both model systems. In vivo imaging revealed a robust increase in the extent of microglial activation/TLR2 response, initially in the olfactory bulb, but also in other more caudal brain regions. The increased TLR2 expression was complemented with enhanced CD68 expression in activated microglia in the same regions. Intense in vitro microglial activation by LPS-QD micelles was accompanied by a significant enhancement of nitric oxide production and formation of large lipid droplets, suggesting the possibility of this organelle acting as an inflammatory biomarker in response to nanoparticles, and not simply as a storage site in fat tissues.

Inflammatory responses in injured nerves play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NeP. Injured nerve derived cyclooxygenase 2/prostaglandin E2 (COX2/PGE2) contributes to the genesis of NeP at the early stage in young rats. Here we show that COX2/PGE2 is involved in the maintenance of NeP at a chronic stage in aged rats. Eighteen months after partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL), NeP remained prominent in aged rats. COX2 expressing macrophages and PGE2 levels were increased in injured nerves. PGE2 receptors (EP1 and EP4) and pain-related ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) were increased in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of aged PSNL rats. Perineural injection of a selective COX2 inhibitor NS-398 relieved NeP, reversed PSNL, increased expression of EPI, EP4 and TRPV1 and suppressed the levels of pain-related peptide substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in DRG neurons. These data suggest that injured nerve-derived PGE2 contributes to the maintenance of NeP at the chronic stage in aged rats. Chronically facilitating the synthesis of pain-related molecules in nociceptive DRG neurons is a novel mechanism underpinning the contribution of PGE2. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Epigenetic patterns are sculpted during development to shape the diversity of gene expression programs in the organism. In contrast to the genetic sequence, which is determined by inheritance and is virtually identical in all tissues, the epigenetic pattern varies from cell type to cell type and is potentially dynamic throughout life. It is postulated here that different environmental exposures, including early parental care, could impact epigenetic patterns, with important implications for mental health in humans. Because epigenetic programming defines the state of expression of genes, epigenetic differences could have the same consequences as genetic polymorphisms. Yet in contrast to genetic sequence differences, epigenetic alterations are potentially reversible. This review will discuss basic epigenetic mechanisms and how epigenetic processes early in life might play a role in defining inter-individual trajectories of human behavior. In this regard, we will examine evidence for the possibility that epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to later-onset neurological dysfunction and disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Multi-level bootstrap analysis of stable clusters in resting-state fMRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Bootstrap; Clustering; Functional MRI; Hierarchical clustering; k-Means; Multi-level analysis; Resting-state networks; Stability analysis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; MRI; CONNECTIVITY; STABILITY; IDENTIFICATION; PARCELLATION	A variety of methods have been developed to identify brain networks with spontaneous, coherent activity in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We propose here a generic statistical framework to quantify the stability of such resting-state networks (RSNs), which was implemented with k-means clustering. The core of the method consists in bootstrapping the available datasets to replicate the clustering process a large number of times and quantify the stable features across all replications. This bootstrap analysis of stable clusters (BASC) has several benefits: (1) it can be implemented in a multi-level fashion to investigate stable RSNs at the level of individual subjects and at the level of a group: (2) it provides a principled measure of RSN stability; and (3) the maximization of the stability measure can be used as a natural criterion to select the number of RSNs. A simulation study validated the good performance of the multi-level BASC on purely synthetic data. Stable networks were also derived from a real resting-state study for 43 subjects. At the group level, seven RSNs were identified which exhibited a good agreement with the previous findings from the literature. The comparison between the individual and group-level stability maps demonstrated the capacity of BASC to establish successful correspondences between these two levels of analysis and at the same time retain some interesting subject-specific characteristics, e.g. the specific involvement of subcortical regions in the visual and fronto-parietal networks for some subjects.

We identified 7 French-Canadian patients with a previously undiagnosed proximal myopathy. A genome wide scan was performed. Homozygosity mapping identified a locus on chromosome 4p16.2 containing DOK7. Sequencing of DOK7 revealed homozygous 1124_1127dupTGCC mutations in all individuals. SNP genotyping of 42 kb surrounding DOK7 in our cohort and in 9 patients of various European origins demonstrated a shared haplotype suggesting a common ancestral European mutation. In our cohort, fatigability was not prominent; rather patients reported prolonged periods of increased weakness. Abnormalities on repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber EMG were not invariably present. There was considerable intra-familial phenotypic variability, and we report an asymptomatic individual. DOK7 mutations should be considered in patients with early-onset myopathy, even in the absence of symptoms suggesting a possible myasthenia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. Recent work suggests that post-stroke USN may be partly related to a disruption of top-down and bottom-up control of visual attention mediated in part through the midbrain superior colliculi (SC). With mounting evidence from animal and human research, our objectives were: (1) to synthesize the literature implicating the SC in USN; (2) to review the rationale and potential for using eye patching and prism adaptation as USN treatment approaches that recruit SC involvement; and (3) to provide recommendations for research on the potential of therapeutic interventions that involve and/or target the retino-collicular pathway. Given the paucity of human studies, the contribution of the SC in USN, while plausible, remains to be confirmed. Further exploration of the mechanisms involved and their impact on USN in human subjects will help develop theoretically based intervention strategies tailored to USN type. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In vision, Bertone, Mottron, Jelenic, and Faubert (2005) found that enhanced and diminished visual processing is linked to the level of neural complexity required to process stimuli, as proposed in the neural complexity hypothesis. Based on these findings, Samson, Mottron, Jemel, Belin, and Ciocca (2006) proposed to extend the neural complexity hypothesis to the auditory modality. They hypothesized that persons with ASD should display enhanced performance for simple tones that are processed in primary auditory cortical regions, but diminished performance for complex tones that require additional processing in associative auditory regions, in comparison to typically developing individuals. To assess this hypothesis, we designed four auditory discrimination experiments targeting pitch, non-vocal and vocal timbre, and loudness. Stimuli consisted of spectra-temporally simple and complex tones. The participants were adolescents and young adults with autism, Asperger syndrome, and typical developmental histories, all with IQs in the normal range. Consistent with the neural complexity hypothesis and enhanced perceptual functioning model of ASD (Mottron, Dawson, Soulieres, Hubert, & Burack, 2006), the participants with autism, but not with Asperger syndrome, displayed enhanced pitch discrimination for simple tones. However, no discrimination-thresholds differences were found between the participants with ASD and the typically developing persons across spectrally and temporally complex conditions. These findings indicate that enhanced pure-tone pitch discrimination may be a cognitive correlate of speech-delay among persons with ASD. However, auditory discrimination among this group does not appear to be directly contingent on the spectro-temporal complexity of the stimuli. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Overt Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage Is Not a Sine Qua Non for Paradoxical Herniation After Decompressive Craniectomy: Case Report	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Brain sag; Decompressive craniectomy; Intracranial hypotension; Lumbar drain; Lumbar puncture; Paradoxical herniation; Transtentorial herniation	INTRACRANIAL HYPOTENSION; BRAIN-STEM; HYPOVOLEMIA; CRANIOTOMY; SECONDARY	OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Paradoxical transtentorial herniation is a rare but well-documented complication of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage in patients with large decompressive craniectomies. However, brain sagging in the absence of CSF hypovolemia has not been previously reported. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old woman suffered massive intracerebral hemorrhage from a small residual left frontal arteriovenous malformation 1 year following endovascular embolization and stereotactic radiosurgery. The patient initially presented in coma with left mydriasis and decorticate posturing and underwent emergent decompressive craniectomy, evacuation of the hematoma, and insertion of an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. Postoperatively, despite a depressed skin flap and low ICP readings, she continued to deteriorate neurologically, and CT revealed increasing midline shift, transtentorial herniation, and brainstem compression. INTERVENTION OR TECHNIQUE: Although there was no history of CSF drainage, the diagnosis of brain sag was suspected, because herniation seemed to occur in the setting of intracranial hypotension. The patient was placed in a 15 Trendelenburg position and improved dramatically within hours. A few days later, she was fully awake and had purposeful movements with her left side, although she had persistent aphasia and right hemiplegia. CONCLUSION: Although rare, paradoxical herniation in the setting of a large craniectomy defect may occur in the absence of CSF drainage. This entity should be suspected whenever transtentorial herniation occurs in conjunction with direct or indirect signs of intracranial hypotension. Placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position should be attempted, because this simple maneuver may turn out to be life-saving.

These disorders are characterized neuropathologically by varying degrees of neuronal cell death in basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord, and include clinical entities such as Wilson's Disease, post-shunt myelopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and acquired non-Wilsonian hepatocerebral degeneration. Morphologic changes to astrocytes (Alzheimer type II astrocytosis) are a major feature of hepatocerebral disorders. Neurological symptoms include Parkinsonism, cognitive dysfunction, and ataxia. Pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for cerebral dysfunction and neuronal cell death in hepatocerebral disorders include ammonia toxicity and neurotoxic effects of metals such as copper, manganese, and iron. Molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity include oxidative/nitrosative stress, glutamate (NMDA)-receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms. However, neuronal cell death in hepatocerebral disorders is limited by adaptive mechanisms that may include NMDA-receptor down-regulation, the synthesis of neuroprotective steroids and hypothermia. Management and treatment of hepatocerebral disorders include chelation therapy (Wilson's Disease), the use of ammonia-lowering agents (lactulose, antibiotics, ornithine aspartate) and liver transplantation.

Non-stress-related factors associated with maternal corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) concentration. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010. During pregnancy, most maternal corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted by the placenta, not the hypothalamus. Second trimester maternal CRH concentration is robustly associated with the subsequent risk of preterm birth, and it is often assumed that physiological and/or psychological stress stimulates placental CRH release. Evidence supporting the latter assumption is weak, however, and other factors affecting maternal CRH have received little attention from investigators. We carried out a case-control study nested within a large, multicentre prospective cohort of pregnant women to examine potential 'upstream' factors associated with maternal CRH concentration measured at 24-26 weeks of gestation. The predictors studied included maternal age, parity, birthplace (as a proxy for ethnic origin), pre-pregnancy body mass index, height, smoking, bacterial vaginosis and vaginal fetal fibronectin (FFN) concentration. Women with high (above the median) plasma CRH concentration were significantly less likely to have been born in Sub-Saharan Africa or the Caribbean, less likely to be overweight or obese, and more likely to be smokers. Associations with maternal birthplace and BMI persisted in logistic regression analyses controlling for potential confounding variables and when restricted to term controls. A strong (but imprecise and statistically non-significant) association was also observed with high vaginal FFN concentration. Further studies are indicated both in animal models and human populations to better understand the biochemical and physiological pathways to CRH secretion and their aetiological role, if any, in preterm birth.

Parasite fauna of Etheostoma nigrum (Percidae: Etheostomatinae) in localities of varying pollution stress in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article							SHINERS NOTROPIS-HUDSONIUS; PERCH PERCA-FLAVESCENS; ENVIRONMENTAL PARASITOLOGY; POTENTIAL USE; FISH; WATER; TRANSMISSION; INDICATORS; EXPOSURE; SYSTEM	Parasite communities were examined in johnny darters (Etheostoma nigrum) collected from five localities in the St. Lawrence River in southwestern Quebec: two reference localities, one polluted locality upstream of the Island of Montreal and downstream of industrial and agricultural activity, and two polluted localities downstream of the Island of Montreal in the plume from the wastewater treatment facility. Twenty-four helminth species were found. Fish from the upstream polluted locality had the highest parasite species richness and total parasite numbers, and fish from the downstream polluted localities the lowest. Nonmetric multivariate analyses were conducted using square-root-transformed Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. An analysis of similarity, dendrogram of centroids, and a permutational multivariate analysis of variance with contrasts all showed that fish from the reference localities had different parasite community composition than those from the polluted localities, and fish from the upstream polluted locality had different parasite communities than fish from the downstream polluted localities. Differences between reference and polluted localities were mainly due to higher abundances of the brain-encysting trematode, Ornithodiplostomum sp., at the reference localities. Differences between upstream and downstream polluted localities were mainly due to a higher diversity and abundance of trematodes in fish at the upstream locality.

Lack of effect of dopaminergic denervation on caudate-putamen hyperthermia or hypothermia induced by drugs and mild stressors	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Brain temperature; Caudate-putamen; Dopamine; Amphetamine; Apomorphine; Stressor	IN-VIVO MICRODIALYSIS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; FREELY MOVING RATS; BRAIN TEMPERATURE; BODY-TEMPERATURE; HYPOTHALAMIC TEMPERATURE; D-AMPHETAMINE; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; ROTATIONAL BEHAVIOR; STRIATAL DOPAMINE	A number of drugs and psychological stressors induce brain hyperthermia and increase extracellular dopamine in the caudate-putamen. The present study tested whether caudate-putamen hyperthermia produced by such stimuli is dependent on dopaminergic transmission. Rats were infused with 6-hydroxydopamine unilaterally into the medial forebrain bundle, and after a two-week recovery period, removable thermocouples were used to monitor temperature in the depleted and intact caudate-putamen in freely-moving animals. The indirect dopamine agonist d-amphetamine (1 and 2 mg/kg s.c.) increased caudate-putamen temperature, whereas a low dose of the direct agonist apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) reduced it. Gamma-butyrolactone, which strongly inhibits dopamine release at the dose administered (700 mg/kg i.p.), initially reduced and then increased caudate-putamen temperature. Brief (5-10 min) presentation of mild stressors, including tail pinch, produced a rapid and transient caudate-putamen hyperthermia. Quantitative (125)I-RTI-55 autoradiography in post-mortem tissue revealed a 97-100% loss of binding to dopamine transporters in the lesioned caudate-putamen. Despite this near-total dopamine denervation, neither basal caudate-putamen temperature, nor any of the observed temperature responses to drugs or mild stressors, was altered. We conclude that in the caudate-putamen, endogenous dopamine is unlikely to modulate temperature significantly at a local level. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

During this process, Golgi-resident proteins are released to the cytosol and interact with other signaling molecules to regulate various cellular processes. Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 protein (ACBD3) is a Golgi protein involved in several signaling events. ACBD3 protein was previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and cAMP-dependent protein kinase associated protein 7 (PAP7), Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa (GCP60). Golgi complex-associated protein 1 (GOCAP1), and Golgi phosphoprotein 1 (GOLPH1). In this review, we present the gene ontology of ACBD3, its relations to other Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing (ACBD) proteins, and its biological function in steroidogenesis, apoptosis, neurogenesis, and embryogenesis. We also discuss the role of ACBD3 in asymmetric cell division and cancer. New findings about ACBD3 may help understand this newly characterized signaling molecule and stimulate further research into its role in molecular endocrinology, neurology, and stem cell biology.

Although schizophrenia has been shown to be associated with deficit in episodic memory and emotional processing, the relation between these processes in this population remains unclear. Here, we used our previously validated paradigm to directly investigate the modulation of emotion on memory recognition. Twenty patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy controls completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of recognition memory of happy, sad, and neutral faces. Brain activity associated with the response bias was obtained by correlating this measure with the contrast subjective old (ie, hits and false alarms) minus subjective new (misses and correct rejections) for sad and happy expressions. Although patients exhibited an overall lower memory performance than controls, they showed the same effects of emotion on memory, both in terms of accuracy and bias. For sad faces, the similar behavioral pattern between groups was mirrored by a largely overlapping neural network, mostly involved in familiarity-based judgments (eg, parahippocampal gyrus). In contrast, controls activated a much larger set of regions for happy faces, including areas thought to underlie recollection-based memory retrieval (eg, superior frontal gyrus and hippocampus) and in novelty detection (eg, amygdala). This study demonstrates that, despite an overall lower memory accuracy, emotional memory is intact in schizophrenia, although emotion-specific differences in brain activation exist, possibly reflecting different strategies.

Association of NPAS3 exonic variation with schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						NPAS3; Genetic variation; Schizophrenia; Neurogenesis	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; OUTER ENVELOPE MEMBRANE; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; POLYGLYCINE STRETCH; BIPOLAR DISORDER; PROTEIN FUNCTION; GENE; MICE; NEUROGENESIS	Background: We previously identified the neuronal PAS3 (NPAS3) gene as a candidate gene for schizophrenia. A mother and daughter, both with schizophrenia, were carriers of a translocation, t(9;14)(q34;q13), that disrupts the NPAS3 gene. The gene is located at 14q13, a region implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in various linkage studies. NPAS3 belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor family, involved in diverse processes including the regulation of cell differentiation and circadian rhythms, and the development and function of the nervous system. Methods: The 12 exons encoding NPAS3 were sequenced in DNA from individuals with schizophrenia. NPAS3 variants were identified in exons 6 and 12, initially in 12 patients only. These two exons were then sequenced in 83 patients and 83 controls. Results and conclusion: Three common variants of NPAS3, also found in controls, showed a positive association with schizophrenia (NM_001164749: rs12434716, c.1654G>C, p=0.009; rs10141940, c.2208C>T, p = 0.01; rs10142034, c.2262C>G, p = 0.01). The c.1654G>C variant, results in an p.Ala552Pro change and may affect NPAS3 protein function directly. Alternatively, the three SNPs may affect the splicing of NPAS3 transcripts, as they are each located within putative exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs (ESEFinder). A c.726C>T variant, identified in three patients, is located in an ESE element and is predicted to reduce the function of the motif. Other variants, identified in controls, included c.2089G>A (p.Gly697Ser) and c.2097T>C. Our identification of potentially defective NPAS3 variants supports recent studies that implicate perturbations in NPAS3 pathways in impaired neurogenesis and psychosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the impact of synaptic scaling on the function of neural networks in vivo. We used the embryonic zebrafish to address the effect of synaptic scaling on the neural network underlying locomotion. Activity was decreased during development by TTX injection to block action potentials or CNQX injection to block glutamatergic transmission. Alternatively TNF alpha was chronically applied. Recordings from spinal neurons showed that glutamatergic mPSCs scaled up similar to 25% after activity reduction and fortuitously scaled down similar to 20% after TNF alpha treatment, and were unchanged following blockade of neuromuscular activity alone with alpha-bungarotoxin. Regardless of the direction of scaling, immediately following reversal of treatment no chronic effect was distinguishable in motoneuron activity patterns or in swimming behavior. We also acutely induced a similar increase of glutamatergic mPSC amplitudes using cyclothiazide to reduce AMPA receptor desensitization or decrease of glutamatergic mPSC amplitudes using a low concentration of CNQX to partially block AMPA receptors. Though the strength of the motor output was altered, neither chronic nor acute treatments disrupted the patterning of synaptic activity or swimming. Our results show, for the first time, that scaling of glutamatergic synapses can be induced in vivo in the zebrafish and that synaptic patterning is less plastic than synaptic strength during development.

THE PATTERN OF HUMAN TAU PHOSPHORYLATION IS THE RESULT OF PRIMING AND FEEDBACK EVENTS IN PRIMARY HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; tauopathies; neurodegeneration; cytoskeleton; axon; microtubules	PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; ALZHEIMER-LIKE PHOSPHORYLATION; PROTEIN-TAU; RAT-BRAIN; FETAL-TAU; IN-VIVO; DISEASE; PATHOLOGY; EPITOPE; KINASE	Tau, an axonal microtubule-associated protein, becomes hyperphosphorylated in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD). In AD brain, tau is phosphorylated at pathological multiple-site epitopes recognized by the antibodies AT8 (S1991S2021T205), AT100 (T212/S214/T217), AT180 (T231/S235) and PHF-1 (S3961S404) and at individual sites such as S262 and S422. Although it is believed that the hyperphosphorylation of tau occurs in a precise cascade of phosphorylation events, this cascade remains to be demonstrated in mammalian neuronal cells. In the present study, human tau mutants in which diseaserelated sites associated with either an early (AT8, T231 and S262) or intermediate (T217) stage of tau pathology were mutated in alanine to inhibit their phosphorylation were over-expressed in primary hippocampal neurons to examine their impact on the phosphorylation of other disease-related sites. The mutation in alanine of S262 decreased the phosphorylation of the AT8 and PHF-1 epitopes and that of T217. When the sites included in the AT8 epitope were mutated in alanine, the phosphorylation of T217 and PHF-1 epitope was significantly reduced indicating that the decrease of AT8 phosphorylation was a key event in the impaired phosphorylation of 1217 and PHF-1 by the S262 alanine mutant. Most interestingly, the mutation in alanine of 1217 had a positive impact on the phosphorylation of the AT8 epitope, indicating the presence of a feedback loop between AT8 and T217 in rat hippocampal neurons. The phosphorylation of the AT180 epitope was increased when S262 and the sites forming the AT8 epitope were mutated in alanine. The mutation of the AT8 epitope also increased the phosphorylation of S422. All together, our data show that the sites forming the AT8 epitope could play a central role in regulating the phosphorylation of tau at disease-associated sites and that priming and feedback events take place to regulate the overall level of tau phosphorylation in rat hippocampal neurons.

Relative to the correct rejection of distracter items, the correct recognition of studied items consistently produces an effect termed the old/new effect that is characterized by increased activity in parietal and frontal cortical regions. This effect has received only scant attention in schizophrenia. We examined the old/new effect in 15 people with schizophrenia and 18 controls during an item recognition test, and neural activity was examined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Both groups performed equally well during the recognition test and showed increased activity in a left dorsolateral prefrontal region and in the precuneus bilaterally during the successful recognition of old items relative to the correct rejection of new items. The control group also exhibited increased activity in the dorsal left parietal cortex. This region has been implicated in the top-down modulation of memory which involves control processes that support memory-retrieval search, monitoring and verification. Although these processes may not be of paramount importance in item recognition memory performance, the present findings suggest that people with schizophrenia may have difficulty with such top-down modulation, a finding consistent with many other studies in information processing.

This study aims at defining the role of microglial kinin B1R in diabetic pain neuropathy. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were made diabetic with STZ (65 mg/kg, i.p.), and 4 days later, two specific inhibitors of microglial cells (fluorocitrate, 1 nmol, i.t.; minocycline, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered to assess the impact on thermal hyperalgesia, allodynia and mRNA expression (qRT-PCR) of B1R and pro-inflammatory markers. Spinal B1R binding sites ((I-125)-HPP-desArg(10)-Hoe 140) were also measured by quantitative autoradiography. Inhibition of microglia was confirmed by confocal microscopy with the specific marker Iba-1. Effects of intrathecal and/or systemic administration of B1R agonist (des-Arg(9)-BK) and antagonists (SSR240612 and R-715) were measured on neuropathic pain manifestations. Results: STZ-diabetic rats displayed significant tactile and cold allodynia compared with control rats. Intrathecal or peripheral blockade of B1R or inhibition of microglia reversed time-dependently tactile and cold allodynia in diabetic rats without affecting basal values in control rats. Microglia inhibition also abolished thermal hyperalgesia and the enhanced allodynia induced by intrathecal des-Arg9-BK without affecting hyperglycemia in STZ rats. The enhanced mRNA expression (B1R, IL-1 alpha, TNF-beta a, TRPV1) and Iba-1 immunoreactivity in the STZ spinal cord were normalized by fluorocitrate or minocycline, yet B1R binding sites were reduced by 38%. Conclusion: The upregulation of kinin B1R in spinal dorsal horn microglia by pro-inflammatory cytokines is proposed as a crucial mechanism in early pain neuropathy in STZ-diabetic rats.

Numerous mRNA-binding and regulatory proteins within mRNPs finely regulate the fate of bound-mRNAs. Their specific combination defines different types of mRNPs that in turn are related to specific synaptic functions. One of these mRNA-binding proteins, Staufen2 (Stau2), was shown to transport dendritic mRNAs along microtubules. Its knockdown expression in neurons was shown to change spine morphology and synaptic functions. To further understand the molecular mechanisms by which Stau2 modulates synaptic function in neurons, it is important to identify and characterize protein cofactors that regulate the fate of Stau2-containing mRNPs. To this end, a proteomic approach was used to identify co-immunoprecipitated proteins in Staufen2-containing mRNPs isolated from embryonic rat brains. The proteomic approach identified mRNA-binding proteins (PABPC1, hnRNP H1, YB1 and hsc70), proteins of the cytoskeleton (alpha- and beta-tubulin) and RUFY3 a poorly characterized protein. While PABPC1 and YB1 associate with Stau2-containing mRNPs through RNAs, hsc70 is directly bound to Stau2 and this interaction is regulated by ATP. PABPC1 and YB1 proteins formed puncta in dendrites of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons. However, they poorly co-localized with Stau2 in the large dendritic complexes suggesting that they are rather components of Stau2-containing mRNA particles. All together, these results represent a further step in the characterization of Stau2-containing mRNPs in neurons and provide new tools to study and understand how Stau2-containing mRNPs are transported, translationally silenced during transport and/or locally expressed according to cell needs.

Differential activation associated with the side of the target curve was found in the form of a sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN). This contralateral brain activity suggests covert attention was deployed to the target curve during performance of the tracing task. The amplitude of the SPCN varied according to the hypothesized curve-tracing process, depending on whether the start and end locations of the target curve were above to below the horizontal midline, or the opposite, and this detailed analysis of the results provided evidence supporting the spread-of-attention model of curve tracing. These results represent the first neurophysiological investigation of brain activity reflecting visual curve tracing in humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we explore the idea that these dysautonomias results, in part, from a defect in synaptic transmission. To test this idea, we investigated cultured sympathetic neurons and show that hyperglycemia inactivates nAChRs through a mechanism involving an elevation in reactive oxygen species and an interaction with highly conserved cysteine residues located near the intracellular mouth of the nAChR channel. Consistent with this, we show that diabetic mice have depressed ganglionic transmission and reduced sympathetic reflexes, whereas diabetic mice expressing mutant postsynaptic nAChRs that lack the conserved cysteine residues on the alpha 3 subunit have normal synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia and normal sympathetic reflexes. Our work suggests a new model for diabetic-induced dysautonomias and identifies ganglionic nAChRs as targets of hyperglycemia-induced downstream signals.

Alternative splicing is frequent during early embryonic development in mouse	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							RNA-BINDING PROTEINS; GENE-EXPRESSION; ISOFORM VARIATION; PITX2 ISOFORMS; HNRNP PROTEINS; NUMB ISOFORMS; GENOME; HEART; BRAIN; FGF8	Background: Alternative splicing is known to increase the complexity of mammalian transcriptomes since nearly all mammalian genes express multiple pre-mRNA isoforms. However, our knowledge of the extent and function of alternative splicing in early embryonic development is based mainly on a few isolated examples. High throughput technologies now allow us to study genome-wide alternative splicing during mouse development. Results: A genome-wide analysis of alternative isoform expression in embryonic day 8.5, 9.5 and 11.5 mouse embryos and placenta was carried out using a splicing-sensitive exon microarray. We show that alternative splicing and isoform expression is frequent across developmental stages and tissues, and is comparable in frequency to the variation in whole-transcript expression. The genes that are alternatively spliced across our samples are disproportionately involved in important developmental processes. Finally, we find that a number of RNA binding proteins, including putative splicing factors, are differentially expressed and spliced across our samples suggesting that such proteins may be involved in regulating tissue and temporal variation in isoform expression. Using an example of a well characterized splicing factor, Fox2, we demonstrate that changes in Fox2 expression levels can be used to predict changes in inclusion levels of alternative exons that are flanked by Fox2 binding sites. Conclusions: We propose that alternative splicing is an important developmental regulatory mechanism. We further propose that gene expression should routinely be monitored at both the whole transcript and the isoform level in developmental studies	[Revil, Timothee; Gaffney, Daniel; Dias, Christel; Majewski, Jacek; Jerome-Majewska, Loydie A.] McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dias, Christel; Majewski, Jacek] Genome Quebec Innovat Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jerome-Majewska, Loydie A.] Montreal Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ H3H 1P3, Canada	Revil, T (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Human Genet, Montreal, PQ, Canada.	timothee.revil@mcgill.ca; dgaffney@uchicago.edu			FQRNT; CIHR; Genome Canada/Genome Quebec; FRSQ	We would like to thank Kevin Lam, Vonda Koka, Kevin Ha and Tony Kwan for their useful advice.

Synapse formation between sensory neurons and L7 begins by 3 h after plating and is accompanied by a rapid accumulation of a novel PKC to sites of synaptic interaction. Reducing ApCAM expression specifically from the surface of L7 blocks presynaptic growth and initial synapse formation, target-induced increase of sensorin in sensory neuron cell bodies and the rapid accumulation of the novel PKC to sites of interaction. Selective blockade of the novel PKC activity in L7, but not in sensory neurons, with injection of a dominant negative construct that interferes with the novel PKC activity, produces the same actions as downregulating ApCAM; blockade of presynaptic growth and initial synapse formation, and the target-induced increase of sensorin in sensory neuron cell bodies. The results indicate that signals initiated by postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule ApCAM coupled with the activation of a novel PKC in the appropriate postsynaptic neuron produce the retrograde signals required for presynaptic growth associated with initial synapse formation, and the target-induced expression of a presynaptic neuropeptide critical for synapse maturation.

It remains unclear though whether low 5-HT mediates the behavior or instead reflects a pre-existing vulnerability trait. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, positron emission tomography with the tracer alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (C-11-AMT) was used to compare 5-HT synthesis capacity in two groups of adult males from a 21-year longitudinal study (mean age +/- SD: 27.1+/-0.7): individuals with a history of childhood-limited high physical aggression (C-LHPA; N = 8) and individuals with normal (low) patterns of physical aggression (LPA; N = 18). The C-LHPA males had significantly lower trapping of C-11-AMT bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex and self-reported more impulsiveness. Despite this, in adulthood there were no group differences in plasma tryptophan levels, genotyping, aggression, emotional intelligence, working memory, computerized measures of impulsivity, psychosocial functioning/adjustment, and personal and family history of mood and substance abuse disorders. Conclusions/Significance: These results force a re-examination of the low 5-HT hypothesis as central in the biology of violence. They suggest that low 5-HT does not mediate current behavior and should be considered a vulnerability factor for impulsive-aggressive behavior that may or may not be expressed depending on other biological factors, experience, and environmental support during development.

The eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) repress translation by disrupting eIF4F formation, thereby preventing ribosome recruitment to the mRNA. Of the three 4E-BPs, 4E-BP2 is the predominant paralog expressed in the mammalian brain and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. 4E-BP2 undergoes asparagine deamidation, solely in the brain, during early postnatal development. Deamidation spontaneously converts asparagines into a mixture of aspartates or isoaspartates, the latter of which may be destabilizing to proteins. The enzyme protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) prevents isoaspartate accumulation by catalyzing the conversion of isoaspartates to aspartates. PIMTexhibits high activity in the brain, relative to other tissues. We report here that 4E-BP2 is a substrate for PIMT. In vitro deamidated 4E-BP2 accrues isoapartyl residues and is methylated by recombinant PIMT. Using an antibody that recognizes 4E-BP2, which harbors isoaspartates at the deamidation sites, Asn(99) and Asn(102), we demonstrate that 4E-BP2 in PIMT-/- brain lysates contains isoaspartate residues. Further, we show that 4E-BP2 containing isoaspartates lacks the augmented association with raptor that is a feature of deamidated 4E-BP2.

Vocal Accuracy and Neural Plasticity Following Micromelody-Discrimination Training	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OLD-WORLD MONKEY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FREQUENCY DISCRIMINATION; PITCH DISCRIMINATION; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION; PROBABILISTIC ATLAS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; MUSICAL RHYTHMS; PREMOTOR AREAS	Background: Recent behavioral studies report correlational evidence to suggest that non-musicians with good pitch discrimination sing more accurately than those with poorer auditory skills. However, other studies have reported a dissociation between perceptual and vocal production skills. In order to elucidate the relationship between auditory discrimination skills and vocal accuracy, we administered an auditory-discrimination training paradigm to a group of non-musicians to determine whether training-enhanced auditory discrimination would specifically result in improved vocal accuracy. Methodology/Principal Findings: We utilized micromelodies (i.e., melodies with seven different interval scales, each smaller than a semitone) as the main stimuli for auditory discrimination training and testing, and we used single-note and melodic singing tasks to assess vocal accuracy in two groups of non-musicians (experimental and control). To determine if any training-induced improvements in vocal accuracy would be accompanied by related modulations in cortical activity during singing, the experimental group of non-musicians also performed the singing tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Following training, the experimental group exhibited significant enhancements in micromelody discrimination compared to controls. However, we did not observe a correlated improvement in vocal accuracy during single-note or melodic singing, nor did we detect any training-induced changes in activity within brain regions associated with singing. Conclusions/Significance: Given the observations from our auditory training regimen, we therefore conclude that perceptual discrimination training alone is not sufficient to improve vocal accuracy in non-musicians, supporting the suggested dissociation between auditory perception and vocal production.

Oxytocin-Induced Analgesia and Scratching Are Mediated by the Vasopressin-1A Receptor in the Mouse	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; SPINAL-CORD; PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; INDUCED ANTINOCICEPTION; OPIOID RECEPTORS; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; BINDING-SITES; RAT-BRAIN; MICE	The neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) contribute to the regulation of diverse cognitive and physiological functions including nociception. Indeed, OXT has been reported to be analgesic when administered directly into the brain, the spinal cord, or systemically. Here, we characterized the phenotype of oxytocin receptor (OTR) and vasopressin-1A receptor (V1AR) null mutant mice in a battery of pain assays. Surprisingly, OTR knock-out mice displayed a pain phenotype identical to their wild-type littermates. Moreover, systemic administration of OXT dose-dependently produced analgesia in both wild-type and OTR knock-out mice in three different assays, the radiant-heat paw withdrawal test, the von Frey test of mechanical sensitivity, and the formalin test of inflammatory nociception. In contrast, OXT-induced analgesia was completely absent in V1AR knock-out mice. In wild-type mice, OXT-induced analgesia could be fully prevented by pretreatment with a V1AR but not an OTR antagonist. Receptor binding studies demonstrated that the distribution of OXT and AVP binding sites in mouse lumbar spinal cord resembles the pattern observed in rat. AVP binding sites diffusely label the lumbar spinal cord, whereas OXT binding sites cluster in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn. In contrast, quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed that V1AR but not OTR mRNA is abundantly expressed in mouse dorsal root ganglia, where it localizes to small-and medium-diameter cells as shown by single-cell RT-PCR. Hence, V1ARs expressed in dorsal root ganglia might represent a previously unrecognized target for the analgesic action of OXT and AVP.

Specific Increases within Global Decreases: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Investigation of Five Days of Motor Sequence Learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBCORTICAL NETWORKS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; MEMORY; BRAIN; CONSOLIDATION; CEREBELLUM; SLEEP; FMRI	Our capacity to learn movement sequences is fundamental to our ability to interact with the environment. Although different brain networks have been linked with different stages of learning, there is little evidence for how these networks change across learning. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the specific contributions of the cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M1) during early learning, consolidation, and retention of a motor sequence task. Performance was separated into two components: accuracy (the more explicit, rapidly learned, stimulus-response association component) and synchronization (the more procedural, slowly learned component). The network of brain regions active during early learning was dominated by the cerebellum, premotor cortex, basal ganglia, presupplementary motor area, and supplementary motor area as predicted by existing models. Across days of learning, as performance improved, global decreases were found in the majority of these regions. Importantly, within the context of these global decreases, we found specific regions of the left M1 and right cerebellar VIIIA/VIIB that were positively correlated with improvements in synchronization performance. Improvements in accuracy were correlated with increases in hippocampus, BA 9/10, and the putamen. Thus, the two behavioral measures, accuracy and synchrony, were found to be related to two different sets of brain regions-suggesting that these networks optimize different components of learning. In addition, M1 activity early on day 1 was shown to be predictive of the degree of consolidation on day 2. Finally, functional connectivity between M1 and cerebellum in late learning points to their interaction as a mechanism underlying the long-term representation and expression of a well learned skill.

NEURAL HETEROGENEITIES AND STIMULUS PROPERTIES AFFECT BURST CODING IN VIVO	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						weakly electric fish; neural coding; information theory; burst firing	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; LATERAL-LINE LOBE; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEM; SENSORY NEURONS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CONDITIONAL BACKPROPAGATION; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION	Many neurons tend to fire clusters of action potentials called bursts followed by quiescence in response to sensory input. While the mechanisms that underlie burst firing are generally well understood in vitro, the functional role of these bursts in generating behavioral responses to sensory input in vivo are less clear. Pyramidal cells within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of weakly electric fish offer an attractive model system for studying the coding properties of burst firing, because the anatomy and physiology of the electrosensory circuitry are well understood, and the burst mechanism of ELL pyramidal cells has been thoroughly characterized in vitro. We investigated the coding properties of bursts generated by these cells in vivo in response to mimics of behaviorally relevant sensory input. We found that heterogeneities within the pyramidal cell population had quantitative but not qualitative effects on burst coding for the low frequency components of broadband time varying input. Moreover, spatially localized stimuli mimicking, for example, prey tended to elicit more bursts than spatially global stimuli mimicking conspecific-related stimuli. We also found small but significant correlations between burst attributes such as the number of spikes per burst or the interspike interval during the burst and stimulus attributes such as stimulus amplitude or slope. These correlations were much weaker in magnitude than those observed in vitro. More surprisingly, our results show that correlations between burst and stimulus attributes actually decreased in magnitude when we used low frequency stimuli that are expected to promote burst firing. We propose that this discrepancy is attributable to differences between ELL pyramidal cell burst firing under in vivo and in vitro conditions. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TSPO expression is altered in pathological conditions such as certain cancers and neurological diseases. In search of the factors regulating Tspo expression, we recently showed that high levels of TSPO in steroidogenic cells may be due to high constitutive expression of protein kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon), while phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) activation of PKC epsilon drives inducible TSPO expression in nonsteroidogenic cells, likely through activator protein 1 (AP1). In this study, we aimed to identify the signal transduction pathway through which PKC epsilon regulates Tspo gene expression. The MEK1/2 specific inhibitor U0126, but not NF kappa B inhibitors, reduced basal Tspo promoter activity in TSPO-rich steroidogenic cells (MA-10 Leydig), as well as basal and PMA-induced Tspo promoter levels in TSPO-poor nonsteroidogenic cells (NIH-3T3 fibroblasts). AP1 and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) have binding sites in the Tspo promoter and are downstream targets of PKC epsilon and MAPK (Raf-1-ERK1/2) pathways. PKC epsilon overexpression induced STAT3 phosphorylation in NIH-3T3 cells, while PKC epsilon knockdown reduced STAT3 and c-Jun phosphorylation in Leydig cells. MEK1/2, ERK2, c-Jun, and STAT3 knockdown reduced Tspo mRNA and protein levels in Leydig cells. Additionally, Raf-1 reduced Tspo mRNA levels in the same cells. MEK1/2, c-Jun, and STAT3 knockdown also reduced basal as well as PMA-induced Tspo mRNA levels in NIH-3T3 cells. Together, these results demonstrate that PKC epsilon regulates Tspo gene expression through a MAPK (Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2) signal transduction pathway, acting at least in part through c-Jun and STAT3 transcription factors.

We asked if similar changes also occur in "functional'' pain syndromes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Acidic saline (AS, pH 4.0) injections into the masseter muscle were used to induce persistent myalgia. Controls received saline at pH 7.2. Nocifensive responses of Experimental rats to applications of Von Frey Filaments to the masseters were above control levels 1-38 days post-injection. This effect was bilateral. Expression of c-Fos in the Trigeminal Mesencephalic Nucleus (NVmes), which contains the somata of masseter muscle spindle afferents (MSA), was above baseline levels 1 and 4 days after AS. The resting membrane potentials of neurons exposed to AS (n = 167) were hyperpolarized when compared to their control counterparts (n = 141), as were their thresholds for firing, high frequency membrane oscillations (HFMO), bursting, inward and outward rectification. The amplitude of HFMO was increased and spontaneous ectopic firing occurred in 10% of acid-exposed neurons, but never in Controls. These changes appeared within the same time frame as the observed nocifensive behaviour. Ectopic action potentials can travel centrally, but also antidromically to the peripheral terminals of MSA where they could cause neurotransmitter release and activation of adjacent fibre terminals. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that annulospiral endings of masseter MSA express the glutamate vesicular transporter VGLUT1, indicating that they can release glutamate. Many capsules also contained fine fibers that were labelled by markers associated with nociceptors (calcitonin gene-related peptide, Substance P, P2X3 receptors and TRPV1 receptors) and that expressed the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5. Antagonists of glutamatergic receptors given together with the 2(nd) injection of AS prevented the hypersensitivity observed bilaterally but were ineffective if given contralaterally. Conclusions/Significance: Low pH leads to changes in several electrical properties of MSA, including initiation of ectopic action potentials which could propagate centrally but could also invade the peripheral endings causing glutamate release and activation of nearby nociceptors within the spindle capsule. This peripheral drive could contribute both to the transition to, and maintenance of, persistent muscle pain as seen in some "functional'' pain syndromes.

These neuronal systems modulate mPFC neuronal activity mainly through diffuse transmission. In order to better understand the anatomical level of influence of these systems, confocal microscopy with triple-fluorescent immunolabeling was used in three subregions of the mPFC of rats and Drd1a-tdTomato/Drd2-EGFP transgenic mice. The zone of interaction was defined as a reciprocal microproximity between dopaminergic and cholinergic axonal segments as well as pyramidal neurons. The density of varicosities, along these segments was considered as a possible activity-dependant morphological feature. The percentage of cholinergic and dopaminergic fibers in microproximity ranged from 12 to 40% depending on the layer and mPFC subregion. The cholinergic system appeared to have more influence on dopaminergic fibers since a larger proportion of the dopaminergic fibers were within microproximity to cholinergic fibers. The density of both cholinergic and dopaminergic varicosities was significantly elevated within microproximities. The main results indicate that the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems converge on pyramidal cells in mPFC particularly in the layer V. In transgenic mice 93% of the pyramidal cells expressed the transgenic marker for Drd2 expression, but only 22% expressed the maker for Drd1ar expression. Data presented here suggest that the modulation of mPFC by dopaminergic fibers would be mostly inhibitory and localized at the output level whereas the cholinergic modulation would be exerted at the input and output level both through direct interaction with pyramidal cells and dopaminergic fibers.

Because wikis depend on collaborators to keep content up-to-date, healthcare professionals who use wikis must adopt behaviors that foster this collaboration. This protocol describes the methods we will use to develop and test the metrological qualities of a questionnaire that will assess healthcare professionals' intentions and the determinants of those intentions to use wiki-based reminders that promote best practices in trauma care. Methods: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, we will conduct semi-structured interviews of healthcare professionals to identify salient beliefs that may affect their future use of wikis. These beliefs will inform our questionnaire on intended behavior. A test-retest of the survey will verify the questionnaire's stability over time. We will interview 50 healthcare professionals (25 physicians and 25 allied health professionals) working in the emergency departments of three trauma centers in Quebec, Canada. We will analyze the content of the interviews and construct and pilot a questionnaire. We will then test the revised questionnaire with 30 healthcare professionals (15 physicians and 15 allied health professionals) and retest it two weeks later. We will assess the internal consistency of the questionnaire constructs using Cronbach's alpha coefficients and determine their stability with the intra-class correlation (ICC). Discussion: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to develop and test a theory-based survey that measures healthcare professionals' intentions to use a wiki-based intervention. This study will identify professionals' salient beliefs qualitatively and will quantify the psychometric capacities of the questionnaire based on those beliefs.

Hypolocomotion, asymmetrically directed behaviors (licking, lifting, flinching, and shaking) and dynamic weight bearing (gait) changes are not measures of neuropathic pain in mice	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article							CHRONIC CONSTRICTION INJURY; SPARED NERVE INJURY; RAT SCIATIC-NERVE; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; COLD ALLODYNIA; ARTHRITIC RATS; CATWALK METHOD; SPINAL-CORD; PERIPHERAL MONONEUROPATHY; ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATION	Background: Spontaneous (non-evoked) pain is a major clinical symptom of neuropathic syndromes, one that is understudied in basic pain research for practical reasons and because of a lack of consensus over precisely which behaviors reflect spontaneous pain in laboratory animals. It is commonly asserted that rodents experiencing pain in a hind limb exhibit hypolocomotion and decreased rearing, engage in both reflexive and organized limb directed behaviors, and avoid supporting their body weight on the affected side. Furthermore, it is assumed that the extent of these positive or negative behaviors can be used as a dependent measure of spontaneous chronic pain severity in such animals. In the present study, we tested these assumptions via blinded, systematic observation of digital video of mice with nerve injuries (chronic constriction or spared nerve injury), and automated assessment of locomotor behavior using photocell detection and dynamic weight bearing (i.e., gait) using the CatWalk (R) system. Results: We found no deficits in locomotor activity or rearing associated with neuropathic injury. The frequency of asymmetric (ipsilaterally directed) behaviors were too rare to be seriously considered as representing spontaneous pain, and in any case did not statistically exceed what was blindly observed on the contralateral hind paw and in control (sham operated and unoperated) mice. Changes in dynamic weight bearing, on the other hand, were robust and ipsilateral after spared nerve injury (but not chronic constriction injury). However, we observed timing, pharmacological, and genetic dissociation of mechanical allodynia and gait alterations. Conclusions: We conclude that spontaneous neuropathic pain in mice cannot be assessed using any of these measures, and thus caution is warranted in making such assertions.

A phase I/II dose-escalation trial of vitamin D3 and calcium in multiple sclerosis	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							25-HYDROXYVITAMIN-D LEVELS; SERUM 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN-D; RISK; SUPPLEMENTATION; EXPOSURE; SAFETY; SUN	Objective: Low vitamin D status has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalence and risk, but the therapeutic potential of vitamin D in established MS has not been explored. Our aim was to assess the tolerability of high-dose oral vitamin D and its impact on biochemical, immunologic, and clinical outcomes in patients with MS prospectively. Methods: An open-label randomized prospective controlled 52-week trial matched patients with MS for demographic and disease characteristics, with randomization to treatment or control groups. Treatment patients received escalating vitamin D doses up to 40,000 IU/day over 28 weeks to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] rapidly and assess tolerability, followed by 10,000 IU/day (12 weeks), and further downtitrated to O IU/day. Calcium (1,200 mg/day) was given throughout the trial. Primary endpoints were mean change in serum calcium at each vitamin D dose and a comparison of serum calcium between groups. Secondary endpoints included 25(OH) D and other biochemical measures, immunologic biomarkers, relapse events, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Results: Forty-nine patients (25 treatment, 24 control) were enrolled [mean age 40.5 years, EDSS 1.34, and 25(OH) D 78 nmol/L]. All calcium-related measures within and between groups were normal. Despite a mean peak 25(OH) D of 413nmol/L, no significant adverse events occurred. Although there may have been confounding variables in clinical outcomes, treatment group patients appeared to have fewer relapse events and a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared to controls. Conclusions: High-dose vitamin D (similar to 10,000 IU/day) in multiple sclerosis is safe, with evidence of immunomodulatory effects. Classification of evidence: This trial provides Class II evidence that high-dose vitamin D use for 52 weeks in patients with multiple sclerosis does not significantly increase serum calcium levels when compared to patients not on high-dose supplementation. The trial, however, lacked statistical precision and the design requirements to adequately assess changes in clinical disease measures (relapses and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores), providing only Class level IV evidence for these outcomes.

An enzymatic model of the growth hormone-releasing hormone oscillator incorporating neuronal synchronization	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						GHRH; Primer; Pulse; Baselator; Hyperneuron	ULTRADIAN RHYTHM; DIFFUSION; SECRETION; PROTEIN; NETWORK; AXIS; RAT	Models of growth hormone (GH) rhythmogenesis which we and others have presented suggest that the GH pulses in the circulation are generated by a GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) oscillator with a 1 h periodicity. Here we examine the possibility that this is an intrinsic neuronal rhythm resulting from enzymatic reactions occurring in the axon terminals. A "Baselator" feedback reaction sequence can generate an hourly chemical burst of a primer (presumably a low molecular weight peptide) regulating Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis of CHAN-loaded vesicles. Accordingly we propose that the priming species is largely immobilized by binding within the terminals. Free unbound primer is able to diffuse and is alternately phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by a kinase and a phosphatase (or undergoes a similar pair of complementary reactions). Under appropriate conditions involving feedback control of one or other of the enzymes the levels of both unreacted and reacted free primer peak sharply at hourly intervals. It is self-evident that synchronization between the packed terminals of the GHRH neurons at the median eminence is necessary to generate highly ordered in vivo pulses of GH release. Gap junctions provide a means of interterminal communication for the primer. Simulations of clusters of 4 adjacent axon terminals in a linear array were performed to assess whether and when synchrony can occur. With gap junctions closed the axons were set to be 90 degrees out of phase, i.e. their chemical bursts were separated by 15 min. Opening the gap junctions, assuming either that only the unphosphorylated species permeates, or that both species permeate, resulted in rapid overall synchronization. The oscillatory systems undergo mutual entrainment and all peaks appeared simultaneously at an intermediate hourly interval. This result was independent of the mode of chemical feedback, whether positive or negative. Closing the gap junctions led to a gradual, but not immediate, loss of synchrony. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Daley, JM; Wilson, TE; Ramotar, D				Daley, James M.; Wilson, Thomas E.; Ramotar, Dindial			Genetic interactions between HNT3/Aprataxin and RAD27/FEN1 suggest parallel pathways for 5 ' end processing during base excision repair	DNA REPAIR			English	Article						Aprataxin; DNA repair; Oxidative DNA damage; Ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1; Base excision repair; DNA ligase	DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS; DISEASE PROTEIN APRATAXIN; DNA 3'-PHOSPHATASE TPP1; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; SCHIZOSACCHAROMYCES-POMBE; ABASIC SITES; YEAST; ENDONUCLEASE; DAMAGE; ATAXIA	Mutations in Aprataxin cause the neurodegenerative syndrome ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1. Aprataxin catalyzes removal of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from the 5' end of a DNA strand, which results from an aborted attempt to ligate a strand break containing a damaged end. To gain insight into which DNA lesions are substrates for Aprataxin action in vivo, we deleted the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HNT3 gene, which encodes the Aprataxin homolog, in combination with known DNA repair genes. While hnt3 Delta single mutants were not sensitive to DNA damaging agents, loss of HNT3 caused synergistic sensitivity to H(2)O(2) in backgrounds that accumulate strand breaks with blocked termini, including apn1 Delta apn2 Delta tpp1 Delta and ntg1 Delta ntg2 Delta ogg1 Delta. Loss of HNT3 in rad27 Delta cells, which are deficient in long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER), resulted in synergistic sensitivity to H(2)O(2) and MMS, indicating that Hnt3 and LP-BER provide parallel pathways for processing 5' AMPs. Loss of HNT3 also increased the sister chromatid exchange frequency. Surprisingly, HNT3 deletion partially rescued H(2)O(2) sensitivity in recombination-deficient rad51 Delta and rad52 Delta cells, suggesting that Hnt3 promotes formation of a repair intermediate that is resolved by recombination.

Prenatal Inflammation-Induced Hypoferremia Alters Dopamine Function in the Adult Offspring in Rat: Relevance for Schizophrenia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MATERNAL IMMUNE ACTIVATION; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL ANIMAL-MODEL; RECEPTOR-DEFICIENT MICE; IRON-DEFICIENCY; FETAL-BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHANGES; BACTERIAL-INFECTION; PREPULSE INHIBITION; POLYCYTHEMIA MICE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA	Maternal infection during pregnancy has been associated with increased incidence of schizophrenia in the adult offspring. Mechanistically, this has been partially attributed to neurodevelopmental disruption of the dopamine neurons, as a consequence of exacerbated maternal immunity. In the present study we sought to target hypoferremia, a cytokine-induced reduction of serum non-heme iron, which is common to all types of infections. Adequate iron supply to the fetus is fundamental for the development of the mesencephalic dopamine neurons and disruption of this following maternal infection can affect the offspring's dopamine function. Using a rat model of localized injury induced by turpentine, which triggers the innate immune response and inflammation, we investigated the effects of maternal iron supplementation on the offspring's dopamine function by assessing behavioral responses to acute and repeated administration of the dopamine indirect agonist, amphetamine. In addition we measured protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, and tissue levels of dopamine and its metabolites, in ventral tegmental area, susbtantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. Offspring of turpentine-treated mothers exhibited greater responses to a single amphetamine injection and enhanced behavioral sensitization following repeated exposure to this drug, when compared to control offspring. These behavioral changes were accompanied by increased baseline levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine and its metabolites, selectively in the nucleus accumbens. Both, the behavioral and neurochemical changes were prevented by maternal iron supplementation. Localized prenatal inflammation induced a deregulation in iron homeostasis, which resulted in fundamental alterations in dopamine function and behavioral alterations in the adult offspring. These changes are characteristic of schizophrenia symptoms in humans.

J	Lupinsky, D; Moquin, L; Gratton, A				Lupinsky, Derek; Moquin, Luc; Gratton, Alain			Interhemispheric Regulation of the Medial Prefrontal Cortical Glutamate Stress Response in Rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EXCITATORY AMINO-ACIDS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; RECEPTOR AGONISTS; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; IN-VIVO; EXTRACELLULAR GLUTAMATE; MESOCORTICAL DOPAMINE; INDUCED INCREASES	While stressors are known to increase medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) glutamate (GLU) levels, the mechanism(s) subserving this response remain to be elucidated. We used microdialysis and local drug applications to investigate, in male Long-Evans rats, whether the PFC GLU stress response might reflect increased interhemispheric communication by callosal projection neurons. We report here that tail-pinch stress (20 min) elicited comparable increases in GLU in the left and right PFC that were sodium and calcium dependent and insensitive to local glial cystine-GLU exchanger blockade. Unilateral ibotenate-induced PFC lesions abolished the GLU stress response in the opposite hemisphere, as did contralateral mGlu(2/3) receptor activation. Local dopamine (DA) D(1) receptor blockade in the left PFC potently enhanced the right PFC GLU stress response, whereas the same treatment applied to the right PFC had a much weaker effect on the left PFC GLU response. Finally, the PFC GLU stress response was attenuated and potentiated, respectively, following alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor blockade and GABA(B) receptor activation in the opposite hemisphere. These findings indicate that the PFC GLU stress response reflects, at least in part, activation of callosal neurons located in the opposite hemisphere and that stress-induced activation of these neurons is regulated by GLU-, DA-, norepinephrine-, and GABA-sensitive mechanisms. In the case of DA, this control is asymmetrical, with a marked regulatory bias of the left PFC DA input over the right PFC GLU stress response. Together, these findings suggest that callosal neurons and their afferentation play an important role in the hemispheric specialization of PFC-mediated responses to stressors.

Fingolimod (FTY720) Enhances Remyelination Following Demyelination of Organotypic Cerebellar Slices	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	61st Annual Meeting of American-Academy-of-Neurology	APR 28-29, 2009	Seattle, WA	Amer Acad Neurol			IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG FTY720; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; SPINAL-CORD; WHITE-MATTER; OLIGODENDROCYTE PROGENITORS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; MYELIN FORMATION; ADULT HUMAN; ASTROCYTES	Remyelination, which occurs subsequent to demyelination, contributes to functional recovery and is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that have differentiated into myelinating cells. Therapeutics that impact remyelination in the CNS could be critical determinants of long-term functional outcome in multiple sclerosis (MS). Fingolimod is a S1P receptor modulator in MS clinical trials due to systemic anti-inflammatory properties, yet may impact cells within the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier. Previous studies using isolated dissociated cultures indicate that neural cells express SIP receptors and respond to receptor engagement. Our objective was to assess the effects of fingolimod on myelin-related processes within a multicellular environment that maintains physiological cell-cell interactions, using organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. Fingolimod treatment had no impact on myelin under basal conditions. Fingolimod treatment subsequent to lysolecithin-induced demyelination enhanced remyelination and process extension by OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes, while increasing microglia numbers and immunoreactivity for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. The number of phagocytosing microglia was not increased by fingolimod. Using SIT receptor specific agonists and antagonists, we determined that fingolimod-induced effects on remyelination and astrogliosis were mediated primarily through S1P3 and S1P5, whereas enhanced microgliosis was mediated through S1P1 and S1P5. Taken together, these data demonstrate that fingolimod modulates multiple neuroglial cell responses, resulting in enhanced remyelination in organotypic slice cultures that maintain the complex cellular interactions of the mammalian brain.

First published March 31, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00807.2009.-Hypercapnia is regularly observed in chronic lung disease, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Hypercapnia results in increased nitric oxide synthase activity and in vitro formation of nitrates. Neural vasculature of the immature subject is particularly sensitive to nitrative stress. We investigated whether exposure to clinically relevant sustained high CO(2) causes microvascular degeneration in the newborn brain by inducing nitrative stress, and whether this microvascular degeneration has an impact on brain growth. Newborn rat pups were exposed to 10% CO(2) as inspired gas (Pa(CO2) = 60-70 mmHg) starting within 24 h of birth until postnatal day 7 (P7). Brains were notably collected at different time points to measure vascular density, determine brain cortical nitrite/nitrate, and trans-arachidonic acids (TAAs; products of nitration) levels as effectors of vessel damage. Chronic exposure of rat pups to high CO(2) (Pa(CO2) approximate to 65 mmHg) induced a 20% loss in cerebrovascular density at P3 and a 15% decrease in brain mass at P7; at P30, brain mass remained lower in CO(2)-exposed animals. Within 24 h of exposure to CO(2), brain eNOS expression and production of nitrite/nitrate doubled, lipid nitration products (TAAs) increased, and protein nitration (3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity) was also coincidently augmented on brain microvessels (lectin positive). Intracerebroventricular injection of TAAs (10 mu M) replicated cerebrovascular degeneration. Treatment of rat pups with NOS inhibitor (L-N(omega)-nitroarginine methyl ester) or a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst (FeTPPS) prevented hypercapnia-induced microvascular degeneration and preserved brain mass. Cytotoxic effects of high CO(2) were reproduced in vitro/ex vivo on cultured endothelial cells and sprouting microvessels. In summary, hypercapnia at values frequently observed in preterm infants with chronic lung disease results in increased nitrative stress, which leads to cerebral cortical microvascular degeneration and curtails brain growth.

We designed this study to assess the hyperglycemic response to liver resection, and to test the hypothesis that perioperative glucose and insulin administration while maintaining normoglycemia ( GIN therapy) provides glycemic control superior to that achieved by the conventional use of insulin. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to GIN therapy or standard therapy (control group). In the GIN therapy group, insulin was administered at 2 mU . kg(-1) . min(-1) during surgery. At the end of surgery, the insulin infusion was decreased to 1 mU . kg(-1) . min(-1) and continued for 24 hours. Dextrose 20% was infused at a rate adjusted to maintain blood glucose within the target range of 3.5 to 6.1 mmol . L(-1) (63-110 mg . dL(-1)). Patients in the standard therapy group received a conventional insulin sliding scale during and after surgery. The mean and SD of blood glucose as well as the percentage of blood glucose values within the target range were calculated. To evaluate intrasubject variability, the coefficient of variability (CV) of blood glucose was calculated for each patient. Episodes of severe hypoglycemia, i.e., blood glucose <2.2 mmol . L(-1) (40 mg . dL(-1)), were recorded. The primary outcome was the proportion of normoglycemic measurements. RESULTS: We studied 52 patients. The mean blood glucose value in patients receiving GIN therapy always remained within the target range. The blood glucose levels were lower in the GIN therapy group than in the standard therapy group (during surgery, P < 0.01; after surgery, P < 0.001). In nondiabetic patients receiving GIN therapy (n = 19), target glycemia was achieved in 90.1% of the blood glucose measurements during surgery and in 77.8% of the measurements after surgery. In diabetic patients receiving GIN therapy (n = 7), target glycemia was achieved in 81.2% of the blood glucose measurements during surgery and in 70.5% of the measurements after surgery. In nondiabetic patients receiving standard therapy (n = 19), target glycemia was achieved in 37.4% of the blood glucose measurements during surgery and in 18.3% of the measurements after surgery. In diabetic patients receiving standard therapy (n = 7), target glycemia was achieved in 4.3% of the blood glucose measurements during surgery and in 2.9% of the measurements after surgery. The SD and CV of blood glucose were smaller in the GIN therapy group than in the standard therapy group, especially in nondiabetic patients after surgery (SD, P < 0.001; CV, P = 0.027). No patients receiving GIN therapy experienced severe hypoglycemia during surgery. One patient receiving GIN therapy experienced hypoglycemia in the intensive care unit after surgery without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: GIN therapy effectively provides normoglycemia in patients undergoing liver resection (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00774098).

J	Valdes, A; Khorasani, K				Valdes, A.; Khorasani, K.			A pulsed plasma thruster fault detection and isolation strategy for formation flying of satellites	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fault detection and isolation; Dynamic neural networks; Formation flying of satellites; Pulsed plasma thrusters	ATTITUDE-CONTROL SUBSYSTEM	The main objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic neural network-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for pulsed plasma thrusters (PPTs) that are employed in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of satellites tasked to perform formation flying (FF) missions. A hierarchical methodology is proposed that consists of three fault detection and isolation ( FDI) approaches, namely (i) a "low-level'' FDI scheme, (ii) a "high-level'' FDI scheme, and (iii) an "integrated'' FDI scheme. Based on the data from the electrical circuit of the PPTs, the proposed "low-level'' FDI scheme can detect and isolate faults in the PPT actuators with a good level of accuracy, however the precision level is poor and below expectations with the misclassification rates as expressed by False Healthy and False Faulty parameters being too high. The proposed "high-level'' FDI scheme utilizes data from the relative attitudes of the FF mission. This scheme has good detection capabilities, however its isolation capabilities are not adequate. Finally, the proposed "integrated'' FDI scheme takes advantage of the strengths of each of the above two schemes while reducing their individual weaknesses. The results demonstrate a high level of accuracy (99.79%) and precision (99.94%) with a misclassification rates that are quite negligible (less than 1%). Furthermore, the proposed "integrated'' FDI scheme provides additional and interesting information related to the effects of faults in the thrust production levels that would not have been available from simply using the low or the high level schemes alone.

Method: The first study included 323 subjects with BD type I (BD I) or BD type II (BD II), diagnosed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Lifetime version (SADS-L) format, or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID). Migraine history was assessed by means of a structured questionnaire. In a second sample of 102 migraine patients, we investigated current and lifetime psychiatric morbidity using the SADS-L. Statistical analyses were conducted using nonparametric analysis and log-linear models. Results: A total of 24.5% of BD patients had comorbid migraine; those with BD II had a higher prevalence (34.8%) compared to BD I (19.1%) (p < 0.005). BD patients with comorbid migraine had significantly higher rates of suicidal behaviour, social phobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (all p < 0.05). In the sample of migraine patients, 34.3% had a current psychiatric diagnosis, and 73.5% had a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. The prevalence of BD I was 4.9%, and 7.8% for BD II. Discussion: Migraine is prevalent within the BD population, particularly among BD II subjects. It is associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and comorbid anxiety disorders. Conversely, migraine sufferers have high rates of current and lifetime psychopathology. A greater understanding of this comorbidity may contribute to our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of BD.

However, human neuroimaging measurements of serotonin transporter binding, a serotonin neuron marker, remain contradictory, especially regarding brain areas affected; and the possibility that structural brain differences might account for serotonin transporter binding changes has not been explored. We measured brain serotonin transporter binding using [C-11] N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine in 50 control subjects and in 49 chronic (mean 4 years) ecstasy users (typically one to two tablets bi-monthly) withdrawn from the drug (mean 45 days). A magnetic resonance image for positron emission tomography image co-registration and structural analyses was acquired. Hair toxicology confirmed group allocation but also indicated use of other psychoactive drugs in most users. Serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users was significantly decreased throughout all cerebral cortices (range -19 to -46%) and hippocampus (-21%) and related to the extent of drug use (years, maximum dose), but was normal in basal ganglia and midbrain. Substantial overlap was observed between control and user values except for insular cortex, in which 51% of ecstasy user values fell below the lower limit of the control range. Voxel-based analyses confirmed a caudorostral gradient of cortical serotonin transporter binding loss with occipital cortex most severely affected. Magnetic resonance image measurement revealed no overall regional volume differences between groups; however, a slight left-hemispheric biased cortical thinning was detected in methamphetamine-using ecstasy users. The serotonin transporter binding loss was not related to structural changes or partial volume effect, use of other stimulant drugs, blood testosterone or oestradiol levels, major serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms, gender, psychiatric status, or self-reported hyperthermia or tolerance. The ecstasy group, although 'grossly behaviourally normal', reported subnormal mood and demonstrated generally modest deficits on some tests of attention, executive function and memory, with the latter associated with serotonin transporter decrease. Our findings suggest that the 'typical'/low dose (one to two tablets/session) chronic ecstasy-polydrug user might display a highly selective mild to marked loss of serotonin transporter in cerebral cortex/hippocampus in the range of that observed in Parkinson's disease, which is not gender-specific or completely accounted for by structural brain changes, recent use of other drugs (as assessed by hair analyses) or other potential confounds that we could address. The striking sparing of serotonin transporter-rich striatum (although possibly affected in 'heavier' users) suggests that serotonergic neurons innervating cerebral cortex are more susceptible, for unknown reasons, to ecstasy than those innervating subcortical regions and that behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions.

We investigated the extent to which the cognition of environmental sounds, like that of language, relies on symbolic mental representations independent of the acoustic input. In a hierarchical sorting task, we found that evaluation of nonliving sounds is consistently biased toward a focus on acoustical information. However, the evaluation of living sounds focuses spontaneously on sound-independent semantic information, but can rely on acoustical information after exposure to a context consisting of nonliving sounds. We interpret these results as support for a robust iconic processing strategy for nonliving sounds and a flexible symbolic processing strategy for living sounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, there is little understanding of why the insula should play such an important role in an addictive behavior. A broad literature (much of it reviewed in this issue) has addressed the role of the insula in processes related to conscious interoception, emotional experience, and decision-making. Here, we review evidence for the role of the insula in drug addiction, and propose a novel theoretical framework for addiction in which the insula represents the interoceptive effects of drug taking, making this information available to conscious awareness, memory and executive functions. A central theme of this framework is that a primary goal for the addicted individual is to obtain the effects of the drug use ritual upon the body, and representations of this goal in interoceptive terms by the insula contribute to how addicted individuals feel, remember, and decide about taking drugs. This makes drug addiction like naturally motivated behaviors, such as eating and sex, for which an embodied ritual is the primary goal.

Kinetic analysis of novel mono- and multivalent VHH-fragments and their application for molecular imaging of brain tumours	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						molecular imaging; multivalency; epidermal growth factor receptor; single domain antibody; brain cancer; surface plasmon resonance	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; SINGLE-DOMAIN ANTIBODY; SOLID TUMORS; CHAIN FV; GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; THERAPY; AFFINITY; BINDING; EXPRESSION; CETUXIMAB	Background and purpose: The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its mutated variant EGFRvIII occurs in 50% of glioblastoma multiforme. We developed antibody fragments against EGFR/EGFRvIII for molecular imaging and/or therapeutic targeting applications. Experimental approach: An anti-EGFR/EGFRvIII llama single-domain antibody (EG(2)) and two higher valency format constructs, bivalent EG(2)-hFc and pentavalent V2C-EG(2) sdAbs, were analysed in vitro for their binding affinities using surface plasmon resonance and cell binding studies, and in vivo using pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, optical imaging and fluorescent microscopy studies. Key results: Kinetic binding analyses by surface plasmon resonance revealed intrinsic affinities of 55 nM and 97 nM for the monovalent EG(2) to immobilized extracellular domains of EGFR and EGFRvIII, respectively, and a 10- to 600-fold increases in apparent affinities for the multivalent binders, V2C-EG(2) and EG(2)-hFc, respectively. In vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in mice revealed plasma half-lives for EG(2), V2C-EG(2) and EG(2)-hFc of 41 min, 80 min and 12.5 h, respectively, as well as a significantly higher retention of EG(2)-hFc compared to the other two constructs in EGFR/EGFRvIII-expressing orthotopic brain tumours, resulting in the highest signal in the tumour region in optical imaging studies. Time domain volumetric optical imaging fusion with high-resolution micro-computed tomography of microvascular brain network confirmed EG(2)-hFc selective accumulation/retention in anatomically defined tumour regions. Conclusions: Single domain antibodies can be optimized for molecular imaging applications by methods that improve their apparent affinity and prolong plasma half-life and, at the same time, preserve their ability to penetrate tumour parenchyma.

Design: Systematic review of the literature and a health regulatory database. Participants: A total of 22 different clinical studies representing 12 699 patients Methods: A systematic review indexed by Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane database (CENTRAL), and the Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Information System Database was performed. All clinical studies with at least 100 eyes injected with bevacizumab and case reports documenting suspected events were included for review. Results: A total of 22 different clinical studies were reviewed, including an international internet survey, 6 retrospective studies assessing the safety of intravitreal bevacizumab, and 15 clinical trials. The most common adverse systemic event reported in these studies, representing 12 699 patients was an increase in blood pressure (0.46% of patients), followed by cerebrovascular accidents (0.21% of patients), and myocardial infarction (0.19% of patients). The 6 case reports documented suspected events not previously identified and only 1 systemic event from the Health Canada database was retrieved. Conclusions: The systemic events temporally associated with intravitreal bevacizumab are mainly of cardiovascular and neurological origin and can be predicted from an exaggerated pharmacology, although a causal association cannot be established at this time. Health Canada's spontaneous drug reporting system is an underutilized resource and a more active surveillance system such as a patient registry may be better suited to establish the low rates of systemic adverse events following bevacizumab use in ophthalmology.

In aged transgenic mice that overexpress TGF-beta(1) (TGF mice), we previously found reduced dilatory function and selectively impaired endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced contraction. Here we studied the effects of chronic treatments with selective ET(A) (ABT-627) or ET(B) (A-192621) receptor antagonist on cerebrovascular reactivity, cerebral perfusion, or memory performance. The dilatory deficit of TGF mice was not improved by either treatment, but both ET-1 contraction and basal nitric oxide (NO) production were distinctly altered. Although ABT-627 was devoid of any effect in TGF mice, it virtually abolished the ET-1-induced contraction and NO release in wild-type (WT) littermates. In contrast, A-192621 only acted upon TGF mice with full recovery of ET-1 contraction and baseline NO synthesis. TGF mice, treated or not, had no cognitive deficit in the Morris water maze, nor did ABT-627-treated WT controls despite severely impaired vasoreactivity. These findings confirm that ET(A) receptors primarily mediate the ET-1-induced contraction. Further, they suggest that ET(B) receptors play a detrimental role in conditions of increased TGF-beta(1) and that vascular dysfunction does not inevitably lead to cognitive deficit.

This review will highlight the unique nature of cerebellar development in terms of its derivation from two germinal matrices and significant postnatal expansion of the granule cell precursor (GCP) compartment resulting in granule cell development and migration to form the mature cerebellar cortex. The molecular signals that are critical for timely cell cycle exit and differentiation may become dysregulated leading to unrestrained cell proliferation and enhanced cell survival; indeed, changes in these molecular markers have been observed in medulloblastoma biopsy specimens. Furthermore, transgenic models that faithfully replicate these changes develop medulloblastoma that, by in large, recapitulates the clinico-histopathological features of these tumours. Cellular and developmental biological approaches have contributed greatly to the current debate on the relevance of the cancer stem cell hypothesis in understanding medulloblastoma initiation and propagation. Penultimately, research findings are being translated into experimental therapeutics that target the aberrant signal transduction machinery in medulloblastoma cells and that will hopefully lead to an improved risk-benefit profile.

Computation of Egomotion in the Macaque Cerebellar Vermis	CEREBELLUM			English	Article						Cerebellum; Vestibular; Purkinje cell; Vermis; Nodulus	INNERVATING OTOLITH ORGANS; SECONDARY VESTIBULOCEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS; QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS; MOSSY FIBER PROJECTIONS; PURKINJE-CELLS; LINEAR ACCELERATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; VESTIBULAR SIGNALS; HEADING PERCEPTION	The nodulus and uvula (lobules X and IX of the vermis) receive mossy fibers from both vestibular afferents and vestibular nuclei neurons and are thought to play a role in spatial orientation. Their properties relate to a sensory ambiguity of the vestibular periphery: otolith afferents respond identically to translational (inertial) accelerations and changes in orientation relative to gravity. Based on theoretical and behavioral evidence, this sensory ambiguity is resolved using rotational cues from the semicircular canals. Recordings from the cerebellar cortex have identified a neural correlate of the brain's ability to resolve this ambiguity in the simple spike activities of nodulus/uvula Purkinje cells. This computation, which likely involves the cerebellar circuitry and its reciprocal connections with the vestibular nuclei, results from a remarkable convergence of spatially- and temporally-aligned otolith-driven and semicircular canal-driven signals. Such convergence requires a spatio-temporal transformation of head-centered canal-driven signals into an estimate of head reorientation relative to gravity. This signal must then be subtracted from the otolith-driven estimate of net acceleration to compute inertial motion. At present, Purkinje cells in the nodulus/uvula appear to encode the output of this computation. However, how the required spatio-temporal matching takes place within the cerebellar circuitry and what role complex spikes play in spatial orientation and disorientation remains unknown. In addition, the role of visual cues in driving and/or modifying simple and complex spike activity, a process potentially critical for long-term adaptation, constitutes another important direction for future studies.

Cortical Anatomy in Autism Spectrum Disorder: An In Vivo MRI Study on the Effect of Age	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						age; autism; brain; cortical thickness; MRI	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN SIZE; HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE; ASPERGERS-SYNDROME; LONGITUDINAL MRI; NEURAL CIRCUITRY; GRAY-MATTER; CHILDREN; THICKNESS; GROWTH	There is increasing evidence that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have age-related differences from controls in cortical volume (CV). It is less clear, however, if these persist in adulthood and whether these reflect alterations in cortical thickness (CT) or cortical surface area (SA). Hence, we used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the relationship between age and CV, CT, and SA in 127 males aged 10 through 60 years (76 with ASD and 51 healthy controls). "Regional" analyses (using cortical parcellation) identified significant age-by-group interactions in both CV and CT (but not SA) in the temporal lobes and within these the fusiform and middle temporal gyri. Spatially nonbiased "vertex-based" analysis replicated these results and identified additional "age-by-group" interactions for CT within superior temporal, inferior and medial frontal, and inferior parietal cortices. Here, CV and CT were 1) significantly negatively correlated with age in controls, but not in ASD, and 2) smaller in ASD than controls in childhood but vice versa in adulthood. Our findings suggest that CV dysmaturation in ASD extends beyond childhood, affects brain regions crucial to social cognition and language, and is driven by CT dysmaturation. This may reflect primary abnormalities in cortical plasticity and/or be secondary to disturbed interactions between individuals with ASD and their environment.

A Role for the Intraparietal Sulcus in Transforming Musical Pitch Information	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory; fMRI; music; parietal lobes; relative pitch	VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; MEMORY RETRIEVAL; NEURAL SUBSTRATE; MENTAL ROTATION; DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN; FMRI	The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates the neural substrates of relative pitch. Musicians and nonmusicians performed 2 same/different discrimination tasks (simple and transposed melody) that differed in whether they required precise encoding and comparison of relative pitch structure, along with 2 control tasks (rhythm and phoneme). The transposed melody task involved a musical transposition of 4 semitones between the target and comparison patterns, requiring listeners to use interval information rather than the absolute value of the individual pitches. Contrasting the transposed melody to the simple melody condition revealed greater activation in the cortex within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) bilaterally; control tasks did not elicit significant activity in the IPS. Moreover, a whole-brain voxel-wise regression analysis of brain oxygenation level-dependent signal showed that activity within the right IPS predicted task performance for both musicians and nonmusicians specifically in the transposed melody condition. Successful performance of the transposed melody task requires encoding and comparison of auditory patterns having different tonal reference points-thus simple tonal memory is not sufficient. Our results point to a role for the IPS in transforming high-level auditory information. We suggest that this area may support a general capacity for transformation and comparison of systematically related stimulus attributes.	[Foster, Nicholas E.

Patients & Methods: Using a magnetic tracking system, whole-body 3D movements were assessed in 10 dyskinetic patients with clear monophasic peak-dose levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), in 10 non-dyskinetic patients and in 10 control subjects, standing with their arms out. Patients were tested during their best ON period. Coherency in the kinematics of pairs of body segments was assessed by spectral analysis. For each pair examined, we calculated the highest coherency between 0.5 and 3.0 Hz and the frequency at which this maximum coherency occurred. Results: Analysis of variance showed that for 34 out of the 44(77.3%) comparisons we studied, there were significant differences between the means of coherencies of the groups. Typically, the control group had the highest coherency and the patients with LID had the lowest. Patients with LID also tended to have their maximum coherency at higher frequencies than the control and non-dyskinetic patient groups (30 out of 44 comparisons were significant). These trends appeared in all types of inter-segment comparisons, including bilaterally symmetric segments, biomechanically linked segments (in which coherencies were higher overall in all groups, but still different between groups) and in other comparisons, but the trends were not so clear for comparisons involving the feet. Conclusion: LID is indeed incoherent in the frequency domain, suggesting that body segments may be driven by different neural outputs. The challenges of dealing with these incoherent involuntary movements when planning and executing voluntary movements must certainly play a role in motor difficulties observed in patients with LID. The fact that both dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic patients showed less coherency than controls suggests that levodopa may alter postural control by decreasing stiffness and increasing limb independence.

COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AFFECT DECISION TASK; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; TIME-COURSE; ERP EVIDENCE; AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION; NONVERBAL EMOTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION	The influence of emotional prosody on the evaluation of emotional facial expressions was investigated in an event-related brain potential (ERP) study using a priming paradigm, the facial affective decision task. Emotional prosodic fragments of short (200-msec) and medium (400-msec) duration were presented as primes, followed by an emotionally related or unrelated facial expression (or facial grimace, which does not resemble an emotion). Participants judged whether or not the facial expression represented an emotion. ERP results revealed an N400-like differentiation for emotionally related prime target pairs when compared with unrelated prime target pairs. Faces preceded by prosodic primes of medium length led to a normal priming effect (larger negativity for unrelated than for related prime target pairs), but the reverse ERP pattern (larger negativity for related than for unrelated prime target pairs) was observed for faces preceded by short prosodic primes. These results demonstrate that brief exposure to prosodic cues can establish a meaningful emotional context that influences related facial processing; however, this context does not always lead to a processing advantage when prosodic information is very short in duration.

In this study we consider the application of machine learning methods for predicting experimental HTS measurements. Such a virtual HTS analysis can be based on the results of real HTS campaigns carried out with similar compounds libraries and similar drug targets. In this way, we analyzed Test assay from McMaster University Data Mining and Docking Competition [1] using binary decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors and partial least squares. First, we studied separately the sets of molecular and atomic descriptors in order to establish which of them provides a better prediction. Then, the comparison of the six considered machine learning methods was made in terms of false positives and false negatives, method's sensitivity and enrichment factor. Finally, a variable selection procedure allowing one to improve the method's sensitivity was implemented and applied in the framework of polynomial SVM.

The study was conducted at a limestone mine located in India. The samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling method, and images of these samples were taken in a simulated environment in a laboratory. The image preprocessing and segmentation were performed using different segmentation methods to extract morphological, colour and textural features. A total of 189 features was extracted during this study. Principal components analysis was conducted to reduce the feature vector for modeling purposes. Five principal components, which were extracted from the feature vectors, captured 95% of the total feature variance. A neural network model was used as a mapping function for ore grade prediction. The five principal components were used as input, and four grade attributes of limestone (CaO, Al(2)O(3), Fe(2)O(3) and SiO(2)) were used as output. The developed model was then used for day to day quality monitoring at 3 different face locations of the mine. Results revealed that this technique can be successfully used for ore grade monitoring at the mine level in a controlled environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Somatosensory-motor bodily representation cortical thinning in Tourette: Effects of tic severity, age and gender	CORTEX			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; Cortical thickness; Neuroimaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Gender; Age	NORMAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BASAL GANGLIA; THICKNESS ANALYSIS; MRI DATA; NIH MRI; VOLUMES; ORGANIZATION; REGISTRATION; CHILDREN	Introduction: Tourette syndrome (TS) implicates the disinhibition of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuitry (CSTC). Previous studies used a volumetric approach to investigate this circuitry with inconsistent findings. Cortical thickness may represent a more reliable measure than volume due to the low variability in the cytoarchitectural structure of the grey matter. Methods: 66 magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 34 TS subjects (age range 10-25, mean 17.19 +/- 4.1) and 32 normal controls (NC) (age range 10-20, mean 16.33 +/- 3.56). Brain morphology was assessed using the fully automated CIVET pipeline at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Results: We report (1) significant cortical thinning in the fronto-parietal and somatosensory-motor cortices in TS relative to NC (p < .05); (2) TS boys showed thinner cortex relative to TS girls in the fronto-parietal cortical regions (p < .05); (3) significant decrease in the frontoparietal mean cortical thickness in TS subjects with age relative to NC and in the pre-central cortex in TS boys relative to TS girls; (4) significant negative correlations between tic severity and the somatosensory-motor cortical thickness. Conclusions: TS revealed important thinning in brain regions particularly involved in the somatosensory/motor bodily representations which may play an important role in tics. Our findings are in agreement with Leckman et al. (1991) hypothesis stating that facial tics would be associated with dysfunction in an orofacial subset of the motor circuit, eye blinking with the occulo-motor circuit, whereas lack of inhibition to a dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex. Gender and age differences may reflect differential etiological factors, which have significant clinical relevance in TS and should be considered in developing and using diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

We describe how the highland Quechua of northern Ayacucho construct and experience expressions of distress and suffering such as pinsamientuwan (worrying thoughts, worries), akary (suffering) and llaki (sorrow, sadness), in a context of persistent social inequalities, social exclusion and a recent history of political violence. It is concluded that the multiple expressions of distress and suffering are closely related to past and current events, shaped by beliefs, core values and cultural norms and, in this process, transformed, recreated and invested with new meanings and attributions.

One is to combine information from multiple complementary cues to improve stimulus detection and discrimination. Another is to resolve peripheral sensory ambiguities and create novel internal representations that do not exist at the level of individual sensors. Here we focus on how ambiguities inherent in vestibular, proprioceptive and visual signals are resolved to create behaviorally useful internal estimates of our self-motion. We review recent studies that have shed new light on the nature of these estimates and how multiple, but individually ambiguous, sensory signals are processed and combined to compute them. We emphasize the need to combine experiments with theoretical insights to understand the transformations that are being performed.

Experimental glaucoma was induced in 4 rhesus and 4 cynomolgus monkeys by laser trabecular meshwork destruction (LTD) in one eye. To evaluate the contribution of ganglion cells to mfERG changes, one monkey of each species had previously underwent unilateral optic nerve transection (ONT). After a parts per thousand yen44 weeks of elevation, the IOP was reduced by trabeculectomy in 2 non-transected animals. In the intact (non-transected) animals, there was an increase in the amplitude of the early mfERG waveforms (N1 and P1) of the first-order kernel (K1) throughout the period of IOP elevation in all of the rhesus, but not all of the cynomolgus monkeys. A species difference was also present as a decrease of the second-order kernel, first slice (K2.1) in all of the cynomolgus monkeys but only in 1 of the rhesus monkeys (the 1 with the ONT). Similar IOP effects on the mfERG were seen in the ONT animals. Surgical lowering of IOP resulted in a return of the elevated K1 amplitudes to baseline levels. However, the depressed K2.1 RMS in the cynomolgus monkeys did not recover. These results demonstrate species-specific changes in cone-driven retinal function during periods of elevated IOP. These IOP-related effects can occur in the absence of retinal ganglion cells and may be reversible.	[Nork, T. Michael; Kim, Charlene B.

New noninvasive diagnostic techniques are being developed to reduce the risks associated with more invasive techniques. The aim of this paper is to review the different protocols for lateralizing and/or localizing language functions using magnetoencephalography (MEG), a noninvasive technique. The reviewed studies include control and patient populations using various protocols which employ different expressive and receptive language tasks. The overall findings reveal high concordance between MEG and the intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT). Moreover, MEG allows intrahemispheric localization of receptive and expressive language functions. However, the different language tasks used with MEG, whether receptive or expressive, appear to activate the left temporal more than frontal areas. The best task to assess language comprehension in both adults and children appears to be a word recognition task. A verbal fluency task could be used to test language production in children and a verb generation task in adults.

However, few studies have addressed the changes occurring in the IC in TLE animal models. Here, we analyzed the immunohistochemical and electrophysiological properties of IC networks in non-epileptic control and pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats. Neurons identified with a neuron-specific nuclear protein antibody showed similar counts in the two types of tissue but parvalbumin- and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons were significantly decreased (parvalbumin, approximately -35%; neuropeptide Y, approximately -38%; P < 0.01) in the epileptic IC. Non-adapting neurons were seen more frequently in the epileptic IC during intracellular injection of depolarizing current pulses. In addition, single-shock electrical stimuli elicited network-driven epileptiform responses in 87% of epileptic and 22% of non-epileptic control neurons (P < 0.01) but spontaneous postsynaptic potentials had similar amplitude, duration and intervals of occurrence in the two groups. Finally, pharmacologically isolated, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials had more negative reversal potential (P < 0.01) and higher peak conductance (P < 0.05) in epileptic tissue. These data reveal moderate increased network excitability in the IC of pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats. We propose that this limited degree of hyperexcitability originates from the loss of parvalbumin- and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons that is compensated by an increased drive for GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition.

The use of microarrays to simultaneously examine the expression levels of thousands of gene transcripts has vastly expanded our capacity to detect the involvement of additional genes and pathways in suicidality, and has opened many new avenues for the discovery of the biological underpinnings of suicide completion. This review examines microarray studies which have been used to identify genes displaying altered expression in suicide completers, and highlights some of the important methodological considerations and metabolic pathways which have emerged from these analyses.

When sensory cells are lost, nerves often regress from the sensory area. Therapeutic and regenerative approaches would benefit from the presence of nerve fibers in the tissue. In the hearing system, retraction of afferent innervation may accompany the degeneration of auditory hair cells that is associated with permanent hearing loss. The only therapy currently available for cases with severe or complete loss of hair cells is the cochlear implant auditory prosthesis. To enhance the therapeutic benefits of a cochlear implant, it is necessary to attract nerve fibers back into the cochlear epithelium. Here we show that forced expression of the neurotrophin gene BDNF in epithelial or mesothelial cells that remain in the deaf ear induces robust regrowth of nerve fibers towards the cells that secrete the neurotrophin, and results in re-innervation of the sensory area. The process of neurotrophin-induced neuronal regeneration is accompanied by significant preservation of the spiral ganglion cells. The ability to regrow nerve fibers into the basilar membrane area and protect the auditory nerve will enhance performance of cochlear implants and augment future cell replacement therapies such as stem cell implantation or induced transdifferentiation. This model also provides a general experimental stage for drawing nerve fibers into a tissue devoid of neurons, and studying the interaction between the nerve fibers and the tissue.

J	Zheng, HE; Lapointe, J; Hekimi, S				Zheng, Huaien; Lapointe, Jerome; Hekimi, Siegfried			Lifelong protection from global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in long-lived Mclk1(+/-) mutants	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Mclk1; Coq7; clk-1; Ubiquinone; Ischemia; Reperfusion; Aging; Age-related diseases; BCCAO; Oxidative stress	HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR; MITOCHONDRIAL OXIDATIVE STRESS; HIPPOCAMPUS FOLLOWING ISCHEMIA; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; NEURONAL DAMAGE; BRAIN-DAMAGE; MICE; OXYGEN; DYSFUNCTION; NEUROPROTECTION	To achieve a long life span, animals must be resistant to various injuries as well as avoid or delay lethality from age-dependent diseases. Reduced expression of the mitochondrial enzyme CLK-1/MCLK1 (a.k.a. Coq7), a mitochondrial hydroxylase that is necessary for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (UQ), extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mice. Here, we show that long-lived Mclk1(+/-) mutants have enhanced resistance to neurological damage following global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Both young (similar to 100 days old) and relatively aged (similar to 450 days old) mutants display increased resistance as indicated by a significant decrease in the amount of degenerating cells observed in forebrain cortex and in hippocampal areas after ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, less oxidative damage resulting from the procedure was measured in the brain of young Mclk1(+/-) animals. The finding that both young and old mutants are protected indicates that this is a basic phenotype of these mutants and not a secondary consequence of their slow rate of aging. Thus, the partial resistance to I/R injury suggests that Mclk1(+/-) mutants have an enhanced recovery potential following age-dependant vascular accidents, which correlates well with their longer survival. By relating this neuroprotective effect to previously reported characteristics of the Mclk1(+/-) phenotype, including altered mitochondrial metabolism and increased HIF-1 alpha expression, this study establishes these mutants as useful models to analyze the mechanisms underlying tolerance to ischemia, particularly those associated with ischemic preconditioning, as well as to clarify the relation between aging and age-dependent diseases.

Microarray analysis showed differential expression of multiple miRNAs in HIVE compared to control brains. Target prediction and gene ontology enrichment analysis disclosed targeting of several gene families/biological processes by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), with cell death-related genes, including caspase-6, showing a bias toward down-regulated DEMs. Consistent with the miRNA data, HIVE brains exhibited higher levels of caspase-6 transcripts compared with control patients. Immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of the cleaved form of caspase-6 in astrocytes in HIVE brain sections. Exposure of cultured human primary astrocytes to HIV viral protein R (Vpr) induced p53 up-regulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-6 activation followed by cell injury. Transgenic mice, expressing Vpr in microglial cells, demonstrated astrocyte apoptosis in brain, which was associated with caspase-6 activation and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Overall, these data point to previously unrecognized alterations in miRNA profile in the brain during HIV infection, which contribute to cell death through dysregulation of cell death machinery.-Noorbakhsh, F., Ramachandran, R., Barsby, N., Ellestad, K.

The sequence of Spi-OAR shares many similarities with two Aplysia and three Drosophila octopamine receptors belonging to a sub-group of beta-adrenergic-like octopamine receptors. Using an expression vector and transient transfections of Spi-OAR into HEK 293 cells, we observed an increase of cAMP upon addition of octopamine and, to a lesser extent, of tyramine, but not after addition of dopamine, serotonin, or histamine. Using a battery of known agonists and antagonists for octopamine receptors, we observed a rather unique pharmacological profile for Spi-OAR through measurements of cAMP. Spi-OAR exhibited some constitutive activity in HEK 293 cells and no Ca(2+) responses could be detected following addition of octopamine to Spi-OAR-transfected cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Spi-OAR mRNA in all adult tissues, oocytes and early embryos examined. While addition of serotonin to isolated clam oocytes resulted in meiotic activation, similar additions of octopamine had no effect, suggesting that its potential role in clam reproductive physiology differs significantly from that of serotonin. This work identifies Spi-OAR as a novel mollusc octopamine receptor closely related to other invertebrate beta-adrenergic-like octopamine receptors, with possible reproductive and other physiological functions. This initial characterization of Spi-OAR makes possible further investigations and comparisons with more studied and familiar insect or gastropod mollusc octopamine receptors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of a novel cerebral malaria susceptibility locus (Berr5) on mouse chromosome 19	GENES AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						genetics; malaria; QTL; inflammation; Plasmodium berghei; Ifit	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; MURINE MALARIA; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; LYMPHOTOXIN-ALPHA; INFECTION; MICE; EXPRESSION; INTERFERON; RESISTANCE; BRAIN	Cerebral malaria (CM) is an acute, generally lethal condition characterized by high fever, seizures and coma. The genetic component to CM can be investigated in mouse models that vary in degree of susceptibility to infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Using survival time to measure susceptibility in an informative F2 cross (n=257), we identified linkage to chromosome 19 (Berr5 (Berghei resistance locus 5), LOD=4.69) controlling, in part, the differential response between resistant BALB/c and susceptible C57BL/6 progenitors. BALB/c alleles convey increased survival through the cerebral phase of infection but have no quantitative effect on parasitemia during the later, anemic phase. The Berr5 locus colocalizes with three other immune loci, including Trl-4 (tuberculosis resistance), Tsiq2 (T-cell secretion of IL-4) and Eae19 (experimental allergic encephalitis 19), suggesting the possibility of a common genetic effect underlying these phenotypes. Potential positional candidates include the family of Ifit1-3 (interferon-inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1-3) and Fas.

Here, I focus on the application of population neuroscience in studies of brain development. By describing in some detail four existing large-scale magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of typically developing children and adolescents, I provide an overview of their design, including population sampling and recruitment, assessments of environmental and genetic "exposures," and measurements of brain and behavior "outcomes." I then discuss challenges faced by investigators carrying out such MR-based studies, including quality assurance, quality control and intersite coordination, and provide a brief overview of the achievements made so far. I conclude by outlining future directions vis-a-vis population neuroscience, such as design strategies that can be used to evaluate the presence of absence of causality in associations discovered by observational studies.

We use these filters as low-distortion delay elements along with an automatic biopotential detector to perform integral waveform extraction and efficient power management. The presented delay elements are realized employing continuous-time OTA-C filters featuring 9th-order equiripple transfer functions with constant group delay. Such analog delay enables processing neural waveforms with reduced overhead compared to a digital delay since it does not requires sampling and digitization. It uses an allpass transfer function for achieving wider constant-delay bandwidth than all-pole does. Two filters realizations are compared for implementing the delay element: the Cascaded structure and the Inverse follow-the-leader feedback filter. Their respective strengths and drawbacks are assessed by modeling parasitics and non-idealities of OTAs, and by transistor-level simulations. A budget of 200 nA is used in both filters. Experimental measurements with the chosen filter topology are presented and discussed.

Results A reduced odds ratio (OR) related to ever having been a regular mobile phone user was seen for glioma [OR 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.94] and meningioma (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68-0.91), possibly reflecting participation bias or other methodological limitations. No elevated OR was observed >= 10 years after first phone use (glioma: OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.76-1.26; meningioma: OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.61-1.14). ORs were < 1.0 for all deciles of lifetime number of phone calls and nine deciles of cumulative call time. In the 10th decile of recalled cumulative call time, >= 1640 h, the OR was 1.40 (95% CI 1.03-1.89) for glioma, and 1.15 (95% CI 0.81-1.62) for meningioma; but there are implausible values of reported use in this group. ORs for glioma tended to be greater in the temporal lobe than in other lobes of the brain, but the CIs around the lobe-specific estimates were wide. ORs for glioma tended to be greater in subjects who reported usual phone use on the same side of the head as their tumour than on the opposite side. Conclusions Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with use of mobile phones. There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma at the highest exposure levels, but biases and error prevent a causal interpretation. The possible effects of long-term heavy use of mobile phones require further investigation.

Behavioural correlates of the P3b event-related potential in school-age children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Auditory oddball; Children; Cognitive correlates; Event-related potentials; Memory; Neuropsychology; P3b	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; REACTION-TIME; P300 LATENCY; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; LOCUS-COERULEUS; MEMORY SPAN; NETWORKS; STIMULI	The latency and amplitude of the P3b component of event-related potentials (ERPs) have been related to behavioural performance on several attention and memory tasks in adult populations. However, the extent to which these results apply to children is unknown. This study examined the neurobehavioral correlates of the P3b component in a longitudinal sample of school-age children from Arctic Quebec. Children (N = 110: mean age = 11.3 years) were assessed on an ERP auditory oddball paradigm and a neurobehavioral evaluation targeting several aspects of cognition, including the Stewart Extended Continuous Performance Test (E-CPT), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Stroop Color-Word Interference Test, and five subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth edition (WISC-IV). P3b latency was positively related to reaction time measures and negatively associated with performance on the WISC-IV Digit Span Forward subtest. Amplitude of the P3b was associated with shorter completion time on the Stroop test and better delayed recognition memory performance among children who did not use semantic strategies on the CVLT. Profile analyses revealed no difference in scalp distribution of the P3b according to performance on these tests. The results are consistent with previous studies with older participants and suggest that, despite age-related differences in waveform and scalp distribution, the P3b component relates to similar neurocognitive processes in children and adults.

In particular, mild-to-moderate hypercapnia is routinely used in calibrated blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based quantification of cerebral oxidative metabolism changes (Delta CMRO(2)), and relies on the assumption of a stable CMRO(2) during CO(2) challenges. However, this assumption has been challenged by certain animal studies, necessitating its verification in humans and under conditions customary to fMRI. We report, for the first time, on global Delta CMRO(2) measurements made noninvasively in humans during graded hypercapnia and hypocapnia. We used computerized end-tidal CO(2) modulation to minimize undesired concurrent changes in oxygen pressure, and our findings suggest that no significant change in global CMRO(2) is expected at the levels of end-tidal CO(2) changes customary to calibrated BOLD.

The patient presented at the age of 4 years with progressive dystonia of the lower extremities and right upper extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral hyperintensities of the globus pallidus that remained stable over the years. Despite extensive investigations, the etiology of her basal ganglia lesions remained nebulous. The patient's dystonia responded to Trihexyphenidyl and to tetrabenazine, but these medications needed to be stopped because of side effects. At the age of 12 years, small doses of levodopa-carbidopa were tried and resulted in dramatic improvement of her dystonia. The authors believe that in the pediatric population with secondary dystonias other than Segawa disease, even though this has been reported only rarely to be effective, a therapeutic trial with levodopa should be considered in some instances.

This mode of treatment requires an effective intracerebral electroencephalographic acquisition system, seizure detector, brain stimulator, and wireless system that consume ultra-low power. This review focuses on alternative brain stimulation treatments for medically intractable epilepsy patients. We mainly discuss clinical studies of long-term responsive stimulation and suggest safer optimized therapeutic options for epilepsy. Finally, we conclude our study with the proposed low-power, implantable fully integrated device that automatically detects low-voltage fast activity ictal onsets and triggers focal treatment to disrupt seizure progression. The detection performance was verified using intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings from two patients with epilepsy. Further experimental validation of this prototype is underway.

However, little is known about its specific roles in stem cells as a functional regulator. We investigated the source of the action of nestin in ES and adult pancreatic ductal stem (PDS) cells in regard to the neogenesis of insulin-secreting beta-cells. In ES cells, suppression of nestin by gene silencing led to an increased expression of the pluripotency-associated genes, including Oct 4, Nanog, and SSEA-1, before embryoid body (EB) formation, whereas it reduced endodermal and pancreatic transcription factors in EBs. Inhibition of nestin expression in adult PDS cells caused a low expression of pancreatic transcription factors and islet hormones, leading to poor beta-cell development and insulin secretion. These data may indicate not only that nestin is a simple stem cell marker, but also that it constitutes a functional factor at the time of stem cell differentiation. We suggest that nestin plays pivotal roles as an intermediate regulator governing both sternness and differentiation of stem cells in the process of their differentiation into insulin-secreting cells.

Brain metastases are rare, occurring in less than 1% of patients with thyroid cancer. Few patients have been managed with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). A retrospective database of 5,067 patients treated for brain metastases between 1985 and 2007 was generated from 11 institutions. Thyroid cancer patients were identified in this database and, when possible, additional information was obtained from further chart review. Patients were excluded if they had incomplete treatment or follow-up information. Two validated prognostic indices, Graded prognostic Assessment (GPA) and Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA), were calculated for each patient. The overall survival times were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Twenty-three thyroid cancer patients were identified (51% male, 48% female). Median age was 63 years (range 20-81). Pathology of the primary thyroid disease was available for twelve patients; the majority were diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer (n = 9 papillary, n = 2 Hurthle cell; 92%) and one had medullary subtype (8%). Median time from diagnosis of primary disease to brain metastasis was 41.8 months (range 0-516). Fifteen (65%) patients underwent SRS as part of their initial treatment with a median number of lesions treated of 1.5 (range 1-9). The median follow-up time for living patients was 35.2 months. Overall median survival time was 20.8 months (40% alive at last follow-up) and 37.4 months for SRS-treated patients (P = NS). A poor Karnofsky performance status was predictive of worse outcome (P = 0.001). GPA and RPA did not provide additional prognostic information. In conclusion, patients treated with SRS for brain metastases from primary thyroid cancer have a favorable prognosis with an expected median survival greater than 3 years. It is unclear as to whether current prognostic indices are relevant to this patient population.

Glial cells participate in synaptic transmission and express metabotropic P2Y as well as ionotropic P2X ATP receptors. In astrocytes, endogenous ATP-evoked currents with kinetics and pharmacology characteristic of the heteromeric P2X1/5 receptor channel have recently been reported. We investigated the interaction of major phosphoinositides with heteromeric P2X1/5 channels. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology on enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing astrocytes acutely isolated from cortical slices of transgenic mice, we report a strong modulation of P2X1/5-like currents by phosphoinositides. Wortmannin-induced depletion of phosphoinositides decreases the amplitude of both the fast and sustained component of the P2X1/5-like currents although recovery and kinetics remain intact. In transfected human embryonic kidney cells, we provide evidence that depleting phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)] levels significantly decreases P2X1/5 currents while intracellular application of PI(4,5)P(2) completely rescued P2X1/5 currents, ruling out the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. In contrast to P2X1, homomeric P2X5 current responses were found insensitive to phosphoinositides, and the C-terminus of P2X5 subunit lacked binding to phospholipids in an overlay assay. Our results suggest that the contribution of calcium-permeable heteromeric P2X1/5 receptor channels to the excitability of astrocytes is modulated by PI(4,5)P(2) through the P2X1 lipid-binding domain.

The Role of V1 Surround Suppression in MT Motion Integration	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL AREA MT; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD CENTER; MACAQUE V1; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; SPATIAL SUMMATION; APERTURE PROBLEM; FEATURE TRACKING; STRIATE CORTEX; COMPLEX CELLS	Neurons in the primate extrastriate cortex are highly selective for complex stimulus features such as faces, objects, and motion patterns. One explanation for this selectivity is that neurons in these areas carry out sophisticated computations on the outputs of lower-level areas such as primary visual cortex (V1), where neuronal selectivity is often modeled in terms of linear spatiotemporal filters. However, it has long been known that such simple V1 models are incomplete because they fail to capture important nonlinearities that can substantially alter neuronal selectivity for specific stimulus features. Thus a key step in understanding the function of higher cortical areas is the development of realistic models of their V1 inputs. We have addressed this issue by constructing a computational model of the V1 neurons that provide the strongest input to extrastriate cortical middle temporal (MT) area. We find that a modest elaboration to the standard model of V1 direction selectivity generates model neurons with strong end-stopping, a property that is also found in the V1 layers that provide input to MT. With this computational feature in place, the seemingly complex properties of MT neurons can be simulated by assuming that they perform a simple nonlinear summation of their inputs. The resulting model, which has a very small number of free parameters, can simulate many of the diverse properties of MT neurons. In particular, we simulate the invariance of MT tuning curves to the orientation and length of tilted bar stimuli, as well as the accompanying temporal dynamics. We also show how this property relates to the continuum from component to pattern selectivity observed when MT neurons are tested with plaids. Finally, we confirm several key predictions of the model by recording from MT neurons in the alert macaque monkey. Overall our results demonstrate that many of the seemingly complex computations carried out by high-level cortical neurons can in principle be understood by examining the properties of their inputs.

Characterization of voltage-gated K+ currents contributing to subthreshold membrane potential oscillations in hippocampal CA1 interneurons. J Neurophysiol 103: 3472-3489, 2010. First published April 14, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00848.2009. CA1 inhibitory interneurons at the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and radiatum junction (LM/RAD-INs) display subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) involving voltage-dependent Na+ and A-type K+ currents. LM/RAD-INs also express other voltage-gated K+ currents, although their properties and role in MPOs remain unclear. Here, we characterized these voltage-gated K+ currents and investigated their role in MPOs. Using outside-out patch recordings from LM/RAD-IN somata, we distinguished four voltage-gated K+ currents based on their pharmacology and activation/inactivation properties: a fast delayed rectifier current (I-Kfast), a slow delayed rectifier current (I-Kslow), a rapidly inactivating A-type current (I-A), and a slowly inactivating current (I-D). Their relative contribution to the total K+ current was I-A > I-Kfast > I-Kslow = I-D. The presence of I-D and the relative contributions of K+ currents in LM/RAD-INs are different from those of other CA1 interneurons, suggesting the presence of differential complement of K+ currents in subgroups of interneurons. We next determined whether these K+ currents were sufficient for MPO generation using a single-compartment model of LM/RAD-INs. The model captured the subthreshold voltage dependence of MPOs. Moreover, all K+ currents were active at subthreshold potentials but I-D, I-A, and the persistent sodium current (I-NaP) were most active near threshold. Using impedance analysis, we found that I-A and I-NaP contribute to MPO generation by modulating peak spectral frequency during MPOs and governing the voltage range over which MPOs occur. Our findings uncover a differential expression of a complement of K+ channels that underlies intrinsic rhythmic activity in inhibitory interneurons.

Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential Latencies in Meniere Disease and Vestibular Schwannoma	JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY			English	Article						acoustic neuroma; Meniere disease; vestibular evoked myogenic potential; vestibular schwannoma	ACOUSTIC NEUROMAS; VEMP	Objective: To evaluate vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) in Meniere disease and vestibular schwannoma. Given that the saccule and inferior vestibular nerve may be damaged in Meniere disease and vestibular schwannoma, respectively, VEMP latency may be prolonged in the patient's affected ear. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Urban otolaryngology practice. Methods: Ten Meniere disease and 12 vestibular schwannoma patients. Subjects were tested with the VEMP head rotation protocol. Main Outcome Measure: VEMP latency. Results: In Meniere disease patients, the pI latencies (mean +/- SEM, milliseconds) were 12.26 +/- 0.75 (healthy ear) and 14.20 +/- 0.73 (affected ear) (p = .041). The nI latencies were 20.29 +/- 1.06 (healthy ear) and 25.06 +/- 1.64 (affected ear) (p = .013). In vestibular schwannoma patients, the pI latencies were 12.02 +/- 0.93 (healthy ear) and 15.88 +/- 1.35 (affected ear) (p = .016). The nI latencies were 20.98 +/- 1.59 (healthy ear) and 24.84 +/- 1.08 (affected ear) (p = .031). Conclusion: VEMP pI and nI latencies were prolonged in the affected ear of Meniere disease and vestibular schwannoma patients. We propose classifying VEMP as abnormal if both the pI latency is > 1 ms longer and the nI latency is > 2 ms longer (sensitivity 66.7%, specificity 86.4%) compared with the other ear. This study suggests a role for VEMP in the clinical testing of these patients.

N-Acetylcysteine attenuates cerebral complications of non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure in mice: antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						Azoxymethane; Acute liver failure; N-acetylcysteine; Hepatic encephalopathy; Inflammation; Brain edema; Ammonia; Glutathione	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SYNDROME; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; LYMPHOTOXIN-ALPHA; INTERFERON-GAMMA; IFN-GAMMA; CYTOKINES; HEPATOTOXICITY	N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an effective antidote to treat acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure (ALF). NAC is hepatoprotective and prevents the neurological complications of ALF, namely hepatic encephalopathy and brain edema. The protective effect of NAC and its mechanisms of action in ALF due to other toxins, however, are still controversial. In the present study, we investigated the effects of NAC in relation to liver pathology, hepatic and cerebral glutathione, plasma ammonia concentrations, progression of encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and plasma proinflammatory cytokines in mice with ALF resulting from azoxymethane (AOM) hepatotoxicity, a well characterized model of toxic liver injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with AOM (100 A mu g/g; i.p.) or saline and sacrificed at coma stage of encephalopathy in parallel with AOM mice administered NAC (1.2 g/kg; i.p.). AOM administration led to hepatic damage, significant increase in plasma transaminase activity, decreased hepatic glutathione levels and brain GSH/GSSG ratios as well as increased expression of plasma proinflammatory cytokines. NAC treatment of AOM mice led to reduced hepatic damage and improvement in neurological function, normalization of brain and hepatic glutathione levels as well as selective attenuation in expression of plasma proinflammatory cytokines. These findings demonstrate that the beneficial effects of NAC in experimental non-APAP-induced ALF involves both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

Alternatively, gene therapy can be a potential option for treating such cancers. Currently mammalian viral-based cancer gene therapy is the most popular approach, but the efficacy has been shown to be quite low in clinical trials. In this study, for the first time, the insect cell-specific baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) has been evaluated as a vector for gene delivery to colorectal cancer cells. Experiments involving factorial design were employed to study the individual and combined effects of different parameters such as multiplicity of infection (MOI), viral incubation time and epigenetic factors on transduction efficiency. The results demonstrate that baculovirus gene delivery system holds immense potential for development of a new generation of highly effective virotherapy for colorectal, as well as other major carcinomas (breast, pancreas, and brain), and offers significant benefits to traditional animal virus-based vectors with respect to safety concerns.

We identified brainstem muscarinoceptive neurons in lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) that received parallel inputs from the MLR and projected back to reticulospinal cells to amplify and extend the duration of locomotor output. These cells responded to muscarine with extended periods of excitation, received direct muscarinic excitation from the MLR and projected glutamatergic excitation to reticulospinal neurons. Targeted blockade of muscarine receptors over these neurons profoundly reduced MLR-induced excitation of reticulospinal neurons and markedly slowed MLR-evoked locomotion. The presence of these neurons forces us to rethink the organization of supraspinal locomotor control, to include a sustained feedforward loop that boosts locomotor output.

However, few reports have addressed the effects of lesions in the anterior limb of the internal capsule on cognition, learning, and memory functions in patients with refractory OCD. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the degree of damage to memory tasks in refractory OCD patients following lesions to the anterior limb of the internal capsule. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A case-controlled, observational study was performed at the Department of Functional Neurosurgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University, China from May 2007 to March 2008. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 refractory OCD patients were admitted to the Department of Functional Neurosurgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University, China from May 2007 to March 2008 and were recruited for this study. The OCD patients were of equal gender, with an average age of (25.1 +/- 9.6) years. An additional 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled from a community of Shanghai City as controls; they were of equal gender and aged (25.1 +/- 8.6) years. METHODS: A total of 10 refractory OCD patients were subjected to lesions in the anterior limbs of the bilateral internal capsules. Wechsler Memory Scale Chinese Revision (WMS-CR, as a task of explicit memory) and the Nissen Version (serial reaction time task) software (SRTT, as a task of implicit memory) were applied to determine memory functions and learning performance in pre- and post-operative OCD patients and controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WMS scores, reaction time in SRTT, and Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale scores were measured in pre- and post-operative OCD patients and controls. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the pre-operative OCD patients exhibited reduced memory task scores (P = 0.005), whereas scores for reciting numbers of backwards digits were greater (P = 0.000). Figure recall and associative memory were less in OCD patients at 1 week following surgery than in the pre-operative OCD patients (P = 0.042, P = 0.002, respectively). Reaction time in implicit SRTT was significantly longer in pre-operative OCD patients compared with controls and post-operative OCD patients (P = 0.01, P = 0.03, respectively). These results suggested ameliorated SRTT following neurosurgery. Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale results revealed significantly improved OCD following lesions in the internal capsule (P = 0.04). Some post-operative OCD patients suffered from deficits in short-term memory and implicit memory. CONCLUSION: Lesions in anterior limbs of bilateral internal capsules improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms and implicit memory in OCD patients, but result in aggravated short-term memory deficits.

Methods: All the molecules were evaluated in 25 tumors and 30 controls: 15 were normal healthy subjects for plasma and 15 were normal brain tissues that were collected during autopsy. Commercially available kits for measurements were used. Results: Superoxide dismutase was significantly lower in tumors, while all other molecules were significantly elevated compared to the controls (p=0.0001). Superoxide dismutase negatively correlated with plasma interleukin-1beta (p=0.04) and plasma Fas (p=0.016). Plasma intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 correlated positively with plasma 3-nitrotyrosine (p=0.019) and nitrite/nitrate (p=0.019), respectively. Furthermore, plasma interleukin-1beta also positively correlated with plasma nitrite/nitrate (p=0.003). Discussion: These results suggest that there is a complex relationship between pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules in glioblastoma multiforme pathogenesis. Thus, targeting multiple pathways with advanced chemotherapeutic agents or radiotheraupetic regimens following total resections might be helpful in patients with glioblastoma multiforme since preventing a single pathway does not seem to be reasonable.

Methods: MRI-based cortical thickness measurement was obtained in 105 patients. A total of 58 had hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance volumetry (TLE-HA) and 47 had normal hippocampal volumes (TLE-NV). Twenty-seven patients had repeated scans with a mean interval of 28 months. Patients were compared to 48 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. We used linear models to assess cortical thinning and the effect of seizure control after surgery. Reproducibility of finding cortical atrophy was statistically evaluated using bootstrap simulations. Results: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed highly similar topology and rates of neocortical thinning in both TLE groups, predominantly in frontocentral, temporal, and cingulate regions. Bootstrap methods showed that at least 20 subjects per group were necessary to reliably observe these patterns of atrophy in TLE. Moreover, power analysis showed that even with sample sizes of 80 subjects per group, differences in thickness between TLE-HA and TLE-NV would be marginal. With respect to postsurgical outcome, we found an association between residual seizures and atrophy in temporopolar and insular cortices in TLE-HA, and in the posterior quadrant in TLE-NV. Conclusion: We demonstrated with a high degree of confidence that static and dynamic effects of epilepsy impact similarly the neocortex of patients with hippocampal atrophy and patients with normal hippocampal volumes. On the contrary, areas predicting unfavorable postsurgical outcome were distinct, suggesting different configurations of epileptogenic networks in these 2 groups.

Given the complexity of the polyamine system, quantification of the levels of the polyamines is an essential step in understanding the downstream effects of dysregulated gene expression. We developed a method using high-resolution capillary gas chromatography ( GC) in combination with mass spectrometry ( MS) for quantitation of polyamines from post-mortem brain tissue, which allowed us to accurately measure spermidine and putrescine concentrations in post-mortem brain tissues. Using this method, we analyzed putrescine and spermidine levels in a total of 126 samples from Brodmann areas 4, 8/9, and 11, from 42 subjects, comprising 16 suicide completers with major depression, 13 non-depressed suicide completers, and 13 control subjects. Both putrescine and spermidine levels fell within the expected nanomolar ranges and were significantly elevated in the brain of suicide completers with a history of major depression as compared with controls. These results were not accounted by possible confounders. This is the first GC-MS study to analyze the expression of putrescine and spermidine from post-mortem brain tissue and confirms the hypothesis raised by previous studies indicating alterations in putrescine and spermidine levels in suicide/major depression.

Stroke patients manifest steering difficulties during walking, which may arise from an altered perception of visual motion. Objective. To examine the ability of stroke patients to control their heading direction while walking in a virtual environment (YE) describing translational optic flows (OFs) expanding from different directions. Methods. The authors evaluated 10 stroke patients and 11 healthy people while they were walking overground and visualizing a VE in a helmet-mounted display. Participants were instructed to walk straight in the VE and were randomly exposed to an OF having a focus of expansion (FOE) located in 5 possible locations (0 degrees, +/- 20 degrees, and +/- 40 degrees to the right or left). The body's center of mass (CoM) trajectory, heading direction, and horizontal body reorientation were recorded with a Vicon-512 system. Results. Healthy participants veered opposite to the FOE location in the physical world, with larger deviations occurring at the most eccentric FOE locations. Stroke patients displayed altered steering behaviors characterized either by an absence of CoM trajectory corrections, multiple errors in the heading direction, or systematic veering to the nonparetic side. Both groups displayed relatively small CoM trajectory corrections that led to large virtual heading errors. Conclusions. The control of heading of locomotion in response to different OF directions is affected by stroke. An altered perception of heading direction and/or a poor integration of sensory and motor information are likely causes. This altered response to OF direction while walking may contribute to steering difficulties after stroke.

Recent findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying these two forms of pain modulation are at least partially separable. This concept is supported by the observation that attention and emotions differentially alter the sensory and affective dimensions of pain perception and apparently implicate different brain circuits. In this review, we will examine those recent findings within the broader cognitive neuroscience conceptualization of human attention and emotion and the corresponding functional neuroanatomy.

Results: Inflammatory reactions are primarily originated by infectious agents, immune reactions and by sterile tissue lesions that activate membrane receptors by means of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, tissue breakdown products and cytokines. The activation of membrane receptors triggers the phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases and of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). The binding of NF-kappa B to the promoter of target genes enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, phospholipase A2, and matrix metalloproteases, proteins that contribute to tissue damage and to the inflammatory reaction. The activation of NF-kappa B has a key role in the immune homeostasis and the inflammatory response and therefore, in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is able to diminish NF-kappa B activation and nuclear translocation in chondrocytes and synovial membrane, effects that may explain the benefits of CS in osteoarthritis. In addition, systemic CS reduces NF-kappa B nuclear translocation in macrophages and hepatocytes, raising the hypothesis that CS might be of benefit to treat other diseases with a strong inflammatory component. There is preliminary evidence in humans that CS improves moderate to severe psoriasis. Moreover, experimental and clinical data suggest that CS might be a useful therapeutic agent in diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, atherosclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Dissection of perceptual, motor and autonomic components of brain activity evoked by noxious stimulation	PAIN			English	Article						Pain; RIII-reflex; Skin conductance; fMRI; Cingulate cortex; Orbitofrontal cortex	NOCICEPTIVE FLEXION REFLEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PAIN PERCEPTION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MODULATION	In the past two decades, functional brain imaging has considerably advanced our knowledge of cerebral pain processing. However, many important links are still missing in our understanding of brain activity in relation to the regulation of pain-related physiological responses. This fMRI study investigates the cerebral correlates of pain (rating), motor responses (RIII-reflex) and autonomic activity (skin conductance response; SCR) evoked by noxious electrical stimulation. Stimulus intensity was adjusted individually based on the RIII threshold to control for differences in peripheral processes and baseline spinal activation. Covariance analyses were used to reveal individual differences in brain activity uniquely associated with individual differences in pain, RIII and SCR. Shock-evoked activity in cingulate, medial orbitofrontal and parahippocampal regions predicted pain sensitivity. Moreover, lateral orbitofrontal and cingulate areas showed strong positive associations with individual differences in motor reactivity but negative associations with autonomic reactivity. Notably, individual differences in OFC activation was almost fully accounted by the combination of individual measures of autonomic and motor reactivity (R(2) = 0.93). Additionally, trial-to-trial fluctuations of RIII-reflex and SCR (within-subjects) were proportional to shock-evoked responses in subgenual cingulate cortex (RIII), anterior insula (SCR) and midcingulate cortex (SCR and RIII). Together, these results confirm that individual differences in perceptual, motor, and autonomic components of pain reflect robust individual differences in brain activity. Furthermore, the brain correlates of trial-to-trial fluctuations in pain responses provide additional evidence for a partial segregation of sub-systems involved more specifically in the ongoing monitoring, and possibly the regulation, of pain-related motor and autonomic responses.

In ten boys the mean age of 9.1 +/- 1 years) to mean age of 16 +/- 1.4 years followed over a period of 7 years, we found that: (1) ventilatory parameters expressed in percentage of predicted value, after a normal ascending phase, start to decrease between 11 and 12 years, (2) Pimax presented only a decreasing phase since the beginning of the study and thus was already at 67% of predicted value at 12 years while ventilatory parameters was still normal, (3) after 12 years the mean slopes of decrease per year of vital capacity and FEV1 were higher (10.7 and 10.4%) than that of Pimax (6.9%), (4) at 15 years mean values of vital capacity and FEV1 (53.3 and 49.5% of predicted values) was simlar to that of Pimax (48.3%). In conclusion, if at early stages of the disease, Pimax is a more reliable index of respiratory impaiment than ventilatory parameters, the follow-up of ventilatory parameters, when they start to decrease, is a better indicator of disease progression and, at advanced stages they provided same information about the functional impact of disease.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Urinary Metabolites of Organophosphate Pesticides	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; pesticides; organophosphates; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DIALKYL PHOSPHATE METABOLITES; DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW SCHEDULE; DISC-IV; CHILDREN; EXPOSURE; RATS; BRAIN; NEURODEVELOPMENT; RELIABILITY	OBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine the association between urinary concentrations of dialkyl phosphate metabolites of organophosphates and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children 8 to 15 years of age. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2000-2004) were available for 1139 children, who were representative of the general US population. A structured interview with a parent was used to ascertain ADHD diagnostic status, on the basis of slightly modified criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen children met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Children with higher urinary dialkyl phosphate concentrations, especially dimethyl alkylphosphate (DMAP) concentrations, were more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD. A 10-fold increase in DMAP concentration was associated with an odds ratio of 1.55 (95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.10), with adjustment for gender, age, race/ethnicity, poverty/income ratio, fasting duration, and urinary creatinine concentration. For the most-commonly detected DMAP metabolite, dimethyl thiophosphate, children with levels higher than the median of detectable concentrations had twice the odds of ADHD (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93 [95% confidence interval: 1.23-3.02]), compared with children with undetectable levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that organophosphate exposure, at levels common among US children, may contribute to ADHD prevalence. Prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal.

Progranulin promotes neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation by regulating GSK-3 beta	PROTEIN & CELL			English	Article						progranulin; frontotemporal lobar degeneration; glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta); neurite outgrowth		Progranulin (PGRN) has recently emerged as a key player in a subset of frontotemporal dementias (FTD). Numerous mutations in the progranulin gene have been identified in patients with familial or sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In order to understand the molecular mechanisms by which PGRN deficiency leads to FTLD, we examined activity of PGRN in mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons and in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment of mouse neurons with PGRN protein resulted in an increase in neurite outgrowth, supporting the role of PGRN as a neurotrophic factor. PGRN treatment stimulated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) in cultured neurons. Knockdown of PGRN in SH-SY5Y cells impaired retinoic acid induced differentiation and reduced the level of phosphorylated GSK-3 beta. PGRN knockdown cells were also more sensitized to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. These results reveal an important role of PGRN in neurite outgrowth and involvement of GSK-3 beta in mediating PGRN activity. Identification of GSK-3 beta activation as a downstream event for PGRN signaling provides a mechanistic explanation for PGRN activity in the nervous system. Our work also suggest that loss of axonal growth stimulation during neural injury repair or deficits in axonal repair may contribute to neuronal damage or axonal loss in FTLD associated with PGRN mutations. Finally, our study suggests that modulating GSK-3 beta or similar signaling events may provide therapeutic benefits for FTLD cases associated with PGRN mutations.

According to this hypothesis, cognitive reserve modulates the relationship between cerebral lesions and their clinical manifestations by limiting the negative impact of cerebral lesions on cognition. Thus, individuals with high cognitive reserve could sustain a greater amount of neuropathological lesions before they reach the criteria for dementia. The goal of this review is to present and discuss the notion of cognitive reserve, a hypothesis that brings a novel perspective to the complexity of normal and pathological cognitive aging. The present article describes the neuronal mechanisms proposed to underlie cognitive reserve and the factors that increase and decrease reserve. In addition, influent studies that have measured the cognitive reserve hypothesis in clinical populations are presented.

Ethnicity effects in relative pitch	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Article							CHILDHOOD MUSIC-EDUCATION; TEASING APART GENES; ABSOLUTE PITCH; BRAIN SIZE; MARVIN,ELIZABETH,WEST 2000; EARLY ENVIRONMENT; SPEECH; GREGERSEN,PETER,K.; PREDISPOSITION; KOWALSKY,ELENA	Absolute pitch (AP), the rare ability to identify a musical pitch, occurs at a higher rate among East Asian musicians. This has stimulated considerable research on the comparative contributions of genetic and environmental factors. Two studies examined whether a similar ethnicity effect is found for relative pitch (RP), identifying the distance or interval between two tones. Nonmusicians (n = 103) were trained to label musical intervals and were subsequently tested on interval identification. We establish similar ethnicity effects: Chinese and Korean participants consistently outperformed other participants in RP tasks, but not in a "relative rhythm" control task. This effect is not driven by previous musical or tone-language experience. The parallel with the East Asian advantage for AP suggests that enhanced perceptual cognitive processing of pitch is more general and is not limited to highly trained musicians. This effect opens up many research questions concerning the environmental and genetic contributions related to this more general pitch-based ability.

This review covers the epidemiology of both disorders, similarities and differences which aid in their mutual diagnoses, and predisposing conditions for the combination of both. Treatments for both migraine and epilepsy can be very useful, although rarely completely successful for migraines. Although the abortive agents used are vastly different, the preventative treatments share mostly similarities, and are commonly anticonvulsant drugs.

Staufen2 is an mRNA-binding protein expressed in the cell bodies and cellular processes of different brain cells. It is notably involved in the transport of dendritic mRNAs along microtubules. Its knockdown expression was shown to change spine morphology and impair synaptic functions. However, the identity of Staufen2-bound mRNAs in brain cells is still completely unknown. As a mean to identify these mRNAs, we immunoprecipitated Staufen2-containing mRNPs from embryonic rat brains and used a genome wide approach to identify Staufen2-associated mRNAs. The genome wide approach identified 1780 mRNAs in Staufen2-containing mRNPs that code for proteins involved in cellular processes such as post-translational protein modifications, RNA metabolism, intracellular transport and translation. These results represent an additional and important step in the characterization of Staufen2- mediated neuronal functions in rat brains.

Recent work by Kalatsky and Stryker (2003) showed that by combining different conditions and using periodic stimuli, recording times can be reduced. Spectral decomposition is then used to provide amplitude and phase information locked to the stimulus. A drawback of the above method is that by focusing only on a single harmonic, response information is limited. The shape of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and the temporal variations in the neural responses cannot be assessed. In this work it is argued that additional information about neural responses can be gathered by using higher harmonics. Moving bars were used to generate visuotopic maps on large portions of the cat visual cortex. Up to four simultaneously bars moving repetitively across the visual field at different frequencies were used to sample the HRF in the Fourier domain. The HRF profile obtained with continuous stimulation was spatially homogeneous throughout the cortex and similar to the HRF profile obtained using episodic stimulation. Furthermore, by modeling the optical response as a convolution between HRF and neuronal responses, the ratio of the second harmonic to the first provided an estimation of the receptive field size. This was further validated by measuring spatial frequency selectivity. Therefore, the use of higher harmonics opens new avenues to estimate receptive field size from temporal signals.

Tissues experience hypertonicity in both physiological (kidney medullar cells) and pathological states (hypernatremia). Hypertonicity induces an adaptive gene expression program that leads to cell volume recovery or apoptosis under persistent stress. We show that the commitment to apoptosis is controlled by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha, the master regulator of the stress response. Studies with cultured mouse fibroblasts and cortical neurons show that mutants deficient in eIF2 alpha phosphorylation are protected from hypertonicity-induced apoptosis. A novel link is revealed between eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and the subcellular distribution of the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1). Stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha promotes apoptosis by inducing the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1, which attenuates internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation of anti-apoptotic mRNAs, including Bcl-xL that was studied here. Hypertonic stress induced the eIF2 alpha phosphorylation-independent formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs, structures that harbor translationally arrested mRNAs) and the eIF2 alpha phosphorylation-dependent accumulation of hnRNP A1 in SGs. The importance of hnRNP A1 was demonstrated by induction of apoptosis in eIF2 alpha phosphorylation-deficient cells that express exogenous cytoplasmic hnRNP A1. We propose that eIF2 alpha phosphorylation during hypertonic stress promotes apoptosis by sequestration of specific mRNAs in SGs in a process mediated by the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1.

We show that loss of retrograde bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) leads to a significant reduction in levels of Rac GEF Trio and a diminution of transcription at the trio locus. We further find that Trio is required in motor neurons for normal structural growth. Finally, we show that transgenic expression of Trio in motor neurons can partially restore NMJ defects in larvae mutant for BMP signaling. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which a retrograde BMP signal from the muscle modulates GTPase activity through transcriptional regulation of Rac GEF trio, thereby regulating the homeostasis of synaptic growth at the NMJ.

J	Nicolakakis, N; Hamel, E				Nicolakakis, Nektaria; Hamel, Edith			The nuclear receptor PPAR gamma as a therapeutic target for cerebrovascular and brain dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						pioglitazone; arterial reactivity; cerebral blood flow; vascular fibrosis; brain metabolism; oxidative stress; inflammation; spatial memory		Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors that regulate peripheral lipid and glucose metabolism. Three subtypes make up the PPAR family (alpha, gamma, beta/delta), and synthetic ligands for PPAR alpha (fibrates) and PPAR gamma (Thiazolidinediones, TZDs) are currently prescribed for the respective management of dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. In contrast to the well characterized action of PPARs in the periphery, little was known about the presence or function of these receptors in the brain and cerebral vasculature until fairly recently. Indeed, research in the last decade has uncovered these receptors in most brain cell types, and has shown that their activation, particularly that of PPAR gamma, is implicated in normal brain and cerebrovascular physiology, and confers protection under pathological conditions. Notably, accumulating evidence has highlighted the therapeutic potential of PPAR gamma ligands in the treatment of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to the testing of the TZDs pioglitazone and rosiglitazone in AD clinical trials. This review will focus on the benefits of PPAR gamma agonists for vascular, neuronal and glial networks, and assess the value of these compounds as future AD therapeutics in light of evidence from transgenic mouse models and recent clinical trials.

There is no vaccine protective against human toxoplasmosis. Herein, immunization of L(d) mice with HF10 (HPGSVNEFDF) with palmitic acid moieties or a monophosphoryl lipid A derivative elicited potent IFN-gamma production from L(d)-restricted CD8(+) T cells in vitro and protected mice. CD8(+) T cell peptide epitopes from T. gondii dense granule proteins GRA 3, 6, 7, and Sag 1, immunogenic in humans for HLA-A02(+), HLA-A03(+), and HLA-B07(+) cells were identified. Since peptide repertoire presented by MHC class I molecules to CD8(+) T cells is shaped by endoplasmic reticulum-associated aminopeptidase (ERAAP), polymorphisms in the human ERAAP gene ERAP1 were studied and associate with susceptibility to human congenital toxoplasmosis (p <0.05). These results have important implications for vaccine development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Frequency-Dependent Attentional Modulation of Local Field Potential Signals in Macaque Area MT	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SELECTIVE VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULUS CONTRAST; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; AWAKE MONKEY; CORTEX; INCREASES	Visual attention modulates neuronal responses in primate motion processing area MT. However, whether it modulates the strength local field potentials (LFP-power) within this area remains unexplored, as well as how this modulation relates to the one of the neurons' response. We investigated these issues by simultaneously recording LFPs and neuronal responses evoked by moving random dot patterns of varying direction and contrast in area MT of two male monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during different behavioral conditions. We found that: (1) LFP-power in the gamma(30-120 Hz), but not in the delta(2-4 Hz), theta(4-8 Hz), alpha(8-12 Hz), beta(1)(12-20 Hz), and beta(2) (20-30 Hz) frequency bands, was tuned for motion direction and contrast, similarly to the neurons' response, (2) shifting attention into a neuron's receptive field (RF) decreased LFP-power in the bands below 30 Hz (except the theta band), whereas shifting attention to a stimulus motion direction outside the RF had no effect in these bands, (3) LFP-power in the gamma band, however, exhibited both spatial-and motion direction-dependent attentional modulation (increase or decrease), which was highly correlated with the modulation of the neurons' response. These results demonstrate that in area MT, shifting attention into the RFs of neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode, or to the direction of a moving stimulus located far away from these RFs, distinctively modulates LFP-power in the various frequency bands. They further suggest differences in the neural mechanisms underlying these types of attentional modulation of visual processing.

SYNAPSE-GLIA INTERACTIONS ARE GOVERNED BY SYNAPTIC AND INTRINSIC GLIAL PROPERTIES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						perisynaptic Schwann cells; synaptic strength; synaptic plasticity; synapse-glia interactions; neuromuscular junction; neuromuscular properties	FROG NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; PERISYNAPTIC SCHWANN-CELLS; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; MOTOR UNITS; TRANSMISSION; MODULATION; EFFICACY; ASTROCYTES; PHYSIOLOGY; MUSCLES	It is believed that glial cell activation and their interactions with synapses are predominantly dependent upon the characteristics of synaptic activity and the level of transmitter release. Because synaptic properties vary from one type of synapse to another, synapse-glia interactions should differ accordingly. The goal of this work was to examine how glial cell activation is dependent upon the properties of their respective synapses as well as the level of synaptic activity. We contrasted Ca(2+) responses of perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) with different synaptic properties; the slow-twitch soleus (SOL) and the fast-twitch levator auris longus (LAL) muscles. Amplitude of PSC Ca(2+) responses elicited by repeated motor nerve stimulation at 40, 50 and 100 Hz were larger and their kinetics faster at LAL NMJs and this, at all frequencies examined. In addition, a greater number of PSCs per NMJ was activated by sustained synaptic transmission at NMJs of LAL in comparison to SOL. Differences in PSC activation could not be explained solely by differences in levels of transmitter release but also by intrinsic PSC properties since increasing transmitter release with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) did not increase their responsiveness. As a whole, these results indicate that PSC responsiveness at NMJs of slow- and fast-twitch muscles differ not only according to the level of activity of their synaptic partner but also in accordance with inherent glial properties.

CERULOPLASMIN-INDUCED AGGREGATION OF P19 NEURONS INVOLVES A SERINE PROTEASE ACTIVITY AND IS ACCOMPANIED BY REELIN CLEAVAGE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						copper proteins; embryonic stem cells; neuronal differentiation; neuronal migration; soybean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin; immunoblotting	DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR; EMBRYONAL CARCINOMA-CELLS; KUNITZ TRYPSIN-INHIBITOR; C-TERMINAL REGION; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; IRON-METABOLISM; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VLDL RECEPTOR	The cytoarchitectural organization of the nervous system depends partly on extracellular serine proteases, including reelin. This 400K protein, which also exists as the N-terminally-derived 300K and 180K fragments, acts through binding to the lipoprotein receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). Ceruloplasmin (CP), a multifunctional protein found in the circulation and also expressed on glial cells, was shown to bind to, and induce aggregation of neurons newly differentiated from P19 embryonic stem cells. This indicated a potential developmental role of CP in neuronal organization, possibly in relation with reelin and other extracellular serine proteases. Therefore, we analysed the effect of cell-impermeant, large spectrum, serine protease inhibitors on CP-induced neuroaggregation and studied reelin expression. Soybean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin (SBTI+Apro) inhibited CP neuroaggregative action. Undifferentiated and neurally-differentiating cultures secreted the 400K reelin. The 180K fragment was present during and after differentiation whereas the 300K species was barely detectable. However, CP stimulated generation of the 300K in the differentiated neuronal cultures, and SBTI+Apro abolished this CP effect. Time course profiles and function-blocking antibody indicated that neuroaggregation does not depend on the generation of the 300K fragment or on reelin action. CP neuroaggregative action thus involves a pericellular serine protease, different from reelin. On the other hand, the CP stimulation of reelin cleavage is in line with a possible role of CP in nervous system development. Since P19 cells express Ap0ER2 and VLDLR, they can help understanding relationships existing between CP, reelin and intervening protease(s). (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Generic antiepileptic drugs and associated medical resource utilization in the United States	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							SUBSTITUTION; EPILEPSY; NONADHERENCE; LAMOTRIGINE; IMPACT; COSTS	Objective: To evaluate whether generic substitution was associated with any difference in medical resource utilization for 5 widely used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the United States. Methods: Health insurance claims from PharMetrics Database, representing over 90 health plans between January 2000 and October 2007, were analyzed. Adult patients with epilepsy, continuously treated with carbamazepine, gabapentin, phenytoin, primidone, or zonisamide, were selected. An open-cohort design was used to classify patients into mutually exclusive periods of brand vs generic use of AEDs. Pharmacy and medical utilization were compared between the 2 periods with multivariate regression analyses. Results were stratified into epilepsy-related medical services, and stable (<= 2 outpatient visits per year and no emergency room visit) vs unstable epilepsy. Time-to-event analyses were also performed for all services and epilepsy-related endpoints. Results: A total of 18,125 patients were observed in the stable group and 15,500 patients in the unstable group. After adjustment of covariates, periods of generic AED treatment were associated with increased use of all prescription drugs (incidence rate ratio [IRR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.13 [1.13-1.14]) and higher epilepsy-related medical utilization rates (hospitalizations: IRR [95% CI] = 1.24 [1.19-1.30]; outpatient visits: IRR [95% CI] = 1.14 [1.13-1.16]; lengths of hospital stays: IRR [95% CI] = 1.29 [1.27-1.32]). Generic-use periods were associated with increased utilization rates in stable and unstable patients and with 20% increased risk of injury, compared to periods with brand use of AEDs. Conclusions: Generic antiepileptic drug use was associated with significantly greater medical utilization and risk of epilepsy-related medical events, compared to brand use. This relationship was observed even in patients characterized as stable. Neurology (R) 2010; 74: 1566-1574	[Labiner, D. M.] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Labiner, D.

At 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), wild-type zebrafish embryos respond to mechanosensory stimulation and swim away from the stimuli, whereas mi310 mutants are insensitive to touch. During similar to 2-4 dpf, wild-type RB neurons undergo programmed cell death, which is caused by sodium current-mediated electrical activity, whereas mutant RB cells survive past 4 dpf, suggesting a defect of sodium currents in the mutants. Indeed, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated the generation of action potentials in wild-type RB neurons, whereas mutant RB cells failed to fire owing to the reduction of voltage-gated sodium currents. Labeling of dissociated RB neurons with an antibody against voltage-gated sodium channels revealed that sodium channels are expressed at the cell surface in wild-type, but not mutant, RB neurons. Finally, in mi310 mutants, we identified a mis-sense mutation in pigu, a subunit of GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) transamidase, which is essential for membrane anchoring of GPI-anchored proteins. Taken together, biogenesis of GPI-anchored proteins is necessary for cell surface expression of sodium channels and thus for firings of RB neurons, which enable zebrafish embryos to respond to mechanosensory stimulation.

Design: Samples were prepared for immunohistochemical staining for GDNF, GFR-alpha 1, and RET and in situ hybridization for the mRNA of GFR-alpha 1. The mRNA expression of two GDNF isoforms and two RET isoforms was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Setting: Infertility unit at a university-affiliated tertiary medical center. Patient(s): Fifteen patients who underwent pregnancy terminations at 21-35 gestational weeks and 28 girls/women aged 5-39 years who underwent ovarian laparoscopies. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Laboratory analysis of human ovarian specimens. Result(s): The GDNF protein was detected in oocytes of all samples. Granulosa cells (GCs) stained for GDNF in a portion of fetal samples and in all samples from girls/women. The proteins for GFR-alpha 1 and RET were detected in both oocytes and GCs with weak staining for the long RET isoform. GFR-alpha 1 mRNA transcripts were detected in oocytes and GCs from all samples. The mRNA transcripts for the two GDNF isoforms and the two RET isoforms were detected in all fetal and adult specimens. Conclusion(s): The presence of the receptors of GDNF in the GCs of human primordial follicles suggests that GDNF may be involved in the regulation of primordial follicular activation.

We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of two brief screening tools, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in detecting MCI in idiopathic RBD. Thirty-eight idiopathic RBD patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, including the MoCA and the MMSE. Receiver operating characteristic curves were created for the MoCA and the MMSE to assess their ability to identify MCI in idiopathic RBD patients, with neuropsychological assessment as the gold standard. For the MoCA, a normality cutoff of 26 yielded the best balance between sensitivity (76%) and specificity (85%) with a correct classification of 79%. For the MMSE, the optimal normality cutoff was 30, with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 54% and a correct classification of 74%. The MoCA is superior to the MMSE in detecting MCI in idiopathic RBD patients, showing good sensitivity and very good specificity.

The interrelationship of dopamine D2-like receptor availability in striatal and extrastriatal brain regions in healthy humans: A principal component analysis of [F-18]fallypride binding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ULTRASTRUCTURAL-LOCALIZATION; D-2-DOPAMINE RECEPTORS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; F-18 FALLYPRIDE; HUMAN FOREBRAIN; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN THALAMUS	Individual differences in dopamine D2-like receptor availability arise across all brain regions expressing D2-like receptors. However, the interrelationships in receptor availability across brain regions are poorly understood. To address this issue, we examined the relationship between D2-like binding potential (BPND) across striatal and extrastriatal regions in a sample of healthy participants. PET imaging was performed with the high affinity D2/D3 ligand [F-18]fallypride in 45 participants. BPND images were submitted to voxel-wise principal component analysis to determine the pattern of associations across brain regions. Individual differences in D2-like BPND were explained by three distinguishable components. A single component explained almost all of the variance within the striatum, indicating that individual differences in receptor availability vary in a homogenous manner across the caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum. Cortical BPND was only modestly related to striatal BPND and mostly loaded on a distinct component. After controlling for the general level of cortical D2-like BPND, an inverse relationship emerged between receptor availability in the striatum and the ventral temporal and ventromedial frontal cortices, suggesting possible cross-regulation of D2-like receptors in these regions. The analysis additionally revealed evidence of: (1) a distinct component involving the midbrain and limbic areas; (2) a dissociation between BPND in the medial and lateral temporal regions; and (3) a dissociation between BPND in the medial/midline and lateral thalamus. In summary, individual differences in D2-like receptor availability reflect several distinct patterns. This conclusion has significant implications for neuropsychiatric models that posit global or regionally specific relationships between dopaminergic tone and behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hansen, BC; Thompson, B; Hess, RF; Ellemberg, D				Hansen, Bruce C.; Thompson, Benjamin; Hess, Robert F.; Ellemberg, Dave			Extracting the internal representation of faces from human brain activity: An analogue to reverse correlation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; VISUAL MENTAL-IMAGERY; HUMAN FUSIFORM GYRUS; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; PHASE ALIGNMENT; SENSITIVE N170; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; AREA	Much of the debate surrounding the precise functional role of brain mechanisms implicated in the processing of human faces can be explained when considering that studies into early-stage neural representations of the spatial arrangement of facial features are potentially contaminated by "higher-level" cognitive attributes associated with human faces. One way to bypass such attributes would be to employ ambiguous stimuli that are not biased toward any particular object class and analyze neural activity in response to those stimuli in a manner similar to traditional reverse correlation for mapping visual receptive fields. Accordingly, we sought to derive whole face representations directly from neural activity in the human brain using electroencephalography (EEG). We presented ambiguous fractal noise stimuli to human participants and asked them to rate each stimulus along a "face not present" to "face present" continuum while simultaneously recording EEGs. All EEGs were subjected to a time-frequency analysis near 170 ms (negative amplitudes near 170 ms post-stimulus onset have been linked to early face processing) for five different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) on a trial-by-trial basis, independent of the behavioral responses. Images containing apparent face-like structure were obtained for theta through gamma frequency bands for strong negative amplitudes near 170 ms post-stimulus onset. The presence of the face-like structure in the spatial images derived from brain signals was objectively verified using both Fourier methods and trained neural networks. The results support the use of a modified reverse correlation technique with EEG as a non-biased assessment of brain processes involved in the complex integration of spatial information into objects such as human faces.

It remains unknown whether such impairments also characterize acute PTSD. In the present investigation, neurocognitive functions were examined in trauma exposed individuals with (n = 21) and without (n = 16) acute PTSD, as well as in a group of individuals never exposed to trauma (n = 17) using specific and standardized tasks such as the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, the Aggie's Figure Learning Test, the Autobiographical Memory Interview, the D2 test, the Stroop task, the digit and visual span tasks of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III, the Trail Making Test, the Tower of London and the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. A number of deficits in the cognitive domains of memory, high-level attentional resources, executive function and working memory were found in the group with a diagnosis of acute PTSD only and not among the other groups. The findings, which point to the possibility of disturbed fronto-temporal system function in trauma-exposed individuals with acute PTSD, are particularly relevant for the early clinical management of this disorder.

A key advantage of control at the translational level is the opportunity to regulate protein synthesis within specific cellular subregions. However, little is known about mechanisms that may link extracellular cues to translation with spatial precision. Here, we show that a transmembrane receptor, DCC, forms a binding complex containing multiple translation components, including eukaryotic initiation factors, ribosomal large and small subunits, and monosomes. In neuronal axons and dendrites DCC colocalizes in particles with translation machinery, and newly synthesized protein. The extracellular ligand netrin promoted DCC-mediated translation and disassociation of translation components. The functional and physical association of a cell surface receptor with the translation machinery leads to a generalizable model for localization and extracellular regulation of protein synthesis, based on a transmembrane translation regulation complex.

The relationships between signaling genes suggest avenues through which homeostasis can be restored and disease symptoms subsequently reduced. Specifically, disease symptoms caused by loss-of-function mutations in a particular gene may be reduced by concomitant perturbations in genes with antagonistic activities. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we use network-neighborhood analyses to predict genetic interactions in Caenorhabditis elegans towards mapping antagonisms and synergisms between genes in an animal model. Most of the predicted interactions are novel, and the experimental validation establishes that our approach provides a gain in accuracy compared to previous efforts. In particular, we identified genetic interactors of gdi-1, the orthologue of GDI1, a gene associated with mental retardation in human. Interestingly, some gdi-1 interactors have human orthologues with known neurological functions, and upon validation of the interactions in mammalian systems, these orthologues would be potential therapeutic targets for GDI1-associated neurological disorders. We also observed the conservation of a gdi-1 interaction between different cellular systems in C. elegans, suggesting the involvement of GDI1 in human muscle degeneration. Conclusions/Significance: We developed a novel predictor of genetic interactions that may have the ability to significantly streamline the identification of therapeutic targets for monogenic disorders involving genes conserved between human and C. elegans.

LGI1 is a secreted protein that shares homology with members of the SLIT family, ligands that direct axonal repulsion and growth cone collapse, and we therefore considered the possibility that LGI1 may regulate neuronal process extension or growth cone collapse. Here we report that LGI1 does not affect growth directly but instead enhances neuronal growth on myelin-based inhibitory substrates and antagonizes myelin-induced growth cone collapse. We show that LGI1 mediates this effect by functioning as a specific Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) ligand that antagonizes the action of myelin-based inhibitory cues. Finally, we demonstrate that NgR1 and ADAM22 physically associate to form a receptor complex in which NgR1 facilitates LGI1 binding to ADAM22.

Here the effect of clitoral stimulation (CLS) on proceptivity was assessed. In Exp 1, ovariectomized, hormone-primed Wistar females formed three groups: Cl (1 CLS every second), G2 (1 CLS every 5 s) and G3 (no CLS). Precopulatory CLS consisted of 5 cycles of 1 min of stimulation with the tip of a cotton swab connected to a vibrator device, followed by 1-2 min of rest. CLS increased proceptive behavior in Cl compared to G2, but not compared to G3. In Exp 2, gonadally-intact rats in late proestrous received CLS prior to copulation. No differences in sexual behavior were detected between the groups, but CLS enhanced reproduction in females that received >9 intromissions. 28,66 and 10% of females became pregnant in G1, G2, and G3, respectively. These data indicate that precopulatory CLS affects proceptive behaviors depending on the pattern and rhythm of stimulation in hormone-primed females. In virgin rats that have received sufficient vagino cervical stimulation CLS also increases fertility. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although it has been used extensively in the brain, its application to the spinal cord is rare. The inability of intrinsic optical techniques to resolve different depths and embedded gray matter hampers their capacity to distinguish larger vasculature contributions of hemodynamic signals originating from motoneuron and interneuron activation. Laminar optical tomography ( LOT) is a recently-developed method that fills the gap left between IOI and diffuse optical imaging. With distinct source-detector separations, light that propagates deeper into tissues can be distinguished from light originating from the surface, providing depth sensitivity. In this work, LOT is investigated for the first time to image spinal cord activation with simultaneous IOI of the cortex in rats. Such proof of concept provides a powerful imaging modality to study spinal cord activation and disruption after injury.

However, it is still not known in detail how network activity patterns emerge, or how they encode information. By using functional multineuron calcium imaging, we simultaneously recorded the activity of >100 neurons in the CA3 region of hippocampal slice cultures. We utilized a novel computational method to analyze the multichannel spike trains and to depict functional neuronal assemblies. By means of event synchronization and the correlation matrix analysis method, we found that: 1), the average functional neuronal cluster consists of 23 neurons, and neurons could be part of multiple assemblies; 2), the clustering strength, size, and mean distance among cells in neuronal assemblies follow a power-law-like distribution; 3), the clustering strength and size of neuronal assemblies are not correlated with the total number of neurons and their physical distance; and 4), the clustering distance of neuronal assemblies is weakly correlated with the total number of neurons and their physical distance. These findings suggest that the functional organization of the spontaneously firing CA3 hippocampal network is a scale-free structure in slice culture.

Muscle Eye Brain Disease. To gain insight into the function of DG in the nervous system we initiated a study to examine its contribution to development of the eye of Drosophila melanogaster. Immuno-histochemistry showed that DG is concentrated on the apical surface of photoreceptors (R) cells during specification of cell-fate in the third instar larva and is maintained at this location through early pupal stages. In point mutations that are null for DG we see abortive R cell elongation during differentiation that first appears in the pupa and results in stunted R cells in the adult. Overexpression of DG in R cells results in a small but significant increase in their size. R cell differentiation defects appear at the same stage in a deficiency line Df(2R)Dg(248) that affects Dg and the neighboring mitochondrial ribosomal gene, mRpL34. In the adult, these flies have severely disrupted R cells as well as defects in the lens and ommatidia. Expression of an mRpL34 transgene rescues much of this phenotype. We conclude that DG does not affect neuronal commitment but functions R cell autonomously to regulate neuronal elongation during differentiation in the pupa. We discuss these findings in view of recent work implicating DG as a regulator of cell metabolism and its genetic interaction with mRpL34, a member of a class of mitochondrial genes essential for normal metabolic function.

We report here the interactions of microglia and neurons with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of three morphologies, spheres, rods, and urchins, coated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or cetyl trimethylammonium bromide ((TAB). Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain, primarily involved in surveillance, macrophagy, and production of cytokines and trophic factors. Analysis by dark-field microscopy and by two-photon-induced luminescence (TPL) indicates that the exposure of neural cells to GNPs resulted in (i) GNP internalization by both microglial cells and primary hippocampal neurons, as revealed by dark-field microscopy and by two-photon-induced luminescence (TPL), (ii) transient toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) up-regulation in the olfactory bulb, after intranasal administration in transgenic mice, in vivo, in real time, and (iii) differential up-regulation in vitro of TLR-2 together with interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and nitric oxide (NO) in microglia. The study demonstrates that GNP morphology and surface chemistry strongly influence the microglial activation status and suggests that interactions between GNPs and microglia can be differentially regulated by tuning GNP nanogeometry.

A New Canine Carotid Artery Bifurcation Aneurysm Model for the Evaluation of Neurovascular Devices	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; DETACHABLE COILS; EMBOLIZATION; OCCLUSION; NECK; CYANOACRYLATE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE. Stents are increasingly used for coiling of difficult aneurysms, to reduce the risk of recurrences, or to modify blood flow Currently available bifurcation aneurysm models are ill-suited to assess stent performance before clinical use We designed a new wide-neck canine T-type bifurcation aneurysm model Its potential value as a training tool as well as in the evaluation of new techniques or embolic agents was assessed Our first task was to verify that recurrences occurred after satisfactory coiling A second aim of this preliminary work was to assess if the new model could recreate the technical challenges involved in bifurcation aneurysms MATERIALS AND METHODS. We introduce a new canine wide-neck bifurcation aneurysm model, created by using a vein pouch at the apex of an end-to-side anastomosis of the carotid arteries, with flow reversal in the proximal RCA by ligation of the innominate artery Three aneurysms were treated with coil embolization, 10 were treated with stents (7 self-expandable, 3 balloon-expandable), and 3 were left untreated Aneurysms were followed by duplex ultrasonography and angiography, and studied with macroscopic photography after euthanasia 11 8 +/- 3 9 months after surgery RESULTS. All aneurysms remained patent at 9 0 +/- 3 6 months' follow-up Coiling led to recurrences by 3 months in all 3 cases Stent placement was technically difficult in all cases and did not lead to aneurysm thrombosis or neointimal closure of the aneurysm neck at 3 months CONCLUSIONS. This model may be suitable for studying the effects of endovascular treatment on aneurysm and branch occlusion rates, for preclinical testing of stems and other intravascular devices, and for training students of endovascular technique	[Raymond, J.] CHUM, Notre Dame Hosp, Intervent Neuroradiol Res Lab NRI, Intervent Neuroradiol Res Unit,Dept Radiol, Montreal, PQ H2L 4M1, Canada	Raymond, J (reprint author), CHUM, Notre Dame Hosp, Intervent Neuroradiol Res Lab NRI, Intervent Neuroradiol Res Unit,Dept Radiol, 1560 Sherbrooke E,Pavil Simard,Suite Z12909, Montreal, PQ H2L 4M1, Canada.

The apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial oxido-reductase originally characterized as a mediator of caspase-independent programmed cell death (PCD). In this postmortem study, we investigated the distribution of AIF and its possible morphological association with pathological features in the hippocampus, as well as entorhinal and medial gyrus of temporal cortices of late stage AD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and control subjects. In comparison with controls, a significant increase in neuronal AIF immunoreactivity (AIF-ir) was observed in the hippocampus and the superficial layers of entorhinal and medial gyrus of temporal cortices in AD but not DLB samples. AIF-ir in neuronal nuclei was also significantly more widespread in AD compared with control and DLB samples. Furthermore, AIF-ir was found to be colocalized with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD brains. Interestingly, a significant positive correlation was seen between nuclear AIF-ir and Braak stage in CA1 of the hippocampus as well as in entorhinal and temporal cortices in AD samples. These data show for the first time: (1) the nuclear localization of AIF in the AD brain and (2) its colocalization with NFTs, suggesting a possible involvement of AIF-mediated caspase-independent PCD, at least in the late stage of this neuropathology.

Design: Generalizability theory was used to estimate generalizability and dependability coefficients as well as the relative contribution of identified sources of measurement error to total measurement error. Decision studies were used to enable the investigators to determine the optimal measurement design. Setting: The IADL Profile was administered in subjects' homes and community environments. Participants: Convenience sample of adults with a moderate or severe TBI (N=30, aged 16-65y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: IADL Profile scores include 6 factor scores (going to the grocery store/shopping for groceries, having a meal with guests/cleaning up, putting on outdoor clothing, obtaining information, making a budget, and preparing a hot meal) and I total score. Results: The greatest sources of measurement error were the subject-item interactions (3-random-facet design) and the subject-rater interactions (2-random-facet design). One hundred percent of generalizability coefficients of factor scores indicated acceptable to excellent reliability. Indices of dependability confirmed that 1 evaluator could reliably score the tool on a single occasion after having received a 3-day training workshop. Conclusions: The IADL Profile administered to persons with a moderate or severe TB I provides occupational therapists with a reliable set of measures of IADL independence capable of both capturing and analyzing the complex interactions between personal and environmental factors.

However, several studies have reported that semantic processing can still be effective for repeated target stimuli when the context, prime word or sentence frame, changes from trial to trial. This type of context-target designs allows to study semantic associations between repeated words. However, it is not optimal to study single concepts or categories and therefore structural aspects of semantic memory. Here, we tested whether semantic effects could be observed if single-word trials were used. Concrete and Abstract words were presented multiple times in two concrete-abstract classification experiments. In the first experiment, 6 words of each category were repeatedly presented. In the second experiment, only one word of each category was used. Results of both experiments showed significant effects of concreteness on reaction times and N400-like event-related potentials (ERPs), which were comparable to those reported in non-repeated conditions. In the second experiment, in which repetitions occurring in consecutive and non-consecutive trials were contrasted, N400-like effects were observed only for nonconsecutive repetitions. These findings suggest that it could be possible to study the brain activity corresponding to individual concepts in experimental designs using single-word trials, provided that consecutive repetitions are avoided.

Clinical and imaging heterogeneity of polymicrogyria: a study of 328 patients	BRAIN			English	Article						polymicrogyria; cortical malformations; magnetic resonance; epileptology	BILATERAL PERISYLVIAN POLYMICROGYRIA; PERIVENTRICULAR HETEROTOPIA; CORTICAL MALFORMATION; CANDIDATE LOCUS; MUTATIONS; MICROGYRIA; EPILEPSY; FEATURES; CORTEX; MRI	Polymicrogyria is one of the most common malformations of cortical development and is associated with a variety of clinical sequelae including epilepsy, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction and speech disturbance. It has heterogeneous clinical manifestations and imaging patterns, yet large cohort data defining the clinical and imaging spectrum and the relative frequencies of each subtype are lacking. The aims of this study were to determine the types and relative frequencies of different polymicrogyria patterns, define the spectrum of their clinical and imaging features and assess for clinical/imaging correlations. We studied the imaging features of 328 patients referred from six centres, with detailed clinical data available for 183 patients. The ascertainment base was wide, including referral from paediatricians, geneticists and neurologists. The main patterns of polymicrogyria were perisylvian (61%), generalized (13%), frontal (5%) and parasagittal parieto-occipital (3%), and in 11% there was associated periventricular grey matter heterotopia. Each of the above patterns was further divided into subtypes based on distinguishing imaging characteristics. The remaining 7% were comprised of a number of rare patterns, many not described previously. The most common clinical sequelae were epileptic seizures (78%), global developmental delay (70%), spasticity (51%) and microcephaly (50%). Many patients presented with neurological or developmental abnormalities prior to the onset of epilepsy. Patients with more extensive patterns of polymicrogyria presented at an earlier age and with more severe sequelae than those with restricted or unilateral forms. The median age at presentation for the entire cohort was 4 months with 38% presenting in either the antenatal or neonatal periods. There were no significant differences between the prevalence of epilepsy for each polymicrogyria pattern, however patients with generalized and bilateral forms had a lower age at seizure onset. There was significant skewing towards males with a ratio of 3:2. This study expands our understanding of the spectrum of clinical and imaging features of polymicrogyria. Progression from describing imaging patterns to defining anatomoclinical syndromes will improve the accuracy of prognostic counselling and will aid identification of the aetiologies of polymicrogyria, including genetic causes.

A search with no language restriction for all available randomized controlled trials (RCT) was conducted in PUBMED on July 2, 2009, EMBASE 1980 to 2009 Week 27, Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1950 to Week 4 in June 2009, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2(nd) Quarter 2009, and CINAHL on July 4, 2009. Reference lists of all studies were also checked. Two investigators extracted data independently. The optimal information size (OIS) was calculated on a 50% failure rate of fetal version for a relative reduction of 25% (alpha = 0.05 two-tailed, beta = 0.2). The OIS was 494. Seven RCTs were found, including 681 pregnant women with a Jadad score from 1 to 3. Central neuraxial blockade increases the success rate of fetal version (risk ratio [RR] = 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-1.79; P = 0.001) (random effects model; I(2) = 30.25%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.20). Three studies used a CNB at anesthetic dose of local anesthetic (RR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.46-2.60; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0.00%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.86; number needed to treat = 4; 95% CI = 3-6). Four studies used an analgesic dose (RR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.94-1.49; P = 0.15; I(2) = 0.00%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.77). These two subgroups were significantly different one from the other with a P value of 0.007. Anesthetic dose neuraxial blockade increases the success rate of external fetal version.

Considering that most FDG-PET studies in dementia use clinical diagnosis as gold standard and that clinical diagnosis is approximately 80% sensitive or accurate, we aim to review the evidence-based data on the diagnostic accuracy of brain FDG-PET in dementia when cerebral autopsy is used as gold standard. We searched the PubMed and Medline databases for dementia-related articles that correlate histopathological diagnosis at autopsy with FDG-PET imaging and found 47 articles among which there were only 5 studies of 20 patients or more. We were able to conclude that sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for Alzheimer's disease are good, but more studies using histopathological diagnosis at autopsy as gold standard are needed in order to evaluate what FDG-PET truly adds to premortem diagnostic accuracy in dementia.

Less is known about the role of the p75 neurotrophin receptor in cancer, but it influences metastatic potential in glioblastoma. To determine the effect of each neurotrophin receptor or co-receptor expression in tumorigenesis, we examined PC12 pheochromocytomas. PC12 wild type (TrkA(+), p75(++)) were compared to three PC12-derived cell lines expressing varying levels of TrkA or TrkC and/or p75. Growth rates, tumorigenic potential ex vivo and in vivo, and chemotherapeutic drug response profiles differed depending on the neurotrophin receptor phenotype. The ability of neurotrophins to rescue cells from doxorubicin or cisplatin induced cell death also varied depending on phenotype. Thus, unique neurotrophin receptor tumor profiles may determine tumor aggressiveness and chemoresistance. This work may help to develop tailored therapies for specific tumor phenotypes by combining traditional chemotherapy with neurotrophin receptor modulators.

Novel roles in cell survival and metabolic adaptation to hypoxia have been ascribed to the microsomal glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT). While antitumorigenic properties of G6PT inhibitors such as chlorogenic acid (CHL) have been documented, those of the G6PT inhibitor and semi-synthetic analog AD4-015 of the polyketide mumbaistatin are not understood. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro antiangiogenic impact of AD4-015 on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), which play an essential role as structural and functional components in tumor angiogenesis. We found that in vitro HBMEC migration and tubulogenesis were reduced by AD4-015 but not by CHL. The mumbaistatin analog significantly inhibited the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 secretion and gene expression as assessed by zymography and RT-PCR. PMA-mediated cell signaling leading to cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and I kappa B downregulation was also inhibited, further confirming AD4-015 as a cell signaling inhibitor in tumor promoting conditions. G6PT functions may therefore account for the metabolic flexibility that enables EC-mediated neovascularization. This process could be specifically targeted within the vasculature of developing brain tumors by G6PT inhibitors.

Methods: Bilateral finger physiological tremor was recorded in 35 right-handed participants with laser displacement sensors in: (A) control condition, (B) modulation attempt of physiological tremor of the right index finger, (C) modulation attempt of physiological tremor of the right index finger by using co-contraction as a means to stabilize the finger. Results: Physiological tremor amplitude was significantly reduced between the control and modulation conditions for the right index finger. Physiological tremor amplitude was also significantly reduced for the left index finger. Regression analysis of oscillation amplitudes showed little relationship between both fingers, even during modulation attempts. The lack of relationship between fingers is also evident by low coherence values obtained in the control and modulation conditions. The coherence in the co-activation condition was significantly higher, albeit still low, in each frequency band. Conclusion: Our results confirm that physiological tremor can be voluntarily reduced, and this reduction is bilateral. The modulation attempt did not however increase the frequency relationship between both sides. Signficance: A central command aiming at modulating tremor amplitude will not increase the synchronization between oscillators responsible for the central components of physiological tremor.

Buprenorphine Transdermal System in Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Study, Followed by an Open-Label Extension Phase	CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						buprenorphine; low back pain; transdermal system; chronic noncancer pain	CONTROLLED-RELEASE OXYCODONE; CHRONIC NONCANCER PAIN; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; OSTEOARTHRITIS PAIN; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; DISABILITY INDEX; OPIOID THERAPY; EFFICACY; TRAMADOL; SLEEP	Background: Buprenorphine is a mixed-activity, partial p-opioid agonist. Its lipid solubility makes it well suited for transdermal administration. Objective: This study assessed the efficacy and safety profile of a 7-day buprenorphine transdermal system (BIDS) in adult (age >18 years) patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain previously treated with tablet daily of an opioid analgesic. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, followed by an open-label extension phase. After a 2- to 7-day washout of previous opioid therapy, eligible patients were randomized to receive BTDS 10 mu g/h or matching placebo patches. The dose was titrated weekly using 10- and 20-mu g/h patches (maximum, 40 mu g/h) based on efficacy and tolerability. After 4 weeks, patients crossed over to the alternative treatment for another 4 weeks. Patients who completed the double-blind study were eligible to enter the 6-month open-label phase. Rescue analgesia was provided as acetaminophen 325 mg to be taken as 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed. The primary outcome assessments were daily pain intensity, measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), from no pain to excruciating pain, and a 5-point ordinal scale, from 0 = none to 4 = excruciating. Secondary outcome assessments included the Pain and Sleep Questionnaire (100-mm VAS, from never to always), Pain Disability Index (ordinal scale, from 0 = no disability to 11 = total disability), Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (categorical scale, from 0 = no difficulty to 5 = unable to do), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients and investigators assessed overall treatment effectiveness at the end of each phase; they assessed treatment preference at the end of double-blind treatment. After implementation of a precautionary amendment, the QTc interval was measured 3 to 4 days after randomization and after any dose adjustment. All assessments performed during the double-blind phase were also performed every 2 months during the open-label extension. Adverse events were collected by non-directed questioning throughout the study. Results: Of 78 randomized patients, 52 (66.7%) completed at least 2 consecutive weeks of treatment in each study phase without major protocol violations (per-protocol [PP] population: 32 women, 20 men; mean [SD] age, 51.3 [11.4] years; mean weight, 85.5 [19.5] kg; 94% white, 4% black, 2% other). The mean (SD) dose of study medication during the last week of treatment was 29.8 (12.1) mu g/h for BTDS and 32.9 (10.7) mu g/h for placebo (P = NS). During the last week of treatment, BTDS was associated with significantly lower mean (SD) pain intensity scores compared with placebo on both the VAS (45.3 [21.3] vs 53.1 [24.3] mm, respectively; P = 0.022) and the 5-point ordinal scale (1.9 [0.7] vs 2.2 [0.8]; P = 0.044). The overall Pain and Sleep score was significantly lower with BTDS than with placebo (177.6 [125.5] vs 232.9 [131.9]; P = 0.027). There were no treatment differences on the Pain Disability Index, Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale, or SF-36; however, BTDS was associated with significant improvements compared with placebo on 2 individual Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale items (get out of bed: P = 0.042; sit in a chair for several hours: P = 0.022). Of the 48 patients/physicians in the PP population who rated the effectiveness of treatment, 64.6% of patients (n = 31) rated BTDS moderately or highly effective, as did 62.5% of investigators (n = 30). Among the 50 patients in the PP population who answered the preference question, 66.0% of patients (n = 33) preferred the phase in which they received BTDS and 24.0% (n = 12) preferred the phase in which they received placebo (P = 0.001), with the remainder having no preference; among investigators, 60.0% (n = 30) and 28.0% (n = 14) preferred the BTDS and placebo phases, respectively (P = 0.008), with the remainder having no preference. The mean placebo-adjusted change from baseline in the QTc interval ranged from -0.8 to +3.8 milliseconds (P = NS). BIDS treatment was associated with a significantly higher frequency of nausea (P < 0.001), dizziness (P < 0.001), vomiting (P = 0.008), somnolence (P = 0.020), and dry mouth (P = 0.003), but not constipation. Of the 49. patients completing 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, 40(81.6%) entered the 6-month, open-label extension study and 27 completed it. Improvements in pain scores achieved during the double-blind phase were maintained in these patients. Conclusions: In the 8-week, double-blind portion of this study, BIDS 10 to 40 mu g/h was effective compared with placebo in the management of chronic, moderate to severe low back pain in patients 11 had previously received opioids. The improvements in pain scores were sustained throughout the 6-month, open-label extension.

Recent evidence suggests that this process may also be crucial to prevent tumor formation. In the past 30 years, the embryo of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be a very powerful model to study the molecular and cellular basis of asymmetric cell division. Understanding this process in Caenorhabditis elegans may thus lead to a better understanding of stem cell function and tumorigenesis in humans. Developmental Dynamics 239:1378-1387, 2010.

Neurocognitive abilities have received only scant attention so far as a risk factor for poor adherence but significant impairments with memory and/or planning abilities could play a role. We examined early medication adherence following admission to a specialized clinical programme for FEP. Method: One hundred sixty FEP participants and 35 healthy controls completed an exhaustive neurocognitive assessment. FEP participants were categorized as a function of their medication adherence at 6 months into poor (n = 34), partial (n = 27) and full (n = 99) adherence, respectively. Domain-specific and global measures of cognitive ability were examined. Results: No measure of neurocognition could significantly discriminate amongst the three medication adherence groups. Conclusion: These results suggest no strong associations between neurocognitive abilities and medication adherence in first episode of psychosis.

In Vivo Molecular Imaging of Somatostatin Receptors in Pancreatic Islet Cells and Neuroendocrine Tumors by Miniaturized Confocal Laser-Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							REAL-TIME; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; ANIMAL-MODELS; ENDOMICROSCOPY; DIAGNOSIS; LESIONS; TECHNOLOGY; ENDOSCOPY; HISTOLOGY; CANCER	The aim of the study was to evaluate real time in vivo molecular imaging of somatostatin receptors (sstrs) using a handheld miniaturized confocal laser scan microscope (CLM) in conjunction with fluorescein-labeled octreotate (OcF) in healthy mice and murine models of neuroendocrine tumors. For CLM a small rigid probe (diameter 7 mm) with an integrated single line laser (488 nm) was used (optical slice thickness 7 mu m; lateral resolution 0.7 mu m). OcF was synthesized via Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by HPLC showing high-affinity binding to the sstr2 (IC(50) 6.2 nmol). For in vitro evaluation, rat and human pancreatic cancer cells were used and characterized with respect to its sstr subtype expression and functional properties. For in vivo confocal imaging, healthy mouse pancreatic islet and renal tubular cells as well as immunoincompetent nude mice harboring sstr-expressing tumors were evaluated. Incubation of sstr-positive cells with OcF showed a specific time- and dose-dependent staining of sstr-positive cells. CLM showed rapid internalization and homogenous cytoplasmatic distribution. After systemic application to mice (n = 8), specific time-dependent internalization and cytoplasmatic distribution into pancreatic islet cells and tubular cells of the renal cortex was recorded. After injection in tumor-harboring nude mice (n = 8), sstr-positive cells selectively displayed a cell surface and cytoplasmatic staining. CLM-targeted biopsies detected sstr-positive tumor cells with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 100% as correlated with ex vivo immunohistochemistry. CLM with OcF permits real-time molecular, functional, and morphological imaging of sstr-expressing cell structures, allowing the specific visualization of pancreatic islet cells and neuroendocrine tumors in vivo.

This is accomplished through the design, administration and interpretation of neuropsychological tests, including those used in functional neuroimaging or cortical mapping and in intracarotid anesthetic procedures. The objective of this paper is to define and summarize in some detail the role and methods of neuropsychologists in specialized epilepsy centers. Included are information and recommendations regarding basic ingredients of a thorough neuropsychological assessment in the epilepsy setting, as well as suggestions for an abbreviated alternative exam when needed, with emphasis on functions associated with specific brain regions. The paper is intended for novice and experienced neuropsychologists to enable them to develop or evaluate their current practices, and also for other clinicians, who seek a better understanding of the methodology underlying the neuropsychological input to their work.

Modality of hyperalgesia tested, not type of nerve damage, predicts pharmacological sensitivity in rat models of neuropathic pain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Mechanism-based pain management; Chronic pain; Rat; Spinal nerve ligation; Chronic constriction injury	EXPERIMENTAL PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; CHRONIC CONSTRICTION INJURY; SPINAL-CORD; CUTANEOUS HYPERALGESIA; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; DYNAMIC COMPONENTS; SENSORY NEURONS; AMITRIPTYLINE; GABAPENTIN; MONONEUROPATHY	Although many types of nerve damage can cause neuropathic pain, there are substantial commonalities in neuropathic pain symptoms, and patients can be divided into sub-groups based on their symptom profile rather than etiology. Mechanism-based treatment suggests that pharmacotherapy should be chosen be based shared commonalities of symptoms rather than etiology. The aim of the present study was to determine whether type of injury (etiology) or behavioral endpoint (symptom) is a better predictor of pharmacological responsivity in the most commonly used rodent models of neuropathic pain. We used the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model to directly compare the temporal and pharmacological characteristics of four different types of evoked stimuli; heat, pressure, acetone cooling and punctate mechanical. We then compared heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia endpoints across etiologies using the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model. Evoked pain responses in both models had strikingly different temporal characteristics. We then tested three standard therapies for neuropathic pain from different drug classes, oxycodone, gabapentin, and amitriptyline. Notably, regardless of the model tested, or the time of onset, common endpoints showed near-identical pharmacological responses, and not all endpoints were equally sensitive to drug intervention within one model. Hypersensitivity to heat and pressure were highly responsive to oxycodone, gabapentin, and amitriptyline; whereas cold and mechanical allodynia were more difficult to reverse. Moreover, CCI- and SNL-induced mechanical allodynia was completely insensitive to amitriptyline treatment. We conclude that regardless of model and time course of presentation, different symptoms of peripheral neuropathy have unique pharmacological responses.

These pro-inflammatory signals are "turned-off" in a timely manner to ensure that the inflammatory response in the injured nerve is limited. The factors that regulate the turning-off of the pro-inflammatory state are not fully understood. The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are potential candidates that could limit the inflammatory response by acting to regulate cytokine signaling at the intracellular level. In this work we show that the expression SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins differ from each other during WD in the mouse sciatic nerve after cut/ligation and crush injuries. SOCS1 is mainly expressed by macrophages and its expression is inversely correlated with phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 signaling proteins and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. In addition, treatment of cut/ligated nerves, which express lower levels of SOCS1 as compared to crush injury, with a SOCS1 mimetic peptide leads to a decrease in macrophage numbers at 14 days post-injury and reduces IL-1 beta mRNA expression 1 day post-injury. In contrast, SOCS3 expression is restricted mainly to Schwann cells and is negatively correlated with the expression of IL-6 and LW. These data suggest that SOCS1 and SOCS3 may play different roles in WD and provide a better understanding of some of the potential regulatory mechanisms that may control inflammation and regeneration in the injured peripheral nerve.

Genes paralogous to PrP, called Doppel and Shadoo, have been identified, that also have neuropathological relevance. To aid in the further functional characterization of PrP and its relatives, we annotated completely the PrP gene family (PrP-GF), in the genomes of 42 vertebrates, through combined strategic application of gene prediction programs and advanced remote homology detection techniques (such as HMMs, PSI-TBLASTN and pGenThreader). We have uncovered several previously undescribed paralogous genes and pseudogenes. We find that current high-quality genomic evidence indicates that the PrP relative Doppel, was likely present in the last common ancestor of present-day Tetrapoda, but was lost in the bird lineage, since its divergence from reptiles. Using the new gene annotations. we have defined the consensus of structural features that are characteristic of the PrP and Doppel structures, across diverse Tetrapoda clades. Furthermore, we describe in detail a transcribed pseudogene derived from Shadoo that is conserved across primates, and that overlaps the meiosis gene, SYCE1, thus possibly regulating its expression. In addition, we analysed the locus of PRNP/PRND for significant conservation across the genomic DNA of eleven mammals, and determined the phylogenetic penetration of non-coding exons. The genomic evidence indicates that the second PRNP non-coding exon found in even-toed ungulates and rodents, is conserved in all high-coverage genome assemblies of primates (human, chimp, orang utan and macaque), and is, at least, likely to have fallen out of use during primate speciation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the PRNT gene (at the PRNP human locus) is conserved across at least sixteen mammals, and evolves like a long non-coding RNA, fashioned from fragments of ancient, long, interspersed elements. These annotations and evolutionary analyses will be of further use for functional characterisation of the PrP-GF, and will be updatable in a semi-automated fashion as more genomes accumulate.

In this study, we explored whether Neu1 would also desialylate the insulin receptors (IR), as well as the IGF-1R on rat skeletal L6 myoblasts, and whether desialylation of IR and IGF-1R would affect a net proliferative effect of insulin. First, we found that physiological (0.5-1 nM) and high therapeutic (10 nM) insulin concentrations induced a modest increase in proliferation rate of cultured L6 myoblasts. While IR kinase inhibitor could abolish the mitogenic effect of these insulin concentrations, the observed more pronounced proliferative response to supraphysiological concentration (100 nM) of insulin could be eliminated only by specific inhibition of IGF-1R. Then, we found that treatment of L6 cells with mouse-derived Neu1 or with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase caused desialylation of IR, which coincided with a significant increase of their proliferative response to lower (0.5-10 nM) concentrations of insulin. In contrast, experimental desialylation of IGF-1R coincided with elimination of the heightened proliferative response of L6 myoblasts to 100 nM insulin. Importantly, we also found that inhibition of endogenous Neu1 abolished the increase in proliferation of L6 cells induced by 1 and 10 nM of insulin, but amplified the proliferative effect of 100 nM insulin. We therefore conclude that desialylation of both IR and IGF-1R by Neu1 controls the net proliferative response of skeletal myoblasts to insulin.

A Nonlinear Model of the Neural Integrator Improves Detection of Deficits in the Human VOR	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Lesion detection; modeling; neural integrator (NI); vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)	VESTIBULO-OCULAR REFLEX; SLOW EYE-MOVEMENTS; OCULOMOTOR SYSTEM; PREPOSITUS-HYPOGLOSSI; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; NEURONS; CONTEXT; POSITION; GOLDFISH; NETWORK	A nonlinear model has been proposed to describe the set-point-dependent characteristics of the neural integrator (NI) in the oculomotor system. It was shown to yield improved prediction of slow-phase eye position in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) of normal subjects, when compared to the classical linear model of the NI. In this paper, we compare the parameters of this nonlinear NI model fitted to VOR data from: 1) compensated subjects diagnosed with vestibular deficiencies such as vestibular neuronitis and Meniere's disease and 2) normal (symptom-free) subjects. The identified models exhibit more severe nonlinearity in VOR patients than the normal controls. Several of the identified parameters in patients unmask asymmetries and more context dependence in the NI and in the VOR gain that are consistent with the lesioned side and could serve to support detection of lesions even after compensation.

In addition to cognitive and functional decline, diverse behavioral changes manifest with increasing severity over time, presenting significant management challenges for caregivers and health care professionals. Almost all patients with AD are affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms at some point during their illness; in some cases, symptoms occur prior to diagnosis of the dementia syndrome. Further, behavioral factors have been identified, which may have their origins in particular neurobiological processes, and respond to particular management strategies. Improved clarification of causes, triggers, and presentation of neuropsychiatric symptoms will guide both research and clinical decision-making. Measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD is most commonly by means of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; its utility and future development are discussed, as are the limitations and difficulties encountered when quantifying behavioral responses in clinical trials. Evidence from clinical trials of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and from neurobiological studies, provides a range of management options that can be tailored to individual needs. We suggest that non-pharmacological interventions (including psychosocial/psychological counseling, interpersonal management and environmental management) should be attempted first, followed by the least harmful medication for the shortest time possible. Pharmacological treatment options, such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, need careful consideration of the benefits and limitations of each drug class.

Brain Morphology in Autism and Fragile X Syndrome Correlates With Social IQ: First Report From the Canadian-Swiss-Egyptian Neurodevelopmental Study	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						autism; fragile X syndrome; magnetic resonance imaging; cerebral cortical thickness; medial prefrontal; anterior cingulate	CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; SPECTRUM DISORDER; CHILDHOOD AUTISM; BEHAVIOR PROFILE; YOUNG-CHILDREN; MRI; BOYS; MATURATION; PROTEIN	Fragile X syndrome shares most of the behavioral phenotypic similarities with autism. How are these similarities reflected in brain morphology? A total of 10 children with autism and 7 with fragile X underwent morphological (T1) 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The authors found no significant difference in total brain volumes, regional volumes, gyrification index, sulcul depth, and cerebral cortical thickness. However, children with autism showed significant decrease in the medial prefrontal bilaterally and the left anterior cingulate cortices. Regression analysis revealed positive correlation between the medial prefrontal cortical thickness and the social IQ. The authors suggest that the difference between the 2 groups in the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices thickness may entail an altered social cognitive style. Functional MRI studies directly differentiating between social indifference (autism) and social avoidance (fragile X) are needed to further characterize the spectrum of social abnormalities between these 2 groups.

Marshall			Pyrethroid Pediculicide Resistance of Head Lice in Canada Evaluated by Serial Invasive Signal Amplification Reaction	JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS MEDICINE AND SURGERY			English	Article							KNOCKDOWN RESISTANCE; CAPITIS; LOUSE; INSECTICIDES; CALIFORNIA; FLORIDA; ISRAEL	Background: Most people in the United States and Canada with pediculosis will be treated with neurotoxic pediculicides containing pyrethrins or pyrethroids. Their widespread use led to significant resistance reported from various countries. Although treatment failures are frequently observed in Canada, the resistance frequency to pyrethroid pediculicide of human head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) has not been determined. Objective: To determine the knockdown resistance (kdr) allele frequency in human head louse populations in Canada. Methods: Patients infested with Pediculus humanus capitis, aged 4 to 65 years, residents of Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia, were participants. Head lice were collected by combing and picking the enrolled subjects' hair. Lice were analyzed by serial invasive signal amplification reaction (SISAR) for genotyping the T917I mutation of lice indicating permethrin resistance. The permethrin-resistant kdr allele (R allele) frequency could then be evaluated in the head lice collected in Canada. Results: Of the head louse populations analyzed, 133 of 137 (97.1%) had a resistant (R) allele frequency, whereas only 4 of 137 (2.9%) had a susceptible (S) allele frequency. Conclusions: The 97.1% resistant (R) allele frequency in head lice from Canada could explain the treatment failures encountered with pyrethrin and pyrethroid pediculicide treatments in Canadian populations infested with Pediculus humanus capitis as the latter will not be eliminated by those pediculicides.

Large-brained mammals live longer	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Review						behavioural flexibility; brain evolution; cognitive buffer; lifespan; mammals; phenotypic plasticity; phylogenetic generalized linear model	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; AGING-RELATED MORTALITY; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SIZE EVOLUTION; BIRDS; PRIMATES; ENCEPHALIZATION; INTELLIGENCE; SOCIALITY; COGNITION	Many mammals have brains substantially larger than expected for their body size, but the reasons for this remain ambiguous. Enlarged brains are metabolically expensive and require elongated developmental periods, and so natural selection should have favoured their evolution only if they provide counterbalancing advantages. One possible advantage is facilitating the construction of behavioural responses to unusual, novel or complex socio-ecological challenges. This buffer effect should increase survival rates and favour a longer reproductive life, thereby compensating for the costs of delayed reproduction. Here, using a global database of 493 species, we provide evidence showing that mammals with enlarged brains (relative to their body size) live longer and have a longer reproductive lifespan. Our analysis supports and extends previous findings, accounting for the possible confounding effects of other life history traits, ecological and dietary factors, and phylogenetic autocorrelation. Thus, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that mammals counterbalance the costs of affording large brains with a longer reproductive life.

A novel liquid-liquid extraction and stable isotope dilution NCI-GC-MS method for quantitation of agmatine in postmortem brain cortex	JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article						agmatine; arginine; HFAA; polyamines; isopropanol; gas chromatography; negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry; suicide; depression	ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; GENE-EXPRESSION; POLYAMINES; NEUROTRANSMITTER	The group of biologically important amines includes putrescine, spermidine and spermine, as well as agmatine, which is a guanidino-amine. There is considerable evidence supporting a role of these amines in the etiology and pathology of mental disorders. We have previously developed a quantitative GC-MS method for simultaneous measurement of three major polyamines to support our studies linking polyamines to mental disorders. However, a unique GC-MS method is required for agmatine. To efficiently extract agmatine from postmortem brain tissues, we developed an isopropanol based liquid-liquid extraction protocol using potassium carbonate as a salting-out agent which showed a much greater recovery than n-butanol used in earlier methods. The GC-MS analysis employed hexafluoroacetylacetone as derivatization reagent and was carried out using negative chemical ionization with total ion and selected ion monitoring. (15)N(4)-Agmatine was synthesized from (15)N(4)-L-arginine and used as internal standard in a conventional stable isotope dilution assay.

J	Titone, D				Titone, Debra			Language, communication, & schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Language; Communication; Schizophrenia		The study of language and schizophrenia has a long history dating back to the earliest reports of the disorder. These early reports have been enriched, in recent years, by empirical, theoretical, and methodological advances in the psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience. The goals of this Special Issue are to sample from this rich literature, with the hope of advancing both neurolinguistic theory and ideas about flow to use this knowledge to improve the Communicative capacities of those diagnosed with schizophrenia. The areas of language studied, the methods used, and the research goals are diverse, although certainly not exhaustive. Nevertheless, for those unfamiliar with the way in which language and communication has been studied in schizophrenia, this Special Issue may serve as a useful introduction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Brain/behavior asymmetry in schizophrenia: A MEG study of cross-modal semantic priming	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Language; Schizophrenia; Semantic priming; MEG; Magnetoencephalography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FORMAL THOUGHT-DISORDER; LEXICAL DECISION TASK; TIME-COURSE; WORD PRONUNCIATION; ACTIVATION; METAANALYSIS; FREQUENCY; N400; ABNORMALITIES	Semantic priming has long been used to investigate how concepts and ideas are related at the level of language, and has become a convenient tool for assessing conceptual and semantic dysfunction in cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia. The study of semantic priming in schizophrenia has led to diverse results: enhanced priming, reduced priming, and priming equivalent to that found in nonpsychiatric comparison groups. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain some of the observed deficits in schizophrenia patients. For example, difficulties in word recognition may be due to hyperactivation of too many lexical representations or to a failure to inhibit lexical competitors. One way to distinguish between these possible explanations is to move beyond reliance on behavior alone and to examine the neural processes involved in lexical recognition. Here we present a magnetoencephalographic study of semantic priming in schizophrenia. Importantly, schizophrenia patients and healthy controls did not differ in performance on a priming task. We show that normal behavioral performance can occur in a context of aberrant neural responses. These findings suggest that normal behavioral responses in schizophrenia can be achieved through neural mechanisms that differ from those seen in the psychiatrically well brain.

J	Champagne-Lavau, M; Stip, E				Champagne-Lavau, Maud; Stip, Emmanuel			Pragmatic and executive dysfunction in schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Pragmatic; Non-literal language; Executive function; Theory of mind; Schizophrenia	RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; MIND; LANGUAGE; SYMPTOMATOLOGY; DEFICITS; PEOPLE; FMRI; IRONY; JOKES	Many studies have reported that patients with schizophrenia (SZ) can be impaired in their pragmatic abilities, typically affecting the processing of non-literal speech acts (e.g., metaphors. indirect requests). Various hypotheses have been proposed to account for impairments in understanding non-literal language, such as executive dysfunction or problems attributing mental states to others; the latter is referred to as theory of mind (ToM) abilities. The aim of this study was to explore whether pragmatic deficits do or do not coexist with ToM impairments and/or impairments of executive functions in schizophrenia. Twenty SZ patients and twenty matched healthy control (HC) participants - all right-handed and native French-speakers - were tested individually for three abilities: (a) pragmatic, (b) ToM (original first- and second-order mental state attribution tasks) and (c) executive functions. The main results showed that SZ patients exhibit pragmatic impairments which co-occurred with an executive dysfunction such as a lack of flexibility and a ToM deficit. Subsequent analyses of covariance suggested that ToM could play a role in pragmatic understanding while flexibility did not.

Four familial ALS pedigrees discordant for two SOD1 mutations: are all SOD1 mutations pathogenic?	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE MUTATION; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; D90A; GENE; ONSET; HOMOZYGOSITY	Background 153 mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene have been claimed to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in familial and sporadic ALS in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern with complete or reduced penetrance. The authors now report four ALS pedigrees from Finland, France, Germany and Sweden with either the D90A or E100K SOD1 mutations in some but not all affected members. After re-collecting DNA, the non-segregation of the SOD1 mutations with disease was confirmed by three independent laboratories using different PCR primers: while some of the affected patients carry SOD1 mutations, other affected family members have two wildtype/normal SOD1 genes. In addition, some unaffected members within the same families are carriers of SOD1 gene mutations. To exclude other known genetic causes, the authors ruled out mutations within the genes coding for VAPB, ANG, TDP43, FUS and DCTN1 in affected individuals in the four pedigrees. Conclusions The authors find that the D90A and E100K SOD1 gene mutations found in some patients are not the exclusive cause of ALS in these pedigrees. Whether this is also the case for the other 151 SOD1 mutations reported in ALS pedigrees is unknown. The findings have consequences for genetic testing in clinical practice when diagnosing ALS and for genetic counselling in ALS. Some SOD1 mutations may be part of an oligo-or epigentic pattern of inheritance. Such a pattern of inheritance may model other oligo- or polygenetic traits responsible for other forms of ALS.

Yet the question of whether this form of learning elicits changes detectable at the spinal cord level has not been addressed. To date, studies in humans have revealed that spinal reflex activity may be altered during the acquisition of various motor skills, but a link between motor sequence learning and changes in spinal excitability has not been demonstrated. To address this issue, we studied the modulation of H-reflex amplitude evoked in the flexor carpi radialis muscle of 14 healthy individuals between blocks of movements that involved the implicit acquisition of a sequence versus other movements that did not require learning. Each participant performed the task in three conditions: "sequence"-externally triggered, repeating and sequential movements, "random"-similar movements, but performed in an arbitrary order, and "simple"-involving alternating movements in a left-right or up-down direction only. When controlling for background muscular activity, H-reflex amplitude was significantly more reduced in the sequence (43.8 +/- 1.47%. mean +/- SE) compared with the random (38.2 +/- 1.60%) and simple (31.5 +/- 1.82%) conditions, while the M-response was not different across conditions. Furthermore, H-reflex changes were observed from the beginning of the learning process up to when subjects reached asymptotic performance on the motor task. Changes also persisted for >60 s after motor activity ceased. Such findings suggest that the excitability in some spinal reflex circuits is altered during the implicit learning process of a new motor sequence.

Independent epileptiform discharge patterns in the olfactory and limbic areas of the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain during 4-aminopyridine treatment. J Neurophysiol 103: 2728-2736, 2010. First published March 10, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00862.2009. In vitro studies performed on brain slices demonstrate that the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 mu M) discloses electrographic seizure activity and interictal discharges. These epileptiform patterns have been further analyzed here in a isolated whole guinea pig brain in vitro by using field potential recordings in olfactory and limbic structures. In 8 of 13 experiments runs of fast oscillatory activity (fast runs, FRs) in the piriform cortex (PC) propagated to the lateral entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus and occasionally to the medial EC. Early and late FRs were asynchronous in the hemispheres showed different duration [1.78 +/- 0.51 and 27.95 +/- 4.55 (SD) s, respectively], frequency of occurrence (1.82 +/- 0.49 and 34.16 +/- 6.03 s) and frequency content (20-40 vs. 40-60 Hz). Preictal spikes independent from the FRs appeared in the hippocampus/EC and developed into ictal-like discharges that did not propagate to the PC. Ictal-like activity consisted of fast activity with onset either in the hippocampus (n = 6) or in the mEC (n = 2), followed by irregular spiking and sequences of diffusely synchronous bursts. Perfusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (100 mu M) did not prevent FRs, increased the duration of limbic ictal-like discharges and favored their propagation to olfactory structures. The AMPA receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (50 mu M) blocked ictal-like events and reduced FRs. In conclusion, 4AP-induced epileptiform activities are asynchronous and independent in olfactory and hippocampal-entorhinal regions. Epileptiform discharges in the isolated guinea pig brain show different pharmacological properties compared with rodent in vitro slices.

Control of wrist position and muscle relaxation by shifting spatial frames of reference for motoneuronal recruitment: possible involvement of corticospinal pathways	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; STATIC SHOULDER POSITIONS; STEM RETICULAR-FORMATION; TRIPHASIC EMG PATTERN; LONG-LATENCY STRETCH; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOMOTOR EXCITABILITY; ARM MOVEMENTS; HAND MUSCLES; REACHING MOVEMENTS	It has previously been established that muscles become active in response to deviations from a threshold (referent) position of the body or its segments, and that intentional motor actions result from central shifts in the referent position. We tested the hypothesis that corticospinal pathways are involved in threshold position control during intentional changes in the wrist position in humans. Subjects moved the wrist from an initial extended to a final flexed position (and vice versa). Passive wrist muscle forces were compensated with a torque motor such that wrist muscle activity was equalized at the two positions. It appeared that motoneuronal excitability tested by brief muscle stretches was also similar at these positions. Responses to mechanical perturbations before and after movement showed that the wrist threshold position was reset when voluntary changes in the joint angle were made. Although the excitability of motoneurons was similar at the two positions, the same transcranial magnetic stimulus (TMS) elicited a wrist extensor jerk in the extension position and a flexor jerk in the flexion position. Extensor motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS at the wrist extension position were substantially bigger compared to those at the flexion position and vice versa for flexor MEPs. MEPs were substantially reduced when subjects fully relaxed wrist muscles and the wrist was held passively in each position. Results suggest that the corticospinal pathway, possibly with other descending pathways, participates in threshold position control, a process that pre-determines the spatial frame of reference in which the neuromuscular periphery is constrained to work. This control strategy would underlie not only intentional changes in the joint position, but also muscle relaxation. The notion that the motor cortex may control motor actions by shifting spatial frames of reference opens a new avenue in the analysis and understanding of brain function.

Some studies of major depressive disorder have linked episodic memory performance to treatment response. In this study, we sought to identify brain regions whose activity, measured during the encoding of pictures, predicted symptomatic improvement after 8 weeks of citalopram treatment. Methods: We included 20 unmedicated depressed patients. These patients performed an episodic recognition memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the encoding phase, 150 pictures depicting emotionally positive, negative or neutral content were presented, and the participants were required to classify each picture according to its emotional valence. The same 150 pictures were presented, along with 150 new ones, for a recognition task. We asked participants to distinguish the old pictures from the new ones. We assessed symptom severity by use of the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) at baseline and after 8 weeks of citalopram treatment. We performed subsequent memory effect analyses using SPM2 software. We explored the relation between brain activation during successful encoding of pictures and symptomatic improvement. Results: Patients showed a mean symptomatic improvement of 54.5% on the HAM-D after 8 weeks. Symptomatic improvement was significantly and positively correlated with picture recognition memory accuracy. We also found that the activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex during successful encoding was significantly correlated with symptomatic improvement. Finally, we found greater activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the successful encoding of positive pictures in comparison with neutral pictures. Limitations: During the recognition memory task, 5 participants T among the best responders to treatment) were not included in the valence-specific analyses because they had very few errors. A more challenging task would have allowed the inclusion of most patients. Conclusion: Different types of functional imaging paradigms have been used to explore whether the activity of specific brain regions measured at baseline is predictive of a better response to treatment in major depressive disorder. Among these regions, the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex usually show the strongest predictive valued According to our results, the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex could have an effect on treatment response in major depressive disorder by contributing to the successful encoding of positively valenced information.

SP-04 inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity both in vitro and in vivo, and induces a dose-dependent increase in Ach levels. SP-04 releases the metabolite 4-(4-ethyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1-(2,3,4-trihydroxy-phenyl)-butan-1-one (SP-04m). Both SP-04 and SP-04m are 1-receptor antagonists supporting their interest in relieving symptoms related to psychosis, a non-cognitive condition often associated with AD. SP-04m displays important antioxidant properties and both SP-04 and SP-04m offers neuroprotection against A 1 42 toxicity in various neuronal cell lines. In addition, both SP-04 and SP-04m protect neuronal cells and rat brain mitochondria exposed to various mitochondrial respiratory chain complex toxins. Taken together these data suggest that the SP-04 multi-targeting approach might offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.

Leptin regulates leukocyte recruitment into the brain following systemic LPS-induced inflammation	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						inflammation; neutrophils; cytokines; chemokines; sepsis	LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-INDUCED ANOREXIA; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RAT-BRAIN; INTERLEUKIN-1 RECEPTOR; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; HOST-DEFENSE; AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; CHRONIC NEURODEGENERATION; BARRIER PERMEABILITY	The appetite suppressing hormone leptin has emerged as an important modulator of immune function and is now considered to be a critical link between energy balance and host defense responses to pathogens. These 'adaptive' responses can, in situations of severe and sustained systemic inflammation, lead to adverse effects including brain damage that is partly mediated by neutrophil recruitment into the brain. We examined the contribution of leptin to this process in leptin-deficient (ob/ob), -resistant (db/db) and wild-type (WT) mice injected intraperitoneally with a septic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This treatment induced a dramatic increase in the number of neutrophils entering the brain of WT mice, an effect that was almost totally abolished in the mutant mice and correlated with a significant reduction in the mRNA levels of interleukin-1 beta, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and neutrophil-specific chemokines. These effects were reversed with leptin replenishment in ob/ob mice leading to recovery of neutrophil recruitment into the brain. Moreover, 48 h food deprivation in WT mice, which decreased circulating leptin levels, attenuated the LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment as did a single injection of an anti-leptin antiserum 4 h before LPS treatment in WT mice. These results provide the first demonstration that leptin has a critical role in leukocyte recruitment to the brain following severe systemic inflammation with possible implications for individuals with altered leptin levels such as during obesity or starvation.

We found that inactivating PKM zeta in the amygdala impaired fear memory in rats and that the extent of the impairment was positively correlated with a decrease in postsynaptic GluR2. Blocking the GluR2-dependent removal of postsynaptic AMPA receptors abolished the behavioral impairment caused by PKM zeta inhibition and the associated decrease in postsynaptic GluR2 expression, which correlated with performance. Similarly, blocking this pathway for removal of GluR2-containing receptors from postsynaptic sites in amygdala slices prevented the reversal of long-term potentiation caused by inactivating PKM zeta. Similar behavioral results were obtained in the hippocampus for unreinforced recognition memory of object location. Together, these findings indicate that PKM zeta maintains long-term memory by regulating the trafficking of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors, the postsynaptic expression of which directly predicts memory retention.

Syntax, concepts, and logic in the temporal dynamics of language comprehension: Evidence from event-related potentials	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Logical semantics; Event-related potentials; Negative Polarity Items (NPIs); LAN; N400; P600	CLOSED-CLASS WORDS; FILLER-GAP DEPENDENCIES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; SEMANTIC MEMORY; POSITIVE SHIFT; ERP; VIOLATIONS; PERSPECTIVE	Logic has been intertwined with the study of language and meaning since antiquity, and such connections persist in present day research in linguistic theory (formal semantics) and cognitive psychology (e.g., studies of human reasoning). However, few studies in cognitive neuroscience have addressed logical dimensions of sentence-level language processing, and none have directly compared these aspects of processing with syntax and lexical/conceptual-semantics. We used ERPs to examine a violation paradigm involving "Negative Polarity Items" or NPIs (e.g., ever/any), which are sensitive to logical/truth-conditional properties of the environments in which they occur (e.g., presence/absence of negation in: John hasn't ever been to Paris, versus: John has *ever been to Paris). Previous studies examining similar types of contrasts found a mix of effects on familiar ERP components (e.g., LAN, N400, P600). We argue that their experimental designs and/or analyses were incapable of separating which effects are connected to NPI-licensing violations proper. Our design enabled statistical analyses teasing apart genuine violation effects from independent effects tied solely to lexical/contextual factors. Here unlicensed NPIs elicited a late P600 followed in onset by a late left anterior negativity (or "L-LAN"), an ERP profile which has also appeared elsewhere in studies targeting logical semantics. Crucially, qualitatively distinct ERP-profiles emerged for syntactic and conceptual semantic violations which we also tested here. We discuss how these findings may be linked to previous findings in the ERP literature. Apart from methodological recommendations, we suggest that the study of logical semantics may aid advancing our understanding of the underlying neurocognitive etiology of ERP components.

Some mechanisms are directly attributable to the tumor; others lie with the therapy, be it surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Several animal models have been developed to study the pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to neuropathic pain. These include inflammation-based models, nerve trauma-induced models, and chemotherapy-induced models of neuropathic pain. My colleagues and I recently identified abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function in peripheral sensory fibers that are associated with neuropathic pain induced by common chemotherapeutic agents and that can be reversed by agents that enhance mitochondrial function. Our hope is that further identification and clarification of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved at the periphery will help us to develop new classes of medicines and treatment options.

Design: Prospective ancillary study of a multicenter randomized, controlled clinical trial. Setting: A Canadian university-affiliated pediatric intensive care unit in a level III trauma center. Patients: Patients <18 yrs with severe traumatic brain injury. Interventions: Holter recording during moderate hypothermia (HYPO group; esophageal temperature 32-33 degrees C) or normothermia (NORMO group; 36.5-37.5 degrees C) induced for 24 hrs started within 8 hrs after a severe traumatic brain injury. Measurements and Main Results: Sixteen patients who had a median age of 12.7 yrs (range, 7.2-17.0 yrs) were enrolled. The time from the injury to the start of the cooling process was 7.3 hrs (range, 6.6-7.8 hrs). The temperature when Holter recording began was 32.9 degrees C (range, 31.6-34.4 degrees C) in the HYPO group. Overall, 44% of all patients (seven of 16 patients) had arrhythmias (two of nine in the NORMO group and five of seven in the HYPO group, p = .13). The most frequent arrhythmias were isolated premature atrial contractions. Hypothermic patients had lower heart rates than normothermic patients (p = .01), but none had a severe bradycardia. In the NORMO group, one patient had accelerated junctional rhythm associated with hypotension. In the HYPO group, one patient had nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions: Arrhythmias are frequent in severe pediatric traumatic brain injury. Further studies are needed to characterize the epidemiology and clinical impact of arrhythmias associated with severe pediatric head trauma and moderate hypothermia.

We first remind that TSPDs consist in difficulties and peculiarities perceiving and integrating online the temporal and spatial characteritics of the incoming sensory events in the visual, auditory and proprioceptive modalities. Via the clinical manifestations exhibited by a baby at risk for autism, some self reports of autistic adults, and several experimental results, we show how the TSPDs might be central for the main behavioral, imitative, sensory-motor and cognitive disorders of at least some autistic persons. Then we present a new concept, the Multi-system Brain Disconnectivity-Dissynchrony (MBD), which represents the various degrees of under- or over- functional connectivity and hypo- or hyper-synchronization between numerous brain regions, and show that MBD might consitute the neurophysiological basis of TSPDs. We finally present the therapeutical applications and clinical perspectives that emerge from our approach, in particular via slowing down the environmental visual and auditory signals.

Investigating cognitive deficits and symptomatology across pre-morbid adjustment patterns in first-episode psychosis	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Cognition; first-episode psychosis; pre-morbid adjustment	NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; GENDER	Background. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are well established and are known to be present during the first episode of a psychotic disorder. In addition, consistent heterogeneity within these impairments remains unexplained. One potential source of variability may be the level of pre-morbid adjustment prior to the onset of first-episode psychosis (FED). Method. Ninety-four FED patients and 32 healthy controls were assessed at baseline on several neuropsychological tests comprising six cognitive domains (verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, processing speed, reasoning/problem-solving and attention) and an abbreviated version of the full IQ. A global neurocognitive domain was also computed. Pre-morbid adjustment patterns were divided into three distinct groups: stable-poor, stable-good and deteriorating course. Results. Based on a cut-off of 0.8 for effect size, the stable-poor pre-morbid adjustment group was significantly more impaired on most cognitive domains and full IQ compared to the deteriorating group, who were more severely impaired on all measures compared to the stable-good group. The type of cognitive deficit within each subgroup did not differ and the results indicate that a global neurocognition measure may reliably reflect the severity of cognitive impairment within each subgroup. Conclusions. Pre-morbid adjustment patterns prior to onset of psychosis are associated with severity but not type of cognitive impairment. Patients in the stable-poor group are generally more impaired compared to the deteriorating group, who are, in turn, more impaired than the stable-good group.

Attentional orienting toward social stress stimuli predicts increased cortisol responsivity to psychosocial stress irrespective of the early socioeconomic status	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Stress reactivity; Attentional bias; Glucocorticoids; Cortisol; Socioeconomic status	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SELF-ESTEEM; THREAT; REACTIVITY; SYSTEMS; MEMORY; BIASES; BRAIN	The principal aim of the study was to examine how the natural tendency to shift attention toward or away from social stress stimuli during a restful state, relates to the magnitude of cortisol elicited in response to a stressful context. It also assessed whether any relationship that did emerge between attentional biases and cortisol responsivity would be associated with the childhood socioeconomic status (SES). Twenty-five healthy normal controls rested for 45 min during which time they completed an adaptation of Posner's attentional orienting paradigm comprising social stress words as cues. Immediately following, participants were exposed to a public stressful speech task adapted from the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Results indicated that a rapid attentional engagement in the direction of social stress words prior to stress exposure related to a pronounced cortisol response to the stress task, while a slow attentional engagement toward social stress words was related to a weak cortisol response to the stress task. It was also found that fast engagers of social stress information displayed lower self-esteem than slow engagers. Groups did not differ in terms of their reported past SES. These findings demonstrate that attentional biases for social stress stimuli at rest predict the magnitude of cortisol likely to be elicited in response to a subsequent stressor. A natural tendency to rapidly shift attention toward social stress-related information may be the driving force behind cortisol reactivity when handling psychological forms of stress, independent of the early SES environment.

Circadian Variation of Sleep During the Follicular and Luteal Phases of the Menstrual Cycle	SLEEP			English	Article						Circadian rhythms; sleep; menstrual cycle; core body temperature; melatonin; ultra-rapid sleep-wake cycle	PREMENSTRUAL DYSPHORIC DISORDER; BODY-TEMPERATURE; THERMOSENSITIVE NEURONS; ORAL-CONTRACEPTIVES; BRIGHT LIGHT; RHYTHMS; WOMEN; DEPRIVATION; MELATONIN; PROGESTERONE	Study Objectives: Women experience insomnia more frequently than men. Menstrual cycle changes in reproductive hormones and circadian rhythms may contribute to sleep disruptions. Our aim, therefore, was to clarify the interaction between menstrual and circadian processes as it affects sleep. Design: Participants entered the laboratory during the mid-follicular (MF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle for an ultra-rapid sleep-wake cycle (URSW) procedure, consisting of 36 cycles of 60-min wake episodes alternating with 60-min nap opportunities. This procedure concluded with an ad libitum nap episode. Setting: Time-isolation suite. Participants: Eight unmedicated, physically and mentally healthy females with regular ovulatory menstrual cycles. Interventions: N/A Measurements: Polysomnographic sleep from nocturnal sleep episodes and 60-min naps; subjective alertness; core body temperature (CBT); salivary melatonin; urinary estradiol; and urinary progesterone. Results: Increased CBT values at night and decreased CBT amplitude were observed during ML compared to MF. Circadian phase of CBT and the circadian melatonin profile were unaffected by menstrual phase. All analyzed sleep parameters showed a circadian variation throughout the URSW procedure, with no menstrual phase differences observed for most, including slow wave sleep (SWS). The circadian variation of REM sleep duration, however, was sensitive to menstrual phase, with reduced REM sleep during ML at circadian phase 0 degrees and 30 degrees. Conclusions: Moderate but significant changes in REM sleep across the menstrual and circadian cycles were observed. These results support an interaction between circadian and menstrual processes in the regulation of REM sleep.

Given the high prevalence of stroke, the objective was to summarize the evidence regarding risk of crashes and traffic citations post stroke. Methods: A structured review of six databases was conducted to retrieve studies that included stroke as a separate exposure from other disorders and measured crashes or traffic citations as an outcome. Results: Four cohort and three case-control studies met the inclusion criteria. Five of the seven studies found increased odds or risk ratios ranging from 1.9 to 7.7, while two found an association of 0.8. Only one result was statistically significant (RR = 2.7). One study examined the outcome traffic citations and found no significant association. Conclusion: There is cause for concern regarding increased risk of crashes post stroke. Future studies that examine the impact of stroke severity and sequelae will help health professionals, families, and those with stroke make informed decisions regarding driving post stroke. This review indicates that drivers with stroke have an increased risk of crashing compared to their counterparts without stroke, as demonstrated by increased risk estimates in five out of the seven studies that have examined this issue. This review also points to an urgent need for rigorous studies investigating the risk of crashes according to specific stroke sequelae: an understanding of crash risk based on stroke severity, impairments, and function will assist clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the need for comprehensive driving evaluation and the potential for driver retraining for specific subgroups.

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK PREDICTION OF STREET TREE GROWTH PATTERNS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Classification prediction; Decision support systems; Multidimensional correspondence analysis; Multivariate linkage clustering; Radial basis functions; Street trees; Urban forestry; Urban tree growth modeling	YIELD PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; PERFORMANCE; VEGETATION; FORM	Municipal administrations annually allocate a large budget to preserve their urban trees. However, survival and growth rates of street trees vary drastically as they are strongly influenced by adverse environmental conditions. Consequently, arboricultural programs must be locally adapted to provide care to stressed trees. Artificial neural networks were used to identify poorly growing trees by learning from growth patterns detected by multivariate statistical analyses. Seven species that are representative of 75% of the Montreal street tree population were sampled: Acer platanoides L., Acer saccharinum. L., Celtis occidentalis L., Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh., Gleditsia triancanthos L., Tilia cordata Mill., and Ulmus pumila L. Individuals were of different age, dissimilar morphological characteristics, and had variable distribution among urban ecological zones. Radial basis function networks (RBFs) were selected as the model type. To assess RBFs robustness and predictive capability on unknown data, global and specific cluster classification was used. When global classification was estimated, the lowest accurate prediction value was 83% and the highest 93%. The average, value for all species taken together was 89%. Similarly, the classification success within groups per species was adequate. For most species, test files prediction accuracy ranged from 80% to almost 100%. This indicates that RBFs are well suited for classification decisions. These results have an impact on the management of street trees. Given the present findings, integrating robust predictive algorithms into data banks as a decision-support system is a conceivable avenue. Artificial-intelligence-based models might probably become important elements of efficient street tree management plans.

Following brain injury, the amputation of a limb, or the loss of a sensory input such as peripheral blindness, brain circuitry often seems to be able to reorganize itself in order to compensate for the handicap by being recruited to carry out tasks not associated with their prior 'default' functioning. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the brain's remarkable ability to adapt to changes in its environment, particularly when it is faced with a sensory loss. Two excellent models to study this phenomenon are provided by blind and deaf individuals. In both cases, studies have shown that they appear to compensate for the loss of sensory input with enhanced abilities in their remaining senses. These behavioral modifications are often coupled with changes in cerebral processing, generally in the form of crossmodal recruitment of deaffarented primary and secondary sensory areas. We will also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these changes and whether the functional topography of these regions present in unimpaired individuals is preserved in blindness and deafness. The notion of a critical period for plastic changes will also be discussed and its importance will be shown to be twofold. On the one hand, the functional relevance of crossmodal processing appears to decrease as a function of the age of onset of the deficiency. On the other hand, the more cortical reorganization takes place, the less likely brain areas will be able to process input from its original sensory modality. This is especially important for deaf individuals as auditory input can now be restored thanks to cochlear implants. (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

To determine the structure of polyglutamine aggregates we perform replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations coupled with the optimized potential for effective peptide forcefield. Using a range of temperatures from 250 to 700 K, we study the aggregation kinetics of the polyglutamine monomer and dimer with chain lengths from 30 to 50 residues. All monomers show a similar structural change at the same temperature from alpha-helical structure to random coil, without indication of any significant beta-strand. For dimers, by contrast, starting from random structures, we observe spontaneous formation of antiparallel beta-sheets and triangular and circular beta-helical structures for polyglutamine with 40 residues in a 400 ns 50 temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulation (total integrated time 20 mu s). This similar to 32 angstrom diameter structure reorganizes further into a tight antiparallel double-stranded similar to 22 angstrom nanotube with 22 residues per turn close to Perutz' model for amyloid fibers as water-filled nanotubes. This diversity of structures suggests the existence of polymorphism for polyglutamine with possibly different pathways leading to the formation of toxic oligomers and to fibrils.

Identification of Caspase-6-Mediated Processing of the Valosin Containing Protein (p97) in Alzheimer's Disease: A Novel Link to Dysfunction in Ubiquitin Proteasome System-Mediated Protein Degradation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; AAA-ATPASE; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; FUSION DEGRADATION; HUMAN NEURONS; D1 RING	The valosin-containing protein (p97) is a ubiquitin-dependent ATPase that plays central roles in ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)mediated protein degradation pathways. p97 has been recently identified as a putative substrate of active Caspase-6 (Casp6) in primary humanneurons. Since Casp6 is activated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brains, the targeting of p97 by Casp6 may represent an important step that leads to UPS impairment in AD. Here, we show that p97 is a Casp6 substrate in vitro and in vivo. Casp6 cleavage of recombinant p97 generated two N-terminal fragments of 28 and 20 kDa, which were not generated by the other two effector caspases, Caspase-3 and Caspase-7. ATP binding to the D1 ATPase ring of p97 reduced the susceptibility of the N-domain to caspase-mediated proteolysis. Mass spectrometric analysis identified VAPD(179) as a Casp6 cleavage site within p97's N-domain. An anti-neoepitope serum immunohistochemically detected p97 cleaved at VAPD(179) in the cytoplasm of the cell soma and neurites of hippocampal neurons in MCI and AD. Overexpression of p97 (1-179) fragment, representing p97 cleaved at D179, impaired the degradation of model substrates in the ubiquitin-fusion degradation and the N-end rule pathways, and destabilized endogenous p97. Collectively, these results show that p97 is cleaved by Casp6 in AD and suggest p97 cleavage as an important mechanism for UPS impairment.

Improved Discrimination of Visual Stimuli Following Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							THETA-BURST STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; NEURONAL RESPONSES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; WORKING-MEMORY; CHRONIC STROKE; PERCEPTION; RTMS; MECHANISMS	Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at certain frequencies increases thresholds for motor-evoked potentials and phosphenes following stimulation of cortex. Consequently rTMS is often assumed to introduce a "virtual lesion'' in stimulated brain regions, with correspondingly diminished behavioral performance. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we investigated the effects of rTMS to visual cortex on subjects' ability to perform visual psychophysical tasks. Contrary to expectations of a visual deficit, we find that rTMS often improves the discrimination of visual features. For coarse orientation tasks, discrimination of a static stimulus improved consistently following theta-burst stimulation of the occipital lobe. Using a reaction-time task, we found that these improvements occurred throughout the visual field and lasted beyond one hour post-rTMS. Low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation yielded similar improvements. In contrast, we did not find consistent effects of rTMS on performance in a fine orientation discrimination task. Conclusions/Significance: Overall our results suggest that rTMS generally improves or has no effect on visual acuity, with the nature of the effect depending on the type of stimulation and the task. We interpret our results in the context of an ideal-observer model of visual perception.

Vangl proteins are thought to assemble with other PCP proteins (Dvl, Pk) to form membrane-bound PCP signaling complexes that provide polarity information to the cell. In the present study, we show that Vangl I is expressed exclusively at the plasma membrane of transfected MDCK cells, where it is targeted to the basolateral membrane Experiments with an inserted exofacial HA epitope indicate that the segment delimited by the predicted transmembrane domains 1 and 2 is exposed to the extracellular milieu Comparative studies of the Lp-associated pathogenic mutation D255E indicate that the targeting of the mutant variant at the plasma membrane is greatly reduced; the mutant variant is predominantly retained intracellularly in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicles colocalizing with the ER marker calreticulin. In addition, the D255E variant shows drastically reduced stability with a half-life of similar to 2 h, compared to > 9 h for its wild type counterpart and is rapidly degraded in a proteasome-dependent and MG132 sensitive pathway. These (inclines highlight a critical role for D255 for normal folding and processing of Vangl proteins, with highly conservative substitutions not tolerated at that site. Our study provide an experimental framework for the analysis of human VANGL mutations recently identified in familial and sporadic cases of spina bifida.

Methods: A comprehensive cerebral palsy population-based registry (REPACQ) for a 4-year inclusive (1999-2002) birth cohort was systematically searched for all children with radiologic evidence for PVWMI/PVL. Clinical features, neurologic subtype, gross motor functional impairment, and comorbidities were compared in those children born preterm (<37 weeks) and those born at term (>= 37 weeks). Results: Of 242 children with cerebral palsy in the registry, 213 had available neuroimaging, in which 41 had PVWMI/PVL: 26 preterm born and 15 term born. Neurologic subtype differed significantly between preterm and term-born children with respect to the frequency of spastic hemiplegia (5/26 vs 8/15; p < 0.05) and spastic diplegia (9/26 vs 2/15; p < 0.05). The groups also differed significantly from a functional perspective (Gross Motor Function Classification System for Cerebral Palsy level I-II; 12/26 vs 12/15; p < 0.05). The comorbidity spectrum was similar between the 2 groups except for the occurrence of cortical blindness in the term-born children (3/15 vs 0/26; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Differences between preterm and term-born children with cerebral palsy with periventricular white matter injury (leukomalacia) suggest that despite a common radiologic pattern, these are different clinicopathologic entities with perhaps a different gestational timing of acquired injury.

We studied the gene encoding the synaptic protein SHANK3 in 285 controls and 185 schizophrenia patients with unaffected parents. Two de novo mutations (R1117X and R536W) were identified in two families, one being found in three affected brothers, suggesting germline mosaicism. Zebrafish and rat hippocampal neuron assays revealed behavior and differentiation defects resulting from the R1117X mutant. As mutations in SHANK3 were previously reported in autism, the occurrence of SHANK3 mutations in subjects with a schizophrenia phenotype suggests a molecular genetic link between these two neurodevelopmental disorders.

Moreover, although variation in human brain size is highly heritable, we do not know the extent to which genes contribute to individual differences in brain plasticity. In this longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study in twins, we report considerable thinning of the frontal cortex and thickening of the medial temporal cortex with increasing age and find this change to be heritable and partly related to cognitive ability. Specifically, adults with higher intelligence show attenuated cortical thinning and more pronounced cortical thickening over time than do subjects with average or below average IQ. Genes influencing variability in both intelligence and brain plasticity partly drive these associations. Thus, not only does the brain continue to change well into adulthood, these changes are functionally relevant because they are related to intelligence.	[Brans, Rachel G.

GSK3 beta Regulates Myelin-Dependent Axon Outgrowth Inhibition through CRMP4	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3; RESPONSE MEDIATOR PROTEINS; RHO-KINASE; GROWTH CONES; NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; NEURONAL POLARITY; BINDING-PROTEIN; SENSORY NEURONS; IN-VIVO; IDENTIFICATION	Myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs) contribute to failed regeneration in the CNS. The intracellular signaling pathways through which MAIs block axonal repair remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the kinase GSK3 beta is directly phosphorylated and inactivated by MAIs, consequently regulating protein-protein interactions that are critical for myelin-dependent inhibition. Inhibition of GSK3 beta mimics the neurite outgrowth inhibitory effect of myelin. The inhibitory effects of GSK3 beta inhibitors and myelin are not additive indicating that GSK3 beta is a major effector of MAIs. Consistent with this, overexpression of GSK3 beta attenuates myelin inhibition. MAI-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3 beta regulate phosphorylation of CRMP4, a cytosolic regulator of myelin inhibition, and its ability to complex with RhoA. Introduction of a CRMP4 antagonist attenuates the neurite outgrowth inhibitory properties of GSK3 beta inhibitors. We describe the first example of GSK3 beta inactivation in response to inhibitory ligands and link the neurite outgrowth inhibitory effects of GSK3 beta inhibition directly to CRMP4. These findings raise the possibility that GSK3 beta inhibition will not effectively promote long-distance CNS regeneration following trauma such as spinal cord injury.

A recent study challenges this view and claims the disorder might arise as a consequence of a general spatial-processing deficit. Here, we assessed spatial processing abilities in two independent samples of individuals with congenital amusia by using line bisection tasks (Experiment 1) and a mental rotation task (Experiment 2). Both amusics and controls showed the classical spatial effects on bisection performance and on mental rotation performance, and amusics and controls did not differ from each other. These results indicate that the neurocognitive impairment of congenital amusia does not affect the processing of space.

Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase Is a Critical Downstream Effector of the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 for Long-term Facilitation in Aplysia	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CAP-DEPENDENT TRANSLATION; MESSENGER-RNA TRANSLATION; INITIATION-FACTOR 4E; MAMMALIAN TARGET; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; SENSITIVE MANNER; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MEMORY STORAGE; RHEB BINDS	Long-term facilitation (LTF) in Aplysia is a leading cellular model for elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning. In Aplysia, LTF requires translational control downstream of the target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1). The major known downstream targets of TORC1 are 4E binding protein (4E-BP) and S6 kinase (S6K). By removing the site within these regulators required for their interaction with TORC1, we have generated dominant negative proteins that disrupt specific pathways downstream of TORC1. Expression of dominant negative S6K, but not dominant negative 4E-BP, in Aplysia sensory neurons (SNs) blocked 24-h LTF. TORC1 is directly activated by the small GTP-binding protein, Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb). To determine the effects of TORC1 activation on translation in Aplysia neurons, we have examined the effects of expressing a constitutively active form of the Aplysia orthologue of Rheb, ApRheb (ApRheb(Q63L)). Expression of ApRheb(Q63L) increased 4E-BP phosphorylation and the level of general, cap-dependent translation within the SN cell soma in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. This increase in cap-dependent translation was blocked neither by dominant negative 4E-BP nor dominant negative S6K. Thus, we demonstrate that S6K is an important downstream target of TORC1 in Aplysia and that it is necessary for 24-h LTF, but not for TORC1-mediated increases in somatic cap-dependent translation.

Comparison of Usefulness of N-Terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide as an Independent Predictor of Cardiac Function Among Admission Cardiac Serum Biomarkers in Patients With Anterior Wall Versus Nonanterior Wall ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CREATININE CLEARANCE; CONTRAST; ENHANCEMENT; EXTENT; TRIAL; MRI	The purpose of the present study was to determine the prognostic value of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), among other serum biomarkers, on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging parameters of cardiac function and infarct size in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We measured NT-pro-BNP, cardiac troponin T, creatinine kinase-MB fraction, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and creatinine on the patients' arrival at the catheterization laboratory in 206 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The NT-pro-BNP levels were divided into quartiles and correlated with left ventricular function and infarct size measured by CMR imaging at 4 to 6 months. Compared to the lower quartiles, patients with nonanterior wall myocardial infarction in the highest quartile of NT-pro-BNP (>= 260 pg/ml) more often had a greater left ventricular end-systolic volume (68 vs 39 ml/m(2), p <0.001), a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (42% vs 54%, p <0.001), a larger infarct size (9 vs 4 g/m(2), p = 0.002), and a larger number of transmural segments (11% of segments vs 3% of segments, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that a NT-pro-BNP level of >= 260 pg/ml was the strongest independent predictor of left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with nonanterior wall myocardial infarction compared to the other serum biomarkers (beta = 5.8; p = 0.019). In conclusion, in patients with nonanterior wall myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, an admission NT-pro-BNP level of >= 260 pg/ml was a strong, independent predictor of left ventricular function assessed by CMR imaging at follow-up. Our findings suggest that NT-pro-BNP, a widely available biomarker, might be helpful in the early risk stratification of patients with nonanterior wall myocardial infarction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Determinants of delays in treatment initiation in children and adolescents diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma in Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						children; cancer; diagnosis; treatment; delay; prognostic factors; epidemiology	PEDIATRIC BRAIN-TUMORS; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; SYMPTOM ONSET; INTERVAL	Minimizing delays that may occur along the cancer care pathway requires an understanding of their determinants. Few studies on childhood cancers have been published on the factors that influence the time it takes for patients to get a first medical consultation (patient delay) and treatment (health care system [HCS] delay) once cancer symptoms have been recognized. Our objective was to assess factors related to disease, patient and HCS on patient and HCS delay for children and adolescents with leukemias and lymphomas in Canada. A prospective cohort study was conducted on subjects enrolled in the Treatment and Outcomes Surveillance program of the Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control Program, a national surveillance program. We studied 963 leukemia and 397 lymphoma patients who were less than 19-years old at diagnosis in 1995-2000. Logistic regression models were used to measure the associations between candidate predictive factors and delays. Age was positively associated with patient delay for both leukemia and lymphoma patients, but not with HCS delay. Patients first seen in a hospital emergency room had a lower risk of HCS delay than patients first seen by a general practitioner. Cancer subtype was associated with patient delay for leukemia patients, and HCS delay for lymphoma patients. Longer patient delay was associated with a lower risk of long HCS delay for both cancers. Factors related to the patients, their disease and the HCS may exert different influences on varying segments of the care pathway of leukemia and lymphoma patients.

Quantification of signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles in FACS-isolated CD31 hi cells, which correspond closely to CD4 recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), indicates that young patients have reduced generation of CD4 RTEs compared to age-matched controls. In RRMS, compared to controls, CXCR4 analyses indicate age-associated thymic output of progressively immature CD4 RTEs, and Ki-67 data demonstrate altered T-cell proliferative responses that fail to maintain naive CD4 T-cell numbers with age. Thus. RRMS patients have early thymic involution with compensatory homeostatic peripheral T-cell proliferative responses that may predispose patients to autoreactivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

LSFC Consortium	LRPPRC and SLIRP Interact in a Ribonucleoprotein Complex That Regulates Posttranscriptional Gene Expression in Mitochondria	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL			English	Article							CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; MESSENGER-RNA; LEIGH-SYNDROME; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; TRANSLATIONAL ACTIVATOR; BINDING-PROTEIN; COX DEFICIENCY; DOMAIN; STABILITY; MULTIPLE	Mutations in LRPPRC are responsible for the French Canadian variant of Leigh syndrome (LSFC), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a tissue-specific deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase ( COX). To investigate the pathogenic mechanism of disease, we studied LRPPRC function in LSFC and control fibroblasts. The level of mutated LRPPRC is reduced in LSFC cells, and this results in decreased steady-state levels of most mitochondrial mRNAs, but not rRNAs or tRNAs, a phenotype that can be reproduced by siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRPPRC in control cells. Processing of the primary transcripts appears normal. The resultant defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis in LSFC cells disproportionately affects the COX subunits, leading to an isolated COX assembly defect. Further knockdown of LRPPRC produces a generalized assembly defect in all oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits, due to a severe decrease in all mitochondrial mRNAs. LRPPRC exists in a high-molecular-weight complex, and it coimmunoprecipitates with SLIRP, a stem-loop RNA-binding protein. Although this interaction does not depend on mitochondrial mRNA, both proteins show reduced stability in its absence. These results implicate LRPPRC in posttranscriptional mitochondrial gene expression as part of a ribonucleoprotein complex that regulates the stability and handling of mature mRNAs.

BOLD signal responses to controlled hypercapnia in human spinal cord	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VOLUME-WEIGHTED FMRI; GRADIENT-ECHO FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; TO-NOISE; 3 TESLA; SPATIAL LOCALIZATION	Functional MRI of the spinal cord is challenging due to the small cross section of the cord and high level of physiological noise. Though blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has been used to study specific responses of the spinal cord to various stimuli, it has not been demonstrated using a controlled stimulus. In this paper, we use hypercapnic manipulation to study the sensitivity and specificity of functional MRI in the human cervical spinal cord. Simultaneous MR imaging in the brain and spinal cord was performed for direct comparison with the brain, in which responses to hypercapnia have been more extensively characterized. Original contributions include: (i) prospectively controlled hypercapnic changes in end-tidal PCO2 (ii) simultaneous recording of BOLD responses in the brain and spinal cord, and (iii) generation of statistical maps of BOLD responses throughout the brain and spinal cord, taking into account physiological noise sources. Results showed significant responses in all subjects both in the brain and the spinal cord. In anatomically-defined regions of interest, mean percent changes were 0.6% in the spinal cord and 1% in the brain. Analysis of residual variance demonstrated significantly larger contribution of physiological noise in the spinal cord (P<0.005). To obtain more reliable results from fMRI in the spinal cord, it will be necessary to improve sensitivity through the use of highly parallelized coil arrays and better modeling of physiological noise. Finely, we believe that the use of controlled global stimuli, such as hypercapnia, will help assess the effectiveness of new acquisition techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Glial cells, the resident immune cells of the CNS, respond to tissue injury by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and free radicals such as nitric oxide. We explored the possibility that neuroimmune responses are involved in parasitic manipulation of host behavior in a trematode-crustacean association. The cerebral larva of the flatworm Microphallus papillorobustus alters responses to environmental stimuli - and thus reflex pathways - in the crustacean Gammarus insensibilis, in a way that enhances predation of the crustacean by birds, definitive hosts of the parasite. Results: Immunocytochemical experiments followed by confocal microscopy were performed to study the distribution of glutamine synthetase, a glial cell marker, and nitric oxide synthase in the brain of gammarids. Astrocytelike glia and their processes were abundant at the surface of the parasites while levels of nitric oxide synthase were elevated at the host-parasite interface in the brain of gammarids harboring mature cerebral larvae and demonstrating altered behavior. Conclusion: Taken together these results lend support to the neuroinflammation hypothesis whereby a chronic CNS specific immune response induced by the parasite plays a role in the disruption of neuromodulation, neuronal integrity, and behavior in infected hosts.

We examined changes to somatosensory function that occur in conjunction with motor learning. We found that even after periods of training as brief as 10 min, sensed limb position was altered and the perceptual change persisted for 24 h. The perceptual change was reflected in subsequent movements; limb movements following learning deviated from the prelearning trajectory by an amount that was not different in magnitude and in the same direction as the perceptual shift. Crucially, the perceptual change was dependent upon motor learning. When the limb was displaced passively such that subjects experienced similar kinematics but without learning, no sensory change was observed. The findings indicate that motor learning affects not only motor areas of the brain but changes sensory function as well.	[Ostry, David J.; Darainy, Mohammad; Mattar, Andrew A.

However, vascular risk factors, especially hypertension and high cholesterol, are not managed optimally even in those patients seen in specialized clinics. This gap between the evidence for secondary prevention of stroke and the clinical reality leads to suboptimal patient outcomes. In this study, we will be testing a pharmacist case manager for delivery of stroke prevention services. We hypothesize this new structure will improve processes of care which in turn should lead to improved outcomes. Methods: We will conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled open-label with blinded ascertainment of outcomes (PROBE) trial. Treatment allocation will be concealed from the study personnel, and all outcomes will be collected in an independent and blinded manner by observers who have not been involved in the patient's clinical care or trial participation and who are masked to baseline measurements. Patients will be randomized to control or a pharmacist case manager treating vascular risk factors to guideline-recommended target levels. Eligible patients will include all adult patients seen at stroke prevention clinics in Edmonton, Alberta after an ischemic stroke or TIA who have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) > 140 mm Hg) or dyslipidemia (fasting LDL-cholesterol > 2.00 mmol/L) and who are not cognitively impaired or institutionalized. The primary outcome will be the proportion of subjects who attain 'optimal BP and lipid control'(defined as systolic BP < 140 mm Hg and fasting LDL cholesterol < 2.0 mmol/L) at six months compared to baseline; 12-month data will also be collected for analyses of sustainability of any effects. A variety of secondary outcomes related to vascular risk and health-related quality of life will also be collected. Conclusions: Nearly one-quarter of those who survive a TIA or minor stroke suffer another vascular event within a year. If our intervention improves the provision of secondary prevention therapies in these patients, the clinical (and financial) implications will be enormous.

Bi- or multifunctional opioid peptide drugs	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Review						Bifunctional drugs; Mixed agonist/antagonists; Opioid analgesics; Opioid tolerance and dependence	MU-AGONIST/DELTA-ANTAGONIST; NEUROKININ-1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; LINKED BIFUNCTIONAL PEPTIDES; DESIGNED MULTIPLE LIGAND; DMT-TIC PHARMACOPHORE; MORPHINE-TOLERANCE; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; PHYSICAL-DEPENDENCE; DELTA-ANTAGONIST; IN-VIVO	Strategies for the design of bi- or multifunctional drugs are reviewed. A distinction is made between bifunctional drugs interacting in a monovalent fashion with two targets and ligands containing two distinct pharmacophores binding in a bivalent mode to the two binding sites in a receptor heterodimer. Arguments are presented to indicate that some of the so-called "bivalent" ligands reported in the literature are unlikely to simultaneously interact with two binding sites. Aspects related to the development of bi- or multifunctional drugs are illustrated with examples from the field of opioid analgesics. The drug-like properties of the tetrapeptide Dmt(1)[DALDA] with triple action as a p opioid agonist, norepinephrine uptake inhibitor and releaser of endogenous opioid peptides to produce potent spinal analgesia are reviewed. Rationales for the development of opioid peptides with mixed agonist/antagonist profiles as analgesics with reduced side effects are presented. Progress in the development of mixed p opioid agonist/delta opioid antagonists with low propensity to produce tolerance and physical dependence is reviewed. Efforts to develop bifunctional peptides containing a p opioid agonist and a cholecystokinin antagonist or an NK1 receptor antagonist as analgesics expected to produce less tolerance and dependence are also reviewed. A strategy to improve the drug-like properties of bifunctional opioid peptide analgesics is presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CDF Collaboration	Search for the Higgs Boson Using Neural Networks in Events with Missing Energy and b-Quark Jets in p(p)over-bar Collisions at root s=1.96 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							STANDARD MODEL	We report on a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a W or Z boson in p (p) over bar collisions at root s = 1.96 TeV recorded by the CDF II experiment at the Tevatron in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb(-1). We consider events which have no identified charged leptons, an imbalance in transverse momentum, and two or three jets where at least one jet is consistent with originating from the decay of a b hadron. We find good agreement between data and background predictions. We place 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section for several Higgs boson masses ranging from 110 GeV/c(2) to 150 GeV/c(2). For a mass of 115 GeV/c(2) the observed (expected) limit is 6.9 (5.6) times the standard model prediction.

Both agents killed cancer cell lines in vitro with similar IC(50) values and with apparently similar cytotoxic mechanisms as unconjugated doxorubicin and etoposide. 2 and 3 exhibited dramatically higher BBB influx rate constants than unconjugated doxorubicin and etoposide and pooled within brain parenchymal tissue. Passage through the BBB was similar in Mdr1a (-/-) and wild type mice. These results provide further evidence of the potential of this drug development platform in the isolation of novel therapeutics with increased brain penetration.

FXTAS is characterized by action tremor, gait ataxia and impaired executive cognitive functioning. It has been proposed that FXTAS is caused by titration of RNA-binding proteins by the expanded CGG repeats. Sam68 is an RNA-binding protein involved in alternative splicing regulation and its ablation in mouse leads to motor coordination defects. Here, we report that mRNAs containing expanded CGG repeats form large and dynamic intranuclear RNA aggregates that recruit several RNA-binding proteins sequentially, first Sam68, then hnRNP-G and MBNL1. Importantly, Sam68 is sequestered by expanded CGG repeats and thereby loses its splicing-regulatory function. Consequently, Sam68-responsive splicing is altered in FXTAS patients. Finally, we found that regulation of Sam68 tyrosine phosphorylation modulates its localization within CGG aggregates and that tautomycin prevents both Sam68 and CGG RNA aggregate formation. Overall, these data support an RNA gain-of-function mechanism for FXTAS neuropathology, and suggest possible target routes for treatment options.

Enhancement in performance on declarative memory tasks has been associated with early NonREM sleep, consisting of the highest percentage of slow-wave sleep. Twenty-four subjects (eight short sleepers <= 7 h, nine average >7 but <9 h, seven long >= 9 h)were tested. Subjects were presented with unfamiliar face stimuli and asked to memorize them for a subsequent test. Following sleep, the subjects were presented with the 40 "old/studied" items intermixed with 40 new and asked to indicate the previously presented stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed to verify the existence of the "Old/New" effect, i.e. amplitude difference [in ERPs] between the old and new stimuli. ANOVA on the scores revealed a significant interaction between the stimuli and group. Post-hoc test on the studied items revealed more accurate responses in the short sleepers compared to the average and long sleepers. Strikingly, the long sleepers failed to show significant retention of the old/studied items, with their recognition of old faces not different from chance. Reaction time (RT) responses were faster for the old vs. the new items. Pearson correlation revealed a significant negative correlation between accuracy and sleep duration in the short sleepers. However, long and average sleepers showed a positive correlation between the two variables. ANOVA performed on the ERPs revealed main effects of stimuli and site, and no interactions involving the group factor. In conclusion, our data show that individual differences in recognition memory performance may be associated with differences in habitual sleep duration.

That study focused on multilingual elderly patients of whom 90% were immigrants. Our memory clinic, in Montreal Canada, has the advantage of having a large set of individuals who are either multilingual immigrants to Canada, or who are nonimmigrants but raised in both official languages of Canada French and English. We thus attempted to replicate the above findings using a larger cohort in a different setting. We examined age at diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and age at symptom onset for all unilingual versus multilingual participants, and then for those who were nonimmigrant English/French bilinguals. Overall, we found a small but significant protective effect of more than 2 languages spoken, but we found no significant benefit in bilinguals overall in relation to age at diagnosis or age at symptom onset. However, in the immigrant group, the results mirrored those of Bialystok et al with 2 or more languages delaying the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease by almost 5 years. A trend toward the same effect was also seen in nonimmigrants whose first language was French. In contrast, in nonimmigrants whose first language was English, no such effect was found. These results are discussed in relation to the earlier findings and the theory of cognitive reserve.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), choline, and riboflavin play distinct roles in homocysteine detoxification and generation of one-carbon donors for methylation. The effect of low dietary choline and riboflavin on pregnancy complications and heart development has not been adequately addressed. Objective: Our goal was to determine whether dietary deficiencies of choline and riboflavin in pregnant mice, with and without mild MTHFR deficiency, affect embryonic development. Design: Female Mthfr(+/+) and Mthfr(+/-) mice were fed a control diet (CD), a choline-deficient diet (ChDD), or a riboflavin-deficient diet (RbDD) and were then mated with male Mthfr(+/-) mice. Embryos were collected 14.5 d postcoitum and examined for reproductive outcomes and cardiac defects. Results: Plasma homocysteine was higher in ChDD-than in CD-fed females. Liver MTHFR enzyme activity was greater in ChDD-fed Mthfr(+/+) than in CD-fed Mthfr(+/+) females. The RbDD resulted in a higher percentage of delayed embryos and smaller embryos than did the CD. There were more heart defects, which were all ventricular septal defects, in embryos from the ChDD- and RbDD-fed females than from the CD-fed females. Dietary riboflavin and MTHFR deficiency resulted in decreased left ventricular wall thickness in embryonic hearts compared with embryos from CD-fed Mthfr(+/+) females. Conclusions: Low dietary choline and riboflavin affect embryonic growth and cardiac development in mice. Adequate choline and riboflavin may also play a role in the prevention of these pregnancy complications in women. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;91:1035-43.

We recently characterized the haplotype structure of the SAT1 promoter region and identified an insertion/deletion (in/del) of 15 adenine residues. This variant appears to be a predictor of SAT1 expression, and we were thus interested in determining if the lower expressing deletion allele was found more frequently among suicide completers. To this end, we genotyped the in/del in a sample of 771 French-Canadian males, comprising 326 suicide completers and 445 non-suicide controls. We found no significant difference in the frequencies of the two alleles between suicide completers and controls in the entire sample. However, we observed a significantly higher frequency of the deletion in the depressed suicide completers compared to the depressed non-suicides. These results add support for a role of SAT1 in conferring a risk for suicide completion, in particular in the context of depressive disorders. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Abnormal B-Cell Cytokine Responses A Trigger of T-Cell Mediated Disease in MS?	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; REMITTING MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; EXPANDED PLASMA-CELLS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; GLATIRAMER ACETATE; RITUXIMAB; ACTIVATION; INFECTIONS; ANTIBODIES; ARTHRITIS	Objective: To study antibody-independent contributions of B cells to inflammatory disease activity, and the immune consequences of B-cell depletion with rituximab, in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: B-Cell effector-cytokine responses were compared between MS patients and matched controls using a 3-signal model of activation. The effects of B-cell depletion on Th1/Th17 CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in MS patients were assessed both ex vivo and in vivo, together with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies as part of 2 rituximab clinical trials in relapsing-remitting MS. Results: B Cells of MS patients exhibited aberrant proinflammatory cytokine responses, including increased lymphotoxin (LT):interleukin-10 ratios and exaggerated LT and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion, when activated in the context of the pathogen-associated TLR9-ligand CpG-DNA, or the Th1 cytokine interferon-gamma, respectively. B-Cell depletion, both ex vivo and in vivo, resulted in significantly diminished proinflammatory (Th1 and Th17) responses of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Soluble products from activated B cells of untreated MS patients reconstituted the diminished T-cell responses observed following in vivo B-cell depletion in the same patients, and this effect appeared to be largely mediated by B-cell LT and TNF alpha. Interpretation: We propose that episodic triggering of abnormal B-cell cytokine responses mediates 'bystander activation' of disease-relevant proinflammatory T cells, resulting in new relapsing MS disease activity. Our findings point to a plausible mechanism for the long-recognized association between infections and new MS relapses, and provide novel insights into B-cell roles in both health and disease, and into mechanisms contributing to therapeutic effects of B-cell depletion in human autoimmune diseases, including MS.

Neuro-optimal operation of a variable air volume HVAC&R system	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						Neural network; Optimal control; HVAC&R systems; Vapor compression refrigeration chiller; VAV system; Energy efficiency; Optimal set points	OPTIMIZATION	Low operational efficiency especially under partial load conditions and poor control are some reasons for high energy consumption of heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) systems. To improve energy efficiency, HVAC&R systems should be efficiently operated to maintain a desired indoor environment under dynamic ambient and indoor conditions. This study proposes a neural network based optimal supervisory operation strategy to find the optimal set points for chilled water supply temperature, discharge air temperature and VAV system fan static pressure such that the indoor environment is maintained with the least chiller and fan energy consumption. To achieve this objective, a dynamic system model is developed first to simulate the system behavior under different control schemes and operating conditions. A multi-layer feed forward neural network is constructed and trained in unsupervised mode to minimize the cost function which is comprised of overall energy cost and penalty cost when one or more constraints are violated. After training, the network is implemented as a supervisory controller to compute the optimal settings for the system. Simulation results show that compared to the conventional night reset operation scheme, the optimal operation scheme saves around 10% energy under full load condition and 19% energy under partial load conditions.

A Cohort Study of Diagnostic Features and Clinical Boundaries	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PRIMARY-PROGRESSIVE-APHASIA; FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; SELECTIVE IMPAIRMENT; 3 VARIANTS; PATHOLOGY; MEMORY; FLUENT; EVOLUTION; ALZHEIMER; KNOWLEDGE	Objectives: To describe a large, clinically defined cohort of patients with semantic dementia (SD) that highlights important, sometimes overlooked features and to compare it with similar entities. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A cognitive neurology clinic. Patients: A population of 48 patients clinically diagnosed with SD was contrasted with 52 patients with progressive nonfluent aphasia, 42 patients with a behavioral variety of frontotemporal dementia, and 105 patients with Alzheimer disease on speech output characteristics, comprehension, naming, and repetition subtests of the Western Aphasia Battery, the Frontal Behavioral Inventory, and other cognitive tests. Neuroimaging was visually analyzed, and 6 patients with SD had autopsy. Results: Of 37 patients with probable SD, 48.6% had semantic jargon; 21.6%, excessive garrulous output; and 75.7%, some pragmatic disturbance. Semantic substitutions were frequent in SD (54.1%) but phonological errors were absent, in contrast to progressive nonfluent aphasia with the opposite pattern. All but 3 patients with probable SD questioned the meaning of words. Patients with SD had significantly lower naming and comprehension scores, and their fluency was between progressive nonfluent aphasia and Alzheimer disease or behavioral frontotemporal dementia. Behavior was abnormal in 94.6% of patients with probable SD. Conclusions: Semantic dementia is distinguishable from other presentations of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease, not only by fluent speech and impaired comprehension without loss of episodic memory, syntax, and phonology but also by empty, garrulous speech with thematic perseverations, semantic paraphasias, and poor category fluency. Questioning the meaning of words (eg, "What is steak?") is an important diagnostic clue not seen in other groups, and behavior change is prevalent.

Sound naming in neurodegenerative disease	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Corticobasal degeneration; Progressive supranuclear palsy; Motor disorder; Sound naming; Manipulability	PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; CORTICOBASAL DEGENERATION; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; OBJECT RECOGNITION; IDEOMOTOR APRAXIA; WORD-CLASS; DISORDERS	Modern cognitive neuroscientific theories and empirical evidence suggest that brain structures involved in movement may be related to action-related semantic knowledge. To test this hypothesis, we examined the naming of environmental sounds in patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), two neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive and motor deficits. Subjects were presented with 56 environmental sounds: 28 Sounds were of objects that required manipulation when producing the sound, and 28 sounds were of objects that required no manipulation. Subjects were asked to provide the name of the object that produced tire Sound and also complete a sound-picture matching condition. Subjects included 33 individuals from four groups: CBD/PSP, Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, and normal controls. We hypothesized that CBD/PSP patients would exhibit impaired naming performance compared with controls, but the impairment would be most apparent when naming sounds associated with actions. We also explored neural correlates of naming environmental sounds using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of brain MRI. As expected, CBD/PSP patients scored lower on environmental sounds naming (p < 0.007) compared with the controls. In particular, the CBD/PSP patients scored the lowest when naming sounds of manipulable objects (p < 0.05), but did not show deficits in naming sounds of non-manipulable objects. VBM analysis across all groups showed that performance in naming sounds of manipulable objects correlated with atrophy in the left pre-motor region, extending from area six to the middle and Superior frontal gyros. These results indicate an association between impairment in the retrieval of action-related names and the motor system, and suggest that difficulty in naming manipulable sounds may be related to atrophy in the pre-motor cortex. Our results support the hypothesis that retrieval of action-related semantic knowledge involves motor regions in the brain. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hence, the present study had two objectives. One was to determine the extent to which the Visual Processing of emotions and objects differs in PD. The other was to assess the impact of cognitive load on the processing of these types of information. Thirty-one patients with idiopathic PD (IPD) under dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) were compared to 30 control subjects on emotion and object recognition tasks. Recognition of objects was more accurate and faster than recognition of facial expressions of emotion, for both groups of subjects. In a second experiment using an N-back procedure with the same stimuli-a more demanding task with a higher cognitive load-patients with IPD were as accurate as control subjects in detecting the correct sequential presentation of stimuli, but were much slower in their decision responses. This indicates that IPD patients under DRT are not impaired in encoding emotion or object information, but that they have difficulty with the processing demands of the N-back task. Thus, patients with IPD appear to be more sensitive to cognitive load than to type of information, whether facial emotions or objects. In this perspective, one must consider that a deafferented dopaminergic system has problems processing more complex information before one can posit the existence of deficits affecting a specific type of information.

However, the effectiveness of RSI has been questioned, and the technique may lead to airway and hemodynamic complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of RSI use in patients with acute appendicitis, the types of drugs administered, and the occurrence of any complications. After approval by the Ethics Committee, the charts of patients undergoing appendectomy in a one-year period were examined retrospectively. Information was retrieved on Mallampati airway evaluation, airway device used, preoxygenation, RSI, and drugs at induction. Reported complications were noted, including airway difficulties, hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) and hypertension (> 160 mmHg) in the 20-min period after induction. General anesthesia with tracheal intubation was used in 248 of 250 cases reviewed. The Mallampati airway evaluation, preoxygenation, and RSI were recorded as performed in 95, 94, and 81% of cases, respectively. Opioids, propofol, and neuromuscular blocking agents were given in 98, 98, and 99% of patients, respectively. Succinylcholine use was common (80%), with 96% of these patients receiving rocuronium precurarization. Difficult intubation with successful alternate technique was encountered in three patients (1.2%). Hypotension and hypertension occurred in 27% and 8% of patients, respectively. There were no documented cases of aspiration. Oxygen desaturation was mentioned in one case at induction and in three cases at emergence. An RSI with opioid, induction agent, and succinylcholine is the technique of choice for appendectomies at our institution. The frequency of airway complications is too low to recommend a change in practice.

Occupational therapists are frequently asked to document the interplay between individuals' neuropsychological deficits and the requirements of their daily lives. Purpose. The present study was designed to develop and validate a measure of independence in everyday functioning that considers recent advances in research regarding the ecological assessment of executive functions. Method. Experts (n=8) judged the IADL Profile's content validity and the tool was pilot tested with the target population (n=8). To document the tool's reliability, 30 patients aged 16 to 65 with moderate or severe TBI were recruited. A trained examiner administered the IADL Profile, and three trained judges rated video recordings on two occasions. Results. An eight-task (29-item) test was developed. Comparing ratings of four raters, 95 percent of kappa coefficients indicated moderate to almost perfect agreement, and 94% showed almost perfect intrarater agreement. Implications. The IADL Profile provides occupational therapists with a set of measures of IADL independence with strong preliminary evidence of reliability.

These studies have shown evidence that the nigrostriatal degeneration solely cannot account for these deficits and that involvement of other neural systems such as the mesocortical dopamine may also play an important role. In this article, we provide a review of neuroimaging results regarding the role of possible compensatory activity, L-Dopa medication, and difference in genotypes on the cognitive deficits observed in PD. Finally, some future avenues for research are proposed.

Claudins: unlocking the code to tight junction function during embryogenesis and in disease	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Review						claudin; tight junction; embryogenesis; epithelial cells; paracellular transport	CLOSTRIDIUM-PERFRINGENS ENTEROTOXIN; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; PARACELLULAR CHLORIDE PERMEABILITY; RECESSIVE DEAFNESS DFNB29; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; EXPRESSION PATTERNS; ADHESION MOLECULES; STRIA VASCULARIS; CL-PERMEABILITY	Claudins are the structural and molecular building blocks of tight junctions. Individual cells express more than one claudin family member, which suggests that a combinatorial claudin code that imparts flexibility and dynamic regulation of tight junction function could exist. Although we have learned much from manipulating claudin expression and function in cell lines, loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments in animal model systems are essential for understanding how claudin-based boundaries function in the context of a living embryo and/or tissue. These in vivo manipulations have pointed to roles for claudins in maintaining the epithelial integrity of cell layers, establishing micro-environments and contributing to the overall shape of an embryo or tissue. In addition, loss-of-function mutations in combination with the characterization of mutations in human disease have demonstrated the importance of claudins in regulating paracellular transport of solutes and water during normal physiological states. In this review, we will discuss specific examples of in vivo studies that illustrate the function of claudin family members during development and in disease.	[Ryan, A.

Here, we examined the additivity of the mismatch negativity (MMN) indexing the early interactions between vowels and pitch when sung. Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants heard frequent sung vowels and rare stimuli deviating in pitch only, in vowel only, or in both pitch and vowel. The task was to watch a silent movie while ignoring the sounds. Results: All three types of deviants elicited both an MMN and a P3a ERP component. The observed MMNs were of similar amplitude for the three types of deviants and the P3a was larger for double deviants. The MMNs to deviance in vowel and deviance in pitch were not additive. Conclusions: The underadditivity of the MMN responses suggests that vowel and pitch differences are processed by interacting neural networks. Significance: The results indicate that vowel and pitch are processed as integrated units, even at a pre-attentive level. Music-processing specificity thus rests on more complex dimensions of music and speech. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

At Time 1, 411 Chinese adolescents from Yue Yang, Hunan completed self-report measures assessing cognitive emotion regulation, depressive symptoms, and risky behavior engagement. Follow-up assessments occurred once a month for 6 months, and participants completed measures assessing depressive symptoms and risky behavior engagement. In line with our hypotheses, results of idiographic, multilevel modeling analyses indicated that individuals who exhibited high levels of neuroticism and a tendency to utilize maladaptive cognitive emotional regulation strategies were more likely than individuals possessing only one or neither of these vulnerability factors to report greater engagement in risky behaviors following increases in symptoms of depression.

Functional neuroimaging studies of young adults suggest that there are differences in left versus right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributions to spatial versus temporal source (recency) retrieval, respectively. The goal of the current study was to determine if age-related decreases in temporal and spatial context retrieval are due to common or distinct changes in PFC function. To address this goal we conducted ail event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which young and older adults performed recognition, recency and spatial context retrieval tasks using face stimuli to identify event-related PFC regions associated with these retrieval tasks in both age groups. Our behavioural results indicated that older adults did not differ on recognition performance, but did exhibit a deficit in both context retrieval tasks, compared to young adults. The fMRI results suggest that age-related deficits in both spatial and temporal context retrieval May be linked to functional changes in right dorsolateral and left medial anterior PFC (APFC) function. in addition, based on brain-behaviour correlations in older adults, our results imply that older adults attempt to compensate for these deficits by engaging left dorsolateral PFC during spatial context retrieval and right APFC during temporal context retrieval.

Cannabinoids and opioids are distinct drug classes that have been historically used separately or in combination to treat different pain states. Indeed, it is widely known that activation of either opioid or cannabinoid systems produces antinociceptive properties in different pain models. Moreover, several biochemical, molecular and pharmacological studies support the existence of reciprocal interactions between both systems, suggesting a common underlying mechanism. Further studies have demonstrated that the endogenous opioid system could be involved in cannabinoid antinociception and recent data have also provided evidence for a role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in opioid antinociception. These interactions may lead to additive or even synergistic antinociceptive effects, emphasizing their clinical relevance in humans in order to enhance analgesic effects with lower doses and consequently fewer undesirable side effects. Thus, the present review is focused on bidirectional interactions between opioids and cannabinoids and their potent repercussions on pain modulation.

In view of their ability to modulate neurotransmission, neurosteroids may influence the clinical course of epileptic disorders. In this review, we highlight two emerging properties of neurosteroids, that is, their anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic activities. Recent findings It has been shown that fluctuations in neurosteroid synthesis, such as those seen in response to stress or during the ovarian cycle, determine an increase in seizure threshold. Moreover, increased neurosteroid synthesis, presumably occurring in glial cells during epileptogenesis, delays the appearance of recurrent spontaneous seizures in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy; such an effect may be due to augmented tonic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-mediated inhibition. Finally, clinical trials with ganaxolone, an allopregnanolone analogue, have demonstrated beneficial effects in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients, whereas finasteride - which interferes with neurosteroid synthesis - facilitates seizures in catamenial epilepsy. Summary The overall evidence suggests that neurosteroids may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in epileptic disorders and a future perspective to control epileptogenicity.

Effect of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) on beta cell development in the human fetal pancreas	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						Human fetal pancreas; Human islet epithelial cell clusters; Islet transcription factors; Nuclear FOXO1; FOXO1 siRNA	TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR FOXO1; TUMOR SUPPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA; INSULIN GENE; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; PATHWAY; MICE; BETA-1-INTEGRIN; DEGRADATION	Recent studies have demonstrated that in adult murine beta cells the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) transcription factor regulates proliferation and stress resistance. However, the role of FOXO1 during pancreatic development remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to characterise the expression of the FOXO1 transcription factor in the early to mid-gestation human fetal pancreas and to understand its role in islet cell development. Human (8-21 week fetal age) pancreases were examined using immunohistological, quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Isolated human (18-21 week) fetal islet epithelial cell clusters were treated with insulin or glucose, or transfected with FOXO1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Nuclear and cytoplasmic FOXO1 were widely produced during human fetal endocrine pancreatic development, co-localising in cells with the transcription factors pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) and neurogenin 3 (NGN3) as well as cytokeratin 19 (CK19), insulin and glucagon. Treatment with exogenous insulin (50 nmol/l) induced the nuclear exclusion of FOXO1 in both cytokeratin 19 (CK19)(+) (p < 0.01) and insulin(+) cells (p < 0.05) in parallel with increased phospho-Akt (p < 0.05) production. siRNA knockdown of FOXO1 significantly increased the number of NGN3(+) (p < 0.01) and NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6-1)(+) (p < 0.05) cells in parallel with increases in insulin gene expression (p < 0.03) and C-peptide(+) cells (p < 0.05) and reduced levels of hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) (p < 0.01). Our results indicate that FOXO1 may negatively regulate beta cell differentiation in the human fetal pancreas by controlling critical transcription factors, including NGN3 and NKX6-1. These data suggest that the manipulation of FOXO1 levels may be a useful tool for improving cell-based strategies for the treatment of diabetes.

It is unclear whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of T2D. Moreover, whereas islet morphogenetic plasticity has been demonstrated in vitro, the in situ plasticity of islets, as well as the effect of T2D on endocrine differentiation, is unknown. We compared beta-cell volume, neogenesis, replication, and apoptosis in pancreata from lean and obese (body mass index >= 27 kg/m(2)) diabetic (5 +/- 2 yr since diagnosis) and nondiabetic cadaveric donors. We also subjected isolated islets from diabetic (3 +/- 1 yr since diagnosis) and nondiabetic donors to an established in vitro model of islet plasticity. Differences in beta-cell volume between diabetic and nondiabetic donors were consistently less pronounced than those reported in long-standing T2D. A compensatory increase in beta-cell neogenesis appeared to mediate this effect. Studies of induced plasticity indicated that islets from diabetic donors were capable of epithelial dedifferentiation but did not demonstrate regenerative potential, as was seen in islets from nondiabetic donors. This deficiency was associated with the overexpression of Notch signaling molecules and a decreased neurogenin-3(+) cell frequency. One interpretation of these results would be that decreased beta-cell volume is a consequence, not a cause, of T2D, mediated by increased apoptosis and attenuated beta-cell (re)generation. However, other explanations are also possible. It remains to be seen whether the morphogenetic plasticity of human islets, deficient in vitro in islets from diabetic donors, is a component of normal beta-cell mass dynamics.

We hypothesized that differences in the quality and quantity of maternal dietary fat would modulate the PL AA content in the neonatal brain affecting stress responsiveness via differences in eCB production and activity in stress-activated brain areas. Pregnant rats were fed a 5% [control (C)] or 30% fat [high fat (HF)] diet rich in either n-6 (HF-n-6) or n-3 (HF-n-3) fat during the last week of gestation and lactation. Postnatal d 10 offspring were tested for metabolic hormones, AA (n-6) and eCB brain content, and hormonal effects of eCB receptor antagonism (AM251, 1 or 3 mg/kgip) on stress responses. Like maternal diet, milk from HF-n-3 mothers had a reduced n-6/n-3 fat ratio compared with that of C and HF-n-6 mothers. Hypothalamic and hippocampal levels of PL AA were diet specific, reflecting the maternal milk and dietary n-6/n-3 ratio, with HF-n-3 offspring displaying reduced AA content relative to C and HF-n-6 offspring. Plasma corticosterone and insulin were elevated in HF-fed pups, whereas leptin was increased only in HF-n-6 pups. Basal eCB concentrations were also diet and brain region specific. In C pups, eCB receptor antagonist pretreatment increased stress-induced ACTH secretion, but not in the HF groups. Stress-induced corticosterone secretion was not sensitive to AM251 treatment in HF-n-3 pups. Thus, the nature of preweaning dietary fat differentially influences neonatal metabolic hormones, brain PL AA levels, and eCB, with functional consequences on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis modulation in developing rat pups.

J	Zhang, J; Haghighat, F				Zhang, Jian; Haghighat, Fariborz			Development of Artificial Neural Network based heat convection algorithm for thermal simulation of large rectangular cross-sectional area Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers; Ventilation; Energy; Artificial Neural Network; Low energy; Building; Modeling; Convective heat transfer		An Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger (ETAHE) is a low energy cooling and heating building component. It uses the ground's thermal storage to dampen ambient air temperature oscillations by delivering the air through a horizontally buried duct. To reduce airflow resistance, some hybrid ventilated buildings have recently adopted large cross-sectional area ducts. This paper describes the development of an Artificial Neural Network based Heat Convection (ANN-HC) algorithm to predict local average Nusselt Numbers along the duct surfaces. Furthermore, the ANN-HC algorithm is integrated with a transient three-dimensional heat transfer model based on finite element analysis of heat conduction in the ground domain surrounding the ETAHE to establish a new thermal modeling method for ETAHEs.
