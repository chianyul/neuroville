Educators emphasize the need to develop and use objective and meaningful assessment tools that are reliable and valid for assessing trainees' progress in acquiring surgical skills. The purpose of this study was to develop proficiency performance benchmarks for a newly proposed set of objective measures (metrics) of neurosurgical technical skills performance during simulated brain tumor resection using a new virtual reality simulator (NeuroTouch). DESIGN: Each participant performed the resection of 18 simulated brain tumors of different complexity using the NeuroTouch platform. Surgical performance was computed using Tier 1 and Tier 2 metrics derived from NeuroTouch simulator data consisting of (1) safety metrics, including (a) volume of surrounding simulated normal brain tissue removed, (b) sum of forces utilized, and (c) maximum force applied during tumor resection; (2) quality of operation metric, which involved the percentage of tumor removed; and (3) efficiency metrics, including (a) instrument total tip path lengths and (b) frequency of pedal activation. SETTING: All studies were conducted in the Neurosurgical Simulation Research Centre, Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 33 participants were recruited, including 17 experts (board-certified neurosurgeons) and 16 novices (7 senior and 9 junior neurosurgery residents). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that "expert" neurosurgeons resected less surrounding simulated normal brain tissue and less tumor tissue than residents. These data are consistent with the concept that "experts" focused more on safety of the surgical procedure compared with novices. By analyzing experts' neurosurgical technical skills performance on these different metrics, we were able to establish benchmarks for goal proficiency performance training of neurosurgery residents. CONCLUSION: This study furthers our understanding of expert neurosurgical performance during the resection of simulated virtual reality tumors and provides neurosurgical trainees with predefined proficiency performance benchmarks designed to maximize the learning of specific surgical technical skills.

J	Schlich, T				Schlich, Thomas			'The Days of Brilliancy are Past': Skill, Styles and the Changing Rules of Surgical Performance, ca. 1820-1920	MEDICAL HISTORY			English	Article						History of Surgery; Skill; Performance; Body History	SURGERY; SCIENCE; MEDICINE; IDENTITY; LISTER; TUMORS; BRAIN; 1890S	This paper examines how, over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the appreciation of skill in surgery shifted in characteristic ways. Skill is a problematic category in surgery. Its evaluation is embedded into wider cultural expectations and evaluations, which changed over time. The paper examines the discussions about surgical skill in a variety of contexts: the highly competitive environment of celebrity practitioners in the amphitheatres of early nineteenth-century Britain; the science-oriented, technocratic German-language university hospitals later in the century; and the elitist surgeons of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century United States with their concerns about distancing themselves from commercialism and cheap showmanship. For analysing the interaction of surgical practices with their various contexts the paper makes use of the concept of 'performance' and examines how the rules of surgical performance varied according to the prevailing technical, social, and moral conditions. Over the course of the century, surgical performance looked more and more recognisably modern, increasingly following the ideals of replicability, universality and standardisation. The changing ideals of surgical skill are a crucial element of the complex history of the emergence of modern surgery, but also an illuminating example of the history of skill in modern medicine.

J	Lamb, S				Lamb, Susan			Social Skills: Adolf Meyer's Revision of Clinical Skill for the New Psychiatry of the Twentieth Century	MEDICAL HISTORY			English	Article						Meyer; Adolf; Psychiatry; History; Progressive Era; Psychobiology	EDINBURGH	Adolf Meyer (1866-1950) exercised considerable influence over the development of Anglo-American psychiatry during the first half of the twentieth century. The concepts and techniques he implemented at his prominent Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins remain important to psychiatric practice and neuro-scientific research today. In the 1890s, Meyer revised scientific medicine's traditional notion of clinical skill to serve what he called the 'New Psychiatry', a clinical discipline that embodied social and scientific ideals shared with other 'new' progressive reform movements in the United States. This revision conformed to his concept of psychobiology-his biological theory of mind and mental disorders-and accorded with his definition of scientific medicine as a unity of clinical-pathological methods and therapeutics. Combining insights from evolutionary biology, neuron theory and American pragmatist philosophy, Meyer concluded that subjective experience and social behaviour were functions of human biology. In addition to the time-honoured techniques devised to exploit the material data of the diseased body-observing and recording in the clinic, dissecting in the morgue and conducting histological experiments in the laboratory-he insisted that psychiatrists must also be skilled at wielding social interaction and interpersonal relationships as investigative and therapeutic tools in order to conceptualise, collect, analyse and apply the ephemeral data of 'social adaptation'. An examination of his clinical practices and teaching at Johns Hopkins between 1913 and 1917 shows how particular historical and intellectual contexts shaped Meyer's conceptualisation of social behaviour as a biological function and, subsequently, his new vision of clinical skill for twentieth-century psychiatry.

Mallar; Luk, Gigi; Grady, Cheryl L.; Bialystok, Ellen			The effect of lifelong bilingualism on regional grey and white matter volume	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Bilingual; Cognitive reserve; MRI; Volumetric; Aging; Hippocampus	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; ANTERIOR TEMPORAL-LOBE; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; OLDER-ADULTS; CORTICAL SURFACE; GEOMETRICALLY ACCURATE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; COGNITIVE RESERVE; COORDINATE SYSTEM	Lifelong bilingualism is associated with the delayed diagnosis of dementia, suggesting bilingual experience is relevant to brain health in aging. While the effects of bilingualism on cognitive functions across the lifespan are well documented, less is known about the neural substrates underlying differential behaviour. It is clear that bilingualism affects brain regions that mediate language abilities and that these regions are at least partially overlapping with those that exhibit age-related decline. Moreover, the behavioural advantages observed in bilingualism are generally found in executive function performance, suggesting that the frontal lobes may also be sensitive to bilingualism, which exhibit volume reductions with age. The current study investigated structural differences in the brain of lifelong bilingual older adults (n=14, mean age=70.4) compared with older monolinguals (n=14, mean age=70.6). We employed two analytic approaches: 1) we examined global differences in grey and white matter volumes; and, 2) we examined local differences in volume and cortical thickness of specific regions of interest previously implicated in bilingual/monolingual comparisons (temporal pole) or in aging (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). We expected bilinguals would exhibit greater volume of the frontal lobe and temporal lobe (grey and white matter), given the importance of these regions in executive and language functions, respectively. We further hypothesized that regions in the medial temporal lobe, which demonstrate early changes in aging and exhibit neural pathology in dementia, would be more preserved in the bilingual group. As predicted, bilinguals exhibit greater frontal lobe white matter compared with monolinguals. Moreover, increasing age was related to decreasing temporal pole cortical thickness in the monolingual group, but no such relationship was observed for bilinguals. Finally, Stoop task performance was positively correlated with frontal lobe white matter, emphasizing the importance of preserved white matter in maintaining executive function in aging. These results underscore previous findings implicating an association between bilingualism and preserved frontal and temporal lobe function in aging.

Modeling the role of osmotic forces in the cerebrovascular response to CO2	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CARBON-DIOXIDE TENSION; VASCULAR-SPACE-OCCUPANCY; MEAN TRANSIT-TIME; RAT-BRAIN CORTEX; PERFUSION MRI; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; CEREBROSPINAL FLUID; SODIUM-BICARBONATE; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION	Increases in blood osmolarity have been shown to exert a vasodilatory effect on cerebral and other vasculature, with accompanying increases in blood flow. It has also been shown that, through an influence on blood concentration of the bicarbonate ion and pH, changes in blood levels of CO2 can alter blood osmolarity sufficiently to have an impact on vessel diameter. We propose here that this phenomenon plays a previously unappreciated role in CO2-mediated vasodilation, and present a biophysical model of osmotically driven vasodilation. Our model, which is based on literature data describing CO2-dependent changes in blood osmolarity and hydraulic conductivity (Lp) of the blood-brain barrier, is used to predict the change in cerebral blood flow (CBF) associated with osmotic forces arising from a specific hypercapnic challenge. Modeled changes were then compared with actual CBF changes determined using arterial spin-labeling (ASL) MRI. For changes in the arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) of 20 mmHg, our model predicted increases of 80% from baseline CBF with a temporal evolution that was comparable to the measured hemodynamic responses. Our modeling results suggest that osmotic forces could play a significant role in the cerebrovascular response to CO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Tancredi, F. B.; Hoge, R.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging Initi	HMGCR is a genetic modifier for risk, age of onset and MCI conversion to Alzheimer's disease in a three cohorts study	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; COENZYME-A REDUCTASE; LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL RESPONSE; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; STATIN THERAPY; IDENTIFIES VARIANTS; TYPE-4 ALLELE; DEMENTIA; POLYMORPHISM	Several retrospective epidemiological studies report that utilization of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors called statins at mid-life can reduce the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) by as much as 70%. Conversely, the administration of these inhibitors in clinically diagnosed subjects with AD confers little or no benefits over time. Here, we investigated the association between AD and HMGCR rs3846662, a polymorphism known to be involved in the regulation of HMGCR exon 13 skipping, in a founder population and in two distinct mixed North American populations of converting mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects (Alzheimer's disease Cooperative study (ADCS) and Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts). Targeting more specifically women, the G allele negative (G-) AD subjects exhibit delayed age of onset of AD (P = 0.017) and significantly reduced risk of AD (OR: 0.521; P = 0.0028), matching the effect size reported by the apolipoprotein E type 2 variant. Stratification for APOE4 in a large sample of MCI patients from the ADCS cohort revealed a significant protective effect of G negative carriers on AD conversion 3 years after MCI diagnosis (odds ratio (OR): 0.554; P = 0.041). Conversion rate among APOE4 carriers with the HMGCR's G negative allele was markedly reduced (from 76% to 27%) to levels similar to APOE4 non-carriers (27.14%), which strongly indicate protection. Conversion data from the independent ADNI cohort also showed significantly reduced MCI or AD conversion among APOE4 carriers with the protective A allele (P = 0.005). In conclusion, HMGCR rs3846662 acts as a potent genetic modifier for AD risk, age of onset and conversion.

Brain organic cation transporter 2 controls response and vulnerability to stress and GSK3 beta signaling	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3; LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; IN-VIVO; ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE; SEROTONIN CLEARANCE; DORSAL HIPPOCAMPUS; MOUSE HIPPOCAMPUS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SPATIAL MEMORY; MICE	Interactions between genetic and environmental factors, like exposure to stress, have an important role in the pathogenesis of mood-related psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder. The polyspecific organic cation transporters (OCTs) were shown previously to be sensitive to the stress hormone corticosterone in vitro, suggesting that these transporters might have a physiologic role in the response to stress. Here, we report that OCT2 is expressed in several stress-related circuits in the brain and along the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Genetic deletion of OCT2 in mice enhanced hormonal response to acute stress and impaired HPA function without altering adrenal sensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). As a consequence, OCT2(-/-) mice were potently more sensitive to the action of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) on depression-related behaviors involving self-care, spatial memory, social interaction and stress-sensitive spontaneous behavior. The functional state of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) signaling pathway, highly responsive to acute stress, was altered in the hippocampus of OCT2(-/-) mice. In vivo pharmacology and western blot experiments argue for increased serotonin tonus as a main mechanism for impaired GSK3 beta signaling in OCT2(-/-) mice brain during acute response to stress. Our findings identify OCT2 as an important determinant of the response to stress in the brain, suggesting that in humans OCT2 mutations or blockade by certain therapeutic drugs could interfere with HPA axis function and enhance vulnerability to repeated adverse events leading to stress-related disorders.

Mutations in KCNA1 and CACNA1A account for the majority of EA cases worldwide. We recruited a two-generation family affected with EA of unknown subtype and performed whole-exome sequencing on two affected members. This revealed a novel heterozygous mutation c.211_212insA (p.I71NfsX27) leading to a premature stop codon in FGF14. Mutations in FGF14 are known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 27 (SCA27). Sanger sequencing confirmed segregation within the family. Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of SCA27 by underlining the possible episodic nature of this ataxia.

Exploring how the structure of the corpus callosum (CC) reorganizes ensuing visual deprivation is of particular interest due to its important functional implication in vision (e.g., via the splenium of the CC). Moreover, comparing early versus late visually deprived individuals has the potential to unravel the existence of a sensitive period for reshaping the CC structure. Here, we develop a novel framework to capture a complete set of shape differences in the CC between congenitally blind (CB), late blind (LB) and sighted control (SC) groups. The CCs were manually segmented from T1-weighted brain MRI and modeled by 3D tetrahedral meshes. We statistically compared the combination of local area and thickness at each point between subject groups. Differences in area are found using surface tensor-based morphometry; thickness is estimated by tracing the streamlines in the volumetric harmonic field. Group differences were assessed on this combined measure using Hotelling's T (2) test. Interestingly, we observed that the total callosal volume did not differ between the groups. However, our fine-grained analysis reveals significant differences mostly localized around the splenium areas between both blind groups and the sighted group (general effects of blindness) and, importantly, specific dissimilarities between the LB and CB groups, illustrating the existence of a sensitive period for reorganization. The new multivariate statistics also gave better effect sizes for detecting morphometric differences, relative to other statistics. They may boost statistical power for CC morphometric analyses.

The efficacy of inhibition relies on low levels of intracellular Cl-, which are controlled by KCC2 activity. This evidence has led us to analyze with field potential recordings the effects induced by the KCC2 blockers VU0240551 (10 mu M) or bumetanide (50 mu M) and by the KCC2 enhancer CLP257 (100 mu M) on the epileptiform discharges generated by piriform and entorhinal cortices (PC and EC, respectively) in an in vitro brain slice preparation. Ictal- and interictal-like discharges along with high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples: 80-200 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) were recorded from these two regions during application of 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 mu M). Blocking KCC2 activity with either VU024055 or high doses of bumetanide abolished ictal discharge in both PC and EC; in addition, these experimental procedures decreased the interval of occurrence and duration of interictal discharges. In contrast enhancing KCC2 activity with CLP257 increased ictal discharge duration in both regions. Finally, blocking KCC2 activity decreased the duration and amplitude of pharmacologically isolated synchronous GABAergic events whereas enhancing KCC2 activity led to an increase in their duration. Our data demonstrate that in vitro ictogenesis is abolished or facilitated by inhibiting or enhancing KCC2 activity, respectively. We propose that these effects may result from the reduction of GABA(A) receptor-dependent increases in extracellular K+ that are known to rest on KCC2 function. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Depression, depressive symptoms, and rate of hippocampal atrophy in a longitudinal cohort of older men and women	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Aging; atrophy; cohort studies; depression; hippocampus; imaging	RECURRENT MAJOR DEPRESSION; DENTATE GYRUS; GERIATRIC DEPRESSION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN ATROPHY; VOLUME LOSS; AGE; MRI; DISORDER	Background. Several studies have reported smaller hippocampal volume (HcV) in depression patients; however, the temporality of the association remains unknown. One proposed hypothesis is that depression may cause HcV loss. This study evaluates whether previous depression and recent depressive symptoms are associated with HcV and HcV loss. Method. We used a prospective cohort of older adults (n = 1328; age = 65-80 years) with two cerebral magnetic resonance imaging examinations at baseline and 4-year follow-up. Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated, in stratified analyses by gender, the association between indicators of history of depression and its severity (age at onset, recurrence, hospitalization for depression), proximal depressive symptoms [ Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale], baseline antidepressant use, and the outcomes: baseline HcV and annual percentage change in HcV. Results. At baseline, women with more depressive symptoms had smaller HcV [-0.05 cm(3), 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to -0.01 cm(3) per 10-unit increase in CES-D scores]. History of depression was associated with a 0.2% faster annual HcV loss in women (95% CI 0.01-0.36%). More baseline depressive symptoms and worsening of these symptoms were also associated with accelerated HcV loss in women. No associations were observed in men. Treatment for depression was associated with slower HcV loss in women and men. Conclusions. While only concomitant depressive symptoms were associated with HcV, both previous depression and more proximal depressive symptoms were associated with faster HcV loss in women.

REPEATABILITY AND MINIMAL DETECTABLE CHANGE IN LONGITUDINAL MEDIAN NERVE EXCURSION MEASURES DURING UPPER LIMB NEURODYNAMIC TECHNIQUES IN A MIXED POPULATION: A PILOT STUDY USING MUSCULOSKELETAL ULTRASOUND IMAGING	ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Carpal tunnel syndrome; Median nerve; Neurodynamics; Reliability; Ultrasound	IN-VIVO; RELIABILITY; MOVEMENTS	This study determined test-retest reliability and minimum detectable change in longitudinal median nerve excursion during upper limb neurodynamic tests (ULNTs). Seven participants with unilateral or bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and 11 healthy participants were randomly tested with two ULNTs (i.e., tensioner and slider). Each ULNT was performed three times each at 45 degrees and 90 degrees of shoulder abduction on two separate visits. Video sequences of median nerve excursion, recorded by a physical therapist using ultrasound imaging, were quantified using computer software. The generalizability theory, encompassing a G-Study and a D-study, measured the dependability coefficient (Phi) along with standard error of measurement (SEM) accuracy and allowed various testing protocols to be proposed. The highest reliability (Phi = 0.84) and lowest minimal measurement error (SEM = 0.58 mm) of the longitudinal median nerve excursion were reached during the ULNT-slider performed with 45 degrees of shoulder abduction and when measures obtained from three different image sequences recorded during a single visit were averaged. It is recommended that longitudinal median nerve excursion measures computed from three separate image sequences recorded during a single visit be averaged in clinical practice. Ideally, adding a second visit (six image sequences) is also suggested in research protocols. (C) 2015 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

The goal of this study was to characterize the development of visual texture segregation using texture segregation visual evoked potentials (tsVEPs) in children born full-term and children born preterm without major neurological impairment. Forty-five full-term and 43 preterm children were tested at either 12, 24 or 36 months of age (corrected age for prematurity at 12 and 24 months old). VEPs were obtained using two lower-level stimuli defined by orientation (oriVEP) and two higher-level stimuli defined by texture (texVEP). TsVEP was obtained by dividing by two the subtraction of oriVEP from texVEP. Results show a clear maturation of the processes underlying visual texture segregation in the full-term group, with a significant N2 latency reduction between 12 and 36 months of age for all conditions. Significant N2 amplitude reduction was observed for oriVEP between 12 and 24 months, as well as for texVEP between 12 and 24 months, and 12 and 36 months. Comparison between full-term and preterm children indicated significantly lower N2 amplitude for the preterm group at 12 months for oriVEP and texVEP. These differences were no longer apparent at 24 months of age, suggesting that children born preterm catch up with their full-term counterparts somewhere between 12 and 24 months of age. Our results appear to reflect a maturational delay in preterm children in both lower-level and higher-level visual processing during, at least, early childhood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

FORGE Canada Consortium; Care4Rare Canada	Whole-exome sequencing broadens the phenotypic spectrum of rare pediatric epilepsy: a retrospective study	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						monogenic; pediatric epilepsy; phenotypic spectrum; whole-exome sequencing	INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; MOLECULAR-BIOLOGY; MUTATIONS; ENCEPHALOPATHIES; REVEALS; GENES; PARKINSONISM; DISEASE; PROJECT	Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has transformed our ability to detect mutations causing rare diseases. FORGE (Finding Of Rare disease GEnes) and Care4Rare Canada are nation-wide projects focused on identifying disease genes using WES and translating this technology to patient care. Rare forms of epilepsy are well-suited for WES and we retrospectively selected FORGE and Care4Rare families with clinical descriptions that included childhood-onset epilepsy or seizures not part of a recognizable syndrome or an early-onset encephalopathy where standard-of-care investigations were unrevealing. Nine families met these criteria and a diagnosis was made in seven, and potentially eight, of the families. In the eight families we identified mutations in genes associated with known neurological and epilepsy disorders: ASAH1, FOLR1, GRIN2A (two families), SCN8A, SYNGAP1 and SYNJ1. A novel and rare mutation was identified in KCNQ2 and was likely responsible for the benign seizures segregating in the family though additional evidence would be required to be definitive. In retrospect, the clinical presentation of four of the patients was considered atypical, thereby broadening the phenotypic spectrum of these conditions. Given the extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity associated with epilepsy, our findings suggest that WES may be considered when a specific gene is not immediately suspected as causal.

A homozygous mutation in SLC1A4 in siblings with severe intellectual disability and microcephaly	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						Ashkenazi Jewish; exome sequencing; intellectual disability; microcephaly; neutral amino acid; SLC1A4	AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTER; L-SERINE; PRIMARY CULTURE; MOUSE-BRAIN; NEURONS; ASCT1; ASTROCYTES; SYSTEM	We performed exome analysis in two affected siblings with severe intellectual disability (ID), microcephaly and spasticity from an Ashkenazi Jewish consanguineous family. We identified only one rare variant, a missense in SLC1A4 (c. 766G>A [p. E256K]), that is homozygous in both siblings but not in any of their 11 unaffected siblings or their parents (Logarithm of odds, LOD score: 2.6). This variant is predicted damaging. We genotyped 450 controls of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and identified only 5 individuals who are heterozygous for this variant (minor allele frequency: 0.0056). SLC1A4 (ASCT1) encodes a transporter for neutral aminoacids such as alanine, serine, cysteine and threonine. l-Serine is essential for neuronal survival and differentiation. Indeed, l-serine biosynthesis disorders affect brain development and cause severe ID. In the brain, l-serine is synthesized in astrocytes but not in neurons. It has been proposed that ASCT1 mediates the uptake of l-serine into neurons and the release of glia-borne l-serine to neighboring cells. SLC1A4 disruption may thus impair brain development and function by decreasing the levels of l-serine in neurons. The identification of additional families with mutations in SLC1A4 would be necessary to confirm its involvement in ID.

Brain mitochondrial ATP-insensitive large conductance Ca+2-activated K+ channel properties are altered in a rat model of amyloid-beta neurotoxicity	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						A beta neurotoxicity; Brain; Mitochondria; MitoBK(Ca) channel; Black (bilayer) lipid membrane	POTASSIUM CHANNEL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INNER MEMBRANE; A-BETA; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MECHANISM; PEPTIDE; DYSFUNCTION; SUBUNIT; ACTIVATION	Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta (A beta)-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism of how A beta affects mitochondrial function remains uncertain. Because mitochondrial potassium channels have been involved in several mitochondrial functions including cytoprotection, apoptosis and calcium homeostasis, a study was undertaken to investigate whether the gating behavior of the mitochondrial ATP- and ChTx-insensitive-IbTx-sensitive Ca2+-activated potassium channel (mitoBK(Ca)) is altered in a rat model of A beta neurotoxicity. A beta 1-42 (4 mu g/mu l) was intracerebroventricularly injected in male Wistar rats (220-250 g). Brain A beta accumulation was confirmed two weeks later on the basis of an immunohistochemisty staining assay, and physiological impacts measured in passive avoidance task cognitive performance experiments. Brain mitochondrial inner membranes were then extracted and membrane vesicles prepared for channel incorporation into bilayer lipid. Purity of the cell fraction was confirmed by Western blot using specific markers of mitochondria, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi. Our results first provide evidence for differences in mitoBK(Ca) ion permeation properties with channels coming from A beta vesicle preparations characterized by an inward rectifying I-V curve, in contrast to control mitoBK(Ca) channels which showed a linear I-V relationship under the same ionic conditions (200 mM cis/50 mM trans). More importantly the open probability of channels from A beta vesicles appeared 1.5 to 2.5 smaller compared to controls, the most significant decrease being observed at depolarizing potentials (30 mV to 50 mV). Because BKCa-beta 4 subunit has been documented to shift the BKCa channel voltage dependence curve, a Western blot analysis was undertaken where expression of mitoBK(Ca) alpha and beta 4 subunits was estimated using anti-alpha and beta 4 subunit antibodies. Our results indicated a significant increase in mitoBK(Ca)-beta 4 subunit expression coupled to a decrease in the expression of alpha subunit. Our results thus demonstrate a modification in the mitoBK(Ca) channel gating properties in membrane preparations coming from a rat model of A beta neurotoxicity, an effect potentially linked to a change in mitoBK(Ca)-beta 4 and -alpha subunits expression or increased ROS production due to an enhanced A beta mitochondrial accumulation. Our results may provide new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunctions in A beta neurotoxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Current standard treatments are not always effective and are associated with complications and side effects. The discovery of stem cells led to research into cell-based therapies for treatment of disorders of voiding dysfunction. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are particularly promising given their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types. Recent studies have investigated bone marrow stem cells to treat a number of functional voiding pathologies including bladder outlet obstruction, neurogenic bladder, and stress urinary incontinence. Experiments in tissue regeneration have also attempted to create artificial bladders and urethras. The purpose of this article is to critically review the literature regarding the use of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of voiding dysfunction.

Considering connectivity measures, coherence is suitable for the detection of rhythmic synchronization, whereas temporal correlation is appropriate for transient synchronization. This paper presents a beamformer-based imaging method, called spatiotemporal imaging of linearly-related source component (SILSC), which is capable of estimating connectivity at the cortical level by extracting the source component with the maximum temporal correlation between the activity of each targeted region and a reference signal. The spatiotemporal correlation dynamics can be obtained by applying SILSC at every brain region and with various time latencies. The results of six simulation studies demonstrated that SILSC is sensitive to detect the source activity correlated to the specified reference signal and is accurate and robust to noise in terms of source localization. In a facial expression imitation experiment, the correlation dynamics estimated by SILSC revealed the regions with mirror properties and the regions involved in motor control network when performing the imitation and execution tasks, respectively, with the left inferior frontal gyrus specified as the reference region.

This study aims at determining: (1) whether B1R is induced in the brain of insulin-resistant rat through the oxidative stress; (2) the consequence of B1R activation on stereotypic nocifensive behavior; (3) the role of downstream putative mediators in B1R-induced behavioral activity. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with 10% D-glucose in their drinking water or tap water (controls) for 4 or 12 weeks, combined either with a standard chow diet or a diet enriched with alpha-lipoic acid (1 g/kg feed) for 4 weeks. The distribution and density of brain B1R binding sites were assessed by autoradiography. Behavioral activity evoked by i.c.v. injection of the B1R agonist Sar-[D-Phe(8)]-des-Arg(9)-BK (10 mu g) was measured before and after i.c.v. treatments with selective antagonists (10 mu g) for kinin B1 (R-715, SSR240612), tachykinin NK1 (RP-67580) and glutamate NMDA (DL-AP5) receptors or with the inhibitor of NOS (L-NNA). Results showed significant increases of B1R binding sites in various brain areas of glucose-fed rats that could be prevented by the diet containing alpha-lipoic acid. The B1R agonist elicited head scratching, grooming, sniffing, rearing, digging, licking, face washing, wet dog shake, teeth chattering and biting in glucose-fed rats, which were absent after treatment with alpha-lipoic acid or antagonists/inhibitors. Data suggest that kinin B1R is upregulated by the oxidative stress in the brain of insulin-resistant rats and its activation causes stereotypic nocifensive behavior through the release of substance P, glutamate and NO.

With new era of multimodality therapy, an increasing proportion of patients are now long-term survivors. ProcedureRetrospective review of neuropsychological (NP) status of survivors from the Canadian ATRT registry. ResultsAmong 77 patients diagnosed between 1995-2012, 16(22%) were survivors. Formal NP assessments were available in eight patients. Partial information on academic achievement was available on three additional patients. There were four girls and seven boys diagnosed at a median age of 27.5 months. Seven patients underwent complete resection and three had metastatic disease. All but one received sequential high dose chemotherapy. Five patients received intrathecal chemotherapy. Three patients underwent radiation. Median age at time of formal NP assessment was 7.6 years (3.9-9.8). Full Scale Intellectual Quotient (FSIQ) ranged from less than 50-119 (mean 78). Simple expressive and receptive language appeared relatively preserved. Three recently diagnosed patients (median time assessment from diagnosis 2.6 years (1.6-4.7)) had average to high average FSIQ, academic and visual spatial skills, visual, and verbal memory. Five other patients diagnosed earlier and tested at a median time of 4.9 years (3.3-8.3) post-diagnosis had a FSIQ ranging from <50 to 71. Approximately 50% of their scores were in the impaired range. ConclusionOverall this cohort appears significantly impaired at school age despite the absence of systematic radiotherapy. Larger series focusing on neurocognitive outcome are needed in the current context where treatment strategies include adjuvant radiation. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2015;62:1265-1269.

Tumefactive appearance of peripheral nerve involvement in hematologic malignancies: a new imaging association	SKELETAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Neurolymphomatosis; Neuroleukemiosis; Plasmacytoma; Neuroplasmacytoma; Tumefactive; Imaging; MRI; Pattern	OF-THE-LITERATURE; T-CELL LYMPHOMA; SCIATIC-NERVE; LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; MONONEURITIS MULTIPLEX; BRACHIAL-PLEXUS; PET-CT; NEUROLYMPHOMATOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; MRI	In neurolymphomatosis (NL), the affected nerves are typically described to be enlarged and hyperintense on T2W MR sequences and to avidly enhance on gadolinium-enhanced T1WI. This pattern is highly non-specific. We recently became aware of a "tumefactive pattern" of NL, neuroleukemiosis (NLK) and neuroplasmacytoma (NPLC), which we believe is exclusive to hematologic diseases affecting peripheral nerves. We defined a "tumefactive" appearance as complex, fusiform, hyperintense on T2WI, circumferential tumor masses encasing the involved peripheral nerves. The nerves appear to be infiltrated by the tumor. Both structures show varying levels of homogenous enhancement. We reviewed our series of 52 cases of NL in search of this pattern; two extra outside cases of NL, three cases of NLK, and one case of NPLC were added to the series. We identified 20 tumefactive lesions in 18 patients (14 NL, three NLK, one NPLC). The brachial plexus (n = 7) was most commonly affected, followed by the sciatic nerve (n = 6) and lumbosacral plexus (n = 3). Four patients had involvement of other nerves. All were proven by biopsy: the diagnosis was high-grade lymphoma (n = 12), low-grade lymphoma (n = 3), acute leukemia (n = 2), and plasmacytoma (n = 1). We present a new imaging pattern of "tumefactive" neurolymphomatosis, neuroleukemiosis, or neuroplasmacytoma in a series of 18 cases. We believe this pattern is associated with hematologic diseases directly involving the peripheral nerves. Knowledge of this association can provide a clue to clinicians in establishing the correct diagnosis. Bearing in mind that tumefactive NL, NLK, and NPLC is a newly introduced imaging pattern, we still recommend to biopsy patients with suspicion of a malignancy.

Uncontrolled eating	APPETITE			English	Article						Personality; Item response theory; Disinhibition; Binge eating; Emotional eating; Impulsivity	BODY-MASS INDEX; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; STRUCTURAL MODEL; TEST BATTERIES; OBESE SUBJECTS; SELF-CONTROL; PERSONALITY; WEIGHT; FOOD; BIFACTOR	Research on eating behaviour has identified several potentially relevant eating-related traits captured by different questionnaires. Often, these questionnaires predict Body Mass Index (BMI), but the relationship between them has not been explicitly studied. We studied the unity and diversity of questionnaires capturing five common eating-related traits: Power of Food, Eating Impulsivity, emotional eating, Disinhibition, and binge eating in women from Estonia (n = 740) and Canada (n = 456). Using bifactor analysis, we showed that a) these questionnaires are largely explained by a single factor, and b) relative to this shared factor, only some questionnaires offered additional variance in predicting BMI. Hence, these questionnaires seemed to characterise a common factor, which we label Uncontrolled Eating, Item Response Theory techniques were then applied to demonstrate that c) within this common factor, the questionnaires could be placed on a continuum of Uncontrolled Eating. That is, Eating Impulsivity focused on the milder degree, Power of Food Scale, emotional eating scales, and Disinhibition on intermediate degrees, and the Binge Eating Scale on the most severe degrees of Uncontrolled Eating. In sum, evidence from two samples showed that questionnaires capturing five common BMI-related traits largely reflected the same underlying latent trait - Uncontrolled Eating. In Estonia, some questionnaires focused on different severities of this common construct, supporting a continuum model of Uncontrolled Eating. These findings provide a starting point for developing better questionnaires of the neurobehavioural correlates of obesity, and provide a unifying perspective from which to view the existing literature. R scripts and data used for the analysis are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It includes silicon avalanche photodiodes (SiAPDs) with dual detection modes using a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with on-chip gain/bias control, and a controllable mixed (active-passive) quench circuit, with tunable hold-off time, and a novel gated quench-reset technique. This integrated photoreceiver front-end has been fabricated using submicrometer standard CMOS technologies with a minimum fill-factor of 95%. Fabricated SiAPDs exhibit avalanche gains of 35 and 22 at 10 and 18 V bias voltages with red-shifted peak photon-detection efficiency and dark count-rates of 114 and 4 kHz (at 1 V excess bias voltage). The TIA consumes 1-mW power, and offers a transimpedance gain of 250 MV/A, a tunable bandwidth (1 kHz-1 GHz), and an input current referred noise < 10 fA/root Hz at 1 kHz. The photon-counter exhibits a quench-time of 10 ns with a 0.4-mW power-consumption with an adaptive hold-off time control. The on-chip integration of SiAPDs and front-end circuit, reduced the power-consumption and after-pulsing, and increased the sensitivity.

Heme Oxygenase-1 Modulates microRNA Expression in Cultured Astroglia: Implications for Chronic Brain Disorders	GLIA			English	Article						astrocyte; heme oxygenase-1; miRNA; mitochondria; neurodegeneration; oxidative stress	OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RAT-BRAIN; IRON DEPOSITION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; IN-VIVO; ASTROCYTIC COMPARTMENT; IONIZING-RADIATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; CELLS	BackgroundOver-expression of the heme-degrading enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) promotes iron deposition, mitochondrial damage, and autophagy in astrocytes and enhances the vulnerability of nearby neuronal constituents to oxidative injury. These neuropathological features and aberrant brain microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns have been implicated in the etiopathogeneses of various neurodevelopmental and aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. ObjectiveTo correlate glial HO-1 overexpression with altered miRNA patterns, which have been linked to the aforementioned core neuropathological features. MethodsmiRNA microchip assays were performed on HMOX1- and sham-transfected primary rat astroglia and affected miRNAs were further validated by qPCR. The roles of the heme degradation products, carbon monoxide (CO), iron (Fe) and bilirubin on miRNA expression were assessed and salient mRNA targets of the impacted miRNAs were ascertained. ResultsIn HMOX1-transfected astrocytes, rno-miR-140*, rno-miR-17, and rno-miR-16 were significantly up-regulated, and rno-miR-297, rno-miR-206, rno-miR-187, rno-miR-181a, rno-miR-138 and rno-miR-29c were down-regulated, compared to sham-transfected controls. CO and Fe were implicated in the HMOX1 effects, whereas bilirubin was inert or counteracted the HMOX1-related changes. mRNA levels of Ngfr, Vglut1, Mapk3, Tnf-, and Sirt1, known targets of the down-regulated miRNAs and abnormal in various human brain disorders, were significantly increased in the HMOX-1-transfected astrocytes. ConclusionsIn chronic CNS disorders, altered expression of salient miRNAs and their mRNA targets may contribute to the neural damage accruing from the over-expression of glial HO-1.

J	Zhang, Q; Wang, YB; Levine, MD; Yuan, XQ; Wang, L				Zhang, Qiang; Wang, Yabin; Levine, Martin D.; Yuan, Xiaoqing; Wang, Long			Multisensor video fusion based on higher order singular value decomposition	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Video fusion; Video tensor; Higher order singular value decomposition; Surfacelet Transform	MULTIMODALITY IMAGE FUSION; CONTOURLET TRANSFORM; SURVEILLANCE; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY; TENSOR	With the ongoing development of sensor technologies, more and more kinds of video sensors are being employed in video surveillance systems to improve robustness and monitoring performance. In addition, there is often a strong motivation to simultaneously observe the same scene by more than one kind of sensor. How to sufficiently and effectively utilize the information captured by these different sensors is thus of considerable interest. This can be realized using video fusion, by which multiple aligned videos from different sensors are merged into a composite. In this paper, a video fusion algorithm is presented based on the 3D Surfacelet Transform (3D-ST) and the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD). In the proposed method, input videos are first decomposed into many subbands using the 3D-ST. Then the relevant subbands from all of the input videos are merged to obtain the corresponding subbands of the intended fused video. Finally, the fused video is constructed by performing the inverse 3D-ST on the merged subband coefficients. Typically, the spatial information in the scene backgrounds and the temporal information related to moving objects are mixed together in each subband. In the proposed fusion method, the spatial and temporal information are actually first separated from each other and then merged using the HOSVD. This is different from the currently published fusion rules (e.g., spatio-temporal energy "maximum" or "matching"), which are usually just simple extensions of static image fusion rules. In these, the spatial and temporal information contained in the input videos are generally treated equally and merged by the same fusion strategy. In addition, we note that the so-called "scene noise" in an input video has been largely ignored by the current literature. We show that this noise can be distinguished from the spatio-temporal objects of interest in the scene and then suppressed using the HOSVD. Clearly, this would be very advantageous for a surveillance system, particularly one dealing with scenes of crowds. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion method exhibits a lower computational complexity than some existing published video fusion methods, such as the ones based on the structure tensor and the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). When the videos are noisy, a modified version of the proposed method is shown to perform better than specialized methods based on the Bivariate-Laplacian model and the PCNN. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Given the huge complexity of network construction, analysis and statistics, toolboxes incorporating these functions are largely lacking. Here, we developed the GRaph thEoreTical Network Analysis (GRETNA) toolbox for imaging connectomics. The GRETNA contains several key features as follows: (i) an open-source, Matlab-based, cross-platform (Windows and UNIX OS) package with a graphical user interface (GUI); (ii) allowing topological analyses of global and local network properties with parallel computing ability, independent of imaging modality and species; (iii) providing flexible manipulations in several key steps during network construction and analysis, which include network node definition, network connectivity processing, network type selection and choice of thresholding procedure; (iv) allowing statistical comparisons of global, nodal and connectional network metrics and assessments of relationship between these network metrics and clinical or behavioral variables of interest; and (v) including functionality in image preprocessing and network construction based on resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI) data. After applying the GRETNA to a publicly released R-fMRI dataset of 54 healthy young adults, we demonstrated that human brain functional networks exhibit efficient small-world, assortative, hierarchical and modular organizations and possess highly connected hubs and that these findings are robust against different analytical strategies. With these efforts, we anticipate that GRETNA will accelerate imaging connectomics in an easy, quick and flexible manner. GRETNA is freely available on the NITRC website.

Methods: Using age-based subgroup data from a randomised Phase-3 clinical trial, nab-PC and sb-PC were compared with respect to overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), safety/toxicity, and quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) with ages >= 60 and >= 70 years as cut points. Results: Among patients aged >= 60 years (N = 546), nab-PC (N = 265) significantly increased ORR and prolonged OS, despite a non-significant improvement in PFS, vs sb-PC (N = 281). Nab-PC improved QoL and was associated with less neuropathy, arthralgia, and myalgia but resulted in more anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Nab-PC yielded significant Q-TWiST benefits (11.1 vs 9.8 months; 95% CI of gain: 0.2-2.6), with a relative Q-TWiST gain of 10.8% (ranging from 6.4% to 15.1% in threshold analysis). In the >= 70 years age group, nab-PC showed similar, but non-significant, ORR, PFS, and Q-TWiST benefits and significantly improved OS and QoL. Conclusion: Nab-PC as first-line therapy in older patients with advanced NSCLC increased ORR, OS, and QoL and resulted in quality-adjusted survival gains compared with standard sb-PC.	[Langer, C.

MicroRNA-22 Gates Long-Term Heterosynaptic Plasticity in Aplysia through Presynaptic Regulation of CPEB and Downstream Targets	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE-C; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PKM-ZETA; NEURONAL ISOFORM; DROSOPHILA ORB2; MEMORY STORAGE; FACILITATION; ENHANCEMENT; PERSISTENCE; CLEAVAGE	The maintenance phase of memory-related long-term facilitation (LTF) of synapses between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia depends on a serotonin (5-HT)-triggered presynaptic upregulation of CPEB, a functional prion that regulates local protein synthesis at the synapse. The mechanisms where by serotonin regulates CPEB levels in presynaptic sensory neurons are not known. Here, we describe a sensory neuron-specific microRNA 22 (miR-22) that has multiple binding sites on the mRNA of CPEB and inhibits it in the basal state. Serotonin triggers MAPK/Erk-dependent downregulation of miR-22, thereby upregulating the expression of CPEB, which in turn regulates, through functional CPE elements, the presynaptic expression of atypical PKC (aPKC), another candidate regulator of memory maintenance. Our findings support a model in which the neurotransmitter-triggered downregulation of miR-22 coordinates the regulation of genes contributing synergistically to the long-term maintenance of memory-related synaptic plasticity.

Results: The internalization of apoD is mediated by a specific cell surface receptor. Conclusion: Basigin, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is implicated in the internalization process of apoD. Significance: This is the first evidence that a specific receptor is involved in apoD internalization. Apolipoprotein D (apoD), a member of the lipocalin family, is a 29-kDa secreted glycoprotein that binds and transports small lipophilic molecules. Expressed in several tissues, apoD is up-regulated under different stress stimuli and in a variety of pathologies. Numerous studies have revealed that overexpression of apoD led to neuroprotection in various mouse models of acute stress and neurodegeneration. This multifunctional protein is internalized in several cells types, but the specific internalization mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the internalization of apoD involves a specific cell surface receptor in 293T cells, identified as the transmembrane glycoprotein basigin (BSG, CD147); more particularly, its low glycosylated form. Our results show that internalized apoD colocalizes with BSG into vesicular compartments. Down-regulation of BSG disrupted the internalization of apoD in cells. In contrast, overexpression of basigin in SH-5YSY cells, which poorly express BSG, restored the uptake of apoD. Cyclophilin A, a known ligand of BSG, competitively reduced apoD internalization, confirming that BSG is a key player in the apoD internalization process. In summary, our results demonstrate that basigin is very likely the apoD receptor and provide additional clues on the mechanisms involved in apoD-mediated functions, including neuroprotection.

We identified three large consanguineous Pakistani families with intellectual disability and in some cases with autistic traits. Methods: Clinical assessments were performed in order to allow comparison of clinical features with other VPS13B mutations. Homozygosity mapping followed by whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing strategies were used to identify disease-related mutations. Results: We identified two novel homozygous deletion mutations in VPS13B, firstly a 1 bp deletion, NM_017890.4:c. 6879delT; p.Phe2293Leufs*24, and secondly a deletion of exons 37-40, which co-segregate with affected status. In addition to COH1-related traits, autistic features were reported in a number of family members, contrasting with the "friendly" demeanour often associated with COH1. The c.6879delT mutation is present in two families from different regions of the country, but both from the Baloch sub-ethnic group, and with a shared haplotype, indicating a founder effect among the Baloch population. Conclusion: We suspect that the c.6879delT mutation may be a common cause of COH1 and similar phenotypes among the Baloch population. Additionally, most of the individuals with the c.6879delT mutation in these two families also present with autistic like traits, and suggests that this variant may lead to a distinct autistic-like COH1 subgroup.

J	O'Reilly, C; Nielsen, T				O'Reilly, Christian; Nielsen, Tore			Automatic sleep spindle detection: benchmarking with fine temporal resolution using open science tools	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep spindles; automatic detection; temporal resolution; reliability; sensitivity; gold standard; assessment	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; S-TRANSFORM; EEG; NIGHT; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM; SPECTRUM; SLOW	Sleep spindle properties index cognitive faculties such as memory consolidation and diseases such as major depression. For this reason, scoring sleep spindle properties in polysomnographic recordings has become an important activity in both research and clinical settings. The tediousness of this manual task has motivated efforts for its automation. Although some progress has been made, increasing the temporal accuracy of spindle scoring and improving the performance assessment methodology are two aspects needing more attention. In this paper, four open-access automated spindle detectors with fine temporal resolution are proposed and tested against expert scoring of two proprietary and two open-access databases. Results highlight several findings: (1) that expert scoring and polysomnographic databases are important confounders when comparing the performance of spindle detectors tested using different databases or scorings; (2) because spindles are sparse events, specificity estimates are potentially misleading for assessing automated detector performance; (3) reporting the performance of spindle detectors exclusively with sensitivity and specificity estimates, as is often seen in the literature, is insufficient; including sensitivity, precision and a more comprehensive statistic such as Matthew's correlation coefficient, F1 -score, or Cohen's K is necessary for adequate evaluation; (4) reporting statistics for some reasonable range of decision thresholds provides a much more complete and useful benchmarking; (5) performance differences between tested automated detectors were found to be similar to those between available expert scorings; (6) much more development is needed to effectively compare the performance of spindle detectors developed by different research teams. Finally, this work clarifies a long-standing but only seldomly posed question regarding whether expert scoring truly is a reliable gold standard for sleep spindle assessment.

Extensive rewiring of epithelial-stromal co-expression networks in breast cancer	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; PROBE LEVEL DATA; TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; IN-SITU; CELLS; PROGRESSION; CARCINOMA; SIGNATURE; FIBROBLASTS	Background: Epithelial-stromal crosstalk plays a critical role in invasive breast cancer pathogenesis; however, little is known on a systems level about how epithelial-stromal interactions evolve during carcinogenesis. Results: We develop a framework for building genome-wide epithelial-stromal co-expression networks composed of pairwise co-expression relationships between mRNA levels of genes expressed in the epithelium and stroma across a population of patients. We apply this method to laser capture micro-dissection expression profiling datasets in the setting of breast carcinogenesis. Our analysis shows that epithelial-stromal co-expression networks undergo extensive rewiring during carcinogenesis, with the emergence of distinct network hubs in normal breast, and estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative invasive breast cancer, and the emergence of distinct patterns of functional network enrichment. In contrast to normal breast, the strongest epithelial-stromal co-expression relationships in invasive breast cancer mostly represent self-loops, in which the same gene is co-expressed in epithelial and stromal regions. We validate this observation using an independent laser capture micro-dissection dataset and confirm that self-loop interactions are significantly increased in cancer by performing computational image analysis of epithelial and stromal protein expression using images from the Human Protein Atlas. Conclusions: Epithelial-stromal co-expression network analysis represents a new approach for systems-level analyses of spatially localized transcriptomic data. The analysis provides new biological insights into the rewiring of epithelial-stromal co-expression networks and the emergence of epithelial-stromal co-expression self-loops in breast cancer. The approach may facilitate the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics targeting epithelial-stromal interactions in cancer.

VARIABILITY IN ACTION: CONTRIBUTIONS OF A SONGBIRD CORTICAL-BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUIT TO VOCAL MOTOR LEARNING AND CONTROL	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						songbird; basal ganglia; reinforcement learning; variability	MALE ZEBRA FINCH; SOCIAL-CONTEXT; FOREBRAIN CIRCUIT; AREA-X; NEURAL ACTIVITY; PARKINSONIAN PRIMATES; RECIPIENT THALAMUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; STRIATAL NEURONS; PREMOTOR CORTEX	Many motor behaviors, from walking to speaking, are acquired through experience, in particular, through trial-and-error learning. The acquisition and maintenance of such motor behaviors in a wide range of species, including humans, appear to depend on cortical-basal ganglia circuits. In this review, we discuss recent studies in songbirds that have been pivotal in informing our current understanding of motor learning and cortical-basal ganglia function. Songbirds are important ethological model systems for the study of motor learning because young songbirds naturally develop and refine their songs through trial-and-error learning. In addition, reinforcement mechanisms are hypothesized to be important for the maintenance and plasticity of structured adult song. Computational and experimental studies highlight the importance of vocal motor variability as the substrate upon which reinforcement mechanisms could operate to shape developing song and to maintain adult song. Recent studies in songbirds indicate that this vocal motor variability is actively generated and modulated by a highly specialized cortical-basal ganglia circuit evolved for a single behavior, song. We argue that these and other recent findings illustrate how the tight association between a specialized neural circuit and a natural behavior make songbirds a unique and powerful model in which to investigate the neural substrates of motor learning and plasticity.

It is known that the allocation of spatial attention modulates the amplitude of LFPs in visual areas of primates. An issue that remains poorly investigated is whether and how attention modulates LFPs in executive brain areas, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), thought to be involved in the origins of attention. Weaddressed this issue by recording LFPs from multielectrode arrays implanted in the LPFC of two macaques. We found that the allocation of attention can be reliably decoded on a single-trial basis from ensembles of LFPs with frequencies >60 Hz. Using LFP frequencies <60 Hz, we could not decode the allocation of attention, but we could decode the location of a visual stimulus as well as the endpoint of saccades toward that stimulus. The information contained in the high-frequency LFPs was fully redundant with the information contained in the spiking activity of single neurons recorded from the same electrodes. Moreover, the decoding of attention using gamma frequency LFPs was less accurate than using spikes, but it was twice more stable across time. Finally, decorrelating the LFP signals from the different electrodes increased decoding performance in the high frequencies by up to similar to 14%. Our findings suggest that LFPs recorded from chronically implanted multielectrode arrays in the LPFC contain information about sensory, cognitive, and motor components of a task in a frequency-dependent manner.

Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPAR. expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPAR. target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPAR gamma. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPAR. transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver.

The limited intrinsic regenerative response mounted by adult central nervous system (CNS) neurons is further hampered by astrogliosis, myelin debris and scar tissue that characterize the damaged CNS. Improved axon regeneration and recovery can be elicited by targeting extrinsic factors as well as by boosting neuron-intrinsic growth regulators. Our knowledge of the molecular basis of intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of regeneration has expanded rapidly, resulting in promising new targets to promote repair. Intriguingly certain neuron-intrinsic growth regulators are emerging as promising targets to both stimulate growth and relieve extrinsic inhibition of regeneration. This crossroads between the intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of spinal cord injury is a promising target for effective therapies for this unmet need.

The juxtamembrane region of synaptotagmin 1 interacts with dynamin 1 and regulates vesicle fission during compensatory endocytosis in endocrine cells	JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE			English	Article						Compensatory endocytosis; Chromaffin cells; Synaptotagmin; Syt1; Dynamin	CLATHRIN-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; RAPID ENDOCYTOSIS; CHROMAFFIN CELLS; SORTING ADAPTER; FUSION PORE; MEMBRANE; PHOSPHORYLATION; EXOCYTOSIS; STONIN-2; RELEASE	Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is a synaptic vesicle protein that is important for the kinetics of both exocytosis and endocytosis, and is thus a candidate molecule to link these two processes. Although the tandem Ca2+-binding C2 domains of Syt1 have important roles in exocytosis and endocytosis, the function of the conserved juxtamembrane (jxm) linker region has yet to be determined. We now demonstrate that the jxm region of Syt1 interacts directly with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the endocytic protein dynamin 1. By using cell-attached capacitance recordings with millisecond time resolution to monitor clathrin-mediated endocytosis of single vesicles in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, we find that loss of this interaction prolongs the lifetime of the fission pore leading to defects in the dynamics of vesicle fission. These results indicate a previously undescribed interaction between two major regulatory proteins in the secretory vesicle cycle and that this interaction regulates endocytosis.

We have shown that the expression of the circadian clock protein PER1 in the forebrain is modulated by stress, and that this effect is associated with changes in plasma corticosterone levels, suggesting a possible role for glucocorticoids in the mediation of stress-induced changes in the expression of PER1 in the brain. To study this, we assessed the effects of adrenalectomy and of pretreatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone, on the expression of PER1 in select limbic and hypothalamic regions following acute exposure to a neurogenic stressor, restraint, or a systemic stressor, 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in rats. Acute restraint suppressed PER1 expression in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEAl), whereas 2DG increased PER1 in both regions. Both stressors increased PER1 expression in the paraventricular (PVN) and dorsomedial (DMH) nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the piriform cortex (Pi). Adrenalectomy and pretreatment with mifepristone reversed the effects of both stressors on PER1 expression in the BNSTov and CEAl, and blocked their effects in the DMH. In contrast, both treatments enhanced the effects of restraint and 2DG on PER1 levels in the PVN. Stress-induced PER1 expression in the Pi was unaffected by either treatment. PER1 expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian clock, was not altered by either exposure to stress or by the glucocorticoid manipulations. Together, the results demonstrate a key role for glucocorticoid signaling in stress-induced changes in PER1 expression in the brain.

We characterized the sleep-wake cycle in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD, which overexpresses a mutant human form of amyloid precursor protein resulting in high levels of beta-amyloid and plaque formation by 3 months of age. Polysomnographic recordings in freely-moving mice were conducted to study sleep-wake cycle architecture at 3, 7 and 11 months of age and corresponding levels of beta-amyloid in brain regions regulating sleep-wake states were measured. At all ages, TgCRND8 mice showed increased wakefulness and reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the resting and active phases. Increased wakefulness in TgCRND8 mice was accompanied by a shift in the waking power spectrum towards fast frequency oscillations in the beta (14-20 Hz) and low gamma range (20-50 Hz). Given the phenotype of hyperarousal observed in TgCRND8 mice, the role of noradrenergic transmission in the promotion of arousal, and previous work reporting an early disruption of the noradrenergic system in TgCRND8, we tested the effects of the alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, prazosin, on sleep-wake patterns in TgCRND8 and non-transgenic (NTg) mice. We found that a lower dose (2 mg/kg) of prazosin increased NREM sleep in NTg but not in TgCRND8 mice, whereas a higher dose (5 mg/kg) increased NREM sleep in both genotypes, suggesting altered sensitivity to noradrenergic blockade in TgCRND8 mice. Collectively our results demonstrate that amyloidosis in TgCRND8 mice is associated with sleep-wake cycle dysfunction, characterized by hyperarousal, validating this model as a tool towards understanding the relationship between beta-amyloid overproduction and disrupted sleep-wake patterns in AD.

TSPO is a drug- and cholesterol-binding protein found at particularly high levels in steroid synthesizing cells. Its aberrant expression has been linked to cancer, neurodegeneration, neuropsychiatric disorders and primary hypogonadism. Brain steroids serve as local regulators of neural development and excitability. Reduced levels of these steroids have been linked to depression, anxiety and neurodegeneration. Reduced serum testosterone is common among subfertile young men and aging men, and is associated with depression, metabolic syndrome and reduced sexual function. Although testosterone-replacement therapy is available, there are undesired side-effects. TSPO drug ligands have been proposed as therapeutic agents to regulate steroid levels in the brain and testis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wt, 165.23 Da) were selected and identified in vitro using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) approach. Aptamers with dissociation constants (K-d) of nanomolar range were isolated. The aptamer sequence of highest affinity was used to design a label-free impedance based aptasensor to assay ATX, for which there are no reported biosensors so far. The aptamer self assembled monolayer is formed on a gold electrode using the disulfide modified aptamer. The assembly process of the aptasensor was characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Upon ATX binding to the immobilized aptamer, a significant decrease in the electron-transfer resistance was observed as a result of the aptamer conformation change, which is used as the sensor signal. The aptasensor showed a limit of detection of 0.5 nM and a wide linear range for ATX concentrations between 1 nM and 100 nM. The K-d of anti-ATX aptamer was calculated by electrochemical methods as well as the fluorescence. Interestingly, the K-d that was calculated from the aptasensor signal showed a lower value implying that the anchoring of the aptamer on the Au surface enhanced its affinity to ATX. The ATX aptasensor showed high stability as well as high specificity against common cynaobacterial toxins. Further development of biosensors that use anatoxin-a binding aptamers as a new recognition receptors could provide potential alternatives to the traditional assays for fast and simple monitoring of anatoxin-a.

Our objective was to compare the measurements obtained with digital image analysis (DIA) versus virtual microscopy (visual scoring (VS)). Methods: To do so, we compared the measurement distributions of each technique and their ability to predict clinically useful endpoints. A tissue microarray series from a cohort of 225 men who underwent radical prostatectomy was immunostained for Ki-67. The percentage of Ki-67 positive nuclei in malignant cells was assessed both by VS and DIA, and a H-score was calculated. The distribution and predictive ability of these scoring methods to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) and death from prostate cancer (DPCa) were compared using Mann-Whitney test and C-index. Results: The measurements obtained with VS were similar to the DIA measurements (p = 0.73) but dissimilar to the H-score (p < 0.001). Cox regression models showed that Ki-67 was associated with BCR (HR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.10-1.94) and DPCa (HR 1.26, 95 % CI 1.06-1.50). C-indexes revealed that Ki-67 was a better predictor of DPCa (0.803, 0.8059 and 0.789; VS, DIA and H-score, respectively) than of BCR (0.625, 0.632 and 0.604; VS, DIA and H-score, respectively). Conclusion: The measurement distributions and the predictive abilities of VS and DIA were similar and presented the same predictive behaviour in our cohort, supporting the role of Ki-67 proliferative index as an important prognostic factor of BCR and DPCa in prostate cancer post RP.

Microglia dysregulation is thought to be causal for a group of neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, called "microgliopathies". However, how the intracellular stimulation machinery in microglia is controlled is poorly understood. Here, we identified the ubiquitin-specific protease (Usp) 18 in white matter microglia that essentially contributes to microglial quiescence. We further found that microglial Usp18 negatively regulates the activation of Stat1 and concomitant induction of interferon-induced genes, thereby terminating IFN signaling. The Usp18-mediated control was independent from its catalytic activity but instead required the interaction with Ifnar2. Additionally, the absence of Ifnar1 restored microglial activation, indicating a tonic IFN signal which needs to be negatively controlled by Usp18 under non-diseased conditions. These results identify Usp18 as a critical negative regulator of microglia activation and demonstrate a protective role of Usp18 for microglia function by regulating the Ifnar pathway. The findings establish Usp18 as a new molecule preventing destructive microgliopathy.

IMAGEN Consortium	Correlated gene expression supports synchronous activity in brain networks	SCIENCE			English	Article							RESTING STATE NETWORKS; MOUSE-BRAIN; TRANSCRIPTOME; CONNECTIVITY; ATLAS	During rest, brain activity is synchronized between different regions widely distributed throughout the brain, forming functional networks. However, the molecular mechanisms supporting functional connectivity remain undefined. We show that functional brain networks defined with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can be recapitulated by using measures of correlated gene expression in a post mortem brain tissue data set. The set of 136 genes we identify is significantly enriched for ion channels. Polymorphisms in this set of genes significantly affect resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of healthy adolescents. Expression levels of these genes are also significantly associated with axonal connectivity in the mouse. The results provide convergent, multimodal evidence that resting-state functional networks correlate with the orchestrated activity of dozens of genes linked to ion channel activity and synaptic function.

Robust estimation of group-wise cortical correspondence with an application to macaque and human neuroimaging studies	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						group-wise registration; cortical surface; spherical harmonics; entropy minimization; sulcal curve; surface registration	SURFACE REGISTRATION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; THICKNESS; BRAIN	We present a novel group-wise registration method for cortical correspondence for local cortical thickness analysis in human and non-human primate neuroimaging studies. The proposed method is based on our earlier template based registration that estimates a continuous, smooth deformation field via sulcal curve-constrained registration employing spherical harmonic decomposition of the deformation field. This pairwise registration though results in a well-known template selection bias, which we aim to overcome here via a group-wise approach. We propose the use of an unbiased ensemble entropy minimization following the use of the pairwise registration as an initialization. An individual deformation field is then iteratively updated onto the unbiased average. For the optimization, we use metrics specific for cortical correspondence though all of these are straightforwardly extendable to the generic setting: The first focused on optimizing the correspondence of automatically extracted sulcal landmarks and the second on that of sulcal depth property maps. We further propose a robust entropy metric and a hierarchical optimization by employing spherical harmonic basis orthogonality. We also provide the detailed methodological description of both our earlier work and the proposed method with a set of experiments on a population of human and non-human primate subjects. In the experiment, we have shown that our method achieves superior results on consistency through quantitative and visual comparisons as compared to the existing methods.

Current conceptual challenges in the study of rhythm processing deficits	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						rhythm; beat; meter; beat deafness; auditory-motor mapping; dysrhythmia; sensorimotor synchronization; poor synchronization	BEAT PERCEPTION	Interest in the study of rhythm processing deficits (RPD) is currently growing in the cognitive neuroscience community, as this type of investigation constitutes a powerful tool for the understanding of normal rhythm processing. Because this field is in its infancy, it still lacks a common conceptual vocabulary to facilitate effective communication between different researchers and research groups. In this commentary, we provide a brief review of recent reports of RPD through the lens of one important empirical issue: the method by which beat perception is measured, and the consequences of method selection for the researcher's ability to specify which mechanisms are impaired in RPD. This critical reading advocates for the importance of matching measurement tools to the putative neurocognitive mechanisms under study, and reveals the need for effective and specific assessments of the different aspects of rhythm perception and synchronization.

Habitual action video game playing is associated with caudate nucleus-dependent navigational strategies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						action video games; striatum; hippocampus; spatial memory; response learning; visual attention	MULTIPLE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; VISUAL-SEARCH; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; DOPAMINE RELEASE; LONGITUDINAL MRI; SPATIAL MEMORY; BRAIN SYSTEMS; GRAY-MATTER; MAZE TASKS; LIFE-SPAN	The habitual playing of video games is associated with increased grey matter and activity in the striatum. Studies in humans and rodents have shown an inverse relationship between grey matter in the striatum and hippocampus. We investigated whether action video game playing is also associated with increased use of response learning strategies during navigation, known to be dependent on the caudate nudeus of the striatum, when presented in a dual solution task. We tested 26 action video game players (actionVGPs) and 33 non-action video game players (nonVGPs) on the 4-on-8 virtual maze and a visual attention event-related potential (ERP) task, which elicits a robust N-2-posterior-controlateral (N2pc) component. We found that actionVGPs had a significantly higher likelihood of using a response learning strategy (80.76%) compared to non VGPs (42.42%). Consistent with previous evidence, actionVGPs and nonVGPs differed in the way they deployed visual attention to central and peripheral targets as observed in the elicited N2pc component during an ERP visual attention task. Increased use of the response strategy in actionVGPs is consistent with previously observed increases in striatal volume in video game players (VGPs). Using response strategies is associated with decreased grey matter in the hippocampus. Previous studies have shown that decreased volume in the hippocampus precedes the onset of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. If actionVGPs have lower grey matter in the hippocampus, as response learners normally do, then these individuals could be at increased risk of developing neurological and psychiatric disorders during their lifetime.

Direct 4D PET MLEM reconstruction of parametric images using the simplified reference tissue model with the basis function method for [C-11]raclopride	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						positron emission tomography; image reconstruction; tracer kinetic modeling; binding potential	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; EM ALGORITHM; BRAIN; ADULTS; SPACE; HRRT; MRI	This work assesses the one-step late maximum likelihood expectation maximization (OSL-MLEM) 4D PET reconstruction algorithm for direct estimation of parametric images from raw PET data when using the simplified reference tissue model with the basis function method (SRTM-BFM) for the kinetic analysis. To date, the OSL-MLEM method has been evaluated using kinetic models based on two-tissue compartments with an irreversible component. We extend the evaluation of this method for twotissue compartments with a reversible component, using SRTM-BFM on simulated 3D + time data sets (with use of [C-11] raclopride time-activity curves from real data) and on real data sets acquired with the high resolution research tomograph. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing voxel-level binding potential (BPND) estimates with those obtained from conventional post-reconstruction kinetic parameter estimation. For the commonly chosen number of iterations used in practice, our results show that for the 3D + time simulation, the direct method delivers results with lower %RMSE at the normal count level (decreases of 9-10 percentage points, corresponding to a 38-44% reduction), and also at low count levels (decreases of 17-21 percentage points, corresponding to a 26-36% reduction). As for the real 3D data set, the results obtained follow a similar trend, with the direct reconstruction method offering a 21% decrease in (CV)-C-% compared to the post reconstruction method at low count levels. Thus, based on the results presented herein, using the SRTM-BFM kinetic model in conjunction with the OSL-MLEM direct 4D PET MLEM reconstruction method offers an improvement in performance when compared to conventional post reconstruction methods.

By using neural networks and deriving adaptive rules based on the steepest descent algorithm, the authors present a stable output feedback control scheme, which is applicable to a wide class of unknown complicated non-linear systems. Therefore an approach based on the dynamic back propagation algorithm is proposed to develop the adaption laws for systems with more general model structure. Using Lyapunov's direct method, uniformly ultimately boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system is also ensured. Moreover, it is shown that the bounds on the tracking errors depend on the designing parameters. Hence, an arbitrarily small tracking error can be achieved by adjusting the parameters properly. Finally, simulation results performed on a non-affine uncertain non-linear system having internal dynamics are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the theoretical discussions.

In a small proportion of patients, no mutation in either gene or only one mutation is found. Analysis of the POLR3B cDNA revealed a large deletion of exons 21-22 in one case and of exons 26-27 in another case. These are the first reports of long deletions causing POLR3-related leukodystrophy, suggesting that deletions and duplications in POLR3A or POLR3B should be investigated in patients with a compatible phenotype, especially if one pathogenic variant has been identified.

First, males are more susceptible than females to perturbations in genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Second, sex-related differences in non-autistic brain structure and function are observed in highly variable regions, namely, the heteromodal associative cortices, and overlap with structural particularities and enhanced activity of perceptual associative regions in autistic individuals. Finally, functional cortical reallocations following brain lesions in non-autistic adults (for example, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis) are sex-dependent. Interactions between genetic sex and hormones may therefore result in higher synaptic and consecutively regional plasticity in perceptual brain areas in males than in females. The onset of autism may largely involve mutations altering synaptic plasticity that create a plastic reaction affecting the most variable and sexually dimorphic brain regions. The sex ratio bias in autism may arise because males have a lower threshold than females for the development of this plastic reaction following a genetic or environmental event.

Stereotaxic coordinate systems have also been developed for experimental animals including non-human primates, dogs, and rodents. However, they are lacking for other species being relevant in experimental neuroscience including sheep. Here, we present a spatial, unbiased ovine brain template with tissue probability maps (TPM) that offer a detailed stereotaxic reference frame for anatomical features and localization of brain areas, thereby enabling inter-individual and cross-study comparability. Three-dimensional data sets from healthy adult Merino sheep (Ovis orientalis aries, 12 ewes and 26 neutered rams) were acquired on a 1.5 T Philips MRI using a T1w sequence. Data were averaged by linear and non-linear registration algorithms. Moreover, animals were subjected to detailed brain volume analysis including examinations with respect to body weight (BW), age, and sex. The created T1w brain template provides an appropriate population-averaged ovine brain anatomy in a spatial standard coordinate system. Additionally, TPM for gray (GM) and white (WM) matter as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) classification enabled automatic prior-based tissue segmentation using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Overall, a positive correlation of GM volume and BW explained about 15% of the variance of GM while a positive correlation between WM and age was found. Absolute tissue volume differences were not detected, indeed ewes showed significantly more GM per bodyweight as compared to neutered rams. The created framework including spatial brain template and TPM represent a useful tool for unbiased automatic image preprocessing and morphological characterization in sheep. Therefore, the reported results may serve as a starting point for further experimental and/or translational research aiming at in vivo analysis in this species.

THE PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL (D-ASPARTYL) METHYLTRANSFERASE PROTECTS AGAINST DOPAMINE-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN NEUROBLASTOMA SH-SY5Y CELLS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						protein L-isoaspartyl (D-aspartyl) methyltransferase; PIMT; dopamine; apoptosis; Parkinson's disease; oxidative stress	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; RAT-BRAIN; CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; REPAIR ENZYME; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; MUTATIONS; CASPASE-9	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder in the world. The main causes of neurodegeneration in PD are mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress promoted by dopamine (DA) metabolism in the cytosol. Protein L-isoaspartyl (D-aspartyl) methyltransferase (PIMT) is a protein repair enzyme with anti-apoptotic properties. We previously reported that PIMT was downregulated at both gene and protein levels by DA-induced oxidative stresses in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic function of PIMT toward DA-induced cell death to better understand its specific neuroprotective role. Overexpression of wild-type PIMT, in contrast to its inactive mutant, protected SH-SY5Y cells from cell death and caspase 3 activation upon DA treatments. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as measured by caspase 9 activity was triggered by reactive oxygen species produced from DA metabolism, and overexpression of wild-type PIMT completely prevented caspase 9 activity stimulated by DA. In addition, cells overexpressing wild-type PIMT produced significantly less reactive oxygen species despite DA treatment compared to cells that do not overexpress PIMT. Together, these data indicate that DA-associated PIMT downregulation is an important event contributing to neuronal cell death. More importantly, the PIMT anti-apoptotic capacity seems to be dependent on its involvement in the cellular antioxidant machinery. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Separate lines of research have implicated the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in the judgment of social traits on the one hand and economic decision-making on the other, making this region a plausible candidate for linking social attributions to voting decisions. Here, we asked whether OFC lesions in humans disrupted the ability to judge traits of political candidates or affected how these judgments influenced voting decisions. Seven patients with lateral OFC damage, 18 patients with frontal damage sparing the lateral OFC, and 53 matched healthy participants took part in a simulated election paradigm, in which they voted for real-life (but unknown) candidates based only on photographs of their faces. Consistent with previous work, attributions of "competence" and "attractiveness" based on candidate appearance predicted voting behavior in the healthy control group. Frontal damage did not affect substantially the ability to make competence or attractiveness judgments, but patients with damage to the lateral OFC differed from other groups in how they applied this information when voting. Only attractiveness ratings had any predictive power for voting choices after lateral OFC damage, whereas other frontal patients and healthy controls relied on information about both competence and attractiveness in making their choice. An intact lateral OFC may not be necessary for judgment of social traits based on physical appearance, but it seems to be crucial in applying this information in political decision-making.

Age-related changes in sleep spindles characteristics during daytime recovery following a 25-hour sleep deprivation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; sleep spindles; circadian process; sleep loss; homeostatic sleep pressure	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; MIDDLE YEARS; CIRCADIAN MODULATION; EEG; BRAIN; YOUNG; LIFE; OSCILLATIONS; TOPOGRAPHY	Objectives: The mechanisms underlying sleep spindles (similar to 11-15 Hz; >0.5 s) help to protect sleep. With age, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain sleep at a challenging time (e.g., daytime), even after sleep loss. This study compared spindle characteristics during daytime recovery and nocturnal sleep in young and middle-aged adults. In addition, we explored whether spindles characteristics in baseline nocturnal sleep were associated with the ability to maintain sleep during daytime recovery periods in both age groups. Methods: Twenty-nine young (15 women and 14 men; 27.3 y +/- 5.0) and 31 middle-aged (19 women and 13 men; 51.6 y +/- 5.1) healthy subjects participated in a baseline nocturnal sleep and a daytime recovery sleep after 25 hours of sleep deprivation. Spindles were detected on artifact-free Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep epochs. Spindle density (nb/min), amplitude (mu V), frequency (Hz), and duration (s) were analyzed on parasagittal (linked ears) derivations. Results: In young subjects, spindle frequency increased during daytime recovery sleep as compared to baseline nocturnal sleep in all derivations, whereas middle-aged subjects showed spindle frequency enhancement only in the prefrontal derivation. No other significant interaction between age group and sleep condition was observed. Spindle density for all derivations and centro-occipital spindle amplitude decreased whereas prefrontal spindle amplitude increased from baseline to daytime recovery sleep in both age groups. Finally, no significant correlation was found between spindle characteristics during baseline nocturnal sleep and the marked reduction in sleep efficiency during daytime recovery sleep in both young and middle-aged subjects. Conclusion: These results suggest that the interaction between homeostatic and circadian pressure modulates spindle frequency differently in aging. Spindle characteristics do not seem to be linked with the ability to maintain daytime recovery sleep.	[Rosinvil, T.; Lafortune, M.; Sekerovic, Z.; Bouchard, M.; Dube, J.; Martin, N.; Lina, J.

In a production facility, measure for efficiency can be based on the total cost of transporting the items between different departments and throughout the facility. However, other factors may influence efficiency of the manufacturing facility too. As such are: supporting the organisation's vision through improved material handling, material flow and control; effectively assigning people, equipment, space and energy; minimising capital investment; adaptability and ease of maintenance; as well as providing for employee safety and job satisfaction. By incorporating health and safety measures in the initial design of a facility layout, the organisation may avoid money and manpower loss resulting from industrial accidents. This paper proposes a facility layout planning methodology which integrates the occupational health and safety (OHS) features in the early design of a facility layout. The model considers transportation cost in the facility as well as safety concerns. By this means, the OHS issues are reflected prior to the construction of a facility.

J	Stip, E				Stip, Emmanuel			PRESENTATION History of psychiatry at the University of Montreal: passages and deadlocks	SANTE MENTALE AU QUEBEC			French	Article						history; psychiatry; psychoanalysis; lithium; sleep		In its current form, the Departement de psychiatrie at the Universite de Montreal (UdeM) was created in 1964. The first person to have headed was Dr. Gerard Beaudoin. Between 1948 and 1964, several others psychiatrists were heading the Departement without necessary bearing a particular title. The directors of the Departement from 1951 to now were: Drs. Fernand Cote, Camille Laurin, Gerard Beaudoin, Yvon Gauthier, Arthur Amyot, Francis Borgeat, Hugues Cormier, Sylvain Palardy, Jean Hebert, and Emmanuel Stip. When the Departement opened, it was the second institution in Montreal that was training psychiatrists. During the first year, there were 3 psychiatric residents, but within 20 years this number had increased to 63. From the early years, teaching psychiatry to residents, and subsequently to all UdeM medical students, has been a priority in the Departement, and over the years many psychiatrists trained at UdeM have attained leadership positions elsewhere. The Departement attained an early reputation for excellence in both clinical and basic research. The strengths the Departement developed in its early years in clinical psychopharmacology, in basic research in neurotransmitters, sleep, cognition, forensic, and in community psychiatry have been augmented more recently with active programs in psychotherapy research, substance abuse research, psychoneuroendocrinology, developmental aspects of behavior, genetics, epigenetics as well as the study of the brain through a variety of brain scanning techniques. The history of the Departement de psychiatrie de l'Universite de Montreal is largely dependent on that of each of the institutions affiliated to the Universite: the Pavillon Albert-Prevost de l'Hopital du Sacre-Coeur de Montreal (HSCM), the Institut universitaire en sante mentale de Montreal (IUSMM) and the CHU Sainte-Justine. We must also remember that the discovery of the potentiating of lithium by antidepressants was made by Dr. Demontigny team at the Hopital Louis-H. Lafontaine (now IUSMM). Significant advances related to the interaction between the psychoanalytic movement and community psychiatry were greatly influenced by the work at the Pavillon Albert-Prevost and the emergence of behavioral therapies (Dr. Yves Lamontagne) and cognitive studies conducted by the Hopital Louis-H. Lafontaine. Great discoveries about sleep were performed at the Hopital du Sacre-Coeur de Montreal by teams gathered around Jacques-Yves Montplaisir. We also recall that two ministers from the Quebec government with important political responsibilities were members or directors of the Departement de psychiatrie. These are Drs. Camille Laurin and Denis Lazure. The Departement aims to strengthen clinical and basic research by contributing new knowledge that will improve care for people with mental disorders. These efforts benefit both patients and the medical students and residents being trained to care for them. The Departement remains committed to its program, to predoctoral education (ensuring that all medical students at the Universite are trained to recognize, diagnose, and be familiar with treatment options for mental disorders), to post-doctoral education for future psychiatrists, and to the care of Quebec's patients. For over 50 years, the academic department has played a key role in attracting and recruiting excellent academic and clinical resources to staff the programs and services of our hospital partners.

J	Doucet, P				Doucet, Pierre			To become a psychiatrist in Quebec in the 50s to 60s	SANTE MENTALE AU QUEBEC			French	Article						history of psychiatry; residency program in psychiatry; Pierre Doucet		The author is the witness of a historic period of the psychiatry in the province of Quebec in Canada, widely francophone. He describes the context, the training in psychiatry, and the care. In Quebec, in the 1950s, the psychiatry did not exist as such as speciality. There was however a discipline: the neuropsychiatry. It was managed by the neurologists who agreed to take care of cases of psychiatry, which few doctors wanted to treat at this moment. The religious and rural society in Quebec of the 1950s got ready for the "Revolution tranquille". The latter finally burst after 1960. But the artistic environment was already in full excitement, and from 1948, it showed its opposition to the values which were current with the publication of the Refus global. Among the signatories of the latter, we find Bruno Cormier as medical student who will become, after 1950, a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. To become a psychiatrist, it was necessary to be trained as an intern in a residency program in the USA, UK or in France. The residency in the United States in the 1950s represented a great adventure for the young doctors of Quebec, especially for the French speakers. At the end of 1950s, the pharmacology emerged. However, he described his own experience as an observer or an actor with ECT, Sakel cure and about the lobotomy.

J	Reid, W; Amyot, A				Reid, Wilfrid; Amyot, Arthur			The role of psychoanalysts in the history of the Departement de psychiatrie de l'Universite de Montreal	SANTE MENTALE AU QUEBEC			French	Article						psychoanalysis; history; Departement de psychiatrie de l'Universite de Montreal		Objectives The authors want to illustrate how psychoanalysis or best a certain psychoanalytical vision without dogmatism and theoretical exclusivism have played an important role in the history of the university department. Methods The authors have made a recension of the principal activities of three psychoanalysts and their immediate collaborators: Dr. Camille Laurin, Dr. Yvon Gauthier and Dr. Arthur Amyot. Results Dr. Laurin permitted psychiatry to become a distinct discipline from neurology. He greatly emphasized the pre-graduate and post-graduate cursus: he has also endowed the department with the first complete program of residency. Dr. Gauthier, in a way, built the administrative organization by creating its principal committees. Dr. Amyot really formed the university network by integrating the different hospitals in the projects and the decisions of the department. Conclusion Each one, in his own way, contributed to one of the distinctive marks of the department, that is the importance given to psychotherapy training. In so doing, they favoured the transmission of psychiatry in which the bio-psycho-social perspective is not a vain word.

J	Borgeat, F; Dongier, M				Borgeat, Franois; Dongier, Maurice			The changes in values and beliefs through the first 50 years of the Departement de psychiatrie de l'Universite de Montreal	SANTE MENTALE AU QUEBEC			French	Article						University of Montreal; values; beliefs; psychiatry		This essay attempts to describe and discuss the major changes in values and fundamental beliefs related to clinical practice within the Departement de psychiatrie de l'Universite de Montreal since its creation fifty years ago. Being an essay, the methods include shared recollections, discussions with colleagues, especially between the co-authors, and the study of some documents related to the practice of psychiatry 40 to 50 years ago. Five major axes of change are proposed: 1-From psychoanalysis to brain diseases, 2-From "Can a non-physician practice psychoanalysis?" to "Can a psychiatrist still perform psychotherapy?" 3-From continuity of care to episodes of treatment, 4-From treatment first to repeated assessments of patients, 5-From love that can heal and repair to a taboo of love. Finally it is suggested that the increasing emphasis on psychopharmacology and on DSM classifications has contributed to a shift from attempts to understand the intimate nature of symptoms and suffering to a priority given to rather mechanical clinical assessments in search of "objective" criteria.

J	Montplaisir, J				Montplaisir, Jacques			Sleep Medicine: 1965 to 2015	SANTE MENTALE AU QUEBEC			French	Article						sleep medicine; history; fundamental research; diagnosis; treatment	RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; BEHAVIOR DISORDER; APNEA SYNDROME; DOUBLE-BLIND; MARKERS; NEURODEGENERATION; ASSOCIATION; DEPRIVATION	The Departement de psychiatrie de l'Universite de Montreal houses one of the first sleep centers founded 40 years ago. This center contributed to virtually every aspect of sleep medicine. It grew considerably over time to become one of the largest sleep centers worldwide. It is now called the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine (CARSM). Fourteen researchers and more than 30 research PhDs and postdoctoral fellows are working together in a 1,500 square-meter facility that includes separate units for fundamental and clinical studies and for the sleep disorders clinic. It has 10 polysomnographic recording rooms, 3 isolated units devoted to chronobiological studies, a high resolution SPECT imaging laboratory specifically devoted to sleep research, a high-density EEG unit and a psychophysiological laboratory to study the interaction between pain and sleep. This article relates the history of the CARSM and also presents a personal sleep odyssey. The CARSM has been very active in the description of clinical features and definitions of the phenotype of most sleep disorders. It contributed specifically to the development of diagnostic tools in narcolepsy (the multiple sleep latency test in different age groups), in nocturnal epilepsy (development of a method to localize the primary focus using in-depth electrodes recording during rapid eye movement sleep), in sleep bruxism (a method for scoring masticatory muscle activity during sleep and definition of cut-off values), in the restless legs syndrome (RLS: the suggested immobilisation test), in sleepwalking (sleep deprivation and experimental awakenings) and REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD: development of the first polygraphic method to diagnose RBD). The CARSM also contributed to the knowledge on the epidemiology of sleep disorders, conducting the first population-based prevalence study of RLS and of sleep bruxism. Researchers at the CARMS also looked at the impact of sleep disorders like narcolepsy, RLS, sleep apnea and the parasomnias on daytime cognitive functions and cardiovascular health. The CARSM collaborates with researchers throughout the world to elucidate the genetic bases of several disorders, especially narcolepsy, RLS, RBD and parasomnias in children and adults, through large well-defined cohorts of patients and normal subjects. Finally, the CARSM has made original contributions to the development of new treatments of sleep disorders, especially the dopaminergic treatments of RLS (first with levodopa and then with pramipexole). Current research also involves the identification of prodromal markers of Parkinson disease and dementia in patients with RBD as to build a ready-to trial cohort to test the efficacy of neuroprotective agents. In summary, the CARSM is a center dedicated to basic and clinical research on sleep and circadian rhythms. It is located at the Hopital du Sacre-Coeur de Montreal but involves several other researchers at the Universite de Montreal and at other universities in Canada and in the world.

Fortunately enough, some of them have taken the road towards the "Dark Third of Life": sleep. This article gives an historical account of the development of the first Canadian sleep disorders laboratory and clinic specifically and selectively designed for children and adolescents with a psychiatric diagnosis. It then stresses the importance of sleep in children bearing a psychiatric diagnosis and summarizes therapeutic strategies. Methods Data-on-file and selective review of literature. Results An innovative scheme matching sleep psychologists and psychiatrists with expertise in neurodevelopmental disorders led to the creation of a sleep research laboratory on mental health disorders. The initial research projects on the sleep and dreams of patients with schizophrenia and persons with autism are summarized. The Sleep Disorders Clinic for Children and Adolescents was then created at the Hopital Riviere-des-Prairies, leading to much needed activities focused on youth. Indeed, sleep disorders show a high prevalence in children with a psychiatric diagnosis and the literature shows that these children have an increased sensitivity for diurnal effects of poor sleep. The main sleep-relevant issues at stake are reviewed, including the high frequency of sleep disorders in pedopsychiatric patients. Clinical challenges are described and the operating mode of the Sleep Disorders Clinic is illustrated. Conclusion Sleep disorders and their effects on daytime functioning need to be assessed in children with a psychiatric diagnosis in order to generate a full clinical picture. Appropriate tools and know-how are readily available in order to achieve this goal.

Altered PLP1 splicing causes hypomyelination of early myelinating structures	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PELIZAEUS-MERZBACHER-DISEASE; PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN GENE; SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA TYPE-2; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXON 3; MUTATIONS; DISORDERS; OLIGODENDROCYTES; FAMILY; PREDICTION	Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic etiology of the X-linked disorder "Hypomyelination of Early Myelinating Structures" (HEMS). Methods: We included 16 patients from 10 families diagnosed with HEMS by brain MRI criteria. Exome sequencing was used to search for causal mutations. In silico analysis of effects of the mutations on splicing and RNA folding was performed. In vitro gene splicing was examined in RNA from patients' fibroblasts and an immortalized immature oligodendrocyte cell line after transfection with mutant minigene splicing constructs. Results: All patients had unusual hemizygous mutations of PLP1 located in exon 3B (one deletion, one missense and two silent), which is spliced out in isoform DM20, or in intron 3 (five mutations). The deletion led to truncation of PLP1, but not DM20. Four mutations were predicted to affect PLP1/DM20 alternative splicing by creating exonic splicing silencer motifs or new splice donor sites or by affecting the local RNA structure of the PLP1 splice donor site. Four deep intronic mutations were predicted to destabilize a long-distance interaction structure in the secondary PLP1 RNA fragment involved in regulating PLP1/DM20 alternative splicing. Splicing studies in fibroblasts and transfected cells confirmed a decreased PLP1/DM20 ratio. Interpretation: Brain structures that normally myelinate early are poorly myelinated in HEMS, while they are the best myelinated structures in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, also caused by PLP1 alterations. Our data extend the phenotypic spectrum of PLP1-related disorders indicating that normal PLP1/DM20 alternative splicing is essential for early myelination and support the need to include intron 3 in diagnostic sequencing.

Baroreflex Activation Therapy for the Treatment of Heart Failure With a Reduced Ejection Fraction	JACC-HEART FAILURE			English	Article						autonomic nervous system; baroreflex; device; heart failure; randomized controlled trial	INHIBITION; METOPROLOL; SYSTEM; TRIAL; HF	OBJECTIVES The objective of this clinical trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of carotid BAT in advanced HF. BACKGROUND Increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity contribute to heart failure (HF) symptoms and disease progression. Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) results in centrally mediated reduction of sympathetic outflow and increased parasympathetic activity. METHODS Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III HF and ejection fractions <= 35% on chronic stable guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) were enrolled at 45 centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. They were randomly assigned to receive ongoing GDMT alone (control group) or ongoing GDMT plus BAT (treatment group) for 6 months. The primary safety end point was system-and procedure-related major adverse neurological and cardiovascular events. The primary efficacy end points were changes in NYHA functional class, quality-of-life score, and 6-minute hall walk distance. RESULTS One hundred forty-six patients were randomized, 70 to control and 76 to treatment. The major adverse neurological and cardiovascular event-free rate was 97.2% (lower 95% confidence bound 91.4%). Patients assigned to BAT, compared with control group patients, experienced improvements in the distance walked in 6 min (59.6 +/- 14 m vs. 1.5 +/- 13.2 m; p = 0.004), quality-of-life score (-17.4 +/- 2.8 points vs. 2.1 +/- 3.1 points; p < 0.001), and NYHA functional class ranking (p = 0.002 for change in distribution). BAT significantly reduced N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (p = 0.02) and was associated with a trend toward fewer days hospitalized for HF (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS BAT is safe and improves functional status, quality of life, exercise capacity, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and possibly the burden of heart failure hospitalizations in patients with GDMT-treated NYHA functional class III HF.

Thus far, current therapeutic strategies have failed to address neuronal degeneration. It has been reported that overproduction of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases through the induction of macromolecular oxidative damage and modulation of intracellular signaling pathways concurring to neuronal cell death. Indeed, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory drugs have been the subject of recommendation as a complementary therapy alongside an effective symptomatic treatment to hamper the progression of PD. Today, much attention is paid to polyphenols in light of their potent capacity to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, while having much fewer side effects than most other drugs. Camellia sinensis L. is the most common ancient herbal tea prepared as a beverage worldwide and it possesses numerous beneficial effects on human health. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is the best-known bioactive component of C. sinensis and is recognized to exert potent neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, autophagy, and neuronal cell death in vitro as well as in vivo. The present review appraises the available literature on the beneficial role of epigallocatechin-3-gallate pertaining to dopaminergic degeneration characteristic of PD with particular emphasis on its possible mechanisms of action.

Through the use of whole exome sequencing, an increasing number of genes have been identified to play a role in human locomotion. Despite identifying these genes, it is not known how these genes are crucial to normal locomotive functioning. Therefore, a reliable assay, which utilizes model organisms to elucidate the role of these genes in order to identify novel targets of therapeutic interest, is needed more than ever. We have designed a sensitized version of the negative geotaxis assay that allows for the detection of milder defects earlier and has the ability to evaluate these defects over time. The assay is performed in a glass graduated cylinder, which is sealed with a wax barrier film. By increasing the threshold distance to be climbed to 17.5 cm and increasing the experiment duration to 2 min we have observed a greater sensitivity in detecting mild mobility dysfunctions. The assay is cost effective and does not require extensive training to obtain highly reproducible results. This makes it an excellent technique for screening candidate drugs in Drosophila mutants with locomotion defects.

Go protein subunit Go alpha and the secretory process of the natriuretic peptide hormones ANF and BNP	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						endocrine heart; ANF; G proteins; hormone storage; hormone secretion	TRIMERIC G-PROTEINS; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; MAMMALIAN HEART; GRANULES; CELLS; GENE; EXOCYTOSIS; EXPRESSION; NETWORK; ATRIA	Expression of the G protein subunit Go alpha has been shown to be prominent in the atria of the rat heart and to be significantly associated with atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-containing atrial-specific secretory granules by immunocytochemistry. In addition, differential expression profile analysis using oligonucleotide arrays has shown that the Go alpha isoform 1 (Go alpha 1) is 2.3-fold more abundant in the atria than it is in the ventricles. In the present report, we show protein-protein interaction between Go alpha and ANF by yeast two-hybrid and by immunoprecipitation. A cardiac conditional Go alpha knockout model developed for the present study showed a 90% decrease in Go alpha expression and decreased atrial expression and ANF and brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) content. Expression of chromogranin A, a specific atrial granule core constituent, was not affected. Morphometric assessment of atrial tissue showed a very significant decrease in atrial-specific granule density as well as granule core electron density. Atrial electrical activity was not affected. The results obtained are compatible with the suggestion that Go alpha plays a role in ANF sorting during intracellular vectorial transport and with the presence of a mechanism that preserves the molar relationship between cellular ANF and BNP stores in the face of the decreased production of these hormones.

Screams in the Night: Pilot Study Reveals Moderate Evidence for Individual Differences in Lorisoid Vocalizations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Ancestral primate model; Bushbaby; Galago; Social complexity; Vocalizations	PRIMATE BRAIN EVOLUTION; FREE-TAILED BATS; VOCAL RECOGNITION; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; ACOUSTIC FEATURES; LONG CALLS; MATERNAL RECOGNITION; CONTACT CALLS; SOCIAL BRAIN; ANIMAL VOCALIZATION	Social complexity is argued to be a driving factor in the evolution of communicative complexity. Complex social systems require individuals to form relationships with many conspecifics and interact in a wide variety of contexts over time, thus selecting for acoustic communication systems complex enough to facilitate these relationships. To better understand the evolution of such social and communicative complexity, we investigated a nocturnal, solitary forager, Garnett's bushbaby (Otolemur garnettii), as a lorisoid model for the ancestral primate social systems from which more complex systems evolved. We hypothesized that it would be advantageous for solitary foragers to have individual differences in long-distance calls, as this could be crucial to the maintenance of their dispersed social networks. We tested for individual differences in the long distance bark vocalization. We measured 6 frequency and temporal parameters for 120 barks (15 barks from each of 8 individuals housed at the University of SouthernMississippi). Principal component and discriminant function analyses assigned the calls to the respective individuals at a rate that was moderately accurate and higher than chance (binomial test: 54.2% correct, P < 0.001, chance = 12.5%). This pilot work provides moderate evidence for individual differences and is the first such study to be conducted on lorisoids. Because individual differences have been documented in the vocalizations of solitary foraging lemuroids, we suggest that moderate individual differences may have been present in ancestral primates and contributed to the dispersed social system that is thought to have been the foundation from which increased social complexity evolved in primates.

J	Wils, T; Rhnima, A				Wils, Thierry; Rhnima, Aziz			Conflict Taxonomy between Work and Family: a Multidimensional Analysis using Self-organizing Maps	RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES-INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS			French	Article						interference between work and family; multidimensional conflict; taxonomy; Kohonen network; nurses	INTERFERENCE; ANTECEDENTS; STRATEGIES; GENDER; SECTOR; ROLES	It is not uncommon for researchers to conceptualize the conflict between work and family bi-directionally by either studying the impact of employment on family (called "work-family conflict") or the conflict of family on employment (called "family-work conflict"). Prior studies which often used this bi-directional conceptualization show inconsistent findings. Indeed no attempt has been made to differentiate among the different sources of the conflict. Greenhaus and Beutell (1985) propose a multidimensional conceptualization of conflict adding to the two directional dimensions, three additional dimensions related to time, energy and behavior. This study answers the following general question: is a multidimensional conceptualization better at understanding the conflict between work and family than a two-dimensional conceptualization ? From a sample of 375 respondents, we used a multidimensional conceptualization of conflict between work and family (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985) to identify forms of conflict using Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM). Kohonen's maps are based on a neural networks resulting from unsupervised learning method (Kohonen, 2001). The results of the neuronal analysis indicate there are six forms of conflict. Two of them are similar to directional conflicts (high conflict and low conflict of the six dimensions), while the other four possess unique characteristics highlighting the need for multidimensional conceptualization. In addition, the analysis of variance revealed several significant differences between the six forms of conflict and external variables related to explanatory factors of conflict between work and family as well as to its consequences. This new taxonomy based on the multidimensional conceptualization of conflict helps in better understanding the interference between work and family by identifying specific forms of conflict in which one or several sources are in action.

This study aimed at evaluating the predictive value of atypicalities in FR and IFE for future symptom severity in children with ASD. Therefore we performed a seven-year follow-up study in 87 children with ASD. FR and IFE were assessed in childhood (T1: age 6-12) using the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT). Symptom severity was assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) in childhood and again seven years later during adolescence (T2: age 12-19). Multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate whether FR and IFE in childhood predicted ASD symptom severity in adolescence, while controlling for ASD symptom severity in childhood. We found that more accurate FR significantly predicted lower adolescent ASD symptom severity scores (Delta R-2 = .09), even when controlling for childhood ASD symptom severity. IFE was not a significant predictor of ASD symptom severity in adolescence. From these results it can be concluded, that in children with ASD the accuracy of FR in childhood is a relevant predictor of ASD symptom severity in adolescence. Test results on FR in children with ASD may have prognostic value regarding later symptom severity. (C) 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	[Eussen, Mart L. J.

Under normal circumstances, donor blood is the best replacement for blood. However, there are exceptions: During natural epidemics (e.g., HIV, Ebola, etc.) or man-made epidemics (terrorism, war, etc.), there is a risk of donor blood being contaminated, and donors being disqualified because they have contracted disease. Unlike red blood cells (RBCs), blood substitutes can be sterilized to remove infective agents. Heart attack and stroke are usually caused by obstruction of arterial blood vessels. Unlike RBCs, which are particulate, blood substitutes are in the form of a solution that can perfuse through obstructed vessels with greater ease to reach the heart and brain, as has been demonstrated in animal studies. Severe blood loss from injuries sustained during accidents, disasters, or war may require urgent blood transfusion that cannot wait for transportation to the hospital for blood group testing. Unlike RBCs, blood substitutes do not have specific blood groups, and can be administered on the spot. RBCs have to be stored under refrigeration for up to 42 days, and are thus difficult to transport and store in times of disaster and at the battlefront. Blood substitutes can be stored at room temperature for more than 1 year, compared to the RBC shelf life of 1 day, at room temperature. In cases of very severe hemorrhagic shock, there is usually a safety window of 60 min for blood replacement, beyond which there could be problems related to irreversible shock. Animal studies show that a particular type of blood substitute, with enhanced RBC enzymes, may be able to prolong the duration of the safety window.

Adult presentations of known hereditary forms are often accompanied by other organ involvement. We recruited a large French-Canadian family with a dominantly inherited late-onset painful sensory neuropathy. The main clinical feature is recurrent leg pain that progresses to constant painful paraesthesias in the feet and later the hands. As it evolves, some patients develop a mild sensory ataxia. We selected four affected individuals for whole exome sequencing. Analysis of rare variants shared by all cases led to a list of four candidate variants. Segregation analysis in all 45 recruited individuals has shown that only the p.Ile403Thr variant in the alpha-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) gene segregates with the disease. Recessive NAGLU mutations cause the severe childhood lysosomal disease mucopolysacharidosis IIIB. Family members carrying the mutation showed a significant decrease of the enzymatic function (average 45%). The late-onset and variable severity of the symptoms may have precluded the description of such symptoms in parents of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB cases. The identification of a dominant phenotype associated with a NAGLU mutation supports that some carriers of lysosomal enzyme mutations may develop later in life much milder phenotypes.

During neuroinflammatory responses the blood-brain barrier is compromised resulting in central nervous system damage and exacerbated pathology. Here, we identified endothelial netrin 1 induction as a vascular response to astrocyte-derived sonic hedgehog that promotes autocrine barrier properties during homeostasis and increases with inflammation. Netrin 1 supports blood-brain barrier integrity by upregulating endothelial junctional protein expression, while netrin 1 knockout mice display disorganized tight junction protein expression and barrier breakdown. Upon inflammatory conditions, blood-brain barrier endothelial cells significantly upregulated netrin 1 levels in vitro and in situ, which prevented junctional breach and endothelial cell activation. Finally, netrin 1 treatment during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis significantly reduced blood-brain barrier disruption and decreased clinical and pathological indices of disease severity. Our results demonstrate that netrin 1 is an important regulator of blood-brain barrier maintenance that protects the central nervous system against inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

The monkeys chose between two color-coded potential targets by determining which target's color matched the predominant color of a multicolored checkerboard-like Decision Cue (DC). Different DCs contained differing numbers of colored squares matching each target. The DCs provided evidence about the correct target ranging from unambiguous (one color only) to very ambiguous and conflicting (nearly equal number of squares of each color). Differences in choice behavior (reach response times and success rates as a function of DC ambiguity) of the monkeys suggested that each applied a different strategy for using the target-choice evidence in the DCs. Nevertheless, the appearance of the DCs evoked a transient coactivation of PMd neurons preferring both potential targets in both monkeys. Reach response time depended both on how long it took activity to increase in neurons that preferred the chosen target and on how long it took to suppress the activity of neurons that preferred the rejected target, in both correct-choice and error-choice trials. These results indicate that PMd neurons in this task are not activated exclusively by a signal proportional to the net color bias of the DCs. They are instead initially modulated by the conflicting evidence supporting both response choices; final target selection may result from a competition between representations of the alternative choices. The results also indicate a temporal overlap between action selection and action initiation processes in PMd and M1.

However, when the temporal interval between two consecutive stimuli is smaller than the latency of the main ERP peaks, i.e., when the stimuli are presented at a fast rate, overlaps between the corresponding ERPs may occur. These overlaps are usually dealt with by assuming that there is a simple additive superposition between the elicited ERPs and consequently performing algebraic waveform subtractions. Here, we test this assumption rigorously by providing a statistical framework that examines the presence of nonlinear additive effects between overlapping ERPs elicited by successive stimuli with short interstimulus intervals (ISIs). The results suggest that there are no nonlinear additive effects due to the time overlap per se but that, for the range of ISIs examined, the second ERP is modulated by the presence of the first stimulus irrespective of whether there is time overlap or not. In other words, two ERPs that overlap in time can still be written as an addition of two ERPs but with the second ERP being different from the first. This difference is also present in the case of nonoverlapping ERPs with short ISIs. The modulation effect elicited on the second ERP by the first stimulus is dependent on the ISI value.

Interactions between rostral and caudal cortical motor areas in the rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						arm; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; premotor	VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; SPINAL-CORD; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICOSPINAL NEURONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN-INJURY	In rats, forelimb movements can be evoked from two distinct cortical regions, the rostral (RFA) and the caudal (CFA) forelimb areas. RFA and CFA have numerous reciprocal connections, and their projections reach several common targets, which allows them to interact at multiple levels of the motor axis. Lesions affecting these areas result in profound and persistent deficits, supporting their essential role for the production of arm and hand movements. Whereas rats are widely used to study motor control and recovery following lesions, little is known as to how cortical motor areas in this model interact to generate movements. To study interactions between RFA and CFA, we used paired-pulse protocols with intracortical microstimulation techniques (ICMS). A conditioning stimulus (C) in RFA was applied simultaneously, or before a test stimulus (T) in CFA. The impact of RFA conditioning on CFA outputs was quantified by recording electromyographic signals (EMG) signals from the contralateral arm muscles. We found that stimulation of RFA substantially modulates the intensity of CFA outputs while only mildly affecting the latency. In general, the effect of RFA conditioning changed from predominantly facilitatory to inhibitory with increasing delays between the C and the T stimulus. However, inspection of individual cortical sites revealed that RFA has a wide range of influence on CFA outputs with each interstimulation delay we used. Our results show that RFA has powerful and complex modulatory effects on CFA outputs that can allow it to play a major role in the cortical control of forelimb movements.	[Deffeyes, J.

Antibioprophylaxy and urological management of women with spinal cord injury during pregnancy	PROGRES EN UROLOGIE			French	Article						Spinal cord injury; Pregnancy; Woman; Neurogenic bladder; Urinary tract infection	URINARY-TRACT RECONSTRUCTION	Objective. - More and more women with spinal cord injury (SCI) can have a pregnancy. Few data have been published on these pregnancies and their urological impact. We report a series of these cases illustrating the urological experience of specialized centers. Methods. - This is a retrospective study that identified pregnancies in women with SCI followed-up between 2000 and 2014. Data covering all urological and obstetric events during pregnancies, before and after implementation of weekly oral cyclic antibiotics (WOCA) program, were collected from medical records. Results. - Fifteen women with SCI who gave birth to 20 children were included. Three of them were quadriplegics and 12 were paraplegics. All of them performed themselves intermittent catheterization: 11 by urethral way and 4 by high way because carrying a continent cystostomy. Mean follow-up period before pregnancy was 14.6 years [3-27 years IC 95%] and the mean follow-up for the study was 8.5 months [6.5-9 IC 95%]. We observed a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections after WOCA onset (13/13 before vs. 0/7 after, P=0.001), a reduction of recurrent urinary infections (6/13 vs. 0/7, P=0.03), a reduction of threats to premature births (8/13 vs. 0/7, P=0.001). Multi-resistant bacteria appeared to increase (0/13 vs. 3/7, P=0.01). We also observed a trend to significant reduction of premature births number (4/13 vs. 0/13, P=0.1) and that of low birth weight (3/13 versus 0/7, P=0.1). The overall neonatal survival rate was 100%. Conclusion. - Our study before/after introduction of a weekly oral cycle antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy for women with spinal cord injury showed a significant reduction in symptomatic urinary tract infections and a tendency to improve pregnancy outcomes.

To identify the biology underlying the disease, we extended these genetic data in a pathway analysis. Methods: The ALIGATOR and GSEA algorithms were used in the IGAP data to identify associated functional pathways and correlated gene expression networks in human brain. Results: ALIGATOR identified an excess of curated biological pathways showing enrichment of association. Enriched areas of biology included the immune response (P = 3.27 X 10(-12) after multiple testing correction for pathways), regulation of endocytosis (P = 1.31 X 10(-11)), cholesterol transport (P = 2.96 X 10(-9)), and proteasome-ubiquitin activity (P = 1.34 X 10(-6)). Correlated gene expression analysis identified four significant network modules, all related to the immune response (corrected P = .002-.05). Conclusions: The immime response, regulation of endocytosis, cholesterol transport, and protein ubiquitination represent prime targets for AD therapeutics.

Manipulability agreement as a predictor of action initiation latency	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						Norms; Object; Motor affordance	WORKING-MEMORY; OBJECTS; NORMS; ACQUISITION; PHOTOGRAPHS; AFFORDANCE; KNOWLEDGE; AGE	In the domain of cognition, an increasing number of researchers are interested in the role of objects' motor affordances in cognitive processing. However, outside of the existing norms on the objects' levels of manipulability (e.g., Magnic, Besson, Poncet, & Dolisi, Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 25: 521-560,2003), relatively few norms exist that would allow researchers to have good control over objects' motor dimensions. In the present study, we have provided norms on the extent to which participants agreed about the movements typically performed for using specific objects-what we will call manipulability agreement. We showed that manipulability agreement was a good predictor of the times needed to initiate the action associated with the object. This study provides ratings on a new dimension of objects' motor affordances that could be useful to researchers in the domain of visual cognition.

Methods: Sixty-two patients with TBI were evaluated within the first 2 weeks following TBI. The Sniffin'Sticks identification test was used to assess olfaction. A neuropsychological evaluation was carried out to assess attention, verbal fluency, naming, memory, problem-solving and mental flexibility. The extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) were rated at discharge from acute care. Results: Traumatic lesions located in the basal frontal area resulted in odour identification scores that were significantly lower than when lesions were elsewhere (p<0.001). A significant positive correlation was shown between odour identification scores and mental flexibility scores (p=0.004) and patients with hyposmia had worse performances on executive tests measuring problem-solving, verbal fluency and mental flexibility (p<0.01). Moreover, the odour identification score and the DRS total score were related (p=0.019). Conclusions: These findings add information regarding acute olfactory status following TBI and provide evidence on the importance of assessing olfaction very early post-TBI in order to plan intervention and determine what accident prevention advice will be required for home or work re-integration.

Accurate predictions may better prepare families and improve the process of donation after circulatory death. We systematically reviewed any predictive factors for time to death after withdrawal of life support therapy. Fifteen observational studies met our inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was time to death, which was evaluated to be within 60 min in the majority of studies (13/15). Additional time endpoints evaluated included time to death within 30, 120 min, and 10 h, respectively. While most studies evaluated risk factors associated with time to death, a few derived or validated prediction tools. Consistent predictors of time to death that were identified in five or more studies included the following risk factors: controlled ventilation, oxygenation, vasopressor use, Glasgow Coma Scale/Score, and brain stem reflexes. Seven unique prediction tools were derived, validated, or both across some of the studies. These tools, at best, had only moderate sensitivity to predicting the time to death. Simultaneous withdrawal of all support and physician opinion were only evaluated in more recent studies and demonstrated promising predictor capabilities. While the risk factors controlled ventilation, oxygenation, vasopressors, level of consciousness, and brainstem reflexes have been most consistently found to be associated with time to death, the addition of novel predictors, such as physician opinion and simultaneous withdrawal of all support, warrant further investigation. The currently existing prediction tools are not highly sensitive. A more accurate and generalizable tool is needed to inform end-of-life care and enhance the predictions of donation after circulatory death eligibility.

POLA Network	TCF12 is mutated in anaplastic oligodendroglioma	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SEQUENCING DATA; CANCER DRIVERS; E-CADHERIN; MUTATIONS; EXPRESSION; GLIOMAS; TRANSCRIPTION; GENES; GLIOBLASTOMA; DISCOVERY	Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) are rare primary brain tumours that are generally incurable, with heterogeneous prognosis and few treatment targets identified. Most oligodendrogliomas have chromosomes 1p/19q co-deletion and an IDH mutation. Here we analysed 51 AO by whole-exome sequencing, identifying previously reported frequent somatic mutations in CIC and FUBP1. We also identified recurrent mutations in TCF12 and in an additional series of 83 AO. Overall, 7.5% of AO are mutated for TCF12, which encodes an oligodendrocyte-related transcription factor. Eighty percent of TCF12 mutations identified were in either the bHLH domain, which is important for TCF12 function as a transcription factor, or were frameshift mutations leading to TCF12 truncated for this domain. We show that these mutations compromise TCF12 transcriptional activity and are associated with a more aggressive tumour type. Our analysis provides further insights into the unique and shared pathways driving AO.

Alex			Neurodegeneration in C-elegans models of ALS requires TIR-1/Sarm1 immune pathway activation in neurons	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MAP KINASE PATHWAY; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; INNATE IMMUNITY; STRESS RESISTANCE; PROTEIN; TOXICITY; MECHANISMS; TRIGGERS; DEATH	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease thought to employ cell non-autonomous mechanisms where neuronal injury engages immune responses to influence disease progression. Here we show that the expression of mutant proteins causative for ALS in Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons induces an innate immune response via TIR-1/Sarm1. Loss of function mutations in tir-1, associated downstream kinases, and the transcription factor atf-7 all suppress motor neuron degeneration. The neurosecretory proteins UNC-13 and UNC-31 are required for induction of the immune response as well as the degeneration of motor neurons. The human orthologue of UNC-13, UNC13A, has been identified as a genetic modifier of survival in ALS, and we provide functional evidence of UNC-13/UNC13A in regulating motor neuron degeneration. We propose that the innate immune system reacts to the presence of mutant proteins as a contagion, recruiting a pathogen resistance response that is ultimately harmful and drives progressive neurodegeneration.

CKD is known to impair drug disposition of non-renally eliminated medications that may lead to unintended toxicity or lower therapeutic effect despite dose adjustment according to glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Modulation of metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450, phase II) and drug transporters in various organs (intestines, liver, kidneys and brain) are being held responsible for altered pharmacokinetics where uremic toxins, inflammatory cytokines and parathyroid hormone, common factors present in CKD, may be considered possible culprits. This review gives a thorough summary of the recent preclinical, clinical studies and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines and allows a current understanding of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in CKD.

Despite the differences in etiology and progression of these distinct disease domains, it is possible that overlapping molecular pathways underlie the expression of self-injurious behaviors (SIBs). This review outlines the similarities and differences at the behavioural and molecular level, where SIBs in both conditions may involve opioid, nucleoside, and dopamine signalling. These points of convergence have important implications for treatment and research of SIB in both populations.

Yet, the extent to which motor skill acquisition relies on intrinsic spinal cord processes remains unknown. To date, attempts to address this question were limited by difficulties in separating spinal local effects from supraspinal influences through traditional electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods. Here, for the first time, we provide evidence for local learning-induced plasticity in intact human spinal cord through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord during motor sequence learning. Specifically, we show learning-related modulation of activity in the C6-C8 spinal region, which is independent from that of related supraspinal sensorimotor structures. Moreover, a brain-spinal cord functional connectivity analysis demonstrates that the initial linear relationship between the spinal cord and sensorimotor cortex gradually fades away over the course of motor sequence learning, while the connectivity between spinal activity and cerebellum gains strength. These data suggest that the spinal cord not only constitutes an active functional component of the human motor learning network but also contributes distinctively from the brain to the learning process. The present findings open new avenues for rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord injuries, as they demonstrate that this part of the central nervous system is much more plastic than assumed before. Yet, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this intrinsic functional plasticity in the spinal cord warrant further investigations.

Here we assess the extent of subventricular zone-olfactory bulb (SVZ-OB) neurogenesis in adult humans having died by suicide. Protein expression of proliferative and neurogenic markers Sox2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and doublecortin (DCX) were examined in postmortem SVZ and OB samples from depressed suicides and matched suddendeath controls. In the SVZ, DCX-immunoreactive (IR) cells displayed phenotypes typical of progenitors, whereas in the olfactory tract (OT), they were multipolar with variable size and morphologies suggestive of differentiating cells. DCX expression was significantly increased in the OB of suicides, whereas SVZ DCX expression was higher among unmedicated, but not antidepressant-treated, suicides. Although very few DCX-IR cells were present in the control OT, they were considerably more common in suicides and correlated with OB DCX levels. Suicides also displayed higher DCX-IR process volumes. These results support the notion that OB neurogenesis is minimal in adult humans. They further raise the possibility that the differentiation and migration of SVZ-derived neuroblasts may be altered in unmedicated suicides, leading to an accumulation of ectopically differentiating cells in the OT. Normal SVZ DCX expression among suicides receiving antidepressants suggests a potentially novel mode of action of antidepressant medication. Given the modest group sizes and rarity of DCX-IR cells assessed here, a larger-scale characterization will be required before firm conclusions can be made regarding the identity of these cells.

Public accessibility is also an issue with computational models for bioactivity, and the ability to share such models still remains a major challenge limiting drug discovery. We describe the creation of a reference implementation of a Bayesian model-building software module, which we have released as an open source component that is now included in the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) project, as well as implemented in the CDD Vault and in several mobile apps. We use this implementation to build an array of Bayesian models for ADME/Tox, in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, and other physicochemical properties. We show that these models possess cross-validation receiver operator curve values comparable to those generated previously in prior publications using alternative tools. We have now described how the implementation of Bayesian models with FCFP6 descriptors generated in the CDD Vault enables the rapid production of robust machine learning models from public data or the user's own datasets. The current study sets the stage for generating models in proprietary software (such as CDD) and exporting these models in a format that could be run in open source software using CDK components. This work also demonstrates that we can enable biocomputation across distributed private or public datasets to enhance drug discovery.

Time spent viewing visual sexual stimuli (VSS) has the potential to habituate the sexual response and generalize to the partner context. Aim. The aim of this study was to examine whether the time spent viewing VSS is related to sexual responsiveness felt in the laboratory or with a sexual partner. Methods. Nontreatment-seeking men (N = 280) reported their weekly average VSS viewing in hours. VSS hours were examined in relation to the sexual arousal experienced while viewing a standardized sexual film in the laboratory and erectile problems experienced with a sexual partner. Main Outcome Measures. Self-reported sexual arousal in response to sexual films and erectile problems on the International Index of Erectile Function were the main outcome measures. Results. More hours viewing VSS was related to stronger experienced sexual responses to VSS in the laboratory, was unrelated to erectile functioning with a partner, and was related to stronger desire for sex with a partner. Conclusions. VSS use within the range of hours tested is unlikely to negatively impact sexual functioning, given that responses actually were stronger in those who viewed more VSS.

The brains of five normal, healthy (non-OA) cats and seven cats with pain associated with naturally occurring OA were imaged using (18)FDG-PET during a standardized mild anesthesia protocol. The PET images were co-registered over a magnetic resonance image of a cat brain segmented into several regions of interest. Brain metabolism was assessed in these regions using standardized uptake values. The brain metabolism in the secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus and periaqueductal gray matter was increased significantly (P <= 0.005) in OA cats compared with non-OA cats. This study indicates that (18)FDG-PET brain imaging in cats is feasible to investigate CNS changes related to chronic pain. The results also suggest that OA is associated with sustained nociceptive inputs and increased activity of the descending modulatory pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite numerous investigations, the exact mechanisms and origins of gamma oscillations are yet to be known. Here, through multiunit recordings in the primary visual cortex of cats, we show that the strength of gamma power (20-40 and 60-80Hz) is significantly stronger between the functionally connected units than between the unconnected units within an assembly. Furthermore, there is increased frequency coherence in the gamma band between the connected units than between the unconnected units. Finally, the higher gamma rhythms (60-80Hz) are mostly linked to the fast-spiking neurons. These results led us to postulate that gamma oscillations are intrinsically generated between the connected units within cell assemblies (microcircuits) in relation to the stimulus within an emergent 50-ms temporal window of opportunity'.

Effects of attention and distractor contrast on the responses of middle temporal area neurons to transient motion direction changes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						area middle temporal; change detection; contrast; neuronal detection sensitivity; visual attention	DECISION-RELATED ACTIVITY; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; VISUAL-CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MT NEURONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COHERENT MOTION; MACAQUE MT; MODULATION; STIMULUS	The ability of primates to detect transient changes in a visual scene can be influenced by the allocation of attention, as well as by the presence of distractors. We investigated the neural substrates of these effects by recording the responses of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of two monkeys while they detected a transient motion direction change in a moving target. We found that positioning a distractor near the target impaired the change-detection performance of the animals. This impairment monotonically decreased as the distractor's contrast decreased. A neural correlate of this effect was a decrease in the ability of MT neurons to signal the direction change (detection sensitivity or DS) when a distractor was near the target, both located inside the neuron's receptive field. Moreover, decreasing distractor contrast increased neuronal DS. On the other hand, directing attention away from the target decreased neuronal DS. At the level of individual neurons, we found a negative correlation between the degree of response normalization and the DS. Finally, the intensity of a neuron's response to the change was predictive of the animal's reaction time, suggesting that the activity of our recorded neurons was linked to the animal's detection performance. Our results suggest that the ability of an MT neuron to signal a transient direction change is regulated by the degree of inhibitory drive into the cell. The presence of distractors, their contrast and the allocation of attention influence such inhibitory drive, therefore modulating the ability of the neurons to signal transient changes in stimulus features and consequently behavioral performance.

Saccade execution suppresses discrimination at distractor locations rather than enhancing the saccade goal location	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						countermanding; covert attention; human; pre-saccadic attentional facilitation; saccade inhibition; saccade planning	FRONTAL EYE FIELD; SELECTIVE VISUAL-ATTENTION; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; STOP-SIGNAL PARADIGM; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; COUNTERMANDING SACCADES; TARGET SELECTION; INTERMEDIATE LAYERS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION	As we have limited processing abilities with respect to the plethora of visual information entering our brain, spatial selection mechanisms are crucial. These mechanisms result in both enhancing processing at a location of interest and in suppressing processing at other locations; together, they enable successful further processing of locations of interest. It has been suggested that saccade planning modulates these spatial selection mechanisms; however, the precise influence of saccades on the distribution of spatial resources underlying selection remains unclear. To this end, we compared discrimination performance at different locations (six) within a work space during different saccade tasks. We used visual discrimination performance as a behavioral measure of enhancement and suppression at the different locations. A total of 14 participants performed a dual discrimination/saccade countermanding task, which allowed us to specifically isolate the consequences of saccade execution. When a saccade was executed, discrimination performance at the cued location was never better than when fixation was maintained, suggesting that saccade execution did not enhance processing at a location more than knowing the likelihood of its appearance. However, discrimination was consistently lower at distractor (uncued) locations in all cases where a saccade was executed compared with when fixation was maintained. Based on these results, we suggest that saccade execution specifically suppresses distractor locations, whereas attention shifts (with or without an accompanying saccade) are involved in enhancing perceptual processing at the goal location.

It is characterized by complex behavioral phenotype and deficits in both social and cognitive functions. Although the exact cause of ASD is still not known, the main findings emphasize the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of autistic behavior. Environmental factors are also likely to interact with the genetic profile and cause aberrant changes in brain growth, neuronal development, and functional connectivity. The past few years have seen an increase in the prevalence of ASD, as a result of enhanced clinical tests and diagnostic tools. Despite growing evidence for the involvement of endogenous biomarkers in the pathophysiology of ASD, early detection of this disorder remains a big challenge. This paper describes the main behavioral and cognitive features of ASD, as well as the symptoms that differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. An attempt will be made to integrate all the available evidence which point to reduced brain connectivity, mirror neurons deficits, and inhibition-excitation imbalance in individuals with ASD. Finally, this review discusses the main factors involved in the pathophysiology of ASD, and illustrates some of the most important markers used for the diagnosis of this debilitating disorder.

Methods: In a monocentric consecutive series of endovascular treatment of 783 ruptured aneurysms, 42 (5.3%) patients received Abciximab after the aneurysm was secured. Bleeding complications were registered and dichotomized as follows: new intracranial hemorrhage and peripheral bleeding. For each patient, World Federation of Neurosurgery (WFNS) subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) grade, shunting, and clinical outcomes in the post-operative period and at 3-6 months were recorded. Results: SAH WFNS grades were as follows: grade I n = 14, grade II n = 10, grade III n = 11, grade IV n = 4, grade V n = 3. Ten patients had intracranial hematoma additionally to the SAH prior to embolization. Four patients (9.5%) presented more blood on the post-embolization CT but only one suffered a new clinically relevant intracranial hemorrhage. Two patients (4.8%) experienced significant peripheral bleeding but none were associated with long-term disabilities. Fourteen patients had a shunt installed less than 24 h prior to Abciximab injection and one less than 48 h later. At 3-6-month follow-up, 31 patients (74%) achieved a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 2 or less, six patients (14%) had a mRS of 3-5, three were dead (7%), and two were lost at follow-up. Conclusion: When the aneurysm is secured, intra-arterial Abciximab injection is a low complication rate treatment modality for thromboembolic events during embolization of cerebral ruptured aneurysm.

Eleven trials published since our last review met inclusion criteria. The quality of the trials was excellent. Seven of the trials demonstrated a significant analgesic effect. Several trials also demonstrated improvement in secondary outcomes (e.g., sleep, muscle stiffness and spasticity). Adverse effects most frequently reported such as fatigue and dizziness were mild to moderate in severity and generally well tolerated. This review adds further support that currently available cannabinoids are safe, modestly effective analgesics that provide a reasonable therapeutic option in the management of chronic non-cancer pain.

Methods: Pallidal neuronal activity was recorded in six nnyoclonus dystonia and six primary generalized dystonia patients operated on for internal globus pallidus deep brain stimulation. In myoclonus dystonia patients compared with primary-dystonia patients, internal pallidum neurons showed higher burst frequency, lower mean burst, and pause durations. External pallidum neurons showed higher mean pause frequency. Oscillatory activity was present in 33% and 35% of internal pallidum neurons in myoclonus dystonia and primary-dystonia patients, respectively, predominantly in the theta frequency band (3-8 Hz). Results: In myoclonus dystonia patients with more severe myoclonus, internal pallidum neurons exhibited a higher bursting activity with high intraburst frequency and lower oscillatory activity frequency. Conclusions: Myoclonus dystonia appears to be related to specific changes in internal pallidum activity, leading to disruption in striato-pallido-thalarno-cortical circuits.

A clinical and experimental study	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						bladder pain syndrome; interstitial cystitis; primary afferents; sympathetic system; urothelium	IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; ALPHA-ADRENOCEPTORS; VISCERAL PAIN; NERVE INJURY; RECEPTOR; MODULATION; MODEL; RATS; BETA(3)-ADRENOCEPTOR; NOREPINEPHRINE	AimsTo evaluate sympathetic system activity in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) patients and to investigate if chronic adrenergic stimulation in intact rats induces BPS/IC-like bladder modifications. MethodsClinical studyIn BPS/IC patients and aged and body mass index matched volunteers TILT test was undertaken and catecholamines were measured in plasma and 24hr urine samples. Experimental studyPhenylephrine was injected subcutaneously (14 days) to female Wistar rats. Pain behavior, spinal Fos expression, urinary spotting, number of fecal pellets expelled, frequency of reflex bladder contractions, and urothelial height were analyzed. Urothelium permeability was investigated by trypan blue staining. Immunoreactivity against caspase 3 and bax were studied in the urothelium and against alpha-1-adrenoreceptor and TRPV1 in suburothelial nerves. Mast cell number was determined in the sub-urothelium. In rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced cystitis, urinary catecholamines, and Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression in bladder nerves were analyzed. ResultsThe TILT test showed an increase of sympathetic activity. Noradrenaline levels in blood at resting conditions and in 24-hr urine samples were higher in BPS/IC patients. Phenylephrine administration increased visceral pain, spinal Fos expression, bladder reflex activity, urinary spotting and the number of expelled fecal pellets. The mucosa showed urothelial thinning and increased immunoreactivity for caspase 3 and bax. Trypan blue staining was only observed in phenylephrine treated animals. Suburothelial nerves co-expressed alpha1 and TRPV1. Mastocytosis was present in the suburothelium. Cystitis increased sympathetic nerve density and urinary noradrenaline levels.

Genetic markers of Restless Legs Syndrome in Parkinson disease	PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson disease; Restless Legs Syndrome; Genetics	GBA MUTATIONS; DRUG-NAIVE; NORMAL IPT; PHENOTYPE; ONSET; LRRK2; RISK; HERITABILITY; SYNUCLEIN; PD	Introduction: Several studies proposed that Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson disease (PD) may be clinically and/or etiologically related. To examine this hypothesis, we aimed to determine whether the known RLS genetic markers may be associated with PD risk, as well as with PD subtype. Methods: Two case-control cohorts from Tel-Aviv and New-York, including 1133 PD patients and 867 controls were genotyped for four RLS-related SNPs in the genes MEIS1, BTBD9, PIPED and MAP2IC5/SKOR1. The association between genotype, PD risk and phenotype was tested using multivariate regression models. Results: None of the tested SNPs was significantly associated with PD risk, neither in any individual cohort nor in the combined analysis after correction for multiple comparisons. The MAP2K5/SKOR1 marker rs12593813 was associated with higher frequency of tremor in the Tel-Aviv cohort (61.0% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.001, dominant model). However, the risk allele for tremor in this gene has been associated with reduced RLS risk. Moreover, this association did not replicate in Tremor-dominant PD patients from New-York. Conclusion: RLS genetic risk markers are not associated with increased PD risk or subtype in the current study. Together with previous genetic, neuropathological and epidemiologic studies, our results further strengthen the notion that RLS and PD are likely to be distinct entities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Most cases are secondary to neurodegenerative conditions, including the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, which has overlapping symptoms with many primary psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the differential diagnosis and neuropsychiatric assessment of young-onset dementia, which includes detailed history taking, family history, mental status examination, office-based cognitive tests, and a focused neurologic examination. The clinical examination serves to establish the presence of a dementia and the specific clinical syndrome. Biomarkers can be subsequently integrated in a probabilistic model to determine the most likely neuropathological process.

Methods: Cross-sectional study. Three hundred and fifty women completed a questionnaire detailing use of folic acid supplementation, and had their RBCf levels measured. Values >= 2906 nmol/L were considered optimal. Factors associated with optimal RBCf were assessed, individually and in a logistic regression model. Results: Median RBCf was 1282 nmol/L. Thirty-five women (10%) had suboptimal levels. Predictors of suboptimal RBCf were non-Caucasian ethnicity, non-consumption of folic acid supplementations, and inadequate health care provider information regarding the benefits of folic acid consumption. Conclusion: Although, in our population, a high proportion of women achieved optimal levels of RBCf, some women remain at risk due to inadequate folate consumption. Patient and health care provider education regarding folate can still be improved, particularly in the groups identified to be at greater risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Visualization of the Long Thoracic Nerve using High-Resolution Sonography	ULTRASCHALL IN DER MEDIZIN			English	Article						normal variants; long thoracic nerve; scapula alata; shoulder pain	SERRATUS ANTERIOR MUSCLE; ISOLATED PARALYSIS; BRACHIAL-PLEXUS; UPPER EXTREMITY; FOLLOW-UP; PALSY; ULTRASOUND; ETIOLOGY; SHOULDER; ANATOMY	Purpose: The long thoracic nerve (LTN) innervates the serratus anterior muscle (SA) which plays an important role in shoulder function. Evaluation of the LTN has so far been restricted to clinical assessment and partly electromyography and neurography. Progress of high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) increasingly enables visualization of small peripheral nerves and their pathologies. We therefore aimed at (a) clarifying the possibility of visualization of the LTN from its origin to the most distal point in the supraclavicular region visible and (b) developing an ultrasound protocol for routine use. We further present two cases of patients with LTN pathology. Methods: The study consisted of two parts: Part 1 included 4 non-enbalmed human bodies in whom the LTN (n = 8) was located and then marked by ink injection. Correct identification was confirmed by anatomical dissection. Part 2 included 20 healthy volunteers whose LTN (n = 40) was assessed independently by two radiologists. Identification of the LTN was defined as consensus in recorded images. Results: LTN was clearly visible in all anatomical specimens and volunteers using HRUS and could be followed until the second slip of the serratus anterior muscle from the supraclavicular region. In anatomical specimens, dissection confirmed HRUS findings. For all volunteers, consensus was obtained. The mean nerve diameter was 1.6 mm +/- 0.3 (range 1.1 - 2.1 mm) after the formation of the main trunk. Discussion: We hereby confirm a reliable possibility of visualization of the LTN in anatomical specimens as well as in volunteers. We encourage HRUS of the LTN to be part of the diagnostic work-up in patients presenting with scapular winging, shoulder weakness or pain of unknown origin.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of driving simulator retraining on driving in clients with neurological impairment and to examine factors associated with treatment effectiveness. Method Individuals with non-degenerative brain injury were randomized to either a simulator training or control group. The simulator group received individualized training (16 sessions) using a driving simulator. The control group did not receive intervention. A blind evaluator assessed participants on the DriveAble On-Road Driving Evaluation. Results There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of individuals who passed the driving evaluation (Chi(2)=0.65; p=0.42; CI=-0.41 to +0.17). However, participants with moderate impairment who received simulator training were more likely to pass the driving test compared with those in the control group (86% versus 17%; Chi(2)=6.2; p=0.03; CI=-1.00 to -0.30). There were no differences in pass rate according to diagnosis, gender, or for those with severe impairments. Conclusion Results provide clinicians with preliminary information on the potential clinical usefulness of driving simulator training. While the findings do not support simulator retraining for the group as a whole, they suggest that clients with moderate impairment have the potential to benefit.

The objective of this post hoc analysis of our randomized control trial was to determine whether rapid diagnosis and treatment of IS could limit the incidence of ASD while identifying risk factors related to ASD outcome. MethodsPatients with IS were randomized in a standardized diagnostic and treatment protocol. Clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) evaluations were completed at all eight visits over 5years, while cognitive evaluations were administered at 0, 6, 24 and 60months, respectively. Autism was initially screened by means of the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) at 24months, and formally assessed at the 30-and 60-month follow-ups using the Autism Diagnostic Observation ScheduleGeneric (ADOS-G). ResultsOf the 69 patients included in the study, 25 could not be assessed due to severe delay or death. Eleven of the 42 patients screened with CHAT, were found to be at risk of an ASD outcome. ADOS was performed in 44 and 10 were diagnosed with ASD. The CHAT proved to correlate highly with the ADOS (80% ppv). Only patients with symptomatic IS developed ASD (p=0.003). Earlier diagnosis or successful treatment did not correlate with a reduced rate of ASD. Other risk factors were identified such as having chronic epileptic discharges in the frontotemporal areas after disappearance of hypsarrhythmia (p=0.005 and p=0.007) and being of nonwhite origin (p=0.009). SignificanceASD was only observed in children with sympyomatic IS. Other clinical risk factors include chronic frontotemporal epileptic activity and being of non-white origin. Early diagnosis and treatment did not prevent ASD as an outcome of IS. However, patients at risk for ASD could be identified early on and should in the future benefit from early intervention to potentially improve their long-term outcome.

Little is known about how treatment, especially lithium, influences decision-making abilities in bipolar patients when euthymic. We aimed at testing for an association between lithium medication and decision-making performance in remitted bipolar patients. Decision-making was measured using the Iowa Gambling Task in 3 groups of subjects: 34 and 56 euthymic outpatients with bipolar disorder, treated with lithium (monotherapy and lithium combined with anticonvulsant or antipsychotic) and without lithium (anticonvulsant, antipsychotic and combination treatment), respectively, and 152 matched healthy controls. Performance was compared between the 3 groups. In the 90 euthymic patients, the relationship between different sociodemographic and clinical variables and decision-making was assessed by stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Euthymic patients with lithium (p=0.007) and healthy controls (p=0.001) selected significantly more cards from the safe decks than euthymic patients without lithium, with no significant difference between euthymic patients with lithium and healthy controls (p=0.9). In the 90 euthymic patients, the stepwise linear multivariate regression revealed that decision-making was significantly predicted (p<0.001) by lithium dose, level of education and no family history of bipolar disorder (all p <= 0.01). Because medication was not randomized, it was not possible to discriminate the effect of different medications. Lithium medication might be associated with better decision-making in remitted bipolar patients. A randomized trial is required to test for the hypothesis that lithium, but not other mood stabilizers, may specifically improve decision-making abilities in bipolar disorder.

Specifically, we develop a temporal hierarchical adaptive texture CRF (THAT-CRF) and apply it to the challenging problem of gad enhancing lesion segmentation in brain MRI of patients with multiple sclerosis. In this context, the presence of many nonlesion enhancements (such as blood vessels) renders the problem more difficult. In addition to voxel-wise features, the framework exploits multiple higher order textures to discriminate the true lesional enhancements from the pool of other enhancements. Since lesional enhancements show more variation over time as compared to the nonlesional ones, we incorporate temporal texture analysis in order to study the textures of enhanced candidates over time. The parameters of the THAT-CRF model are learned based on 2380 scans from a multi-center clinical trial. The effect of different components of the model is extensively evaluated on 120 scans from a separate multi-center clinical trial. The incorporation of the temporal textures results in a general decrease of the false discovery rate. Specifically, THAT-CRF achieves overall sensitivity of 95% along with false discovery rate of 20% and average false positive count of 0.5 lesions per scan. The sensitivity of the temporal method to the trained time interval is further investigated on five different intervals of 69 patients. Moreover, superior performance is achieved by the reviewed labelings of our model compared to the fully manual labeling when applied to the context of separating different treatment arms in a real clinical trial.

An apparent electrochemically active surface area (AEASA) and charge storage capacity (CSC) were determined. The freshly-prepared Ir0.6Ru0.4-oxide coating was found to offer the largest AEASA and CSC; however, after exposing all the coatings to prolonged extreme electrochemical cycling in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4, within a 5 V potential window ("torturing"), the Ir0.8Ru0.2-oxide coating yielded both the largest AEASA (1540 cm(2)) and CSC (27 mC cm(-2)). Under the same experimental condition, the Ir0.8Ru0.2-oxide coating was found to yield by a 56% higher CSC than the current state-of-the-art neural stimulating electrode, Ir-oxide, making it a good candidate for further optimization and possible application as a neural stimulating electrode.

Despite growing evidence associating epigenetics and psychiatric disorders, it is unclear how epigenetics, particularly DNA methylation, relate to brain function and behavior, including drinking behavior. Method: The authors carried out a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of 18 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for alcohol use disorder and validated differentially methylated regions. After validation, the authors characterized these differentially methylated regions using personality trait assessment and functional MRI in a sample of 499 adolescents. Results: Hypermethylation in the 3'-protein-phosphatase-1G (PPM1G) gene locus was associated with alcohol use disorder. The authors found association of PPM1G hypermethylation with early escalation of alcohol use and increased impulsiveness. They also observed association of PPM1G hypermethylation with increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent response in the right subthalamic nucleus during an impulsiveness task. Conclusions: Overall, the authors provide first evidence for an epigenetic marker associated with alcohol consumption and its underlying neurobehavioral phenotype.

Neurofilaments, the 10-nm intermediate filaments of neurons, provide structure and mechanoresistance but also provide a scaffolding for the organization of the nucleus and organelles such as mitochondria and ER. Disruption of neurofilament organization and expression or metabolism of neurofilament proteins is characteristic of certain neurological syndromes including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth sensorimotor neuropathies and Giant Axonal Neuropathy. Microfluorometric live imaging techniques have been instrumental in revealing the dynamics of neurofilament assembly and transport and their functions in organizing intracellular organelle networks. The insolubility of neurofilament proteins has limited identifying interactors by conventional biochemical techniques but yeast two-hybrid experiments have revealed new roles for oligomeric, nonfilamentous structures including vesicular trafficking. Although having long half-lives, new evidence points to degradation of subunits by the ubiquitin-proteasome system as a mechanism of normal turnover. Although certain E3-ligases ubiquitinating neurofilament proteins have been identified, the overall process of neurofilament degradation is not well understood. We review these mechanisms of neurofilament homeostasis and abnormalities in motor neuron and peripheral nerve disorders. Much remains to discover about the disruption of processes that leads to their pathological aggregation and accumulation and the relevance to pathogenesis. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic strategies.

We therefore examined the relationship between intelligence quotient (IQ) and changes in cortical thickness and surface over time in 504 healthy subjects. At 10 years of age, more intelligent children have a slightly thinner cortex than children with a lower IQ. This relationship becomes more pronounced with increasing age: with higher IQ, a faster thinning of the cortex is found over time. In the more intelligent young adults, this relationship reverses so that by the age of 42 a thicker cortex is associated with higher intelligence. In contrast, cortical surface is larger in more intelligent children at the age of 10. The cortical surface is still expanding, reaching its maximum area during adolescence. With higher IQ, cortical expansion is completed at a younger age; and once completed, surface area decreases at a higher rate. These findings suggest that intelligence may be more related to the magnitude and timing of changes in brain structure during development than to brain structure per se, and that the cortex is never completed but shows continuing intelligence-dependent development.

The gene products, the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin and the serine/threonine kinase PINK1, are neuroprotective proteins, which act together in a mitochondrial quality control pathway. Here, we review the structure of parkin and mechanisms of its autoinhibition and function as a ubiquitin ligase. We present a model for the recruitment and activation of parkin as a key regulatory step in the clearance of depolarized or damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy). We conclude with a brief overview of other functions of parkin and considerations for drug discovery in the mitochondrial quality control pathway.

By taking advantage of stress analysis in finite element modeling (FEM), the degradation process governed by Paris' law can adjust itself immediately to respond to the changes of the operating condition. The capability to directly relate the load to the damage propagation is a key advantage of the proposed integrated prognostics approach over the existing data-driven methods for dealing with time-varying operating conditions. In the proposed method, uncertainties in material parameters are considered as sources responsible for randomness in the predicted failure life. The joint distribution of material parameters is updated as sensor data become available. The updated distribution better characterizes the material parameters, and reduces the uncertainty in life prediction for the specific individual unit under condition monitoring. The update process is realized via Bayesian inference. To reduce the computational effort, a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) collocation method is applied in computing the likelihood function in the Bayesian inference and the predicted failure time distribution. Examples based on crack propagation in a spur gear tooth are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the example also shows that the proposed approach is effective even when the current loading profile is different from the loading profile under which historical data were collected.

Accumulating evidence suggests that nebulized opioids selective for the mu-receptor subtype may relieve dyspnea by modulating intrapulmonary opioid receptor activity. Our respective primary and secondary objectives were to test the hypothesis that nebulized fentanyl (a mu-opioid receptor agonist) relieves dyspnea during exercise in the presence of abnormal restrictive ventilatory constraints and to identify the physiological mechanisms of this improvement. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we examined the effect of 250 mu g nebulized fentanyl, chest wall strapping (CWS), and their interaction on detailed physiological and perceptual responses to constant work rate cycle exercise (85% of maximum incremental work rate) in 14 healthy, fit young men. By design, CWS decreased vital capacity by similar to 20% and mimicked the negative consequences of a mild restrictive lung disorder on exercise endurance time and on dyspnea, breathing pattern, dynamic operating lung volumes, and diaphragmatic electromyographic and respiratory muscle function during exercise. Compared with placebo under both unrestricted control and CWS conditions, nebulized fentanyl had no effect on exercise endurance time, integrated physiological response to exercise, sensory intensity, unpleasantness ratings of exertional dyspnea. Our results do not support a role for intrapulmonary opioids in the neuromodulation of exertional dyspnea in health nor do they provide a physiological rationale for the use of nebulized fentanyl in the management of dyspnea due to mild restrictive lung disorders, specifically those arising from abnormalities of the chest wall and not affiliated with airway inflammation.

This study evaluated the effects of 200 mg and 400 mg of caffeine on sleep in young and middle-aged adults. The sleep of 22 young (23.5 +/- 1.9 years) and 24 middle-aged (51.7 +/- 11.5 years) adults was recorded using polysomnography in two conditions (placebo and caffeine) in a double-blind cross-over design. Compared to placebo, caffeine increased sleep latency, shortened total sleep duration and reduced sleep efficiency. At the higher dose, these effects were more pronounced in middle-aged than in young adults. Furthermore, the higher dose of caffeine increased absolute stage 1 sleep in young adults, whereas it decreased absolute stage 2 sleep in middle-aged adults. Caffeine also induced dose-dependent increases in relative stage 1 sleep and reductions in absolute and relative slow wave sleep and absolute rapid eye movement sleep in both age groups. There was no dose- or age-related modulation of the effects of caffeine on quantified electroencephalographic measures. These results indicate that, compared to young adults, middle-aged adults are generally more sensitive to the effects of a high dose of caffeine on sleep quantity and quality.

ERP evidence for the influence of scene context on the recognition of ambiguous and unambiguous objects	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Object recognition; ERPs; Scene context; Visual ambiguity	PERCEPTUAL CLOSURE; ILLUSORY FIGURES; IDENTIFICATION; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS; SIGNATURES; TIMECOURSE; PICTURES; MEMORY; AREAS	We are used to seeing objects in specific settings, and in association with other related objects. This contextual information allows for fast and efficient object recognition and influences brain-related processes. The influence of scene context has been studied using event-related potentials (ERPs) in order to further our understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms. Current ERP studies have focused on effects related to the incongruity between unambiguous objects and their scenes, rather than the specific influence of a congruent scene. The present study sought to examine ERPs associated with the beneficial influence of scene context on object recognition. This influence was examined using ambiguous objects that required a congruent scene in order to be recognized, as well as unambiguous objects, to determine whether scene processing occurs even when it is unnecessary for recognizing the object. Twenty healthy subjects were instructed to indicate whether they recognized, had a vague idea, or did not recognize target objects that appeared within congruent and neutral scenes. ERPs from 250 to 1000 ms, including the N300 and N400, were more positive at anterior sites and more negative at posterior sites, when objects appeared in congruent scenes as opposed to when they appeared in neutral scenes, with a larger effect seen for ambiguous objects. Upon further examination, the results showed that the ERPs to ambiguous objects became similar to those of unambiguous objects when they appeared in congruent contexts. These findings indicated that a congruent context exerted its influence by reducing the ambiguity of objects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Effect of Radiotherapy on Gentamicin Ototoxicity: An Animal Model	OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY			English	Article						radiotherapy; radiation; gentamicin; aminoglycoside; guinea pig; hearing loss	HEARING-LOSS; AMINOGLYCOSIDE TOXICITY; BRAIN-TUMORS; GUINEA-PIGS; RADIATION; IRRADIATION; PLATINUM; CHILDREN; EAR	Objective Patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) often present with serious bacterial infections requiring the use of antibiotic treatment. Gentamicin is a commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotic, whose ototoxicity remains a major problem in clinical use. The objective of this study was to determine whether radiation exposure can influence gentamicin-induced ototoxicity. Study Design Prospective animal study. Setting Animal care facilities of the Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute. Methods Sixteen guinea pigs received low-dose RT unilaterally for 4 weeks (total: 48 Gy). Animals then received low or high doses of gentamicin (40 mg/kg/d and 80 mg/kg/d) for 10 days. The ears were divided into 4 groups: gentamicin 40 mg, gentamicin 80 mg, gentamicin 40 mg + RT, and gentamicin 80 + RT. Auditory brainstem responses and distortion products otoacoustic emissions were assessed at baseline and before and after gentamicin treatment. Cochlear morphology using light and scanning electron microscopy were evaluated. Results High-dose gentamicin caused significant auditory brainstem response threshold shifts (P = .020), with greater hearing loss in the irradiated ear (difference of 23.6 + 7.5 dB). All animals exposed to high-dose gentamicin had head tilts toward the radiated side. Cochlear morphology revealed the greatest hair cell damage in the gentamicin 80 + RT group followed by gentamicin 80. Conclusion Results suggest that radiation can exacerbate the ototoxicity of gentamicin at high doses.

Few genetic loci have been associated with disorders of neurodevelopment. Our objective of the present study was to analyse a consanguineous Arab family showing some of the hallmark signs of a rare cerebellar hypoplasia-related neurodevelopmental syndrome as a strategy for discovering a causative genetic mutation. Methods We used whole exome sequencing to identify the causative mutation in two female siblings of a consanguineous Arab family showing some of the hallmark signs of a cerebellar-hypoplasia-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Direct Sanger sequencing was used to validate the candidate mutations that cosegregated with the phenotype. Gene expression and loss of function studies were carried out in the zebrafish model system to examine the role of the candidate gene in neurodevelopment. Results Patients presented with severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and biochemical findings suggestive of nephrotic disease. Whole exome sequencing of the two patients revealed a shared nonsense homozygous variant in WDR73 (p. Q235X (c. 703C>T)) resulting in loss of the last 144 amino acids of the protein. The variant segregated according to a recessive mode of inheritance in this family and was absent from public and our inhouse databases. We examined the developmental role of WDR73 using a loss-of-function paradigm in zebrafish. There was a significant brain growth and morphogenesis defect in wdr73 knockdown embryos resulting in a poorly differentiated midbrain and cerebellum. Conclusions The results provide new insight into the functional role of WDR73 in brain development and show that perturbation of its function in an inherited disorder in humans is associated with cerebellar hypoplasia as well as nephrotic disease, consistent with Galloway-Mowat Syndrome.

The osmotic control of oxytocin and vasopressin release at the neurohypophysis is required for osmoregulation in these animals, and this release is mediated by a modulation of the action potential firing rate by the MNCs. Under basal (isotonic) conditions, MNCs fire action potentials at a slow rate, and this activity is inhibited by hypo-osmotic conditions and enhanced by hypertonicity. The effects of changes in osmolality on MNCs are mediated by a number of different factors, including the involvement of synaptic inputs, the release of taurine by local glial cells and regulation of ion channels expressed within the neurosecretory neurones themselves. We review recent findings that have clarified our understanding of how osmotic stimuli modulate the activity of nonselective cation channels in MNCs. Previous studies have shown that osmotically-evoked changes in membrane potential and action potential firing rate in acutely isolated MNCs are provoked mainly by a modulation of nonselective cation channels. Notably, the excitation of isolated MNCs during hypertonicity is mediated by the activation of a capsaicin-insensitive cation channel that MNCs express as an N-terminal variant of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (Trpv1) channel. The activation of this channel during hypertonicity is a mechanical process associated with cell shrinking. The effectiveness of this mechanical process depends on the presence of a thin layer of actin filaments (F-actin) beneath the plasma membrane, as well as a densely interweaved network of microtubules (MTs) occupying the bulk of the cytoplasm of MNCs. Although the mechanism by which F-actin contributes to Trpv1 activation remains unknown, recent data have shown that MTs interact with Trpv1 channels via binding sites on the C-terminus, and that the force mediated through this complex is required for channel gating during osmosensory transduction. Indeed, displacement of this interaction prevents channel activation during shrinking, whereas increasing the density of these interaction sites potentiates shrinking-induced activation of Trpv1. Therefore, the gain of the osmosensory transduction process can be regulated bi-directionally through changes in the organisation of F-actin and MTs.	[Prager-Khoutorsky, M.; Bourque, C.

J	Finet, P; Nguyen, DK; Bouthillier, A				Finet, Patrice; Dang Khoa Nguyen; Bouthillier, Alain			Vascular consequences of operculoinsular corticectomy for refractory epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						insula surgery; operculoinsular resection; ischemic lesions; refractory epilepsy	INTRINSIC INSULAR TUMORS; SURGICAL RESECTION; COPENHAGEN STROKE; DEPTH ELECTRODE; LOBE EPILEPSY; TIME-COURSE; CORTEX; RECOVERY; SURGERY; GLIOMAS	OBJECT Surgery in the insular region is considered challenging because of its vascular relationships, the proximity of functional structures, and its deep location in the sylvian fissure. The authors report the incidence and consequences of ischemic lesions after operculoinsular corticectomy for refractory epilepsy. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the data of all patients who underwent an insular resection with or without an opercular resection for refractory epilepsy at their center. All patients underwent postoperative MRI, enabling a radiological analysis of the ischemic lesions as a result of the corticectomies. The resections were classified according to the location and extent of the insular corticectomy and the type of operculectomy. Each patient underwent clinical follow-up. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent surgery. All patients underwent insular corticectomy with or without an operculectomy. Ischemic lesions were identified in 12 patients (60%). In these patients, 11 ischemic lesions (55%) were related to the insular corticectomy, and 1 was related to the associated peninsular resection. The ischemic lesions associated with the insulectomies were typically located in the corona radiata running from the insula to the periventricular region. Nine patients (45%) developed a postoperative neurological deficit, among whom 6 (67%) had an insular corticectomy-related ischemic lesion. All reported neurological deficits were transient. Five patients (25%) had ischemic lesions without neurological deficit. CONCLUSIONS Operculoinsular corticectomies are associated with ischemic lesions in approximately 60% of patients. However, given that no patient had a definitive postoperative deficit, these ischemic lesions have few clinical consequences. Therefore, this surgical procedure can be considered reasonably safe for the treatment of refractory epilepsy.

Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate containing an anti-CD79B monoclonal antibody conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E. We aimed to assess the safety and clinical activity of polatuzumab vedotin in relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Methods In this phase 1, multicentre, open-label study, we enrolled patients with documented NHL or CLL expected to express CD79B (confirmation of CD79B expression was not required) and for whom no suitable therapy of curative intent or higher priority existed from 13 centres. The primary endpoints of the study were to assess safety and tolerability, determine the maximum tolerated dose, and identify the recommended phase 2 dose of polatuzumab vedotin as a single agent and in combination with rituximab. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used in which we treated patients with polatuzumab vedotin (0.1-2.4 mg/kg every 21 days) in separate dose-escalation cohorts for NHL and CLL. After determination of the recommended phase 2 dose, we enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and relapsed or refractory indolent NHL into indication-specific cohorts. We also enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory NHL into an additional cohort to assess the feasibility of the combination of polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab 375 mg/m(2). Patients who received any dose of polatuzumab vedotin were available for safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01290549. Findings Between March 21, 2011, and Nov 30, 2012, we enrolled 95 patients (34 to the NHL dose-escalation cohort, 18 to the CLL dose-escalation cohort, 34 with NHL to the expansion cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose, and nine with NHL to the rituximab combination cohort; no expansion cohort of CLL was started due to lack of activity in the dose-escalation cohort). The recommended phase 2 dose in NHL was 2.4 mg/kg as a single agent and in combination with rituximab; the maximum tolerated dose in CLL was 1.0 mg/kg as a result of dose-limiting toxic effects reported in two of five patients given 1.8 mg/kg. Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 26 (58%) of 45 patients with NHL treated at the single-agent recommended phase 2 dose, and the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (18 [40%] of 45), anaemia (five [11%]), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (four [9%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 17 (38%) of 45 patients, and included diarrhoea (two patients), lung infection (two patients), disease progression (two patients), and lung disorder (two patients). Seven (77%) of nine patients in the rituximab combination cohort had a grade 3-4 adverse event, with neutropenia (five [56%]), anaemia (two [22%]), and febrile neutropenia (two [22%]) reported in more than one patient. 11 (12%) of 95 patients died during the study: eight with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (due to progressive disease in four patients, infections in three patients [two treatment related], and treatment-related worsening ascites in one patient) and three with relapsed or refractory CLL (due to progressive disease, pulmonary infection, and pneumonia; none thought to be treatment-related). At the recommended phase 2 dose, objective responses were noted in 23 of 42 activity-evaluable patients with NHL given single-agent polatuzumab vedotin (14 of 25 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, seven of 15 with indolent NHL, and two with mantle-cell lymphoma) and seven of nine patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. No objective responses were observed in patients with CLL. Interpretation Polatuzumab vedotin has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with NHL but not in those with CLL. Its clinical activity should be further assessed in NHL.

For several vital functions, such as respiration and mastication, neurons need to generate a rhythmic firing pattern. Here we show in the rat trigeminal sensori-motor circuit for mastication that this ability depends on regulation of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](e)) by astrocytes. In this circuit, astrocytes respond to sensory stimuli that induce neuronal rhythmic activity, and their blockade with a Ca2+ chelator prevents neurons from generating a rhythmic bursting pattern. This ability is restored by adding S100b, an astrocytic Ca2+-binding protein, to the extracellular space, while application of an anti-S100b antibody prevents generation of rhythmic activity. These results indicate that astrocytes regulate a fundamental neuronal property: the capacity to change firing pattern. These findings may have broad implications for many other neural networks whose functions depend on the generation of rhythmic activity.

However, their diffusion in the brain remains unknown. Here, we studied A beta oligomers' dissemination and evaluated their in vivo toxicity. Wild-type mice were injected with 50 pmol of synthetic A beta oligomers (of different size) in the hippocampus. Oligomers diffused largely in the brain as soon as 1 hour and up to 7 days after injection. A transient encephalopathy with memory impairment was induced by this unique injection. The immunoreactivity of the postsynaptic marker PSD95 was diffusely decreased. Similar results (both on memory and PSD95 immunoreactivity) were obtained with delipidated and high molecular weight oligomers (>50 kDa) but not with smaller assemblies. Tau hyperphosphorylation was observed in the oligomer-injected brains. Finally, fos immunostaining was increased in A beta-derived diffusible ligandseinjected mice, suggesting neuronal hyperactivity. Rapid and widespread diffusion of Ab oligomers was demonstrated in vivo and associated with decreased synaptic markers and memory deficits which gives new insight to the pathogenicity of A beta.

Superficial white matter as a novel substrate of age-related cognitive decline	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Superficial white matter; Cognitive-aging; Diffusion tensor imaging	NEURITE ORIENTATION DISPERSION; DIGIT MODALITIES TEST; PROCESSING-SPEED; HUMAN BRAIN; LIFE-SPAN; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS; SPATIAL STATISTICS; REPEATABLE BATTERY; MULTIPLE MEASURES; T2-WEIGHTED MRI	Studies of diffusion tensor imaging have focused mainly on the role of deep white matter tract microstructural abnormalities associated with aging and age-related cognitive decline. However, the potential role of superficial white matter (SWM) in aging and, by extension, cognitive-aging, is less clear. Healthy individuals (n = 141; F/M: 66/75 years) across the adult lifespan (18-86 years) underwent diffusion tensor imaging and a battery of cognitive testing. SWM was assessed via a combination of probabilistic tractography and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). A widespread inverse relationship of fractional anisotropy (FA) values in SWM with age was observed. SWM-FA adjacent to the precentral gyri was associated with fine-motor-speed, whereas performance in visuomotor-attention/processing speed correlated with SWM-FA in all 4 lobes of the left-hemisphere and in right parieto-occipital SWM-FA (family-wise error corrected p < 0.05). Independent of deep white matter-FA, right frontal and right occipital SWM-FA-mediated age effects on motor-speed and visuomotor-attention/processing speed, respectively. Altogether, our results indicate that SWM-FA contributes uniquely to age-related cognitive performance, and should be considered as a novel biomarker of cognitive-aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The current consensus paper highlights the broad range of clinical signs and symptoms of MS patients, which relate to cerebellar dysfunction. There is considerable evidence of cerebellar involvement in MS based on clinical, histopathological as well as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The review of the recent literature, however, also demonstrates a high variability of results. These discrepancies are, at least partially, caused by the use of different techniques and substantial heterogeneity among the patient cohorts in terms of disease duration, number of patients, and progressive vs. relapsing disease courses. Moreover, the majority of studies were cross-sectional, providing little insight into the dynamics of cerebellar involvement in MS. Some links between the histopathological changes, the structural and functional abnormalities as captured by MRI, cerebellar dysfunction, and the clinical consequences are starting to emerge and warrant further study. A consensus is formed that this line of research will benefit from advances in neuroimaging techniques that allow to trace cerebellar involvement at higher resolution. Using a prospective study design, multimodal high-resolution cerebellar imaging is highly promising, particularly in patients who present with radiologically or clinically isolated syndromes or newly diagnosed MS.

Whereas phobic responses have been linked to brain systems mediating fear, little is known about how the recruitment of these systems relates to exaggerated expectancies of threat. We used fMRI to examine spider-phobic and control participants while they imagined visiting different locations in a forest after having received background information about the likelihood of encountering different animals (spiders, snakes, and birds) at these locations. Critically, imagined encounter expectancies modulated brain responses differently in phobics as compared with controls. Phobics displayed stronger negative modulation of activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and visual cortex by encounter expectancies for spiders, relative to snakes or birds (within-participants analysis); these effects were not seen in controls. Between-participants correlation analyses within the phobic group further corroborated the hypothesis that these phobia-specific modulations may underlie irrationality in encounter expectancies (deviations of encounter expectancies from objective background information) in spider phobia; the greater the negative modulation a phobic participant displayed in the lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and visual cortex, the stronger was her bias in encounter expectancies for spiders. Interestingly, irrationality in expectancies reflected in frontal areas relied on right rather than left hemispheric deactivations. Our data accord with the idea that expectancy biases in spider phobia may reflect deficiencies in cognitive control and contextual integration that are mediated by right frontal and parietal areas.

Schwannomas typically present with gradually progressive symptoms, but isolated reports have suggested that schwannomas may cause fluctuating symptoms as well. Methods: This is a report of ten cases of presumed cranial nerve schwannoma that presented with transient or recurring ocular motor nerve deficits. Results: Schwannomas of the third, fourth, and fifth nerves resulted in fluctuating deficits of all 3 ocular motor nerves. Persistent nodular cranial nerve enhancement was present on sequential MRI studies. Several episodes of transient oculomotor (III) deficts were associated with headaches, mimicking ophthalmoplegic migraine. Conclusions: Cranial nerve schwannomas may result in relapsing and remitting cranial nerve symptoms.

Although observation of pain behaviors (e.g., frowning) is recommended for pain assessment in nonverbal populations, they are attenuated and sometimes even suppressed in patients with TBI receiving high doses of sedatives. This study explored the potential utility of the bilateral bispectral index system (BIS) for pain detection in critically ill adults with TBI and altered level of consciousness. Methods: Using a repeated measure within-subject design, participants (N = 25) were observed for 1 minute before (baseline), during, and 15 minutes after two procedures: (a) noninvasive blood pressure (nonnociceptive) and (b) turning (nociceptive). At each assessment, BIS indexes (0-100) of the right (R) and left (L) hemispheres and pain behaviors were documented. Results: Compared with baseline, significant median increases (p .05) in BIS-R (+4.93%) and BIS-L (+8.43%) and in the frequency of pain behaviors (+3.00) were observed during turning but not noninvasive blood pressure. Interestingly, increases in BIS-R were more pronounced in participants with left-sided TBI (+17.23%, p = .021) than those with right-sided TBI (+3.01%). BIS-R fluctuations in participants with left-sided TBI were also positively correlated (r(s) = .986, p .001) with the frequency of pain behaviors observed during turning. Conclusions: Overall, only increases in BIS-R were correlated with participants' pain behaviors and in those with left-sided TBI exclusively. Although further research is needed, our findings support the potential use of the bilateral BIS for pain detection in nonverbal patients with TBI who cannot behaviorally respond to pain, but only when they have a left-sided injury.

Cigarette smoking and thinning of the brain's cortex	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL THICKNESS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PRENATAL-EXPOSURE; OLD-AGE; DISEASE; COHORT; DEMENTIA; NICOTINE	Cigarette smoking is associated with cognitive decline and dementia, but the extent of the association between smoking and structural brain changes remains unclear. Importantly, it is unknown whether smoking-related brain changes are reversible after smoking cessation. We analyzed data on 504 subjects with recall of lifetime smoking data and a structural brain magnetic resonance imaging at age 73 years from which measures of cortical thickness were extracted. Multiple regression analyses were performed controlling for gender and exact age at scanning. To determine dose-response relationships, the association between smoking pack-years and cortical thickness was tested and then repeated, while controlling for a comprehensive list of covariates including, among others, cognitive ability before starting smoking. Further, we tested associations between cortical thickness and number of years since last cigarette, while controlling for lifetime smoking. There was a diffuse dose-dependent negative association between smoking and cortical thickness. Some negative dose-dependent cortical associations persisted after controlling for all covariates. Accounting for total amount of lifetime smoking, the cortex of subjects who stopped smoking seems to have partially recovered for each year without smoking. However, it took similar to 25 years for complete cortical recovery in affected areas for those at the mean pack-years value in this sample. As the cortex thins with normal aging, our data suggest that smoking is associated with diffuse accelerated cortical thinning, a biomarker of cognitive decline in adults. Although partial recovery appears possible, it can be a long process.

Tobacco smoking strongly modifies the association of prothrombin G20210A with undetermined stroke: Consecutive survivors and population-based controls	ATHEROSCLEROSIS			English	Article						Hypercoagulopathy; Prothrombin G20210A (rs1799963); Factor V Leiden (rs6025); Genetic epidemiology; Ischemic stroke; Smoking	FACTOR-V-LEIDEN; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; EARLY-ONSET STROKE; VENOUS THROMBOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; LONGITUDINAL TRENDS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; CZECH POPULATION; MUTATIONS; VARIANT	Objective: Due to contradictory results of previous studies evaluating the association between ischemic stroke (IS) and thrombophilic polymorphisms, their routine screening in IS patients, particularly those older than 60 years, is not recommended. We evaluated the differences in the distribution of rs6025 and rs1799963 polymorphisms according to IS subtypes and their interaction with smoking. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of 423 hospital-based consecutive survivors of their first-ever IS and 614 population-based controls. Survivors (18-81 years) with IS documented by brain imagining were examined at a median of 16 months after the index event. The stroke subtype was categorized using the Causative Classification of Stroke System. Controls (50-75 years) were free of a history of stroke/TIA, coronary heart disease, and venous thromboembolism. Results: Age-and gender-adjusted prevalence of individuals carrying at least one copy of the rs1799963A minor allele was 5.3% among stroke survivors (by subtypes: 3.1% in large artery atherosclerosis, 2.0% in cardio-aortic embolism, 2.4% in small artery occlusion, and 10.3% in undetermined stroke) vs. 2.4% among controls. In multinomial multivariate adjusted analysis, rs1799963 was exclusively associated with undetermined stroke (OR: 3.67; 95% CI: 1.52-8.85; p = 0.004). There was strong evidence of rs1799963 x smoking synergistic interaction (OR: 5.14; 95% CI: 1.65-16.01; p = 0.005). There was no association of rs6025 with IS in general, or with any subtype.

Both structures are highly susceptible to generate seizures and may also be involved in epileptogenesis. We found that THDOC application to pilocarpine-treated slices: (i) decreased interictal discharge frequency in PC while increasing it in EC; (ii) abolished ictal discharges in both areas in approx. one third of the experiments and reduced them in frequency and duration in the remaining experiments; and (iii) increased the occurrence of ripples and fast ripples associated to interictal events, and modified their pattern of occurrence during ictal discharges in both PC and EC. These effects were either weaker or absent in NEC tissue. Our results demonstrate that THDOC plays a structure-dependent modulatory role in epileptiform synchronization in the pilocarpine-treated epileptic rat brain where its actions are more pronounced than in NEC tissue. This evidence supports the application of neurosteroids as potential antiepileptic tools. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Soltani, MM; Motamedi, A; Hammad, A				Soltani, Mohammad Mostafa; Motamedi, Ali; Hammad, Amin			Enhancing Cluster-based RFID Tag Localization using artificial neural networks and virtual reference tags	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						RFID Tag Localization; Clustering; Artificial neural networks; Indoor positioning; k-NN; Virtual reference tags	LANDMARC; SYSTEM	Construction sites are changing every day, which brings some difficulties for different contractors to do their tasks properly. One of the key points for all entities who work on the same site is the location of resources including materials, tools, and equipment. Therefore, the lack of an integrated localization system leads to an increase in the time wasted on searching for resources. In this research, a localization method based on Radio Frequency Identification (RED) systems which does not need infrastructure is proposed to overcome this problem. This paper investigates the usage of active RFID technology for the localization of movable objects (e.g. components, equipment, and tools) equipped with RFID tags using handheld readers by extending a Cluster-based Movable Tag Localization (CMTL) technique which uses a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. CMTL uses a multidimensional clustering technique that considers signal pattern similarity between target and reference tags together with spatial distribution of reference tags for detecting the region where the target tag is located. The paper proposes applying an irregular bilinear interpolation method to form a grid of virtual reference tags within the selected cluster of real reference tags. Moreover, the proposed method uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) for positioning the target tag, as opposed to empirical weighted averaging formulas used in similar k-NN based methods. Comparative analysis is performed to quantify the improvement of the proposed method over similar k-NNbased methods using a simulation environment. A case study is performed to analyze the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through the use of our docking tool FITTED, we investigated the relationship between ligand activity towards GluK2 and the conformational state induced at the receptor level. By focusing our rational design on the interaction between the ligand and a tyrosine residue in the binding site, we synthesized a series of molecules based on a glutamate scaffold, and carried out electrophysiological recordings. The observed ability of some of these molecules to inhibit receptor activation shows the potential of our design for the development of effective antagonists with a molecular size comparable to that of the endogenous neurotransmitter L-glutamate.

Partial Recovery of Abnormal Insula and Dorsolateral Prefrontal Connectivity to Cognitive Networks in Chronic Low Back Pain After Treatment	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						chronic pain; cognitive networks; functional MRI; resting state; intrinsic connectivity; longitudinal	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; DIABETIC NEUROPATHIC PAIN; ALTERED RESTING STATE; CORD-INJURY PAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; NEUROGENIC PAIN; TASK; FIBROMYALGIA; FREQUENCY	We previously reported that effective treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) reversed abnormal brain structure and functional MRI (fMRI) activity during cognitive task performance, particularly in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Here, we used resting-state fMRI to examine how chronic pain affects connectivity of brain networks supporting cognitive functioning and the effect of treatment in 14 CLBP patients and 16 healthy, pain-free controls (scans were acquired at baseline for all subjects and at 6-months post-treatment for patients and a matched time-point for 10 controls). The main networks activated during cognitive task performance, task-positive network (TPN) and task-negative network (TNN) (aka default mode) network, were identified in subjects' task fMRI data and used to define matching networks in resting-state data. The connectivity of these cognitive resting-state networks was compared between groups, and before and after treatment. Our findings converged on the bilateral insula (INS) as the region of aberrant cognitive resting-state connectivity in patients pretreatment versus controls. These findings were complemented by an independent, data-driven approach showing altered global connectivity of the INS. Detailed investigation of the INS confirmed reduced connectivity to widespread TPN and TNN areas, which was partially restored post-treatment. Furthermore, analysis of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data revealed structural changes in white matter supporting these findings. The left DLPFC also showed aberrant connectivity that was restored post-treatment. Altogether, our findings implicate the bilateral INS and left DLPFC as key nodes of disrupted cognition-related intrinsic connectivity in CLBP, and the resulting imbalance between TPN and TNN function is partially restored with treatment.

Multicenter Mapping of Structural Network Alterations in Autism	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						ASD; ABIDE; neocortex; connectivity; medial PFC; connectome	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; CORTICAL THICKNESS; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; WHITE-MATTER; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; MRI	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions primarily characterized by abnormalities in social cognition. Abundant previous functional MRI studies have shown atypical activity in networks encompassing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial parietal regions corresponding to posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/PCU). Conversely, studies assessing structural brain anomalies in ASD have been rather inconsistent. The current work evaluated whether structural changes in ASD can be reliability detected in a large multicenter dataset. Our comprehensive structural MRI framework encompassed cortical thickness mapping and structural covariance analysis based on three independent samples comprising individuals with ASD and controls (n=220), selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange open-access database. Surface-based analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in ASD relative to controls in mPFC and lateral prefrontal cortex. Clusters encompassing mPFC were embedded in altered inter-regional covariance networks, showing decreased covariance in ASD relative to controls primarily to PCC/PCU and inferior parietal regions. Cortical thickness increases and covariance reductions in ASD were consistent, yet of variable effect size, across the different sites evaluated and measurable both in children and adults. Our multisite study shows regional and network-level structural alterations in mPFC in ASD that, possibly, relate to atypical socio-cognitive functions in this condition.

J	Kamyshanska, H; Memisevic, R				Kamyshanska, Hanna; Memisevic, Roland			The Potential Energy of an Autoencoder	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Autoencoders; representation learning; unsupervised learning; generative classification	DENOISING AUTOENCODERS; CONTRASTIVE DIVERGENCE; STATISTICAL-MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Autoencoders are popular feature learning models, that are conceptually simple, easy to train and allow for efficient inference. Recent work has shown how certain autoencoders can be associated with an energy landscape, akin to negative log-probability in a probabilistic model, which measures how well the autoencoder can represent regions in the input space. The energy landscape has been commonly inferred heuristically, by using a training criterion that relates the autoencoder to a probabilistic model such as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). In this paper we show how most common autoencoders are naturally associated with an energy function, independent of the training procedure, and that the energy landscape can be inferred analytically by integrating the reconstruction function of the autoencoder. For autoencoders with sigmoid hidden units, the energy function is identical to the free energy of an RBM, which helps shed light onto the relationship between these two types of model. We also show that the autoencoder energy function allows us to explain common regularization procedures, such as contractive training, from the perspective of dynamical systems. As a practical application of the energy function, a generative classifier based on class-specific autoencoders is presented.

Maternal Care Differentially Affects Neuronal Excitability and Synaptic Plasticity in the Dorsal and Ventral Hippocampus	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT; RAT; EXPRESSION; ANXIETY; ADULTHOOD; MEMORY; STRESS; MODEL; ORGANIZATION	Variations in early life maternal care modulate hippocampal development to program distinct emotional-cognitive phenotypes that persist into adulthood. Adult rat offspring that received low compared with high levels of maternal licking and grooming (low LG offspring) in early postnatal life show reduced long term potentiation (LTP) and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory, suggesting a 'detrimental' maternal effect on neural development. However, these studies focused uniquely on the dorsal hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests a distinct role of the ventral hippocampus in mediating aggression, anxiety, and fear-memory formation, which are enhanced in low LG offspring. We report that variations in maternal care in the rat associate with opposing effects on hippocampal function in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Reduced pup licking associated with suppressed LTP formation in the dorsal hippocampus, but enhanced ventral hippocampal LTP. Ventral hippocampal neurons in low LG offspring fired action potentials at lower threshold voltages that were of larger amplitude and faster rise rate in comparison with those in high LG offspring. Furthermore, recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potential-to-spike coupling (E-S coupling) revealed an increase in excitability of ventral hippocampal CA1 neurons in low LG offspring. These effects do not associate with changes in miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents or paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting a specific effect of maternal care on intrinsic excitability. These findings suggest region-specific influences of maternal care in shaping neural development and synaptic plasticity.

It is well known that activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) initiates dopamine burst firing, a mode associated with reward signaling; but NMDARs also contribute to the maintenance of an inhibitory drive to dopamine neurons. Such opposite modulatory functions imply that different subtypes of NMDARs are expressed on different ventral midbrain (VM) neurons and/or afferent inputs to dopamine neurons. By using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique, we studied the effects of VM downregulation of NMDAR subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2D on reward induced by dorsal raphe electrical stimulation. Reward thresholds were measured before and 24 h after each of three consecutive daily bilateral microinjections of siRNA for the targeted receptor subunit(s) or non-active RNA sequence. After the last measurement, reward thresholds were reassessed following a bilateral microinjection of the preferred GluN2A-NMDA antagonist, (2R, 4S)-4-(3-Phosphopropyl)-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid (PPPA). Western-blot analysis showed that siRNAs reduced GluN1- and GluN2A-containing receptors whereas behavioral tests showed that only a reduction in GluN1 produced reward attenuation. Despite NMDAR reduction, reward-enhancing effect of PPPA remained unchanged. We conclude that VM glutamate relays the reward signal initiated by dorsal raphe electrical stimulation by acting on NMDARs devoid of GluN2A/2D subunits and exerts an inhibition on this reward signal by acting on GluN2A-containing NMDARs most likely located on afferent terminals.

Integration of neural networks activated by amphetamine in females with different estrogen levels: A functional imaging study in awake rats	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Estradiol; BOLD; Schizophrenia; Ovariectomy; fMRI; Amphetamine sensitization	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; STRIATAL DOPAMINE RELEASE; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; C-FOS; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LATERAL HABENULA; DECISION-MAKING; LIMBIC SYSTEM	Previous studies demonstrate that schizophrenia symptomatology in women is dependent upon estrogen levels. Estrogen has beneficial properties when administered in conjunction with antipsychotics, and estrogen also alters, in rats, dopamine neurotransmission, which is a common target of all antipsychotic medications, suggesting a possible interaction between the two. The aim of the current study was to investigate this possible interaction using functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake, female rats. Amphetamine-sensitized, ovariectomized rats receiving no, chronic low, or phasic high levels of estradiol replacement were used, and changes in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal were recorded over time in response to an acute amphetamine injection. Increasing levels of estradiol enhanced BOLD activation in pathways previously known to be implicated in schizophrenia symptomatology, such as the mesocorticolimbic, habenular and olfactory pathways, as well as more widespread areas. We propose here the first comprehensive "amphetamine activation map" integrating brain regions where amphetamine-related BOLD activity is influenced by estrogen levels in sensitized female rats.

Epidemiological studies also indicate that chronic exposure to opiates may lead in susceptible individuals to the emergence of depressive symptoms, strongly contributing to the severity and chronicity of addiction. We recently established a mouse model of heroin abstinence, characterized by the development of depressive-like behaviors following chronic heroin exposure. While genetic factors regulating immediate behavioral responses to opiates have been largely investigated, little is known about their contribution to long-term emotional regulation during abstinence. Here, we compared locomotor stimulation and physical dependence induced by heroin exposure, as well as emotional dysfunction following abstinence, across mice strains with distinct genetic backgrounds. Mice from three inbred strains (C57BL/6J, Balb/cByJ, and 129S2/SvPas) were exposed to an escalating chronic heroin regimen (10-50 mg/kg). Independent cohorts were used to assess drug-induced locomotor activity during chronic treatment, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal at the end of chronic treatment, and emotional-like responses after a 4-week abstinence period. Distinct behavioral profiles were observed across strains during heroin treatment, with no physical dependence and low locomotor stimulation in 129S2/SvPas. In addition, different behavioral impairments developed during abstinence across the three strains, with increased despair-like behavior in 129S2/SvPas and Balb/cByJ, and low sociability in 129S2/SvPas and C57BL/6J. Our results indicate that depressive-like behaviors emerge during heroin abstinence, whatever the severity of immediate behavioral responses to the drug. In addition, inbred mouse strains will allow studying several aspects of mood-related deficits associated with addiction.	[Ayranci, G.; Befort, K.; Lalanne, L.; Kieffer, B.

As part of a program of research examining pain in preterm infants, we conducted a qualitatively driven mixed-methods design, supplemented with a qualitative and quantitative component, to understand how health care professionals (HCPs) assess and manage procedural pain for tiny and underdeveloped preterm infants. Fifty-nine HCPs from different disciplines across four tertiary-level neonatal units in Canada participated in individual or focus group interviews and completed a brief questionnaire. Four themes from the content analysis were (a) subtlety and unpredictability of pain indicators, (b) infant and caregiver attributes and contextual factors that influence pain response and practices, (c) the complex nature of pain assessment, and (d) uncertainty in the management of pain. The information gleaned from this study can assist in identifying gaps in knowledge and informing unit-based and organizational knowledge translation strategies for this vulnerable population.

The development of brain injury in these newborns has been related partly to brain perfusion abnormalities. The purposes of this study were to assess brain hyperperfusion over the first month of life in term asphyxiated newborns and to search for some histopathological clues indicating whether this hyperperfusion may be related to activated angiogenesis following asphyxia. In this prospective cohort study, regional cerebral blood flow was measured in term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia around day 10 of life and around 1 month of life using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arterial spin labeling. A total of 32 MRI scans were obtained from 24 term newborns. Asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia displayed an increased cerebral blood flow in the injured brain areas around day 10 of life and up to 1 month of life. In addition, we looked at the histopathological clues in a human asphyxiated newborn and in a rat model of neonatal encephalopathy. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was expressed in the injured brain of an asphyxiated newborn treated with hypothermia in the first days of life and of rat pups 24-48 h after the hypoxic-ischemic event, and the endothelial cell count increased in the injured cortex of the pups 7 and 11 days after hypoxia-ischemia. Our data showed that the hyperperfusion measured by imaging persisted in the injured areas up to 1 month of life and that angiogenesis was activated in the injured brain of asphyxiated newborns.

Wakefulness delta waves increase after cortical plasticity induction	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						iTBS; Plasticity; Delta band; Delta waves; Sleep; Synaptic homeostasis hypothesis; EEG; MEP; TMS	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; THETA-BURST-STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; SLEEP SLOW WAVES; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; STROKE PATIENTS; UPPER-LIMB; EEG; FREQUENCY; TMS	Objective: Delta waves (DW) are present both during sleep and in wakefulness. In the first case, DW are considered effectors of synaptic plasticity, while in wakefulness, when they appear in the case of brain lesions, their functional meaning is not unanimously recognized. To throw light on the latter, we aimed to investigate the impact on DW exerted by the cortical plasticity-inducing protocol of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). Methods: Twenty healthy subjects underwent iTBS (11 real iTBS and nine sham iTBS) on the left primary motor cortex with the aim of inducing long-term potentiation (LTP)-like phenomena. Five-minute resting open-eye 32-channel EEG, right opponens pollicis motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and alertness behavioral scales were collected before and up to 30 min after the iTBS. Power spectral density (PSD), interhemispheric coherence between homologous sensorimotor regions, and intrahemispheric coherence were calculated for the frequency bands ranging from delta to beta. Results: Real iTBS induced a significant increase of both MEP amplitude and DW PSD lasting up to 30 min after stimulation, while sham iTBS did not. The DW increase was evident over frontal areas ipsilateral and close to the stimulated cortex (electrode F3). Neither real nor sham iTBS induced significant modifications in the PSD of theta, alpha, and beta bands and in the interhemispheric coherence. Behavioral visuo-analogic scales score did not demonstrate changes in alertness after stimulations. No correlations were found between MEP amplitude and PSD changes in the delta band. Conclusions: Our data showed that LTP induction in the motor cortex during wakefulness, by means of iTBS, is accompanied by a large and enduring increase of DW over the ipsilateral frontal cortex. Significance: The present results are strongly in favor of a prominent role of DW in the neural plasticity processes taking place during the awake state.

Histopathologic Changes of the Inner ear in Rhesus Monkeys After Intratympanic Gentamicin Injection and Vestibular Prosthesis Electrode Array Implantation	JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						vestibular prosthesis; vestibular implant; gentamicin; rhesus; macaque; intratympanic; transtympanic; cochlear implant	HAIR-CELL COUNTS; SEMICIRCULAR CANAL PROSTHESIS; HUMAN UTRICULAR MACULA; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; MENIERES-DISEASE; COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION; CRISTAE AMPULLARES; VESTIBULOCOLLIC NEURONS; COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGY	Bilateral vestibular deficiency (BVD) due to gentamicin ototoxicity can significantly impact quality of life and result in large socioeconomic burdens. Restoring sensation of head rotation using an implantable multichannel vestibular prosthesis (MVP) is a promising treatment approach that has been tested in animals and humans. However, uncertainty remains regarding the histopathologic effects of gentamicin ototoxicity alone or in combination with electrode implantation. Understanding these histological changes is important because selective MVP-driven stimulation of semicircular canals (SCCs) depends on persistence of primary afferent innervation in each SCC crista despite both the primary cause of BVD (e.g., ototoxic injury) and surgical trauma associated with MVP implantation. Retraction of primary afferents out of the cristae and back toward Scarpa's ganglion would render spatially selective stimulation difficult to achieve and could limit utility of an MVP that relies on electrodes implanted in the lumen of each ampulla. We investigated histopathologic changes of the inner ear associated with intratympanic gentamicin (ITG) injection and/or MVP electrode array implantation in 11 temporal bones from six rhesus macaque monkeys. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained 10-mu m temporal bone sections were examined under light microscopy for four treatment groups: normal (three ears), ITG-only (two ears), MVP-only (two ears), and ITG + MVP (four ears). We estimated vestibular hair cell (HC) surface densities for each sensory neuroepithelium and compared findings across end organs and treatment groups. In ITG-only, MVP-only, and ITG + MVP ears, we observed decreased but persistent ampullary nerve fibers of SCC cristae despite ITG treatment and/or MVP electrode implantation. ITG-only and ITG + MVP ears exhibited neuroepithelial thinning and loss of type I HCs in the cristae but little effect on the maculae. MVP-only and ITG + MVP ears exhibited no signs of trauma to the cochlea or otolith end organs except in a single case of saccular injury due to over-insertion of the posterior SCC electrode. While implanted electrodes reached to within 50-760 mu m of the target cristae and were usually ensheathed in a thin fibrotic capsule, dense fibrotic reaction and osteoneogenesis were each observed in only one of six electrode tracts examined. Consistent with physiologic studies that have demonstrated directionally appropriate vestibulo-ocular reflex responses to MVP electrical stimulation years after implantation in these animals, histologic findings in the present study indicate that although intralabyrinthine MVP implantation causes some inner ear trauma, it can be accomplished without destroying the distal afferent fibers an MVP is designed to excite.

This paper presents a nouvelle cutting tool wear assessment in high precision turning process using type-2 fuzzy uncertainty estimation on acoustic Emission. Without understanding the exact physics of the machining process, type-2 fuzzy logic system identifies acoustic emission signal during the process and its interval set of output assesses the uncertainty information in the signal. The experimental study shows that the development trend of uncertainty in acoustic emission signal corresponds to that of cutting tool wear. The estimation of uncertainties can be used for proving the conformance with specifications for products or auto-controlling of machine system, which has great meaning for continuously improvement in product quality, reliability and manufacturing efficiency in machining industry.

Resveratrol has been considered as one of the key ingredients responsible for the preventive action of red wine since the stilbene displays a neuroprotective action in various models of toxicity. Besides its well documented free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties, resveratrol has been shown to increase the clearance of beta-amyloid, a key feature of Alzheimer's disease, and to modulate intracellular effectors associated with oxidative stress (e.g. heme oxygenase), neuronal energy homeostasis (e.g. AMP kinase), program cell death (i.e. AIF) and longevity (i.e. sirtuins). This article summarizes the most recent findings on mechanisms of action involved in the protective effects of this multi target polyphenol, and discusses its possible roles in the prevention of various age-related neurological disorders.

Within term-equivalent rat brains exposed to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus HI, it was previously showed that neurons produce IL-1 beta earlier than do glial cells, and that blocking IL-1 was neuroprotective. To further define the mechanisms whereby IL-1 exerts its neurotoxic effect, we hypothesize that IL-1 beta plays a pivotal role in a direct and/or indirect mechanistic loop of neuronal self-injury through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Methods: An established preclinical rat model of LPS+HI-induced neonatal encephalopathy was used. In situ hybridization, ELISA, and immunolabeling techniques were employed. Selective blocking compounds allowed addressing the respective roles of IL-1 and MMP-9. Results: In LPS+HI-exposed forebrains, neuronal IL-1 beta was first detected in infarcted neocortical and striatal areas and later in glial cells of the adjacent white matter. Neuronal IL-1 beta played a key role: (i) in the early post-HI exacerbation of neuroinflammation and (ii) in generating both core and penumbral infarcted cerebral areas. Systemically administered IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) reached the brain and bound to the neocortical and deep gray neuronal membranes. Then, IL-1Ra down-regulated IL-1 beta mRNA and MMP-9 neuronal synthesis. Immediately post-HI, neuronal IL-1 beta up-regulated cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. MMP-9 would disrupt the blood-brain barrier, which, combined to CINC-1 up-regulation, would play a role in polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration into the LPS+HI-exposed brain. IL-1 beta blockade prevented PMN infiltration and oriented the phenotype of macrophagic/microglial cells towards anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic M2 profile. IL-1 beta increased the expression of activated caspase-3 and of receptor-interacting-protein (RIP)-3 within infarcted forebrain area. Such apoptotic and necroptotic pathway activations were prevented by IL-1Ra, as well as ensuing cerebral palsy-like brain damage and motor impairment. Conclusions: This work uncovered a new paradigm of neuronal self-injury orchestrated by neuronal synthesis of IL-1 beta and MMP-9. In addition, it reinforced the translational neuroprotective potential of IL-1 blockers to alleviate human perinatal brain injuries.

We discuss the diagnostic evaluation and clinical characteristics followed by treatment options suitable for the clinician working from primary through to specialist psychiatric care. Robust data supports the effectiveness of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine in the short-term and the longer-term treatment and for relapse prevention. Owing to better tolerability, SSRIs are acknowledged as the first-line pharmacological treatment of choice. For those patients for whom first line treatments have been ineffective, evidence supports the use of adjunctive antipsychotic medication, and some evidence supports the use of high-dose SSRIs. Novel compounds are also the subject of active investigation. Neurosurgical treatments, including ablative lesion neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation, are reserved for severely symptomatic individuals who have not experienced sustained response to both pharmacological and cognitive behavior therapies.

However, the strengths of this technique have not been widely harnessed in neurosciences due to the critical step of CNS tissue preparation into a single cell suspension. Previous reports assessed either neural cells or infiltrating leukocytes but simultaneous detection has not been extensively implemented. We optimized CNS tissue preparation for flow cytometry analysis. New method: We subjected CNS tissue from individual adult mice to different digestion protocols and Percoll (TM) methods. We quantified and characterized by flow cytometry neural cells (neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia) and leukocytes (macrophages, T lymphocytes). Results: The one step Percoll (TM) method significantly increased cell yield compared to the gradient Percoll (TM) method. The collagenase D + DNase I digestion led to the maximal cell number recovery while preserving cell marker (04, NeuN, CD45, CD11b, CD3, CD4, CD8) integrity compared to papain, trypsin digestion, and no digestion. The combination of collagenase D + DNase I digestion and one step Percoll (TM) method was optimal for the recovery and analysis of cells from the CNS of naive and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (multiple sclerosis model) mice. Comparison with existing method(s): Although flow cytometry does not reveal CNS localization, this technique allows concurrent quantification of multiple parameters. In contrast to other protocols, our novel method simultaneously analyzes neural and immune cells in individual mice in healthy and pathological conditions. Conclusions: We strongly believe that the field of neurosciences will benefit from an optimal use of flow cytometry to elucidate physiological and pathological processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we compared how individuals from these two cultures passively respond to emotional cues from faces and voices using an Oddball task. Participants viewed in-group emotional faces, with or without simultaneous vocal expressions, while performing a face-irrelevant visual task as the EEG was recorded. A significantly larger visual Mismatch Negativity (vMMN) was observed for Chinese vs. English participants when faces were accompanied by voices, suggesting that Chinese were influenced to a larger extent by task-irrelevant vocal cues. These data highlight further differences in how adults from East Asian vs. Western cultures process socio-emotional cues, arguing that distinct cultural practices in communication (e.g. display rules) shape neurocognitive activity associated with the early perception and integration of multisensory emotional cues.

A Point Mutation in the Ubiquitin Ligase RNF170 That Causes Autosomal Dominant Sensory Ataxia Destabilizes the Protein and Impairs Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor-mediated Ca2+ Signaling	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RETICULUM-ASSOCIATED DEGRADATION; ER-ASSOCIATED DEGRADATION; SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIAS; RELEASE CHANNELS; SYSTEM; ERLIN2; PROTEASOME; TOPOLOGY; RESIDUES; DOMAINS	RNF170 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane ubiquitin ligase that contributes to the ubiquitination of activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, and also, when point mutated (arginine to cysteine at position 199), causes autosomal dominant sensory ataxia (ADSA), a disease characterized by neurodegeneration in the posterior columns of the spinal cord. Here we demonstrate that this point mutation inhibits RNF170 expression and signaling via IP3 receptors. Inhibited expression of mutant RNF170 was seen in cells expressing exogenous RNF170 constructs and in ADSA lymphoblasts, and appears to result from enhanced RNF170 autoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The basis for these effects was probed via additional point mutations, revealing that ionic interactions between charged residues in the transmembrane domains of RNF170 are required for protein stability. In ADSA lymphoblasts, platelet-activating factor-induced Ca2+ mobilization was significantly impaired, whereas neither Ca2+ store content, IP3 receptor levels, nor IP3 production were altered, indicative of a functional defect at the IP3 receptor locus, which may be the cause of neurodegeneration. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion of RNF170 showed that RNF170 mediates the addition of all of the ubiquitin conjugates known to become attached to activated IP3 receptors (monoubiquitin and Lys(48)-and Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chains), and that wild-type and mutant RNF170 have apparently identical ubiquitin ligase activities toward IP3 receptors. Thus, the Ca2+ mobilization defect seen in ADSA lymphoblasts is apparently not due to aberrant IP3 receptor ubiquitination. Rather, the defect likely reflects abnormal ubiquitination of other substrates, or adaptation to the chronic reduction in RNF170 levels.	[Wright, Forrest A.; Lu, Justine P.; Wojcikiewicz, Richard J.

In particular, research on the cognitive advantages of bilingualism suggests that it can enhance control over interference and help delay the onset of dementia signs. However, the evidence on the so-called cognitive advantage is not unanimous; furthermore, little is known about the neural basis of this supposed cognitive advantage in bilingual as opposed to monolingual elderly populations. In this study, elderly bilingual and monolingual participants performed a visuospatial interference control task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Response times and accuracy rates were calculated for congruent and incongruent conditions of the Simon task, and the neurofunctional correlates of performance on the Simon task were examined. The results showed equivalent performance on the Simon task across groups but different underlying neural substrates in the two groups. With incongruent trials, monolinguals activated the right middle frontal gyrus, whereas bilinguals relied upon the left inferior parietal lobule. These results show that elderly bilinguals and monolinguals have equivalent interference control abilities, but relay on different neural substrates. Thus, while monolinguals show a classical PASA (posterior-anterior shift in aging) effect, recruiting frontal areas, bilinguals activate visuospatial processing alone and thus do not show this posterior-anterior shift. Moreover, a modulation of frontal activity with task-dynamic control of interference, observed in the elderly bilingual group alone, suggests that elderly bilinguals deal with interference control without recruiting a circuit that is particularly vulnerable to aging.

Multisensory attention training for treatment of tinnitus	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GAZE-EVOKED TINNITUS; NETWORK; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; MOVEMENTS; LOUDNESS; THERAPY; CORTEX; TRIAL; FMRI	Tinnitus is the conscious perception of sound with no physical sound source. Some models of tinnitus pathophysiology suggest that networks associated with attention, memory, distress and multisensory experience are involved in tinnitus perception. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a multisensory attention training paradigm which used audio, visual, and somatosensory stimulation would reduce tinnitus. Eighteen participants with predominantly unilateral chronic tinnitus were randomized between two groups receiving 20 daily sessions of either integration (attempting to reduce salience to tinnitus by binding with multisensory stimuli) or attention diversion (multisensory stimuli opposite side to tinnitus) training. The training resulted in small but statistically significant reductions in Tinnitus Functional Index and Tinnitus Severity Numeric Scale scores and improved attentional abilities. No statistically significant improvements in tinnitus were found between the training groups. This study demonstrated that a short period of multisensory attention training reduced unilateral tinnitus, but directing attention toward or away from the tinnitus side did not differentiate this effect.

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.

This is mainly due to the insurmountable and selective nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we show that the thermal energy generated by magnetic heating (hyperthermia) of commercially available magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the brain capillaries of rats can transiently increase barrier permeability. Here, the fluorescent Evans Blue (EB) dye was used to verify the BBB integrity. Results indicate a substantial but reversible opening of the BBB where hyperthermia is applied. Also, in this investigation, analysis of CD68 immunoreactivity, an indicator of inflammation, implies that this technique is not associated with any inflammation. We have previously investigated theranostic (therapeutic and diagnostic) capabilities of the MNPs, therefore, the findings presented in this investigation are particularly encouraging for a novel targeted drug delivery system to the brain.

During the first few weeks of withdrawal, cue-induced cocaine craving intensifies, or "incubates," and persists over extended periods of time. Although several brain regions and molecular mechanisms were found to be involved in this process, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are still unknown. Herein, we used a rat model of incubation of cocaine craving, in which rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg, 6 h/d, 10 d), and cue-induced cocaine-seeking was examined in an extinction test after 1 or 30 d of withdrawal. We show that the withdrawal periods, as well as cue-induced cocaine seeking, are associated with broad, time-dependent enhancement of DNA methylation alterations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These gene methylation alterations were partly negatively correlated with gene expression changes. Furthermore, intra-NAc injections of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (RG108, 100 mu M) abolished cue-induced cocaine seeking on day 30, an effect that persisted 1 month, whereas the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (500 mu M) had an opposite effect on cocaine seeking. We then targeted two proteins whose genes were demethylated by RG108-estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). Treatment with an intra-NAc injection of the ESR1 agonist propyl pyrazole triol (10 nM) or the CDK5 inhibitor roscovitine (28 mu M) on day 30 of withdrawal significantly decreased cue-induced cocaine seeking. These results demonstrate a role for NAc DNA methylation, and downstream targets of DNA demethylation, in incubation of cocaine craving.

Under normal conditions, NPY is found in interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in sympathetic postganglionic neurons but is absent from the cell bodies of sensory neurons. Following peripheral nerve injury NPY is dramatically upregulated in the sensory ganglia. How NPY expression is altered in the peripheral nervous system, distal to a site of nerve lesion, remains unknown. To address this question, NPY expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry at the level of the trigeminal ganglion, the mental nerve and in the skin of the lower lip in relation to markers of sensory and sympathetic fibers in a rat model of trigeminal neuropathic pain. Results: At 2 and 6 weeks after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the mental nerve, de novo expression of NPY was seen in the trigeminal ganglia, in axons in the mental nerve, and in fibers in the upper dermis of the skin. In lesioned animals, NPY immunoreactivity was expressed primarily by large diameter mental nerve sensory neurons retrogradely labelled with Fluorogold. Many axons transported this de novo NPY to the periphery as NPY-immunoreactive (IR) fibers were seen in the mental nerve both proximal and distal to the CCI. Some of these NPY-IR axons co-expressed Neurofilament 200 (NF200), a marker for myelinated sensory fibers, and occasionally colocalization was seen in their terminals in the skin. Peptidergic and non-peptidergic C fibers expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or binding isolectin B4 (IB4), respectively, never expressed NPY. CCI caused a significant de novo sprouting of sympathetic fibers into the upper dermis of the skin, and most, but not all of these fibers, expressed NPY. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide a comprehensive description of changes in NPY expression in the periphery after nerve injury. Novel expression of NPY in the skin comes mostly from sprouted sympathetic fibers. This information is fundamental in order to understand where endogenous NPY is expressed, and how it might be acting to modulate pain in the periphery.

Interaction among components at all spatial scales, including genes, proteins, neurons, local neuronal circuits and macroscopic brain regions, are indispensable for such vital functions. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that, from the microscopic to the macroscopic levels, such connections might also be a conduit for in intra-brain disease spreading. For instance, cell-to-cell misfolded proteins (MP) transmission and neuronal toxicity are prominent connectivity-mediated factors in aging and neurodegeneration. This article offers an overview of connectivity dysfunctions associated with neurodegeneration, with a specific focus on how these may be central to both normal aging and the neuropathologic degenerative progression.

Therapeutic hypothermia is currently the standard of care to prevent brain injury in asphyxiated newborns but is not protective in all cases. More robust and versatile treatment options are needed. Angiogenesis is a demonstrated therapeutic target in adult stroke. However, no systematic study examines the expression of angiogenesis-related markers following birth asphyxia in human newborns. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the expression of angiogenesis-related protein markers in asphyxiated newborns developing and not developing brain injury compared to healthy control newborns. Design/Methods Twelve asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia were prospectively enrolled; six developed eventual brain injury and six did not. Four healthy control newborns were also included. We used Rules-Based Medicine multi-analyte profiling and protein array technologies to study the plasma concentration of 49 angiogenesis-related proteins. Mean protein concentrations were compared between each group of newborns. Results Compared to healthy newborns, asphyxiated newborns not developing brain injury showed up-regulation of pro-angiogenic proteins, including fatty acid binding protein-4, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, neuropilin-1, and receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3; this up-regulation was not evident in asphyxiated newborns eventually developing brain injury. Also, asphyxiated newborns developing brain injury showed a decreased expression of anti-angiogenic proteins, including insulin-growth factor binding proteins -1, -4, and -6, compared to healthy newborns. Conclusions These findings suggest that angiogenesis pathways are dysregulated following birth asphyxia and are putatively involved in brain injury pathology and recovery.

Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood: Retrospective Genetic Study and Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in 187 Subjects from the US AHCF Registry	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ONSET DYSTONIA-PARKINSONISM; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER EAAT1; DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; ATP1A3 MUTATION; CLINICAL-MANIFESTATIONS; ALPHA-3 ISOFORM; NA+ INTERACTION; K+-ATPASE; SPECTRUM; AFFINITY	Mutations in ATP1A3 cause Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) by disrupting function of the neuronal Na+/K+ ATPase. Published studies to date indicate 2 recurrent mutations, D801N and E815K, and a more severe phenotype in the E815K cohort. We performed mutation analysis and retrospective genotype-phenotype correlations in all eligible patients with AHC enrolled in the US AHC Foundation registry from 1997-2012. Clinical data were abstracted from standardized caregivers' questionnaires and medical records and confirmed by expert clinicians. We identified ATP1A3 mutations by Sanger and whole genome sequencing, and compared phenotypes within and between 4 groups of subjects, those with D801N, E815K, other ATP1A3 or no ATP1A3 mutations. We identified heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations in 154 of 187 (82%) AHC patients. Of 34 unique mutations, 31 (91%) are missense, and 16 (47%) had not been previously reported. Concordant with prior studies, more than 2/3 of all mutations are clustered in exons 17 and 18. Of 143 simplex occurrences, 58 had D801N (40%), 38 had E815K (26%) and 11 had G937R (8%) mutations. Patients with an E815K mutation demonstrate an earlier age of onset, more severe motor impairment and a higher prevalence of status epilepticus. This study further expands the number and spectrum of ATP1A3 mutations associated with AHC and confirms a more deleterious effect of the E815K mutation on selected neurologic outcomes. However, the complexity of the disorder and the extensive phenotypic variability among subgroups merits caution and emphasizes the need for further studies.

In humans, SWs are generated and propagate on a structural backbone of highly interconnected cortical regions that form most of the default mode network, such as the insula, cingulate cortices, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and medial frontal lobe. Regions in this network undergo cortical thinning and breakdown in structural and functional connectivity over the course of normal aging. In this study, we investigated how changes in cortical thickness (CT), a measure of gray matter integrity, are involved in modifications of sleep SWs during adulthood in humans. Thirty young (mean age = 23.49 years; SD = 2.79) and 33 older (mean age = 60.35 years; SD = 5.71) healthy subjects underwent a nocturnal polysomnography and T1 MRI. We show that, when controlling for age, higher SW density (nb/min of nonrapid eye movement sleep) was associated with higher CT in cortical regions involved in SW generation surrounding the lateral fissure (insula, superior temporal, parietal, middle frontal), whereas higher SW amplitude was associated with higher CT in middle frontal, medial prefrontal, and medial posterior regions. Mediation analyses demonstrated that thinning in a network of cortical regions involved in SW generation and propagation, but also in cognitive functions, explained the age-related decrease in SW density and amplitude. Altogether, our results suggest that microstructural degradation of specific cortical regions compromise SW generation and propagation in older subjects, critically contributing to age-related changes in SW oscillations.

Polarity-specific transcranial direct current stimulation disrupts auditory pitch learning	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial direct current stimulation; auditory pitch learning; pitch discrimination; consolidation; anodal tDCS	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; DC-STIMULATION; HOMEOSTATIC PLASTICITY; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DEPENDENT MODULATION; EXCITABILITY SHIFTS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; SUPRAMARGINAL GYRUS	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is attracting increasing interest because of its potential for therapeutic use. While its effects have been investigated mainly with motor and visual tasks, less is known in the auditory domain. Past tDCS studies with auditory tasks demonstrated various behavioral outcomes, possibly due to differences in stimulation parameters, task-induced brain activity, or task measurements used in each study. Further research, using well-validated tasks is therefore required for clarification of behavioral effects of tDCS on the auditory system. Here, we took advantage of findings from a prior functional magnetic resonance imaging study, which demonstrated that the right auditory cortex is modulated during fine-grained pitch learning of microtonal melodic patterns. Targeting the right auditory cortex with tDCS using this same task thus allowed us to test the hypothesis that this region is causally involved in pitch learning. Participants in the current study were trained for 3 days while we measured pitch discrimination thresholds using microtonal melodies on each day using a psychophysical staircase procedure. We administered anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS to three groups of participants over the right auditory cortex on the second day of training during performance of the task. Both the sham and the cathodal groups showed the expected significant learning effect (decreased pitch threshold) over the 3 days of training; in contrast we observed a blocking effect of anodal tDCS on auditory pitch learning, such that this group showed no significant change in thresholds over the 3 days. The results support a causal role for the right auditory cortex in pitch discrimination learning.

Impact of cancer and chemotherapy on autonomic nervous system function and cardiovascular reactivity in young adults with cancer: a case-controlled feasibility study	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Cancer; Autonomic nervous system; Composite autonomic scoring scale; Cardiovascular disease; Young adults	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; RATE RECOVERY; EXERCISE; NEUROPATHY; BAROREFLEX; CISPLATIN	Background: Preliminary evidence suggests cancer- and chemotherapy-related autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction may contribute to the increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity-and mortality-risks in cancer survivors. However, the reliability of these findings may have been jeopardized by inconsistent participant screening and assessment methods. Therefore, good laboratory practices must be established before the presence and nature of cancer-related autonomic dysfunction can be characterized. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting concurrent ANS and cardiovascular evaluations in young adult cancer patients, according to the following criteria: i) identifying methodological pitfalls and proposing good laboratory practice criteria for ANS testing in cancer, and ii) providing initial physiologic evidence of autonomic perturbations in cancer patients using the composite autonomic scoring scale (CASS). Methods: Thirteen patients (mixed diagnoses) were assessed immediately before and after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Their results were compared to 12 sex-and age-matched controls. ANS function was assessed using standardized tests of resting CV (tilt-table, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and Valsalva maneuver) and sudomotor (quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test) reactivity. Cardiovascular reactivity during exercise was assessed using a modified Astrand-Ryhming cycle ergometer protocol. Our feasibility criteria addressed: i) recruitment potential, ii) retention rates, iii) pre-chemotherapy assessment potential, iv) test performance/tolerability, and v) identification and minimizing the influence of potentially confounding medication. T-tests and repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess between-and within-group differences at baseline and follow-up. Results: The overall success rate in achieving our feasibility criteria was 98.4 %. According to the CASS, there was evidence of ANS impairment at baseline in 30.8 % of patients, which persisted in 18.2 % of patients at follow-up, compared to 0 % of controls at baseline or follow-up. Conclusions: Results from our feasibility assessment suggest that the investigation of ANS function in young adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy is possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report CASS-based evidence of ANS impairment and sudomotor dysfunction in any cancer population. Moreover, we provide evidence of cancer- and chemotherapy-related parasympathetic dysfunction - as a possible contributor to the pathogenesis of CV disease in cancer survivors.

Critical assessment of influenza VLP production in Sf9 and HEK293 expression systems	BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Influenza vaccines; Virus like particles (VLPs); Insect cells; Mammalian cells; Process development; VLP characterization	VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES; PROTECTIVE IMMUNE-RESPONSES; A VIRUS; PANDEMIC INFLUENZA; MATRIX PROTEIN; VIRAL-PROTEINS; M1 PROTEIN; HEMAGGLUTININ; VACCINES; MICE	Background: Each year, influenza is responsible for hundreds of thousand cases of illness and deaths worldwide. Due to the virus' fast mutation rate, the World Health Organization (WHO) is constantly on alert to rapidly respond to emerging pandemic strains. Although anti-viral therapies exist, the most proficient way to stop the spread of disease is through vaccination. The majority of influenza vaccines on the market are produced in embryonic hen's eggs and are composed of purified viral antigens from inactivated whole virus. This manufacturing system, however, is limited in its production capacity. Cell culture produced vaccines have been proposed for their potential to overcome the problems associated with egg-based production. Virus-like particles (VLPs) of influenza virus are promising candidate vaccines under consideration by both academic and industry researchers. Methods: In this study, VLPs were produced in HEK293 suspension cells using the Bacmam transduction system and Sf9 cells using the baculovirus infection system. The proposed systems were assessed for their ability to produce influenza VLPs composed of Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA) and Matrix Protein (M1) and compared through the lens of bioprocessing by highlighting baseline production yields and bioactivity. VLPs from both systems were characterized using available influenza quantification techniques, such as single radial immunodiffusion assay (SRID), HA assay, western blot and negative staining transmission electron microscopy (NSTEM) to quantify total particles. Results: For the HEK293 production system, VLPs were found to be associated with the cell pellet in addition to those released in the supernatant. Sf9 cells produced 35 times more VLPs than HEK293 cells. Sf9-VLPs had higher total HA activity and were generally more homogeneous in morphology and size. However, Sf9 VLP samples contained 20 times more baculovirus than VLPs, whereas 293 VLPs were produced along with vesicles. Conclusions: This study highlights key production hurdles that must be overcome in both expression platforms, namely the presence of contaminants and the ensuing quantification challenges, and brings up the question of what truly constitutes an influenza VLP candidate vaccine.

The 3' addition of CCA to mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)) is specifically impaired in patients with mutations in the tRNA nucleotidyl transferase TRNT1	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							SIDEROBLASTIC ANEMIA-MLASA; LACTIC-ACIDOSIS; ADDING ENZYME; DNA; POLYMERIZATION; DELETIONS; MECHANISM; TEMPLATE; MYOPATHY; GENE	Addition of the trinucleotide cytosine/cytosine/adenine (CCA) to the 3' end of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) is essential for translation and is catalyzed by the enzyme TRNT1 (tRNA nucleotidyl transferase), which functions in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Exome sequencing revealed TRNT1 mutations in two unrelated subjects with different clinical features. The first presented with acute lactic acidosis at 3 weeks of age and developed severe developmental delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, seizures, progressive cortical atrophy, neurosensorial deafness, sideroblastic anemia and renal Fanconi syndrome, dying at 21 months. The second presented at 3.5 years with gait ataxia, dysarthria, gross motor regression, hypotonia, ptosis and ophthalmoplegia and had abnormal signals in brainstem and dentate nucleus. In subject 1, muscle biopsy showed combined oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects, but there was no OXPHOS deficiency in fibroblasts from either subject, despite a 10-fold-reduction in TRNT1 protein levels in fibroblasts of the first subject. Furthermore, in normal controls, TRNT1 protein levels are 10-fold lower in muscle than in fibroblasts. High resolution northern blots of subject fibroblast RNA suggested incomplete CCA addition to the non-canonical mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)), but no obvious qualitative differences in other mitochondrial or cytoplasmic tRNAs. Complete knockdown of TRNT1 in patient fibroblasts rendered mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)) undetectable, and markedly reduced mitochondrial translation, except polypeptides lacking Ser(AGY) codons. These data suggest that the clinical phenotypes associated with TRNT1 mutations are largely due to impaired mitochondrial translation, resulting from defective CCA addition to mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)), and that the severity of this biochemical phenotype determines the severity and tissue distribution of clinical features.

The three 'P's of mitophagy: PARKIN, PINK1, and post-translational modifications	GENES & DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						PARKIN; ubiquitin; deubiquitination; mitophagy; PINK1; phosphorylation	MITOCHONDRIAL QUALITY-CONTROL; ATYPICAL UBIQUITIN CHAINS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA NEURONS; MEDIATED MITOPHAGY; DAMAGED MITOCHONDRIA; LIGASE ACTIVITY; COMPLEX-I; PINK1-DEPENDENT PHOSPHORYLATION; DEPOLARIZED MITOCHONDRIA; ACTIVATE PARKIN	Two Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated proteins, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the E3-ubiquitin (Ub) ligase PARKIN, are central to mitochondrial quality control. In this pathway, PINK1 accumulates on defective mitochondria, eliciting the translocation of PARKIN from the cytosol to mediate the clearance of damaged mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy). Throughout the different stages of mitophagy, post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical for the regulation of PINK1 and PARKIN activity and function. Indeed, activation and recruitment of PARKIN onto damaged mitochondria involves PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of both PARKIN and Ub. Through a stepwise cascade, PARKIN is converted from an autoinhibited enzyme into an active phospho-Ub-dependent E3 ligase. Upon activation, PARKIN ubiquitinates itself in concert with many different mitochondrial substrates. The Ub conjugates attached to these substrates can in turn be phosphorylated by PINK1, which triggers further cycles of PARKIN recruitment and activation. This feed-forward amplification loop regulates both PARKIN activity and mitophagy. However, the precise steps and sequence of PTMs in this cascade are only now being uncovered. For instance, the Ub conjugates assembled by PARKIN consist predominantly of noncanonical K6-linked Ub chains. Moreover, these modifications are reversible and can be disassembled by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), including Ub-specific protease 8 (USP8), USP15, and USP30. However, PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub can impede the activity of these DUBs, adding a new layer of complexity to the regulation of PARKIN-mediated mitophagy by PTMs. It is therefore evident that further insight into how PTMs regulate the PINK1-PARKIN pathway will be critical for our understanding of mitochondrial quality control.

The intermediate filament protein nestin was recently identified in vascular smooth muscle cells and in other cell types directly participated in proliferation. The present study tested the hypothesis that vessel remodeling secondary to hypertension was characterized by nestin upregulation in vascular smooth muscle cells. Two weeks after suprarenal abdominal aorta constriction of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, elevated mean arterial pressure increased the media area and thickness of the carotid artery and aorta and concomitantly upregulated nestin protein levels. In the normal adult rat carotid artery, nestin immunoreactivity was observed in a subpopulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and the density significantly increased following suprarenal abdominal aorta constriction. Filamentous nestin was detected in cultured rat carotid arteryand aorta-derived vascular smooth muscle cells and an analogous paradigm observed in human aorta-derived vascular smooth muscle cells. ANG II and EGF treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated DNA and protein synthesis and increased nestin protein levels. Lentiviral short-hairpin RNA-mediated nestin depletion of carotid artery-derived vascular smooth muscle cells inhibited peptide growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis, whereas protein synthesis remained intact. These data have demonstrated that vessel remodeling secondary to hypertension was characterized in part by nestin upregulation in vascular smooth muscle cells. The selective role of nestin in peptide growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis has revealed that the proliferative and hypertrophic responses of vascular smooth muscle cells were mediated by divergent signaling events.

AIDS			English	Article						cognition; cognition disorders; HIV; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; neuropsychological tests	MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; RATING-SCALES; PERFORMANCE; HIV/AIDS; IMPACT	Objective: Existing screening tools for HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) may lack the accuracy required for clinical use. We hypothesized that the diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a screening tool for HAND might be improved with a stronger scoring methodology. Design: Two hundred HIV-positive participants aged 18-65 years completed the MoCA and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Methods: HAND diagnosis was established according to the Frascati criteria, and an NPZ-8 score was also calculated. Rasch analysis was applied to the MoCA items to create a quantitative score. Results: The optimal cut-off on the quantitative MoCA for detecting impairment as per Frascati criteria yielded a sensitivity of 0.74 and a specificity of 0.68. Overall accuracy was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.85), an improvement over standard scoring methods. However, whether cognition was quantified with the quantitative MoCA or with NPZ-8, there was substantial overlap between diagnostic categories; several individuals categorized as impaired had better overall cognitive function as assessed by NPZ-8 or quantitative MoCA than those classified as normal using standard criteria. Conclusion: Quantifying performance on MoCA items through Rasch analysis improves its accuracy as a screening tool for HAND, and demonstrates that cognition can be measured as a unidimensional construct in HIV, at least at the level of precision of bedside testing. However, the current categorical diagnostic approach to HAND is poorly aligned with summary measures of cognitive ability. Measuring cognition as a quasi-continuous construct may be more relevant than conventional HAND diagnostic categories for many clinical purposes. Copyright (c) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Systematic Review of Clinical Studies Examining Biomarkers of Brain Injury in Athletes after Sports-Related Concussion	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Review						traumatic brain injury; systematic review; sports; concussion; biomarkers	NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; AMATEUR SOCCER PLAYERS; PHYSICAL STRESS TEST; ALPHA-II-SPECTRIN; MINOR HEAD-INJURY; SERUM CLEAVED-TAU; NEUROSURGICAL INTERVENTION; INTRACRANIAL LESIONS; WHITE-MATTER	The aim of this study was to systematically review clinical studies examining biofluid biomarkers of brain injury for concussion in athletes. Data sources included PubMed((R)), MEDLINE (R), and the Cochrane Database from 1966 to October 2013. Studies were included if they recruited athletes participating in organized sports who experienced concussion or head injury during a sports-related activity and had brain injury biomarkers measured. Acceptable research designs included experimental, observational, and case-control studies. Review articles, opinion papers, and editorials were excluded. After title and abstract screening of potential articles, full texts were independently reviewed to identify articles that met inclusion criteria. A composite evidentiary table was then constructed and documented the study title, design, population, methods, sample size, outcome measures, and results. The search identified 52 publications, of which 13 were selected and critically reviewed. All of the included studies were prospective and were published either in or after the year 2000. Sports included boxing (six studies), soccer (five studies), running/jogging (two studies), hockey (one study), basketball (one study), cycling (one study), and swimming (one study). The majority of studies (92%) had fewer than 100 patients. Three studies (23%) evaluated biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), one in both serum and CSF, and 10 (77%) in serum exclusively. There were 11 different biomarkers assessed, including S100 beta, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron-specific enolase, tau, neurofilament light protein, amyloid beta, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, creatine kinase and heart-type fatty acid binding protein, prolactin, cortisol, and albumin. A handful of biomarkers showed a correlation with number of hits to the head (soccer), acceleration/deceleration forces (jumps, collisions, and falls), postconcussive symptoms, trauma to the body versus the head, and dynamics of different sports. Although there are no validated biomarkers for concussion as yet, there is potential for biomarkers to provide diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring information postinjury. They could also be combined with neuroimaging to assess injury evolution and recovery.

Youths are at risk because of a higher threat of repeated injury, and cumulative effects of concussions exist, making accurate diagnosis and follow-up essential. This study examines a navigational memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task to determine whether activation differences exist between children with concussion and uninjured controls. Fifty adolescents were recruited-35 controls and 15 with concussion. All subjects underwent structural and fMRI testing using our navigational memory task, and a battery of neuropsychological testing. The activation patterns of the 15 subjects with concussion were compared with those of 15 age and sex-matched controls. Subtraction and regression analyses were performed using the matched controls along with scatter-plots using means and 95% quantiles of the 35 controls. While no differences were seen with neuropsychological testing or task performance, subjects with concussion had significantly diminished activation in the retrosplenial, thalamic, and parahippocampal areas bilaterally, along with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left precuneus. Interestingly, they had increased activation in the left hippocampus and right middle temporal gyrus. Regression analysis demonstrated negative correlations between activation and post-concussive symptoms in the left premotor cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobules, and parahippocampal gyrus. Subjects with concussion show both diminished and increased activation in specific cerebral regions, differentiating them from controls. This is one of the first studies to look at such a task using fMRI and its applicability in testing for concussion in children. These findings support navigational memory fMRI as a potential objective test for concussions.

Females given access to the familiar male show more Fos induction within regions of the brain that contain oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) cell bodies, notably the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) relative to females given sexual experience with different males. The present experiments examined whether the Fos induction we previously observed within the SON and PVN occurred within OT and/or AVP neurons, and whether exogenous administration of OT or AVP prior to female rats first sexual experience could potentiate the acquisition of mate guarding behavior. Female rats that display conditioned mate guarding had significantly more double-labeled Fos/OT neurons in both SON and PVN, and significantly more Fos/AVP neurons in the PVN. Peripheral administration of OT or AVP prior to their first sexual experience with the familiar male facilitated different aspects of mate guarding: OT augmented affiliative behaviors and presenting responses whereas AVP augmented interference behavior. These results indicate that female rats' first experiences with sexual reward when paired with the same male induce changes to bonding networks in the brain. Moreover peripheral administration of OT or AVP during their first sexual experience can augment different aspects of mate guarding behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

Three groups were compared: French-English bilinguals who acquired two languages from birth (simultaneous), French-English bilinguals who learned their L2 after the age of 5 years (sequential), and English-speaking monolinguals. While the bilingual groups contrasted in age of acquisition, they were matched for language proficiency, although sequential bilinguals produced speech with a less native-like accent in their L2 than in their L1. Simultaneous bilinguals activated similar brain regions to an equivalent degree when reading in their two languages. In contrast, sequential bilinguals more strongly activated areas related to speech-motor control and orthographic to phonological mapping, the left inferior frontal gyrus, left premotor cortex, and left fusiform gyrus, when reading aloud in L2 compared to L1. In addition, the activity in these regions showed a significant positive correlation with age of acquisition. The results provide evidence for the engagement of overlapping neural substrates for processing two languages when acquired in native context from birth. However, it appears that the maturation of certain brain regions for both speech production and phonological encoding is limited by a sensitive period for L2 acquisition regardless of language proficiency.

The nicotinic alpha 6 subunit gene determines variability in chronic pain sensitivity via cross-inhibition of P2X2/3 receptors	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							SPARED NERVE INJURY; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; P2X(3) RECEPTORS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MECHANICAL HYPERALGESIA; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; TRANSGENIC MICE; P2X3 RECEPTORS; MOUSE STRAINS; EXPRESSION	Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and poorly managed human health problem. We used microarray-based expression genomics in 25 inbred mouse strains to identify dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-expressed genetic contributors to mechanical allodynia, a prominent symptom of chronic pain. We identified expression levels of Chrna6, which encodes the alpha 6 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), as highly associated with allodynia. We confirmed the importance of alpha 6* (alpha 6-containing) nAChRs by analyzing both gain-and loss-of-function mutants. We find that mechanical allodynia associated with neuropathic and inflammatory injuries is significantly altered in alpha 6* mutants, and that alpha 6* but not alpha 4* nicotinic receptors are absolutely required for peripheral and/or spinal nicotine analgesia. Furthermore, we show that Chrna6's role in analgesia is at least partially due to direct interaction and cross-inhibition of alpha 6* nAChRs with P2X2/3 receptors in DRG nociceptors. Finally, we establish the relevance of our results to humans by the observation of genetic association in patients suffering from chronic postsurgical and temporomandibular pain.

A molecular model for neurodevelopmental disorders	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NEURAL STEM-CELLS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; CEREBRAL CORTICAL SIZE; FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; MICRODELETION SYNDROME; SIGNALING PATHWAY; SATB2 INTERACTS; PROTEIN SHANK3; RETT-SYNDROME	Genes implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) important in cognition and behavior may have convergent function and several cellular pathways have been implicated, including protein translational control, chromatin modification, and synapse assembly and maintenance. Here, we test the convergent effects of methyl-CpG binding domain 5 (MBD5) and special AT-rich binding protein 2 (SATB2) reduced dosage in human neural stem cells (NSCs), two genes implicated in 2q23.1 and 2q33.1 deletion syndromes, respectively, to develop a generalized model for NDDs. We used short hairpin RNA stably incorporated into healthy neural stem cells to supress MBD5 and SATB2 expression, and massively parallel RNA sequencing, DNA methylation sequencing and microRNA arrays to test the hypothesis that a primary etiology of NDDs is the disruption of the balance of NSC proliferation and differentiation. We show that reduced dosage of either gene leads to significant overlap of gene-expression patterns, microRNA patterns and DNA methylation states with control NSCs in a differentiating state, suggesting that a unifying feature of 2q23.1 and 2q33.1 deletion syndrome may be a lack of regulation between proliferation and differentiation in NSCs, as we observed previously for TCF4 and EHMT1 suppression following a similar experimental paradigm. We propose a model of NDDs whereby the balance of NSC proliferation and differentiation is affected, but where the molecules that drive this effect are largely specific to disease-causing genetic variation. NDDs are diverse, complex and unique, but the optimal balance of factors that determine when and where neural stem cells differentiate may be a major feature underlying the diverse phenotypic spectrum of NDDs.

Additionally, we sought to investigate network differences before and after averaging network parameters between both maintenance and interference windows. We compared young and older adults by measuring their magnetoencephalographic recordings during an interference-based working memory task restricted to successful recognitions. Data analysis focused on the topology/temporal evolution of functional networks during both the maintenance and interference windows. We observed that: (a) Older adults require higher synchronization between cortical brain sites in order to achieve a successful recognition, (b) The main differences between age groups arise during the interference window, (c) Older adults show reduced ability to reorganize network topology when interference is introduced, and (d) Averaging network parameters leads to a loss of sensitivity to detect age differences.

Despite reported health benefits, yoga's effects on the brain have received little study. We used magnetic resonance imaging to compare age-related gray matter (GM) decline in yogis and controls. We also examined the effect of increasing yoga experience and weekly practice on GM volume and assessed which aspects of weekly practice contributed most to brain size. Controls displayed the well documented age-related global brain GM decline while yogis did not, suggesting that yoga contributes to protect the brain against age-related decline. Years of yoga experience correlated mostly with GM volume differences in the left hemisphere (insula, frontal operculum, and orbitofrontal cortex) suggesting that yoga tunes the brain toward a parasympatically driven mode and positive states. The number of hours of weekly practice correlated with GM volume in the primary somatosensory cortex/superior parietal lobule (S1/SPL), precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), hippocampus, and primary visual cortex (V1). Commonality analyses indicated that the combination of postures and meditation contributed the most to the size of the hippocampus, precuneus/PCC, and S1/SPL while the combination of meditation and breathing exercises contributed the most to V1 volume. Yoga's potential neuroprotective effects may provide a neural basis for some of its beneficial effects.	[Villemure, Chantal; Ceko, Marta; Cotton, Valerie A.; Bushnell, M.

Spindles in Svarog: framework and software for parametrization of EEG transients	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep spindles; matching pursuit; EEG transients; time-frequency; sleep; Svarog; open source; free software	TIME-FREQUENCY DICTIONARIES; MATCHING PURSUIT; HIGH-RESOLUTION; SLEEP	We present a complete framework for time-frequency parametrization of EEG transients, based upon matching pursuit (MP) decomposition, applied to the detection of sleep spindles. Ranges of spindles duration (>0.5 s) and frequency (11-16 Hz) are taken directly from their standard definitions. Minimal amplitude is computed from the distribution of the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the signal within the frequency band of sleep spindles. Detection algorithm depends on the choice of just one free parameter, which is a percentile of this distribution. Performance of detection is assessed on the first cohort/second subset of the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS-C1/552). Cross-validation performed on the 19 available overnight recordings returned the optimal percentile of the RMS distribution close to 97 in most cases, and the following overall performance measures: sensitivity 0.63 +/- 0.06, positive predictive value 0.47 +/- 0.08, and Matthews coefficient of correlation 0.51 +/- 0.04. These concordances are similar to the results achieved on this database by other automatic methods. Proposed detailed parametrization of sleep spindles within a universal framework, encompassing also other EEG transients, opens new possibilities of high resolution investigation of their relations and detailed characteristics. MP decomposition, selection of relevant structures, and simple creation of EEG profiles used previously for assessment of brain activity of patients in disorders of consciousness are implemented in a freely available software package Svarog (Signal Viewer, Analyzer and Recorder On GPL) with user-friendly, mouse-driven interface for review and analysis of EEG.

We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes-which is most clearly seen in blood-though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes.

Channel activity in this case was found to decrease in presence of ATP 100 mu M on the cytoplasmic side and was totally inhibited at ATP concentrations greater than 0.25 mM. Although such features would be compatible with the presence of a K-ATP channel in the RER, recent data obtained from a brain mitochondrial inner membrane preparation have provided evidence for a Maxi-K channel which could also be blocked by ATP within the mM concentration range. A series of channel incorporation experiments was thus undertaken to determine if the ATP-sensitive channel originally observed in the RER corresponds to K-ATP channel. Our results indicate that the gating and permeation properties of this channel are unaffected by the addition of 800 nM charybdotoxin and 1 mu M iberiotoxin, but appeared sensitive to 10 mM TEA and 2.5 mM ATP. Furthermore, adding 100 mu M glibenclamide at positive potentials and 400 mu M tolbutamide at negative or positive voltages caused a strong inhibition of channel activity. Finally Western blot analyses provided evidence for Kir6.2, SUR1 and/or SUR2B, and SUR2A expression in our RER fractions. It was concluded on the basis of these observations that the channel previously characterized in RER membranes corresponds to K-ATP, suggesting that opening of this channel may enhance Ca2+ releases, alter the dynamics of the Ca2+ transient and prevent accumulation of Ca2+ in the ER during Ca2+ overload.

We report that a narrow spectrum of amino-acid substitutions within the transactivation domain of the v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF), a leucine zipper-containing transcription factor of the AP1 superfamily, profoundly affect development. Seven different de novo missense mutations involving conserved residues of the four GSK3 phosphorylation motifs were identified in eight unrelated individuals. The distinctive clinical phenotype, for which we propose the eponym Ayme-Gripp syndrome, is not limited to lens and eye defects as previously reported for MAF/Maf loss of function but includes sensorineural deafness, intellectual disability, seizures, brachycephaly, distinctive flat facial appearance, skeletal anomalies, mammary gland hypoplasia, and reduced growth. Disease-causing mutations were demonstrated to impair proper MAF phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, perturbed gene expression in primary skin fibroblasts, and induced neurodevelopmental defects in an in vivo model. Our findings nosologically and clinically delineate a previously poorly understood recognizable multisystem disorder, provide evidence for MAF governing a wider range of developmental programs than previously appreciated, and describe a novel instance of protein dosage effect severely perturbing development.

Animal studies testing the fetal programming hypothesis find that maternal glucocorticoids pass through the placenta and alter fetal brain development, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, there are no prospective studies of pregnant women exposed to a sudden-onset independent stressor that elucidate the biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for the wide variety of consequences of prenatal stress seen in human offspring. The aim of the QF2011 Queensland Flood Study is to fill this gap, and to test the buffering effects of Midwifery Group Practice, a form of continuity of maternity care. Methods/design: In January 2011 Queensland, Australia had its worst flooding in 30 years. Simultaneously, researchers in Brisbane were collecting psychosocial data on pregnant women for a randomized control trial (the M@NGO Trial) comparing Midwifery Group Practice to standard care. We invited these and other pregnant women to participate in a prospective, longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal maternal stress from the floods on maternal, perinatal and early childhood outcomes. Data collection included assessment of objective hardship and subjective distress from the floods at recruitment and again 12 months post-flood. Biological samples included maternal bloods at 36 weeks pregnancy, umbilical cord, cord blood, and placental tissues at birth. Questionnaires assessing maternal and child outcomes were sent to women at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. The protocol includes assessments at 16 months, 21/2 and 4 years. Outcomes include maternal psychopathology, and the child's cognitive, behavioral, motor and physical development. Additional biological samples include maternal and child DNA, as well as child testosterone, diurnal and reactive cortisol. Discussion: This prenatal stress study is the first of its kind, and will fill important gaps in the literature. Analyses will determine the extent to which flood exposure influences the maternal biological stress response which may then affect the maternal-placental-fetal axis at the biological, biochemical, and molecular levels, altering fetal development and influencing outcomes in the offspring. The role of Midwifery Group Practice in moderating effects of maternal stress will be tested.

In the brain, A beta 42 and A beta 40 are toxic and the most important proteolytic fragments generated through sequential processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Impeding the generation of A beta 42 and A beta 40 is thus considered as a promising strategy to prevent Alzheimer's disease. We therefore wanted to determine key parameters of the APP transmembrane sequence enabling production of these A beta species. Here we show that the hydrophilicity of amino acid residues G33, T43, and T48 critically determines the generation of A beta 42 and A beta 40 peptides (amino acid numbering according to A beta nomenclature starting with aspartic acid 1). First, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of glycine residue G33 positioned within the N-terminal half of the APP transmembrane sequence by exchanging it against the 19 other amino acids. We found that hydrophilicity of the residue at position 33 positively correlated with A beta 42 and A beta 40 generation. Second, we analyzed two threonine residues at positions T43 and T48 in the C-terminal half of the APP-transmembrane sequence. Replacement of single threonine residues by hydrophobic valines inversely affected A beta 42 and A beta 40 generation. We observed that threonine mutants affected the initial gamma-secretase cut, which is associated with levels of A beta 42 or A beta 40.

Hyperacusis following unilateral damage to the insular cortex: A three-case report	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory processing; Event-related potentials; Hyperacusis; Insula; Saliency; Stroke	PERIPHERAL AUDITORY ACTIVITY; PROCESSING DEFICITS; PERCEPTION; MODULATION; COMPONENT; AGNOSIA; HUMANS; P300; REORGANIZATION; ORGANIZATION	The insula is a multisensory area involved in various brain functions, including central auditory processing. However, its specific role in auditory function remains unclear. Here we report three cases of persistent hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli following damage to the insular cortex, using behavioral and neurophysiological measures. Two patients who complained of auditory disturbance since they suffered an isolated unilateral insular stroke, and one epileptic patient who underwent right insular resection for control of drug-resistant seizures, were involved in this study. These patients, all young adult women, were tested for auditory function more than one year after brain injury, and were compared to 10 healthy control participants matched for age, sex,and education. The assessment included pure-tone detection and speech detection in quiet, loudness discomfort levels, random gap detection, recognition of frequency and duration patterns, binaural separation, dichotic listening, as well as late-latency auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Each patient showed mild or moderate hyperacusis, as revealed by decreased loudness discomfort levels, which was more important on the side of lesion in two cases. Tests of temporal processing also revealed impairments, in concordance with previous findings. ERPs of two patients were characterised by increased amplitude of the P3b component elicited during a two-tone auditory oddball detection task. This study is the first to report cases of persistent hyperacusis following damage to the insular cortex, and suggests that the insula is involved in modulating the perceived intensity of the incoming auditory stimuli during late-stage processing.

In the present pilot study, we aimed to identify factors associated with high versus low levels of OT in pregnant women with high levels of CPA. We hypothesized that insecurely attached women, and those who recently experienced stressful life events (SLE), would have lower levels of prenatal OT. Methods: Thirty pregnant women with mood and anxiety disorders and high levels of CPA were recruited from the perinatal mental health service of a general hospital. Participants completed self-report measures of psychosocial stress and adult attachment style, and blood was then drawn to assess OT. Results and conclusions: Lower OT levels were found among those who were insecurely attached, and among those who experienced SLE within the last year. In a multiple linear regression, both attachment security and SLE significantly contributed to a model of prenatal OT levels. These individual difference factors explained 38% of the variance in prenatal OT, which may in turn predict poorer maternal mental health and caregiving outcomes during the postpartum period.

Developmental Predictors of Inattention-Hyperactivity from Pregnancy to Early Childhood	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; DEPRESSION SCALE; FAMILY INCOME; AGE; DISORDER; CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; POPULATION; VALIDITY	Objective The objective of the study was to characterize the developmental sequence of pre-and postnatal risk factors for inattention-hyperactivity symptoms in preschoolers. Materials and Methods Longitudinal data came from a French population based birth cohort study (EDEN; N = 1311 mother-child pairs followed from the pregnancy onwards). Inattention-hyperactivity symptoms were assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire when participating children were 3 years of age. Potential risk factors were classified in four domains (fetal exposures and child somatic characteristics, child temperament, child neurodevelopmental status, psychosocial environment) and four periods (before pregnancy, prenatal/birth, infancy, toddlerhood). Their role as potential moderator or mediator was tested with path analysis to determine the developmental sequence. Results A low family socioeconomic status before pregnancy was the main environmental risk factor for inattention-hyperactivity symptoms at 3 years, and its effect occurred via two pathways. The first was a risk pathway, where lower SES was associated with higher maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy; then to higher maternal and child distress and dysregulation in infancy; and in turn to higher levels of inattention-hyperactivity at 3 years. The second was a protective pathway, where higher SES was associated with longer duration of breastfeeding during infancy; then to better child neurodevelopmental status in toddlerhood; and in turn to lower levels of inattention-hyperactivity at 3 years. Discussion This study identified psychosocial factors at several developmental periods that represent potential targets for preventing the emergence of inattention-hyperactivity symptoms in early childhood.

Several facets of a woman's sexuality are negatively affected by after spinal cord injury, and consequently, sexual satisfaction has been shown to decrease, which also negatively affects quality of life. Neurogenic bladder is common after spinal cord injury, and the resulting urinary incontinence is a top therapeutic priority of this population. To improve sexual satisfaction and quality of life for women with spinal cord injury, future research needs to explore the effects of urinary incontinence on various aspects of sexuality.

This article presents one-year findings from a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Housing First with treatment as usual. Methods: The study was a nonblind, parallel-group RCT conducted in five Canadian cities. A sample of 950 high-need participants with severe mental illness, who were either absolutely homeless or precariously housed, was randomly assigned to Housing First (N=469) or treatment as usual (N=481). Housing First participants received a rent supplement, assistance to find housing, and assertive community treatment. Treatment-as-usual participants had access to all other existing programs. Results: At one-year follow-up, 73% of Housing First participants and 31% of treatment-as-usual participants resided in stable housing (p<.001, odds ratio=6.35, covariate adjusted difference=42%, 95% confidence interval [CI]=36% 248%). Improvement in overall quality of life was significantly greater among Housing First participants compared with treatment-as-usual participants (p<.001, d=.31, CI=.16-.46). Housing First participants also showed greater improvements in community functioning compared with treatment-as-usual participants (p=.003, d=.25, CI=.09-.41). Conclusions: Compared with treatment as usual, Housing First produced greater improvements in housing stability, quality of life, and community functioning after one year of enrollment. The study provides support for adopting Housing First as an approach for ending chronic homelessness among persons with severe mental illness, even if they are actively symptomatic or using substances.

Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Cannabidiol When Administered Concomitantly With Intravenous Fentanyl in Humans	JOURNAL OF ADDICTION MEDICINE			English	Article						cannabidiol; cannabis; opioid dependence; pharmacokinetics	CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; OPIOID RECEPTORS; NEURAL BASIS; NUCLEUS; PLASMA; CB1; DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INHIBITION; HYDROLYSIS	Objectives: Cannabidiol (CBD) is hypothesized as a potential treatment for opioid addiction, with safety studies an important first step for medication development. We determined CBD safety and pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly with a high-potency opioid in healthy subjects. Methods: This double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of CBD, coadministered with intravenous fentanyl, was conducted at the Clinical Research Center in Mount Sinai Hospital, a tertiary care medical center in New York City. Participants were healthy volunteers aged 21 to 65 years with prior opioid exposure, regardless of the route. Blood samples were obtained before and after 400 or 800 mg of CBD pretreatment, followed by a single 0.5 (session 1) or 1.0 mu g/kg (session 2) of intravenous fentanyl dose. The primary outcome was the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE) to assess safety and adverse effects. CBD peak plasma concentrations, time to reach peak plasma concentrations (t(max)), and area under the curve (AUC) were measured. Results: SAFTEE data were similar between groups without respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications during any test session. After low-dose CBD, t(max) occurred at 3 and 1.5 hours in sessions 1 and 2, respectively. After high-dose CBD, tmax occurred at 3 and 4 hours in sessions 1 and 2, respectively. There were no significant differences in plasma CBD or cortisol (AUC P = NS) between sessions. Conclusions: Cannabidiol does not exacerbate adverse effects associated with intravenous fentanyl administration. Coadministration of CBD and opioids was safe and well tolerated. These data provide the foundation for future studies examining CBD as a potential treatment for opioid abuse.

Pregabalin might reduce the incidence of chronic postoperative pain. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of perioperative pregabalin on the occurrence of PTPS, defined as any surgical site pain 3 months after surgery. Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients undergoing elective thoracotomy. Patients received either pregabalin 150 mg orally twice a day initiated 1 hour before thoracotomy and continued until 4 days after thoracotomy (10 doses total) or a placebo using the same protocol. All patients received preincision thoracic epidural analgesia. Postthoracotomy pain syndrome was evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire through a telephone interview. Secondary outcomes included evaluation of neuropathic characteristics through the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs questionnaire, analgesic use 3 months after surgery, and evaluation of acute postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Results: One hundred fourteen patients were randomized, and 99 patients completed the study (placebo, n = 49; pregabalin, n = 50). Postthoracotomy pain syndrome occurred in 49 (49.5%) of 99 patients and more frequently in the pregabalin group (31/50 [62%] vs 18/49 [37%] in the placebo group, P = 0.01). However, among patients with PTPS, those in the pregabalin group required significantly less analgesics, reported less moderate to severe average pain, and presented significantly less neuropathic characteristics than patients in the placebo group 3 months after surgery.

Canadian Expert Panel Recommendations for MRI Use in MS Diagnosis and Monitoring	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; multiple sclerosis; multiple sclerosis MRI; neuroimaging	SUBCUTANEOUS INTERFERON BETA-1A; CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES; 2010 MCDONALD CRITERIA; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CONSENSUS GUIDELINES; CONVERSION; DEFINITE; PROTOCOL; THERAPY; LESIONS	Background: A definitive diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), as distinct from a clinically isolated syndrome, requires one of two conditions: a second clinical attack or particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings as defined by the McDonald criteria. MRI is also important after a diagnosis is made as a means of monitoring subclinical disease activity. While a standardized protocol for diagnostic and follow-up MRI has been developed by the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centres, acceptance and implementation in Canada have been suboptimal. Methods: To improve diagnosis, monitoring, and management of a clinically isolated syndrome and MS, a Canadian expert panel created consensus recommendations about the appropriate application of the 2010 McDonald criteria in routine practice, strategies to improve adherence to the standardized Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centres MRI protocol, and methods for ensuring effective communication among health care practitioners, in particular referring physicians, neurologists, and radiologists. Results: This article presents eight consensus statements developed by the expert panel, along with the rationale underlying the recommendations and commentaries on how to prioritize resource use within the Canadian healthcare system. Conclusions: The expert panel calls on neurologists and radiologists in Canada to incorporate the McDonald criteria, the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centres MRI protocol, and other guidance given in this consensus presentation into their practices. By improving communication and general awareness of best practices for MRI use in MS diagnosis and monitoring, we can improve patient care across Canada by providing timely diagnosis, informed management decisions, and better continuity of care.

Therefore, it is important to study oxidative stress not only in cell systems but also using whole organisms. C. elegans is an attractive model organism to study the genetics of oxidative stress signal transduction pathways, which are highly evolutionarily conserved. Here, we provide a protocol to measure oxidative stress resistance in C. elegans in liquid. Briefly, ROS-inducing reagents such as paraquat (PQ) and H2O2 are dissolved in M9 buffer, and solutions are aliquoted in the wells of a 96 well microtiter plate. Synchronized L4/young adult C. elegans animals are transferred to the wells (5-8 animals/well) and survival is measured every hour until most worms are dead. When performing an oxidative stress resistance assay using a low concentration of stressors in plates, aging might influence the behavior of animals upon oxidative stress, which could lead to an incorrect interpretation of the data. However, in the assay described herein, this problem is unlikely to occur since only L4/young adult animals are being used. Moreover, this protocol is inexpensive and results are obtained in one day, which renders this technique attractive for genetic screens. Overall, this will help to understand oxidative stress signal transduction pathways, which could be translated into better characterization of oxidative stress-associated human disorders.

The success of personalized medicine hinges on the answer to this question. In this paper, I argue that judgment about the quality of biomarker experiments is mediated by the problem of theoretical underdetermination. That is, the network of biological and pathophysilogical theories motivating a biomarker experiment is sufficiently complicated that it often frustrates valid interpretation of the experimental results. Drawing on a case-study in biomarker diagnostic development from neurooncology, I argue that this problem of underdetermination can be overcome with greater coordination across the biomarker research trajectory. I then sketch an account for how coordination across a research trajectory can be evaluated. I ultimate conclude that what makes a high-quality biomarker experiment must be judged by the epistemic contribution it makes to this coordinated research effort.

The low-frequency, spatially averaged electric fields from many thousands of neurons have been shown to promote synchrony. It remains unclear whether highly transient, spatially localized electric fields from single action potentials (ephaptic coupling) significantly affect spike timing of neighboring cells and in consequence, population synchrony. In this study, we simulated the extracellular potentials and the resulting coupling between neurons in the NEURON environment and generalized their connection rules to create an oscillator network model of a sheet of ephaptically coupled neurons. With the use of both models, we explained several aspects of epileptiform behavior not previously modeled by synaptically coupled networks. Importantly, reduction of neuron spacing induced synchronization via single-spike ephaptic coupling, agreeing with seizure suppression seen clinically and in vitro via extracellular volume adjustment. Further reduction of neuron spacing yielded locally synchronized clusters, providing a mechanism for recent in vitro observations of localized neuronal synchrony in the absence of synaptic and gap-junction coupling.

Based on the mathematical expression of IFOG output, three temperature relevant terms are extracted, which include: (1) temperature of fiber loops; (2) temperature variation of fiber loops; (3) temperature product term of fiber loops. Then, the input-modified RBF ANN-based temperature compensation scheme is established, in which temperature relevant terms are transferred to train the RBF ANN. Experimental temperature tests are conducted and sufficient data are collected and post-processed to form the novel RBF ANN. Finally, we apply the modified RBF ANN based on temperature compensation model in two IFOGs with temperature compensation capabilities. The experimental results show the proposed temperature compensation model could efficiently reduce the influence of environment temperature on the output of IFOG, and exhibit a better temperature compensation performance than conventional scheme without proposed improvements.

A physical examination was unremarkable except for miosis and atypical limb movements. The patient underwent an extensive workup, including the search for metabolic, infectious, neurologic, and toxicologic etiologies. An abdominal ultrasound was performed because the child continued to remain neurologically impaired with no cause identified on other investigations. The ultrasound revealed a persistent uncomplicated ileoileal intussusception. The patient was taken to the operating room for surgical reduction. The child recovered fully postoperatively. This case illustrates the rare presentation of intussusception encephalopathy, which can be a diagnostic dilemma, especially when none of the symptoms of intussusception are present.

Deep Brain Stimulation Influences Brain Structure in Alzheimer's Disease	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Deep brain stimulation; Alzheimer's disease; Fornix; Hippocampus; MRI; Volume	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; DEFORMATION-BASED MORPHOMETRY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; OLDER-ADULTS; SEGMENTATION; NEUROGENESIS; RELIABILITY; DEPRESSION; MEMORY; MRI	Background: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is thought to improve the symptoms of selected neurological disorders by modulating activity within dysfunctional brain circuits. To date, there is no evidence that DBS counteracts progressive neurodegeneration in any particular disorder. Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that DBS applied to the fornix in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) could have an effect on brain structure. Methods: In six AD patients receiving fornix DBS, we used structural MRI to assess one-year change in hippocampal, fornix, and mammillary body volume. We also used deformation-based morphometry to identify whole-brain structural changes. We correlated volumetric changes to hippocampal glucose metabolism. We also compared volumetric changes to those in an age-, sex-, and severity-matched group of AD patients (n = 25) not receiving DBS. Results: We observed bilateral hippocampal volume increases in the two patients with the best clinical response to fornix DBS. In one patient, hippocampal volume was preserved three years after diagnosis. Overall, mean hippocampal atrophy was significantly slower in the DBS group compared to the matched AD group, and no matched AD patients demonstrated bilateral hippocampal enlargement. Across DBS patients, hippocampal volume change correlated strongly with hippocampal metabolism and with volume change in the fornix and mammillary bodies, suggesting a circuit-wide effect of stimulation. Deformation-based morphometry in DBS patients revealed local volume expansions in several regions typically atrophied in AD. Conclusion: We present the first in-human evidence that, in addition to modulating neural circuit activity, DBS may influence the natural course of brain atrophy in a neurodegenerative disease.

Predictors of postherpetic neuralgia in patients with herpes zoster: a pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies from North and Latin America and Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Herpes zoster; Postherpetic neuralgia; Predictors; North America; Latin America; Asia	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HEALTH-CARE UTILIZATION; RISK-FACTORS; RASH SEVERITY; PAIN; BURDEN; PERSISTENCE; ILLNESS; VACCINE; IMPACT	Objectives: The most common complication of herpes zoster (HZ) is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a persistent pain that can substantially affect quality of life (QoL). This analysis aimed to evaluate predictors of PHN in HZ patients. Methods: A pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies of HZ patients aged >= 50 years from North America (Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina), and Asia (Taiwan, South Korea, and Thailand) was performed. Patients within 14 days of rash onset were included. The incidence of PHN was defined as a worst pain score of >= 3, persisting/appearing at >90 days after rash onset. Socio-demographics, HZ disease characteristics, treatment, pain-related interference with activities of daily living, and health-related QoL were assessed. Results: Of 702 patients with HZ, 148 (21.1%) developed PHN. Similar risks of PHN were observed across geographic regions. On multivariate analysis, older age, greater severity of pain at rash onset, employment status, walking problems at enrollment, and pain interference affecting social relationships were significantly associated with the development of PHN. Conclusions: In addition to older age and severe acute pain, this study suggests that impaired physical and social functioning from acute zoster pain may play a role in the development of PHN in this prospective cohort study of HZ patients from North and Latin America and Asia.

Autism spectrum traits are related to cortical thickness differences in both autism and typical development	RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism; Autism spectrum quotient; Brain structure; MRI; Cortical thickness	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; MRI DATA; BRAIN; DISORDERS; VOLUME; POPULATION; COGNITION; NETWORK	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in communication and social interaction, as well as repetitive behaviors and interests. However, these traits are highly variable across individuals with ASD and are also present in the typically developing population. Brain structural correlates of ASD are also heterogeneous. Recent findings have indicated that ASD traits as measured by the autism quotient (AQ) are reflected in white matter structural differences in a continuous way across both typically-developed and ASD individuals. Here, we tested for the first time, how ASD traits are related to gray matter structural differences (and particularly cortical thickness) in both ASD and typically developing adults. The present results show that ASD traits are primarily correlated with reductions in cortical thickness in a continuous fashion across ASD and typically developing adults in social brain areas and the default mode network including the orbitofrontal cortex, postcentral gyrus, and lingual gyrus. These findings provide new evidence that ASD traits are primarily reflected in neural structure that exists along a continuum extending into the typically developing population.

Sleep spindle alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; sleep spindle morphology; EEG; neurodegeneration; biomarker	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BEHAVIOR DISORDER; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS; DELAYED EMERGENCE; NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; L-DOPA; EEG; DEMENTIA; MEMORY	The aim of this study was to identify changes of sleep spindles (SS) in the EEG of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Five sleep experts manually identified SS at a central scalp location (C3-A2) in 15 PD and 15 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Each SS was given a confidence score, and by using a group consensus rule, 901 SS were identified and characterized by their (1) duration, (2) oscillation frequency, (3) maximum peak-to-peak amplitude, (4) percent-to-peak amplitude, and (5) density. Between-group comparisons were made for all SS characteristics computed, and significant changes for PD patients vs. control subjects were found for duration, oscillation frequency, maximum peak-to-peak amplitude and density. Specifically, SS density was lower, duration was longer, oscillation frequency slower and maximum peak-to-peak amplitude higher in patients vs. controls. We also computed inter-expert reliability in SS scoring and found a significantly lower reliability in scoring definite SS in patients when compared to controls. How neurodegeneration in PD could influence SS characteristics is discussed. We also note that the SS morphological changes observed here may affect automatic detection of SS in patients with PD or other neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs).	[Christensen, Julie A.

Visually-guided correction of hand reaching movements: The neurophysiological bases in the cerebral cortex	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Visual control of reaching; Hand trajectory formation and correction; Parietal cortex; Motor cortex; Premotor cortex; Behavioral neurophysiology	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; OPTIMAL FEEDBACK-CONTROL; DORSAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; ONLINE CONTROL; ARM MOVEMENTS; OPTIC ATAXIA; TARGET LOCATION; TRAJECTORY MODIFICATIONS	The ability of human and non-human primates to make fast corrections to hand movement trajectories after a sudden shift in the target's location is a key feature of visuo-motor behavior. In healthy individuals, hand movements smoothly adapt to a change in target location without needing to complete the movement to the first target location, as typical of parietal patients. This finding indicates that the nervous system continuously monitors the visual scene and is able to integrate new information in order to produce an efficient motor response. In this paper, we review the kinematics, reaction times and muscle activity observed during the online correction of hand movements as well as the underlying neurophysiological processes studied through single-cell neural recordings in monkeys. Brain stimulation, lesion and imaging studies in humans are also discussed. We demonstrate that while online correction mechanisms strongly depend on the activity of a parieto-frontal network of which the posterior parietal cortex is a crucial node, these mechanisms proceed smoothly and are similar to what is observed during simple point-to-point movements. Online correction of hand movements would rely on feedforward and feedback mechanisms in the parietal cortex, as part of the activity within the fronto-parietal network for the planning and execution of visuo-motor tasks.

One theoretical approach to study such systems is to develop realistic models for the tissue. This involves first developing detailed ionic "Hodgkin-Huxley"-type models of individual cells and then connecting the individual cells via synaptic and gap junctions in realistic geometries. An alternative approach is to characterize tissue in terms of functional properties such as phase resetting curves and restitution curves. Using simple models based on one-dimensional difference equations, the measured functional curves can be used to predict, analyze, and interpret nonlinear dynamical phenomena. This approach offers the prospects of providing simplified descriptions that offer insight into the experimental and clinical cardiac dynamics.

Most of the attention in last few decades have focused on changes in gene sequence as a cause of gene dysfunction leading to disease and mental health disorders. Germ line mutations or other alterations in the sequence of DNA that associate with different behavioral and neurological pathologies have been identified. However, sequence alterations explain only a small fraction of the cases. In addition there is evidence for "gene-environment" interactions in the brain suggesting mechanisms that alter gene function and the phenotype through environmental exposure. Genes are programmed by "epigenetic" mechanisms such as chromatin structure, chromatin modification and DNA methylation. These mechanisms confer on similar sequences different identities during cellular differentiation. Epigenetic differences are proposed to be involved in differentiating gene function in response to different environmental contexts and could result in alterations in functional gene networks that lead to brain disease. Epigenetic markers could serve important biomarkers in brain and behavioral diseases. Moreover, epigenetic processes are potentially reversible pointing to epigenetic therapeutics in psychotherapy.

The role that apoD may play in regulating AD pathology has not been addressed. Here, we crossed both apoD-null mice and Thy-1 human apoD transgenic mice with APP-PS1 amyloidogenic AD mice. Loss of apoD resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in hippocampal amyloid plaque load, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Conversely, transgenic expression of neuronal apoD reduced hippocampal plaque load by approximately 35%. This latter finding was associated with a 60% decrease in amyloid beta 1-40 peptide levels, and a 34% decrease in insoluble amyloid beta 1-42 peptide. Assessment of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) levels and proteolytic products of amyloid precursor protein and neuregulin-1 point toward a possible association of altered BACE1 activity in association with altered apoD levels. In conclusion, the current studies provide clear evidence that apoD regulates amyloid plaque pathology in a mouse model of AD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Social information processing following resection of the insular cortex	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Emotion recognition; Empathy; Epilepsy; Insula; Neuropsychology; Neurosurgery	FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; VOXEL-BASED LESION; EMOTION RECOGNITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; COGNITIVE EMPATHY; BRAIN-INJURY; IMPAIRED RECOGNITION; TEMPORAL LOBECTOMY; ANTERIOR INSULA; NEURAL SYSTEMS	The insula has been implicated in social cognition and empathy in several neuroimaging paradigms. Impairments in social information processing, including specific deficits in disgust recognition, have been described following isolated insular damage, although the evidence remains limited to a few case studies. The present study examines social cognition and empathy in a group of fifteen patients for whom the insula was removed as part of their epilepsy surgery. These patients were compared to a lesion-control group of 15 epileptic patients who had a surgery in the anterior temporal lobe that spared the insula, and to 20 healthy volunteers matched on age, sex, and education. Participants were assessed on an Emotion Recognition Task (ERT), the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, and a self-administered empathy questionnaire. Patients who underwent insular resection showed poorer ability to recognize facial expressions of emotions and had lower scores of perspective taking on the empathy questionnaire than healthy controls. Using results from healthy controls as normative data, emotion recognition deficits were more frequent in insular patients than in both other groups. Specific emotion analyses revealed impairments in fear recognition in both groups of patients, whereas happiness and surprise recognition was only impaired in patients with insular resection. There was no evidence for a deficit in disgust recognition. The findings suggest that unilateral damage to the operculo-insular region may be associated with subtle impairments in emotion recognition, and provide further clinical evidence of a role of the insula in empathic processes. However, the description of 15 consecutive cases of insula-damaged patients with no specific deficit in disgust recognition seriously challenges the assumptions, based on previous case reports, that the insula is specifically involved in disgust processing.

Sampling frequency of fetal heart rate impacts the ability to predict pH and BE at birth: a retrospective multi-cohort study	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						fetus; sampling rate; prediction; fetal heart rate; monitoring; labour	VARIABILITY ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS	Fetal heart rate (FHR) sampling rate used on the bedside is equal or less than 4 Hz. Current FHR analysis methods fail to detect incipient fetal acidemia. In a fetal sheep model of human labour we showed that FHR sampling rates near 1000 Hz are needed to detect fetal acidemia. Trans-abdominal fetal ECG (t-a fECG) sampling FHR at 900 Hz combined with a complex signals bioinformatics approach showed promise in a human cohort. Here we validate this finding in a retrospective human cohort study by comparing the performance of the same bioinformatics approach to predict pH and BE at birth in the cohorts with FHR sampled either at 4 Hz or at 900 Hz. The 4 Hz FHR recording data sets consisted of the open access intrapartum CTG data base with n = 552 subjects used to develop the predictive model and another cohort of prospectively recruited n = 11 labouring women to then validate it. 900 Hz FHR data set comprised two prospectively recruited t-a fECG cohorts of n = 60 and n = 23 subjects. Recruitment criteria were similar across the cohorts. We have determined the goodness of fit (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) as the performance indicators of the model on each cohort. The clinical characteristics of all cohorts were similar (gestational age 280 +/- 8 d; gender 50% male; birth body weight 3.5 +/- 0.5 kg; pH and BE at birth 7.25 +/- 0.1 and -5.7 +/- 3.4 mmol L-1, respectively; 1' and 5' Apgar scores at birth 8.5 +/- 1.4 and 9.4 +/- 0.6, respectively). The 4 Hz FHR cohort rendered-for pH and BE-R-2 = 0.26 and 0.2 and RMSE = 0.087 and 3.44, respectively. This could not be confirmed in the validation cohort for neither pH nor BE prediction. The 900 Hz FHR cohort rendered-for pH and BE-R-2 = 0.9 and 0.77 and RMSE = 0.03 and 1.70, respectively, and the pH prediction was validated. In our model, lower FHR sampling rate increased the predicted error range similar to 3-4 fold. We show that increasing FHR sampling rate to 900 Hz improves prediction of fetal pH and BE at birth. This should improve early identification of babies at risk of brain injury.

Dual-Lumen Balloon Catheters May Improve Liquid Embolization of Vascular Malformations: An Experimental Study in Swine	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN ARTERIOVENOUS-MALFORMATIONS; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; INITIAL-EXPERIENCE; ONYX EMBOLIZATION; TECHNICAL NOTE; EMBOLIC AGENT; MODEL; FISTULAS; CONSTRUCTION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Liquid embolic agents are increasingly used to treat vascular malformations. We sought to assess embolization with these agents by using a dual-lumen balloon catheter in an experimental setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen injections of liquid embolic agents were performed in the rete mirabile of swine. We used 3 methods to control liquid embolic agent reflux:1) dual-lumen balloon-catheter (group A, n = 8); 2) injection of liquid embolic agent after proximal n-BCA plug formation through a second microcatheter (group B, n = 4); and 3) standard liquid embolic agent injection (group C, controls, n = 6). The following outcomes were graded by using ordinal scales by angiography, macrophotography, and radiography of retia after euthanasia: 1) angiographic and pathologic extent of liquid embolic agent embolization of the rete, 2) reflux of liquid embolic agents in the parent artery, and 3) density of liquid embolic agents in the proximal rete. Technical complications were also recorded. A successful injection was defined as an embolization that reached the contralateral rete without reflux into proximal external branches. Exact logistic regression analyses were performed to compare groups. RESULTS: There were significant differences among groups for reflux (P = .029) and liquid embolic agent density in the proximal rete = .014), while extension to the contralateral rete did not reach statistical significance (P = .07). Injections differed among groups (P = .004), with dual-lumen balloon-catheter injections more frequently successful compared with control injections (P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Dual-lumen balloon catheters allowed better liquid embolic agent injections than standard injections.	[Gentric, J.

Patients and methods Asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia were prospectively enrolled in this study if they had at least one MRI performed during hypothermia treatment and then another MRI performed around day 10 of life. Results A total of 129 MRI scans were obtained from 43 asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia. Sixty per cent developed brain injury; all the brain injuries observed on the late scans were already present on day 2-3 of life during hypothermia, and the extent of injury was similar between the early and late scans. The brain MRI on day 2-3 of life had a sensitivity of 100% (95% Cl 84% to 100%) and a specificity of 100% (95% Cl 77% to 100%) to identify the presence and extent of later brain injury. Conclusions The brain MRIs performed during hypothermia already permit an accurate definition of the presence and extent of brain injury that later develop in asphyxiated newborns despite treatment. These results may have research and clinical implications for the care of these newborns.

J	Li, N; Sawan, M				Li, Nan; Sawan, Mohamad			Neural signal compression using a minimum Euclidean or Manhattan distance cluster-based deterministic compressed sensing matrix	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article							POWER INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT; RECOVERY; SYSTEM; ALGORITHMS; DESIGN; CODES	Multichannel wireless neural signal recording systems are a prominent topic in biomedical research, but because of several limitations, such as power consumption, the device size, and enormous quantities of data, it is necessary to compress the recorded data. Compressed sensing theory can be employed to compress neural signals. However, a neural signal is usually not sparse in the time domain and contains a large number of similar non-zero points. In this article, we propose a new method for compressing not only a sparse signal but also a non-sparse signal that has identical points. First, several concepts about the identical items of the signal are introduced; thus, a method for constructing the Minimum Euclidean or Manhattan Distance Cluster-based (MDC) deterministic compressed sensing matrix is given. Moreover, the Restricted Isometry Property of the MDC matrix is supported. Third, three groups of real neural signals are used for validation. Six different random or deterministic sensing matrices under diverse reconstruction algorithms are used for the simulation. From the simulation results, it can be demonstrated that the MDC matrix can largely compress neural signals and also have a small reconstruction error. For a six-thousand-point signal, the compression rate can be up to 98%, whereas the reconstruction error is less than 0.1. In addition, from the simulation results, the MDC matrix is optimal for a signal that has an extended length. Finally, the MDC matrix can be constructed by zeros and ones; additionally, it has a simple construction structure that is highly practicable for the design of an implantable neural recording device.

MMN alterations have been shown in children with language and/or developmental disorders. In benign focal epilepsies, neuropsychological disorders are often reported and linked to interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. There are few studies reporting MMN in children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) and sleep IEDs. Moreover, no MMN recording has yet been reported in atypical BECTS children with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (CSWS). We retrospectively compared MMN in typical and atypical BECTS children, particularly addressing the impact of NREM sleep IEDs on auditory discrimination. Moreover, we attempted a neuropsychological characterization of patients. MethodsThe MMN was recorded in 9 normal controls and 23 patients (14 typical BECTS and 9 atypical BECTS) in an oddball paradigm with syllable stimuli. MMN, sleep electroencephalography (EEG) and neuropsychological evaluation were realized in the same testing session. ResultsMeasurable MMN responses to speech stimuli were identified in both the control and patient groups. A significant difference between control and atypical BECTS children was found with respect to amplitude (p=0.0061). Atypical BECTS also showed a lower MMN amplitude with respect to typical BECTS, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.0545). Statistical comparisons between groups revealed no differences in latency. Among the neuropsychological variables, academic difficulties were significantly more prominent in the patients with atypical BECTS (p=0.04). SignificanceCSWS EEG pattern affects auditory discrimination and may have a long-lasting impact on academic skills acquisition, whereas in typical BECTS children with a lower degree of IED NREM sleep, plastic brain reorganization or the preservation of participating networks may prevent such difficulty. Early electrophysiologic identification of auditory discrimination deficits in epileptic children could be used in early rehabilitation, thereby reducing the risk of developing neuropsychological disorders.

A Method for Compression of Intra-Cortically-Recorded Neural Signals Dedicated to Implantable Brain-Machine Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biomedical implants; data compression; neural recording; spike extraction; wavelet transform	WAVELET TRANSFORM; MICROSYSTEM; ELECTRODES; CIRCUIT; UNIT	This paper proposes an efficient data compression technique dedicated to implantable intra-cortical neural recording devices. The proposed technique benefits from processing neural signals in the Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform space, a new spike extraction approach, and a novel data framing scheme to telemeter the recorded neural information to the outside world. Based on the proposed technique, a 64-channel neural signal processor was designed and prototyped as a part of a wireless implantable extra-cellular neural recording microsystem. Designed in a 0.13-mu m standard CMOS process, the 64-channel neural signal processor reported in this paper occupies similar to 0.206 mm(2) of silicon area, and consumes 94.18 mu W when operating under a 1.2-V supply voltage at a master clock frequency of 1.28 MHz.

Multicopper ferroxidases (MCFs) play an important role in cellular iron metabolism. However, the role of MCFs in the CNS in health and disease remains poorly characterized. Objective: The aim was to study the role of hephaestin (HEPH) and ceruloplasmin (CP) in CNS iron metabolism and homeostasis. Methods: Iron concentrations and L-ferritin protein levels of selected brain regions were determined in global hephaestin knockout (Heph KO), global ceruloplasmin knockout (Cp KO), and wild-type (WT) male mice at 6-7 mo of age. Gene expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (Dmt1), ferroportin 1 (Fpn1), Heph, Cp, and transferrin receptor 1 (Tfrc) and HEPH protein level was quantitated in the same brain regions. Results: Iron and L-ferritin protein levels were significantly increased in Heph KO mouse brain cortex (iron: 30%, P< 0.05; L-ferritin: 200%, P< 0.05), hippocampus (iron: 80%, P< 0.05; L-ferritin: 300%, P< 0.05), brainstem (iron: 20%, P< 0.05; L-ferritin: 150%, P < 0.05), and cerebellum (iron: 20%, P < 0.05; L-ferritin: 100%, P< 0.05) regions than in WT and Cp KO mouse brain regions at 6 mo of age. Expression of the Heph gene was significantly increased in the Cp KO mouse cortex (100%; P< 0.01), hippocampus (350%; P< 0.001), brainstem (30%; P< 0.01), and cerebellum (150%; P< 0.001) than in WT controls, and Cp gene expression was significantly decreased in the Heph KO mouse hippocampus (20%; P< 0.05) than in WT control mice at 6 mo of age. Conclusions: Ablation of HEPH or CP results in disordered brain iron homeostasis in mice. Heph KO may provide a novel model for neurodegenerative disorders.

This paper aims to highlight the scope, power, and future promise of evo-devo to transform and unify diverse aspects of biology. We articulate key questions at the core of eleven biological disciplinesfrom Evolution, Development, Paleontology, and Neurobiology to Cellular and Molecular Biology, Quantitative Genetics, Human Diseases, Ecology, Agriculture and Science Education, and lastly, Evolutionary Developmental Biology itselfand discuss why evo-devo is uniquely situated to substantially improve our ability to find meaningful answers to these fundamental questions. We posit that the tools, concepts, and ways of thinking developed by evo-devo have profound potential to advance, integrate, and unify biological sciences as well as inform policy decisions and illuminate science education. We look to the next generation of evolutionary developmental biologists to help shape this process as we confront the scientific challenges of the 21st century.

Both of them are based on a unique combination of a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and artificial intelligence techniques, i.e. artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithms (GA). Since in an islanded microgrid, the frequency of the system is determined by the shaft speed of the diesel engine (DE), while the voltage amplitude is set by the synchronous generator (SG) field voltage, therefore, two FTC systems for frequency and voltage regulation have been implemented in each proposed control scheme. The first scheme consists of an MRAC system with a PID controller tuned by a GA for controlling the speed of the DE and a classic MRAC system for controlling the voltage amplitude of the SG. In the second scheme, an MRAC system with a GA-tuned PID controller is used for the DE, and a hybrid controller in which the MRAC is combined with an ANN and a PID controller tuned by a GA is designed for the SG. The dynamic models of the microgrid components are presented in detail, and the proposed microgrid and its FTC systems are implemented and tested in the Simpower Systems of MATLAB/Simulink (R) simulation environment. All results indicate high effectiveness and robustness of the MRAC-based FTC schemes in both normal and emergency/faulty operations of the microgrid in comparison with a benchmark baseline controller, IEEE Type 1 AVR for the SG and a PID controlled governor for the DE.

This preponderance among women is evident only after 12 years of age, implicating pubertal factors in the risk of MS. Objective: To investigate the influence of female puberty on central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity. Methods: We examined the relationship between age of menarche on MS outcomes in 116 female children (< 16 years old) whom presented with incident acquired demyelinating syndromes' (ADS) and were followed prospectively in the national Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study, from 2004-2013. Furthermore, we directly investigated the effects of puberty on susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in two groups of female mice that differed only in their pubertal status. Results: In the ADS children, a later age of menarche was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent MS diagnosis. This relationship persisted, after accounting for patient age at ADS presentation and the presence of 1 T2 lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64; and additional factors that associate with MS outcomes in ADS children, including low vitamin D levels. Furthermore, we found female mice that had transitioned through puberty were more susceptible to EAE than age-matched, pre-pubertal mice. Conclusion: Puberty in females enhances CNS autoimmune mechanisms that lead to MS in humans and EAE in mice.

Three patients (69, 64 and 94 years of age) with intractable and poorly controlled pain due to bed sores, pelvic metastatic mass, and thoracic vertebra and rib fractures, respectively, were treated. Daily doses of opioids could not be increased due to side effects. An IT catheter (20 G) was placed by percutaneous approach in the lumbar area while advancing toward the thoracic region, and was then tunnelled and fixed subcutaneously. It was connected to an external infusion pump with a mixture of bupivacaine 1 mg/mL, naloxone 0.02 ng/mL, ketamine 100 mu g/mL, morphine 0.01 mg/mL and clonidine 0.75 mu g/mL. The starting rate was 1 mL/h. The pain was mostly controlled at a rate of <1 mL/h. Opioid consumption was reduced dramatically. The catheter was kept in place for one month in the first and third patients, and for six months in the second patient, until his death. Major side effects, such as hypotension, constipation, muscle weakness, sphincter dysfunction, and cognitive or mood deterioration, were not observed with this approach. One patient experienced a urinary tract infection followed by sepsis and meningitis, which was cured by antibiotics. The catheter was removed in this patient. IT infusion with a low-concentration multidrug mixture could be considered as an alternative modality for intractable pain relief in older adults or in malignancies.

Mutation analysis has shown common causative factors for two major neurodegenerative disorders, ALS and FTD. Shared pathological and genetic markers as well as common neurological signs between these diseases have given rise to the notion of an ALS/FTD spectrum. This overlap among genetic factors causing ALS/FTD and the coincidence of mutated alleles (including causative, risk and modifier variants) have given rise to the notion of an oligogenic model of disease. In this review we summarize major advances in the elucidation of novel genetic factors in these diseases which have led to a better understanding of the common pathogenic factors leading to neurodegeneration.

Study Design In this study, asphyxiated newborns, for whom later brain injury was defined by brain imaging and/or autopsy results, were monitored by NIRS during therapeutic hypothermia. We compared regional cerebral oxygenation saturation (rSO(2)) measured by NIRS at key time points for newborns who developed or did not develop later brain injury. Results A total of 18 asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia were enrolled. rSO(2) was higher in the asphyxiated newborns who developed later brain injury. Sensitivity within the first 10 hours of hypothermia treatment for an adverse outcome was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70-100%) and specificity was 83% (95% CI, 36-99%). Conclusions NIRS appears to identify asphyxiated newborns at risk of developing brain injury as early as the first 10 hours of hypothermia treatment. Thus, NIRS may have an important role as an early outcome predictor in this population.

Yet, the neurobehavioral effects of paternal deprivation (PD) are poorly understood. Here, we examined the behavioral consequences of PD in the California mouse, a species displaying monogamous bonding and biparental care, and assessed its impact on dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and glutamate (GLU) transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In adult males, deficits in social interaction were observed, when a father-deprived (PD) mouse was matched with a PD partner. In adult females, deficits were observed when matching a PD animal with a non-PD control, and when matching 2 PD animals. PD also increased aggression in females. Behavioral abnormalities in PD females were associated with a sensitized response to the locomotor-activating effect of amphetamine. Following immunocytochemical demonstration of DA, 5-HT, and GLU innervations in the mPFC, we employed in vivo electrophysiology and microiontophoresis, and found that PD attenuated the basal activity of low-spiking pyramidal neurons in females. PD decreased pyramidal responses to DA in females, while enhancing responses to NMDA in both sexes. We thus demonstrate that, during critical neurodevelopmental periods, PD leads to sex-dependent abnormalities in social and reward-related behaviors that are associated with disturbances in cortical DA and GLU neurotransmission.

On how the brain decodes vocal cues about speaker confidence	CORTEX			English	Article						Feeling of knowing; Prosody; Expressed confidence; P200; Late positivity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EMOTIONAL PROSODY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; TIME-COURSE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; ERP EVIDENCE; SPEECH; SEX	In speech communication, listeners must accurately decode vocal cues that refer to the speaker's mental state, such as their confidence or 'feeling of knowing'. However, the time course and neural mechanisms associated with online inferences about speaker confidence are unclear. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the temporal neural dynamics underlying a listener's ability to infer speaker confidence from vocal cues during speech processing. We recorded listeners' real-time brain responses while they evaluated statements wherein the speaker's tone of voice conveyed one of three levels of confidence (confident, close-to-confident, unconfident) or were spoken in a neutral manner. Neural responses time-locked to event onset show that the perceived level of speaker confidence could be differentiated at distinct time points during speech processing: unconfident expressions elicited a weaker P2 than all other expressions of confidence (or neutral-intending utterances), whereas close-to-confident expressions elicited a reduced negative response in the 330-500 msec and 550-740 msec time window. Neutral-intending expressions, which were also perceived as relatively confident, elicited a more delayed, larger sustained positivity than all other expressions in the 980-1270 msec window for this task. These findings provide the first piece of evidence of how quickly the brain responds to vocal cues signifying the extent of a speaker's confidence during online speech comprehension; first, a rough dissociation between unconfident and confident voices occurs as early as 200 msec after speech onset. At a later stage, further differentiation of the exact level of speaker confidence (i.e., close-to-confident, very confident) is evaluated via an inferential system to determine the speaker's meaning under current task settings. These findings extend three-stage models of how vocal emotion cues are processed in speech comprehension (e.g., Schirmer & Kotz, 2006) by revealing how a speaker's mental state (i.e., feeling of knowing) is simultaneously inferred from vocal expressions.

We briefly review the myriad meanings of the term neuroplasticity, and its neuroscientific basis. We then review the evidence for aberrant neuroplasticity and metaplasticity associated with schizophrenia as well as the risk for developing this illness, and discuss the implications of such understanding for prevention and therapeutic interventions. We argue that the failure and/or altered timing of plasticity of critical brain circuits might underlie cognitive and deficit symptoms, and may also lead to aberrant plastic reorganization in other circuits, leading to affective dysregulation and eventually psychosis. This dysplastic model of schizophrenia can suggest testable etiology and treatment-relevant questions for the future.

DOMESTICA; BASAL GANGLIA; SOCIAL-CONTEXT	Social context affects behavioral displays across a variety of species. For example, social context acutely influences the acoustic and temporal structure of vocal communication signals such as speech and birdsong. Despite the prevalence and importance of such social influences, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the social modulation of communication. Catecholamines are implicated in the regulation of social behavior and motor control, but the degree to which catecholamines influence vocal communication signals remains largely unknown. Using a songbird, the Bengalese finch, we examined the extent to which the social context in which song is produced affected immediate early gene expression (EGR-1) in catecholamine-synthesising neurons in the midbrain. Further, we assessed the degree to which administration of amphetamine, which increases catecholamine concentrations in the brain, mimicked the effect of social context on vocal signals. We found that significantly more catecholaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (but not the central grey, locus coeruleus or subcoeruleus) expressed EGR-1 in birds that were exposed to females and produced courtship song than in birds that produced non-courtship song in isolation. Furthermore, we found that amphetamine administration mimicked the effects of social context and caused many aspects of non-courtship song to resemble courtship song. Specifically, amphetamine increased the stereotypy of syllable structure and sequencing, the repetition of vocal elements and the degree of sequence completions. Taken together, these data highlight the conserved role of catecholamines in vocal communication across species, including songbirds and humans.

BRPF1 (bromodomain-and PHD finger-containing protein 1) is a unique chromatin regulator possessing two PHD fingers, one bromodomain and a PWWP domain for recognizing multiple histone modifications. In addition, it binds to the acetyltransferases MOZ, MORF, and HBO1 (also known as KAT6A, KAT6B, and KAT7, respectively) to promote complex formation, restrict substrate specificity, and enhance enzymatic activity. Wehave recently showed that ablation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes embryonic lethality at E9.5. Here we present systematic analyses of the mutant animals and demonstrate that the ablation leads to vascular defects in the placenta, yolk sac, and embryo proper, as well as abnormal neural tube closure. At the cellular level, Brpf1 loss inhibits proliferation of embryonic fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors. Molecularly, the loss reduces transcription of a ribosomal protein L10 (Rpl10)-like gene and the cell cycle inhibitor p27, and increases expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p16 and a novel protein homologous to Scp3, a synaptonemal complex protein critical for chromosome association and embryo survival. These results uncover a crucial role of Brpf1 in controlling mouse embryo development and regulating cellular and gene expression programs.

Special emphasis has been given to image fusion in multimodal imaging and 3-dimensional rendering of the AVM, with the aim to improve the visualization of the lesion (for diagnostic purposes) and the selection of the nidus (for therapeutic aims, like the selection of the region of interest for the gamma knife radiosurgery plan). Searching for new diagnostic and prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers, fractal-based computational models have been proposed for describing and quantifying the angioarchitecture of the nidus. Computational modeling in the AVM field offers promising tools of analysis and requires a strict collaboration among neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, clinicians, computer scientists, and engineers. We present here some updated state-of-the-art exemplary cases in the field, focusing on recent neuroimaging computational modeling with clinical relevance, which might offer useful clinical tools for the management of AVMs in the future.

Lack of biological understanding of the substantial clinical heterogeneity of these tumours restricts therapeutic advances. We integrated genomic and clinicopathological analyses of a cohort of patients with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours to find out the molecular basis for clinical heterogeneity in these tumours. Methods We obtained 259 rhabdoid tumours from 37 international institutions and assessed transcriptional profiles in 43 primary tumours and copy number profiles in 38 primary tumours to discover molecular subgroups of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours. We used gene and pathway enrichment analyses to discover group-specific molecular markers and did immunohistochemical analyses on 125 primary tumours to evaluate clinicopathological significance of molecular subgroup and ASCL1-NOTCH signalling. Findings Transcriptional analyses identified two atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour subgroups with differential enrichment of genetic pathways, and distinct clinicopathological and survival features. Expression of ASCL1, a regulator of NOTCH signalling, correlated with supratentorial location (p=0.004) and superior 5-year overall survival (35%, 95% CI 13-57, and 20%, 6-34, for ASCL1-positive and ASCL1-negative tumours, respectively; p=0.033) in 70 patients who received multimodal treatment. ASCL1 expression also correlated with superior 5-year overall survival (34%, 7-61, and 9%, 0-21, for ASCL1-positive and ASCL1-negative tumours, respectively; p=0.001) in 39 patients who received only chemotherapy without radiation. Cox hazard ratios for overall survival in patients with differential ASCL1 enrichment treated with chemotherapy with or without radiation were 2.02 (95% CI 1.04-3.85; p=0.038) and 3.98 (1.71-9.26; p=0.001). Integrated analyses of molecular subgroupings with clinical prognostic factors showed three distinct clinical risk groups of tumours with different therapeutic outcomes. Interpretation An integration of clinical risk factors and tumour molecular groups can be used to identify patients who are likely to have improved long-term radiation-free survival and might help therapeutic stratification of patients with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours.

Methods: A longitudinal study following up 22 individuals from well-defined periods of lower and higher stress was conducted. HF-HRV during waking restfulness and in response to a worry induction was measured during a low-stress period. Sleep disturbances were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) during low-stress and high-stress periods. Results: During both the low-and high-stress periods, lower HF-HRV during worry was associated with greater PSQI scores. Importantly, lower HF-HRV during the worry induction prospectively predicted greater increases in the PSQI score from the low-stress to the high-stress periods. Conclusion: HF-HRV during worry might represent an index of vulnerability to stress-induced sleep disturbances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In recent years, it has been demonstrated that microglia are not only immunocentric, but also neurobiological and can impact neural development and the maintenance of neuronal cell function in both healthy and pathological contexts. In the disease context, there is widespread consensus that microglia are dynamic cells with a potential to contribute to both central nervous system damage and repair. Indeed, a number of studies have found that microenvironmental conditions can selectively modify unique microglia phenotypes and functions. One novel mechanism that has garnered interest involves the regulation of microglial function by microRNAs, which has therapeutic implications such as enhancing microglia-mediated suppression of brain injury and promoting repair following inflammatory injury. Furthermore, recently published articles have identified molecular signatures of myeloid cells, suggesting that microglia are a distinct cell population compared to other cells of myeloid lineage that access the central nervous system under pathological conditions. Thus, new opportunities exist to help distinguish microglia in the brain and permit the study of their unique functions in health and disease.

PDs have been shown to be heritable, although research has not identified any consistent biomarkers associated with them. Biological research on PD is in a very early stage, and cannot be used as a basis for biological treatment. Current practices that favour aggressive drug therapy are not justified by the current state of research. Moreover, medications are often not effective for this patient population, while specific forms of psychotherapy have much better established efficacy.

Therefore, robust biomarkers are needed to guide the development of new targeted therapy. The authors evaluated the expression of several biomarkers in pediatric intracranial ependymoma and observed that the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a polycomb complex protein involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, was independently associated with poor survival. METHODSTissue microarray immunostaining was performed on 180 ependymoma samples from 12 of 16 Canadian pediatric centers. Expression levels of EZH2, Ki-67, B lymphoma Moloney-murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 homolog, tumor protein 16 (P16), Y-box binding protein 1, phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT), and epidermal growth factor receptor were evaluated. Cox regression analyses were performed, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves. RESULTSEZH2 expressed in 16% of tumors was associated with inferior 5-year overall survival. Ki-67 and pAKT levels were associated with a poor outcome in patients with posterior fossa ependymoma, and the absence of P16 was associated with a poor outcome in patients with supratentorial ependymoma. Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age and EZH2 expression (95% confidence interval, 1.1-36.0) were independent markers of a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONSEZH2 is a novel, independent marker of a poor prognosis in patients with ependymoma, especially in those who have tumors located in the posterior fossa. EZH2, pAKT, and P16 are potential therapeutic targets, particularly for patients who have tumors in which standard gross total resection plus fractionated radiotherapy is not feasible.

Expression levels of several biomarkers are investigated in pediatric intracranial ependymomas, and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) expression is independently associated with poor survival.

In nonendangered alcohol-preferring vervet monkeys, we modeled the most common nondysmorphic form of fetal alcohol syndrome disorder with voluntary drinking during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here, we report significant numerical reductions in the principal hippocampal neurons of fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) offspring, as compared to age-matched, similarly housed conspecifics with isocaloric sucrose exposure. These deficits, particularly marked in CA1 and CA3, are present neonatally and persist through infancy (5 months) and juvenile (2 years) stages. Although the volumes of hippocampal subdivisions in FAE animals are not atypical at birth, by age 2, they are only 65-70% of those estimated in age-matched controls. These data suggest that moderate, naturalistic alcohol consumption during late pregnancy results in a stable loss of hippocampal neurons and a progressive reduction of hippocampal volume.

Here we describe a next-generation sequencing approach that precisely maps and characterizes organelle DNA rearrangements in a single genome-wide experiment. In addition to displaying global portraits of genomic instability, it surprisingly unveiled an abundance of short-range rearrangements in Arabidopsis thaliana and human organelles. Among these, short-range U-turn-like inversions reach 25% of total rearrangements in wild-type Arabidopsis plastids and 60% in human mitochondria. Furthermore, we show that replication stress correlates with the accumulation of this type of rearrangement, suggesting that U-turn-like rearrangements could be the outcome of a replication-dependent mechanism. We also show that U-turn-like rearrangements are mostly generated using microhomologies and are repressed in plastids by Whirly proteins WHY1 and WHY3. A synergistic interaction is also observed between the genes for the plastid DNA recombinase RECA1 and those encoding plastid Whirly proteins, and the triple mutant why1why3reca1 accumulates almost 60 times the WT levels of U-turn-like rearrangements. We thus propose that the process leading to U-turn-like rearrangements may constitute a RecA-independent mechanism to restart stalled forks. Our results reveal that short-range rearrangements, and especially U-turn-like rearrangements, are a major factor of genomic instability in organelles, and this raises the question of whether they could have been underestimated in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

Salivary glands of healthy children versus sialorrhea children, is there an anatomical difference? An ultrasonographic biometry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						Salivary gland; Anatomy; Ultrasound; Sialorrhea; Drooling; Biometry	CEREBRAL-PALSY; TOXIN	Objectives: There is no literature about the average size of the salivary glands in the pediatric population with drooling (sialorrhea). Studies have shown that some pathologies affect the functionality of the salivary glands. We assessed via ultrasonography the sizes of the submandibular and parotid glands in 9 healthy children who were not suffering from local or systemic diseases that could affect the salivary glands. We also compared this group with a group of 9 patients with sialorrhea. Methods: Volunteers were matched based on age, gender, and BMI. Body weight did not differ more than 20% from ideal weight. The parotid and submandibular glands of 9 patients with sialorrhea without any previous treatment were measured via ultrasound and matched to a healthy control. Children with various causes for drooling were included (neurological disorders, neuromuscular disorders, lack of oral motor control). Results: Dimensions of the parotid glands in drooling and healthy patients were: surface area 2.96 cm(2) (SD +/- 0.90) and 2.81 cm(2) (SD +/- 0.54); in depth 1.68 cm (SD +/- 0.24) and 1.61 cm (SD +/- 0.27); in the axis longitudinal to the horizontal mandibular ramus 3.18 cm (+/- 0.46) and 3.15 cm (SD +/- 0.45) in drooling and healthy groups respectively. The means of submandibular glands of drooling and healthy patients measured in surface area: 3.20 cm(2) (SD +/- 0.66) and 3.08 cm(2) (SD +/- 0.65); anterior-posterior length 1.55 cm (SD +/- 0.23) and 1.46 cm (SD +/- 0.23), media-lateral length 3.07 cm (SD +/- 0.39) and 3.07 cm (SD +/- 0.32). There was no statistical significance in comparison with the healthy group control. Conclusion: The parotid and submandibular salivary glands in the pediatric population do not differ in size in children with or without drooling. Measuring the glands at baseline and post treatment with botulinum toxin injections allows one to evaluate if there are changes in the gland related to the treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

RHSCIR Network	The Influence of Time from Injury to Surgery on Motor Recovery and Length of Hospital Stay in Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: An Observational Canadian Cohort Study	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						timing of surgery; spinal cord injury; clinical trials; surgical decompression; translational research	OF-THE-LITERATURE; NEUROLOGIC RECOVERY; CLINICAL-TRIALS; ICCP PANEL; INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS; ANTERIOR DECOMPRESSION; DELAYED DECOMPRESSION; VASCULAR MECHANISMS; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; COMPRESSION INJURY	To determine the influence of time from injury to surgery on neurological recovery and length of stay (LOS) in an observational cohort of individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI), we analyzed the baseline and follow-up motor scores of participants in the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry to specifically assess the effect of an early (less than 24 h from injury) surgical procedure on motor recovery and on LOS. One thousand four hundred and ten patients who sustained acute tSCIs with baseline American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades A, B, C, or D and were treated surgically were analyzed to determine the effect of the timing of surgery (24, 48, or 72 h from injury) on motor recovery and LOS. Depending on the distribution of data, we used different types of generalized linear models, including multiple linear regression, gamma regression, and negative binomial regression. Persons with incomplete AIS B, C, and D injuries from C2 to L2 demonstrated motor recovery improvement of an additional 6.3 motor points (SE=2.8 p<0.03) when they underwent surgical treatment within 24 h from the time of injury, compared with those who had surgery later than 24 h post-injury. This beneficial effect of early surgery on motor recovery was not seen in the patients with AIS A complete SCI. AIS A and B patients who received early surgery experienced shorter hospital LOS. While the issues of when to perform surgery and what specific operation to perform remain controversial, this work provides evidence that for an incomplete acute tSCI in the cervical, thoracic, or thoracolumbar spine, surgery performed within 24 h from injury improves motor neurological recovery. Early surgery also reduces LOS.

Intact glycosaminoglycans from intervertebral disc-derived notochordal cell-conditioned media inhibit neurite growth while maintaining neuronal cell viability	SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Notochordal cells; Intervertebral disc; Neuronal cells; Glycosaminoglycans; Chondroitin sulfate; Neurite outgrowth	NUCLEUS PULPOSUS PHENOTYPE; IN-VITRO; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; SUBSTANCE-P; BACK-PAIN; EXPRESSION; DEGENERATION; INNERVATION; INGROWTH; SENSITIVITY	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Painful human intervertebral discs (IVDs) exhibit nerve growth deep into the IVD. Current treatments for discogenic back pain do not address the underlying mechanisms propagating pain and are often highly invasive or only offer temporary symptom relief. The notochord produces factors during development that pattern the spine and inhibit the growth of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons into the IVD. We hypothesize that notochordal cell (NC)-conditioned medium (NCCM) includes soluble factors capable of inhibiting neurite growth and may represent a future therapeutic target. PURPOSE: To test if NCCM can inhibit neurite growth and determine if NC-derived glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are necessary candidates for this inhibition. STUDY DESIGN: Human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells and rat DRG cells were treated with NCCM in two-dimensional culture in vitro, and digestion and mechanistic studies determined if specific GAGs were responsible for inhibitory effects. METHODS: Notochordal cell-conditioned medium was generated from porcine nucleus pulposus tissue that was cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium for 4 days. A dose study was performed using SH-SY5Y cells that were seeded in basal medium for 24 hours and neurite outgrowth and cell viability were assessed after treatment with basal media or NCCM (10% and 100%) for 48 hours. Glycosaminoglycans from NCCM were characterized using multiple digestions and liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Neurite growth was assessed on both SH-SY5Y and DRG cells after treatment with NCCM with and without GAG digestion. RESULTS: Notochordal cell-conditioned medium significantly inhibited the neurite outgrowth from SH-SY5Y cells compared with basal controls without dose or cytotoxic effects; % of neurite expressing cells were 39.0 +/- 2.9%, 27.3 +/- 3.6%, and 30.2 +/- 2.7% and mean neurite length was 60.3 +/- 3.5, 50.8 +/- 2.4, 53.2 +/- 3.7 mu m for basal, 10% NCCM, and 100% NCCM, respectively. Digestions and LC-MS determined that chondroitin-6-sulfate was the major GAG chain in NCCM. Neurite growth from SH-SY5Y and DRG cells was not inhibited when cells were treated with NCCM with digested chondroitin sulfate (CS). CONCLUSIONS: Soluble factors derived from NCCM were capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth in multiple neural cell types without any negative effects on cell viability. Cleavage of GAGs via digestion was necessary to reverse the neurite inhibition capacity of NCCM. We conclude that intact GAGs such as CS secreted from NCs are potential candidates that could be useful to reduce neurite growth in painful IVDs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Risk Factors for Neurodegeneration in Idiopathic Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder: A Multicenter Study	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE DEMENTIA; LEWY BODIES; AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION; DIAGNOSTIC-PROCEDURES; DELAYED EMERGENCE; SYMPTOMS; PD	ObjectiveTo assess whether risk factors for Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies increase rate of defined neurodegenerative disease in idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). MethodsTwelve centers administered a detailed questionnaire assessing risk factors for neurodegenerative synucleinopathy to patients with idiopathic RBD. Variables included demographics, lifestyle factors, pesticide exposures, occupation, comorbid conditions, medication use, family history, and autonomic/motor symptoms. After 4 years of follow-up, patients were assessed for dementia or parkinsonism. Disease risk was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and epidemiologic variables were compared between convertors and those still idiopathic using logistic regression. ResultsOf 305 patients, follow-up information was available for 279, of whom 93 (33.3%) developed defined neurodegenerative disease. Disease risk was 25% at 3 years and 41% after 5 years. Patients who converted were older (difference=4.5 years, p<0.001), with similar sex distribution. Neither caffeine, smoking, nor alcohol exposure predicted conversion. Although occupation was similar between groups, those who converted had a lower likelihood of pesticide exposure (occupational insecticide=2.3% vs 9.0%). Convertors were more likely to report family history of dementia (odds ratio [OR]=2.09), without significant differences in Parkinson disease or sleep disorders. Medication exposures and medical history were similar between groups. Autonomic and motor symptoms were more common among those who converted. Risk factors for primary dementia and parkinsonism were generally similar, except for a notably higher clonazepam use in dementia convertors (OR=2.6). InterpretationPatients with idiopathic RBD are at very high risk of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy. Risk factor profiles between convertors and nonconvertors have both important commonalities and differences.

The default mode network (DMN) is critical in this study, given the insight it provides for long-distance connectivity, and the importance of regions in this network for introspection and social emotion processing, areas affected in ASD. However, study of this network has largely been limited to adults; research earlier in development is lacking. The objective of this study was to examine DMN connectivity in children/adolescents with ASD. MethodsA total of 115 children/adolescents, aged 6 to 17 years (71 males with ASD and 44 group age-matched TD males) were included in these analyses. We examined group differences in (1) functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and regions across the brain, (2) connectivity within the DMN as a function of age and intelligence quotient (IQ), and (3) the association between DMN connectivity and empathic accuracy. ResultsIndividuals with ASD, relative to controls, showed either stronger or weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and DMN regions, depending on the region, but also showed stronger connectivity with non-DMN regions. A significant group-by-age interaction was observed in functional connectivity between the PCC and medial prefrontal cortex; connectivity increased with age in controls, but decreased in individuals with ASD. No effects of IQ were found. There was a significant group difference in the relation between DMN connectivity and empathic accuracy. InterpretationDifferences in functional connectivity may suggest the presence of neural atypicalities that impact the development of typical connectivity in ASD. In addition to affecting DMN dynamics, these atypicalities may also impact social-cognitive abilities. Ann Neurol 2015;77:866-876	[Doyle-Thomas, Krissy A.

Methods and results: Baseline study was conducted prior to ablating right and left ganglionated plexuses (RAGP, LAGP) in 11 anesthetized canines (Neuroablation group) and in 11 canines without neuroablation (Intact GP). After being subjected to RAP (400 beats/min) for 6 weeks, animals were reanesthetized for terminal study. The ERP shortening typical of chronic RAP was significantly more pronounced in the Intact GP (baseline: 112 +/- 2 to terminal: 80 +/- 11 ms) than in the Neuroablation group (113 +/- 18 to 102 +/- 21 ms, p < .001), and AF inducibility (extrastimulus protocol) showed significantly greater increment in the Intact GP (baseline: 23 +/- 19% to terminal: 60 +/- 17% of trials) than in the Neuroablation group (18 +/- 15% to 27 +/- 17%, p = 0.029). Negative chronotropic responses to right vagus nerve stimulation were markedly reduced immediately after the neuroablation procedure but had recovered at terminal study. Vagally-evoked repolarization changes (from 191 unipolar electrograms) occurred in a majority of Intact GP animals in the superior, middle and inferior RA free wall, and in the LA appendage. In the Neuroablation group, repolarization changes were restricted to the superior RA free wall but none occurred in the inferior RA and only infrequently in the LA appendage, yielding significantly smaller affected areas in Neuroablation than in Intact GP animals. Conclusion: Persistent functional denervation in LA and RA regions other than RA pacemaker areas may contribute to prevent the development of a tachycardia-dependent AF substrate.

Objectives: To evaluate prenatal and postnatal exposures to PCB-153, a proxy of total PCB exposure, and their relation to inattention and activity in 5-year-old Inuits from the Cord Blood Monitoring Program. Methods: Prenatal exposure to PCBs was informed by cord plasma PCB-153 levels. We used a validated pharmacokinetic model to estimate monthly infants' levels across the first year of life. Inattention and activity were assessed by coding of video recordings of children undergoing fine motor testing. We used multivariable linear regression to evaluate the association between prenatal and postnatal PCB-153 levels and inattention (n = 97) and activity n = 98) at 5 years of age. Results: Cord plasma PCB-153 was not associated with inattention and activity. Each interquartile range (IQR) increase in estimated infant PCB-153 levels at 2 months was associated with a 1.02% increase in the duration of inattention (95% CI: 0.04, 2.00). Statistical adjustment for the duration of breastfeeding slightly increased regression coefficients for postnatal level estimates, some of which became statistically significant for inattention (months: 2-4) and activity (months: 2-5). Conclusions: Our study adds to the growing evidence of postnatal windows of development during which children are more susceptible to neurotoxicants like PCBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Emergence of Age-Dependent Social Cognitive Deficits After Generalized Insult to the Developing Brain: A Longitudinal Prospective Analysis Using Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						child; brain injuries; magnetic resonance imaging; Theory of Mind; neurobiology	PEDIATRIC HEAD-INJURY; DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; WHITE-MATTER DAMAGE; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; EMOTION RECOGNITION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; MIND; ADOLESCENCE	Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for maturation of neurobiological processes that underlie complex social and emotional behavior including Theory of Mind (ToM). While structural correlates of ToM are well described in adults, less is known about the anatomical regions subsuming these skills in the developing brain or the impact of cerebral insult on the acquisition and establishment of high-level social cognitive skills. This study aimed to examine the differential influence of age-at-insult and brain pathology on ToM in a sample of children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Children and adolescents with TBI (n=112) were categorized according to timing of brain insult: (i) middle childhood (5-9 years; n=41); (ii) late childhood (10-11 years; n=39); and (iii) adolescence (12-15 years; n=32) and group-matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status to a typically developing (TD) control group (n=43). Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging including a susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence 2-8 weeks postinjury and were assessed on a battery of ToM tasks at 6- and 24-months after injury. Results showed that for adolescents with TBI, social cognitive dysfunction at 6- and 24-months postinjury was associated with diffuse neuropathology and a greater number of lesions detected using SWI. In the late childhood TBI group, we found a time-dependent emergence of social cognitive impairment, linked to diffuse neuropathology. The middle childhood TBI group demonstrated performance unrelated to SWI pathology and comparable to TD controls. Findings indicate that the full extent of social cognitive deficits may not be realized until the associated skills reach maturity. Evidence for brain structure-function relationships suggests that the integrity of an anatomically distributed network of brain regions and their connections is necessary for the acquisition and establishment of high-level social cognitive skills.

Methods: During training, the system explicitly models the spatial variability of the intensity distributions throughout the brain by first segmenting it into distinct anatomical regions and then building regional likelihood distributions for each tissue class based on multimodal magnetic resonance image (MRI) intensities. Local class smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel information in the prior probability through Markov random fields. The system is tested on two datasets from real multisite clinical trials consisting of multimodal MRIs from a total of 100 patients with MS. Lesion classification results based on the framework are compared with and without the regional information, as well as with other state-of-the-art methods against the labels from expert manual raters. The metrics for comparison include Dice overlap, sensitivity, and positive predictive rates for both voxel and lesion classifications. Results: Statistically significant improvements in Dice values (p < 0.01), for voxel-based and lesion-based sensitivity values (p < 0.001), and positive predictive rates (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively) are shown when the proposed method is compared to the method without regional information, and to a widely used method [1]. This holds particularly true in the posterior fossa, an area where classification is very challenging. Significance: The proposed method allows us to provide clinicians with accurate tissue labels for T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesions, two types of lesions that differ in appearance and clinical ramifications, and with a confidence level in the classification, which helps clinicians assess the classification results.

Neurosurgical virtual reality simulation metrics to assess psychomotor skills during brain tumor resection	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery			English	Article						Performance metrics; Virtual reality neurosurgical simulation; Haptic feedback; Brain tumor resection; Neurosurgical oncology; NeuroTouch	LAPAROSCOPIC SURGEONS; SURGICAL SKILLS; ADVERSE EVENTS; OPERATING-ROOM; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; COMPETENCE	Virtual reality simulator technology together with novel metrics could advance our understanding of expert neurosurgical performance and modify and improve resident training and assessment. This pilot study introduces innovative metrics that can be measured by the state-of-the-art simulator to assess performance. Such metrics cannot be measured in an operating room and have not been used previously to assess performance. Three sets of performance metrics were assessed utilizing the NeuroTouch platform in six scenarios with simulated brain tumors having different visual and tactile characteristics. Tier 1 metrics included percentage of brain tumor resected and volume of simulated "normal" brain tissue removed. Tier 2 metrics included instrument tip path length, time taken to resect the brain tumor, pedal activation frequency, and sum of applied forces. Tier 3 metrics included sum of forces applied to different tumor regions and the force bandwidth derived from the force histogram. The results outlined are from a novice resident in the second year of training and an expert neurosurgeon. The three tiers of metrics obtained from the NeuroTouch simulator do encompass the wide variability of technical performance observed during novice/expert resections of simulated brain tumors and can be employed to quantify the safety, quality, and efficiency of technical performance during simulated brain tumor resection. Tier 3 metrics derived from force pyramids and force histograms may be particularly useful in assessing simulated brain tumor resections. Our pilot study demonstrates that the safety, quality, and efficiency of novice and expert operators can be measured using metrics derived from the NeuroTouch platform, helping to understand how specific operator performance is dependent on both psychomotor ability and cognitive input during multiple virtual reality brain tumor resections.

Herpes zoster-associated severity and duration of pain, health-related quality of life, and healthcare utilization in Taiwan: a prospective observational study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS-INFECTION; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; OLDER-ADULTS; GENERAL-PRACTICE; IMPACT; VACCINE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION; NEUROPATHY; VARICELLA	BackgroundTo assess the severity and duration of herpes zoster (HZ)-associated pain (ZAP) and its impact on quality of life (QoL) and healthcare utilization (HCRU) from a patient perspective in routine care in Taiwan. MethodsA prospective, observational, single-cohort study was conducted in five centers across Taiwan. Patients were recruited at different time points during their HZ episode and were followed for 180days. ZAP was assessed with the Initial Zoster Impact Questionnaire and the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory, QoL with the EQ-5D, and HCRU with a simple questionnaire. ResultsA total of 150 patients were included with a mean age of 64.9years and mean time since rash onset of 18.8days. Prodromal pain was experienced by 64.7% of patients, of whom 91.8% reported moderate-to-severe pain. At enrollment, 98.0% of patients experienced ZAP. MeanSD worst pain score decreased from 5.95 +/- 3.09 at enrollment to 2.65 +/- 2.98 at 30days and 0.28 +/- 0.83 at 180days. Postherpetic neuralgia was observed in 20.7% of patients. Mean +/- SD EQ-5D score significantly decreased (P<0.001) from 0.91 +/- 0.16 before rash onset to 0.67 +/- 0.18 after rash onset, showing significant QoL deterioration up to 60days. The impact of HZ on QoL and pain severity was similar across age groups. Significant HCRU was observed including visits to the doctor (83.3% of patients), specialist (30.7%), emergency department (24.7%), physiotherapist (23.3%), and hospitalizations (20.7%). ConclusionSevere morbidity and significant HCRU are associated with HZ in Taiwan, supporting the need for early intervention and preventive strategies to reduce the HZ-associated burden of illness.

Disruption of CLPB is associated with congenital microcephaly, severe encephalopathy and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							PROTEIN DISAGGREGATION; MOLECULAR CHAPERONE; SPINAL INTERNEURONS; ATP HYDROLYSIS; ZEBRAFISH; MOTOR; AAA; ATPASES; STARTLE; HSP104	Background The heterogeneous group of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria disorders includes several inborn errors of metabolism that affect mitochondrial function through poorly understood mechanisms. We describe four newborn siblings, from a consanguineous family, who showed microcephaly, small birth weight, severe encephalopathy and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Their neurological examination was characterised by severe hypertonia and the induction of prolonged clonic movements of the four limbs upon minimal tactile stimulation. Methods and results Using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous truncating mutation (p.I562Tfs*23) in CLPB segregating with the disease in this family. CLPB codes for a member of the family of ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA(+) proteins) whose function remains unknown. We found that CLPB expression is abolished in fibroblasts from the patients. To investigate the function of this gene, we interfered with the translation of the zebrafish clpb orthologue using an antisense morpholino. The clpb morphants showed an abnormal touch-evoked response with increased swim velocity and tail beat frequency. This motor phenotype is reminiscent of that observed in the patients and is suggestive of increased excitability in neuronal circuits. Interestingly, knocking down clpb reduced the number of inhibitory glycinergic interneurons and increased a population of excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the spinal cord. Conclusions Altogether, our study suggests that disruption of CLPB causes a novel form of neonatal encephalopathy associated with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.

Here we identified a role for SETX in controlling the antiviral response. Cells that had undergone depletion of SETX and SETX-deficient cells derived from patients with AOA2 had higher expression of antiviral mediators in response to infection than did wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we propose a model whereby SETX attenuates the activity of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at genes stimulated after a virus is sensed and thus controls the magnitude of the host response to pathogens and the biogenesis of various RNA viruses (e.g., influenza A virus and West Nile virus). Our data indicate a potentially causal link among inborn errors in SETX, susceptibility to infection and the development of neurologic disorders.

Integrated analysis of pediatric glioblastoma reveals a subset of biologically favorable tumors with associated molecular prognostic markers	ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA			English	Article						Glioblastoma; Pediatric; Brain tumor; Methylation; Prognostic; Subgroup; Survival; CDKN2A; BRAF	HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; INTRINSIC PONTINE GLIOMA; ACTIVATING ACVR1 MUTATIONS; MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION; GENOMIC LANDSCAPE; EXPRESSION; SUBGROUPS; TEMOZOLOMIDE; IDH1; ASTROCYTOMAS	Pediatric glioblastoma (pedGBM) is amongst the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood and carries a dismal prognosis. In contrast to adult GBM, few molecular prognostic markers for the pediatric counterpart have been established. We, therefore, investigated the prognostic significance of genomic and epigenetic alterations through molecular analysis of 202 pedGBM (1-18 years) with comprehensive clinical annotation. Routinely prepared formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples were assessed for genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, with known candidate genes screened for alterations via direct sequencing or FISH. Unexpectedly, a subset of histologically diagnosed GBM (n = 40, 20 %) displayed methylation profiles similar to those of either low-grade gliomas or pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA). These tumors showed a markedly better prognosis, with molecularly PXA-like tumors frequently harboring BRAF V600E mutations and 9p21 (CDKN2A) homozygous deletion. The remaining 162 tumors with pedGBM molecular signatures comprised four subgroups: H3.3 G34-mutant (15 %), H3.3/H3.1 K27-mutant (43 %), IDH1-mutant (6 %), and H3/IDH wild-type (wt) GBM (36 %). These subgroups were associated with specific cytogenetic aberrations, MGMT methylation patterns and clinical outcomes. Analysis of follow-up data identified a set of biomarkers feasible for use in risk stratification: pedGBM with any oncogene amplification and/or K27M mutation (n = 124) represents a particularly unfavorable group, with 3-year overall survival (OS) of 5 %, whereas tumors without these markers (n = 38) define a more favorable group (3-year OS similar to 70 %).Combined with the lower grade-like lesions, almost 40 % of pedGBM cases had distinct molecular features associated with a more favorable outcome. This refined prognostication method for pedGBM using a molecular risk algorithm may allow for improved therapeutic choices and better planning of clinical trial stratification for this otherwise devastating disease.

In rats, the activation of stress-related brain systems, including corticotropin-releasing factor and norepinephrine, is critical for stress-induced reinstatement of extinguished drug seeking, an animal model for drug relapse. In addition, there are strong indications that activation of the endogenous opioid system is important for the effects of stress on drug seeking. More specifically, activation of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system is critically involved in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking following exposure to stressors, such as footshock, forced swimming or social stress. However, studies on the role of the dynorphin/KOR system in stress-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking are scarce. Here, rats were trained to self-administer heroin (0.1mg/kg/infusion) for 10 days. Drug seeking was then extinguished and the rats were tested for acute (21 hours) food deprivation-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. In two separate experiments, rats were injected with the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist, naltrexone (0.0, 1.0, 10.0mg/kg; s.c.) or the KOR antagonist, norBNI (0.0, 1.0, 10.0mg/kg; i.p.) before the reinstatement test. Naltrexone treatment did not affect stress-induced reinstatement. In contrast, treatment with norBNI dose-dependently attenuated food deprivation-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. These results support the hypothesis that activation of KOR, but not MOR, is critically involved in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.

IMAGEN Consortium	No differences in ventral striatum responsivity between adolescents with a positive family history of alcoholism and controls	ADDICTION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alcohol; functional magnetic resonance imaging; reward	SUBSTANCE USE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DELAYED REWARDS; SCREENING-TEST; BEHAVIOR; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; DEPENDENCE; CHILDREN; DRINKING; ADULTS	Individuals with alcohol-dependent parents show an elevated risk of developing alcohol-related problems themselves. Modulations of the mesolimbic reward circuit have been postulated as a pre-existing marker of alcoholism. We tested whether a positive family history of alcoholism is correlated with ventral striatum functionality during a reward task. All participants performed a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task while their brain responses were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We compared 206 healthy adolescents (aged 13-15) who had any first- or second-degree relative with alcoholism to 206 matched controls with no biological relative with alcoholism. Reward anticipation as well as feedback of win recruited the ventral striatum in all participants, but adolescents with a positive family history of alcoholism did not differ from their matched peers. Also we did not find any correlation between family history density and reward anticipation or feedback of win. This finding of no differences did not change when we analyzed a subsample of 77 adolescents with at least one parent with alcohol use disorder and their matched controls. Because this result is in line with another study reporting no differences between children with alcohol-dependent parents and controls at young age, but contrasts with studies of older individuals, one might conclude that at younger age the effect of family history has not yet exerted its influence on the still developing mesolimbic reward circuit.

To understand the links between circadian rhythms and schizophrenia, we analyzed wheel-running behavior of Sandy (Sdy) mice, which have a loss-of-function mutation in the schizophrenia risk gene Dtnbpl, and exhibit several behavioral features of schizophrenia. While rhythms of Sdy mice were mainly normal under light-dark conditions (LD) or in constant darkness (DD), they had a significantly longer free-running period under constant light (LL) compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. The mutant mice also had a higher subjective day/subjective night ratio of activity under LL, indicating lower amplitude, and a lower precision of their onsets of activity under all three lighting conditions. These observations are reminiscent of the circadian disruptions observed in schizophrenia patients. This prompted us to assess schizophrenia-relevant behavioral abnormalities in Sdy mice following alteration of the circadian rhythms by presentation of constant light. Spontaneous locomotor activity, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle and anxiety-like behavior were assessed under baseline LD conditions, then in LL, and then again in LD. Under LL, the Sdy mice showed significantly increased spontaneous locomotion as well as deficits in PPI compared to WT mice. Strikingly, these behavioral deficits persisted even after the mice were returned in LD conditions. While LL led to an increase in anxiety-like behavior in WT animals that was fully reversed after 3 weeks in LD, this effect was not observed in the Sdy mutants. Overall, these results suggest that Dtnbp1 deficiency may lead to increased vulnerability to schizophrenia under environmental conditions where circadian rhythms are altered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Ovarian Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors in Patients With Probable or Confirmed Germline DICER1 Mutations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Ovary; DICER1; Mutation; Sex cord-stromal tumor; Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor; Granulosa cell tumor	GRANULOSA-CELL TUMORS; PLEUROPULMONARY BLASTOMA; FOXL2; EXPRESSION; DIAGNOSIS	The DICER1 gene encodes an endoribonuclease involved in the production of mature microRNAs which regulates gene expression through several mechanisms. Recent studies have demonstrated somatic mutations in DICER1 in approximately 60% of ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. Furthermore, patients with germline mutations in DICER1 are predisposed to developing a range of rare neoplasms including ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors most of which have been classified as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. However, the histologic features of these tumors have not been reported in detail. We describe the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings of 4 sex cord-stromal tumors arising in patients with proven or likely germline DICER1 mutations including 3 individuals from 1 family. Three tumors showed similar appearances characterized by marked architectural and cytologic heterogeneity including sertoliform, juvenile granulosa cell tumor-like, and unclassifiable elements. The remaining case mainly showed heterologous mucinous epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation with only a minor intermediate-grade Sertoli cell component. This tumor and one of the 3 former cases arose in related patients with identical germline DICER1 mutations indicating that additional factors influence tumor morphology. All tumors were positive for steroidogenic factor-1 and FOXL2 on immunohistochemical analysis, whereas there was more variable expression of inhibin, calretinin, CD56, CD99, and hormone receptors. The present small series suggests that some ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor associated with germline DICER1 mutations may show distinctive histologic features in particular admixed Sertoli cell and juvenile granulosa cell tumor-like features. Larger studies are required to establish whether heterologous elements are also a more common feature of these tumors.	[Oost, E.

A major confounder in molecular studies using human brain tissue is postmortem interval (i.e. the amount of time between a subject's death and processing of tissue). We examined the integrity of biomolecules that were of interest to molecular studies of neurologic disorders, including RNA, microRNA, histone modifications, and proteins, at various postmortem intervals in an animal model to assess their robustness and suitability for experimentation. Sprague-Dawley rats were selected as model and subjected to 2 conditions: a variable postmortem interval at room temperature and a fixed time of 24 hours at 4 degrees C, which simulates the period commonly spent in the morgue before brain collection. Eight time points were investigated. MicroRNA was impressively resistant to postmortem intervals; methylated histone modifications showed a threshold between 72 and 96 hours, mirroring results from histone proteins at 72 hours. RNA degradation was transcript-specific, with housekeeping genes being more robust than genes with lower expression. Our results suggest that molecules commonly investigated in genetic and epigenetic studies were highly stable through the postmortem intervals investigated. These results support the continued use of postmortem tissue for neuropsychiatric research.

In this study, using specific antibodies, we examined the precise distribution of both melatonin receptors immunoreactivity across the adult rat brain using light, confocal, and electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate a selective MT1 and MT2 localization on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in numerous regions of the rat telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon. Confocal and ultrastructural examination confirmed the somatodendritic nature of MT1 and MT2 receptors, both being localized on neuronal membranes. Overall, striking differences were observed in the anatomical distribution pattern of MT1 and MT2 proteins, and the labeling often appeared complementary in regions displaying both receptors. Somadendrites labeled for MT1 were observed for instance in the retrosplenial cortex, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the islands of Calleja, the medial habenula, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the superior colliculus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the dorsal raphe nucleus, and the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland. Somadendrites endowed with MT2 receptors were mostly observed in the CA3 field of the hippocampus, the reticular thalamic nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the inferior colliculus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Together, these data provide the first detailed neurocytological mapping of melatonin receptors in the adult rat brain, an essential prerequisite for a better understanding of melatonin distinct receptor function and neurophysiology.

Yet, the neurophysiological processes underlying these organized, large-scale fluctuations remain to be uncovered. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging during rest in 12 healthy subjects we analyze the resting state networks and their underlying neurophysiology. We first demonstrate non-invasively that cortical occurrences of high-frequency oscillatory activity are conditioned to the phase of slower spontaneous fluctuations in neural ensembles. We further show that resting-state networks emerge from synchronized phase-amplitude coupling across the brain. Overall, these findings suggest a unified principle of local-to-global neural signaling for long-range brain communication. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cognitive milestones happen concurrently with these structural changes, and a delay in such changes has been implicated in developmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Accurate estimation of individuals' brain maturity, therefore, is critical in establishing a baseline for normal brain development against which neurodevelopmental disorders can be assessed. In this study, cortical thickness derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a large longitudinal dataset of normally growing children and adolescents (n = 308), were used to build a highly accurate predictive model for estimating chronological age (cross-validated correlation up to R = 0.84). Unlike previous studies which used kernelized approach in building prediction models, we used an elastic net penalized linear regression model capable of producing a spatially sparse, yet accurate predictive model of chronological age. Upon investigating different scales of cortical parcellation from 78 to 10,240 brain parcels, we observed that the accuracy in estimated age improved with increased spatial scale of brain parcellation, with the best estimations obtained for spatial resolutions consisting of 2560 and 10,240 brain parcels. The top predictors of brain maturity were found in highly localized sensorimotor and association areas. The results of our study demonstrate that cortical thickness can be used to estimate individuals' brain maturity with high accuracy, and the estimated ages relate to functional and behavioural measures, underscoring the relevance and scope of the study in the understanding of biological maturity.

While studies with small sample sizes can rarely be shown to deviate from standard hypotheses (such as the normality of the residuals) due to the poor sensitivity of normality tests with low degrees of freedom, large-scale studies (e.g. > 100 subjects) exhibit more obvious deviations from these hypotheses and call for more refined models for statistical inference. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of robust regression as a tool for analyzing large neuroimaging cohorts. First, we use an analytic test based on robust parameter estimates; based on simulations, this procedure is shown to provide an accurate statistical control without resorting to permutations. Second, we show that robust regression yields more detections than standard algorithms using as an example an imaging genetics study with 392 subjects. Third, we show that robust regression can avoid false positives in a large-scale analysis of brain-behavior relationships with over 1500 subjects. Finally we embed robust regression in the Randomized Parcellation Based Inference (RPBI) method and demonstrate that this combination further improves the sensitivity of tests carried out across the whole brain. Altogether, our results show that robust procedures provide important advantages in large-scale neuroimaging group studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

HSG	Quantitative comparison of 21 protocols for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions in in vivo MRI: Towards a harmonized segmentation protocol	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Hippocampus; Medial temporal lobe; Hippocampal subfields; CA1; CA2; CA3; Dentate gyrus; Subiculum; Entorhinal cortex; Perirhinal cortex; Parahippocampal gyrus; Magnetic resonance imaging; Segmentation; Unified protocol	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HIGH-RESOLUTION MRI; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; APICAL NEUROPIL ATROPHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VOLUMETRIC-ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; DENTATE GYRUS; CORTEX; AGE	Objective: An increasing number of human in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have focused on examining the structure and function of the subfields of the hippocampal formation (the dentate gyrus, CA fields 1-3, and the subiculum) and subregions of the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices). The ability to interpret the results of such studies and to relate them to each other would be improved if a common standard existed for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions. Currently, research groups label different subsets of structures and use different rules, landmarks, and cues to define their anatomical extents. This paper characterizes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the variability in the existing manual segmentation protocols for labeling hippocampal and parahippocampal substructures in MRI, with the goal of guiding subsequent work on developing a harmonized substructure segmentation protocol. Method: MRI scans of a single healthy adult human subject were acquired both at 3 T and 7 T. Representatives from 21 research groups applied their respective manual segmentation protocols to the MRI modalities of their choice. The resulting set of 21 segmentations was analyzed in a common anatomical space to quantify similarity and identify areas of agreement. Results: The differences between the 21 protocols include the region within which segmentation is performed, the set of anatomical labels used, and the extents of specific anatomical labels. The greatest overall disagreement among the protocols is at the CA1/subiculum boundary, and disagreement across all structures is greatest in the anterior portion of the hippocampal formation relative to the body and tail. Conclusions: The combined examination of the 21 protocols in the same dataset suggests possible strategies towards developing a harmonized subfield segmentation protocol and facilitates comparison between published studies.

In addition, it is unclear how the algorithms would perform on previously unseen data, and thus, how they would perform in clinical practice when there is no real opportunity to adapt the algorithm to the data at hand. To address these comparability, generalizability and clinical applicability issues, we organized a grand challenge that aimed to objectively compare algorithms based on a clinically representative multi-center data set. Using clinical practice as the starting point, the goal was to reproduce the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated algorithms for multi-class classification of three diagnostic groups: patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The diagnosis based on clinical criteria was used as reference standard, as it was the best available reference despite its known limitations. For evaluation, a previously unseen test set was used consisting of 354 T1-weighted MRI scans with the diagnoses blinded. Fifteen research teams participated with a total of 29 algorithms. The algorithms were trained on a small training set (n = 30) and optionally on data from other sources (e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging). The best performing algorithm yielded an accuracy of 63.0% and an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 78.8%. In general, the best performances were achieved using feature extraction based on voxel-based morphometry or a combination of features that included volume, cortical thickness, shape and intensity.

Action potentials generating some HFOs are observed in the vicinity of neurons in experimental animals. However electrodes that are remote from neurons, as in case of clinical situations, should not record action potentials. We propose to resolve this question by a realistic simulation of epileptic neuronal network. Methods: The rat dentate gyrus with sclerosis was simulated in silico. We computed the current dipole moment generated by each granule cell and the field potentials in a measurement area far from neurons. Results: The dentate gyrus was stimulated through synaptic input to evoke discharges resembling interictal epileptiform discharges, which had superimposed HFOs <= 295 Hz that were recordable with remote electrodes and represented bursts of action potentials of granule cells. The increase in power of HFOs was associated with the progression of sclerosis, the reduction of GABAergic inhibition, and the increase in cell connectivity. Spectral frequency of HFOs had similar tendencies. Conclusions: HFOs recorded with electrodes remote from neurons could actually be generated by clusters of action potentials. Significance: The phenomenon of action potentials recorded with remote electrodes can possibly extend the clinical meaning of EEG. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In some studies, these abilities are paralleled by an improved understanding of speech in noisy environments, partially due to more robust encoding of speech signals in noise at the level of the brainstem. Little is known about the impact of musicianship on attention-dependent cortical activity related to lexical access during a speech-in-noise task. To address this issue, we presented musicians and nonmusicians with single words mixed with three levels of background noise, across two conditions, while monitoring electrical brain activity. In the active condition, listeners repeated the words aloud, and in the passive condition, they ignored the words and watched a silent film. When background noise was most intense, musicians repeated more words correctly compared with nonmusicians. Auditory evoked responses were attenuated and delayed with the addition of background noise. In musicians, P1 amplitude was marginally enhanced during active listening and was related to task performance in the most difficult listening condition. By comparing ERPs from the active and passive conditions, we isolated an N400 related to lexical access. The amplitude of the N400 was not influenced by the level of background noise in musicians, whereas N400 amplitude increased with the level of background noise in nonmusicians. In nonmusicians, the increase in N400 amplitude was related to a reduction in task performance. In musicians only, there was a rightward shift of the sources contributing to the N400 as the level of background noise increased. This pattern of results supports the hypothesis that encoding of speech in noise is more robust in musicians and suggests that this facilitates lexical access. Moreover, the shift in sources suggests that musicians, to a greater extent than nonmusicians, may increasingly rely on acoustic cues to understand speech in noise.

Chatter detection in this situation is a crucial step for improving surface quality and reducing both noise and rapid wear of the cutting tool. This paper proposes a new methodology for the chatter detection in computer numerical control milling machines. This methodology is based on vibratory signal analysis and artificial intelligence. The methodology consists of five major steps: (1) data acquisition, (2) signal processing, (3) features generation, (4) features selection and (5) classification. As chatter components occur around system resonance frequencies, a multiband resonance filtering method is proposed at the processing step. The process is then followed by envelope analysis. This allows the signal-to-noise ratio to be increased and the sensitivity of generated features to be increased. Extracted features are then ranked based on their entropy in which only best features are selected and presented to the system for classification. At the classification step, the selected features are classified into two classes: stable and unstable utilizing neural networks. Two neural network approaches, radial basis function and multi-layer perceptrons, are tested. The developed approach is applied for chatter detection in a Huron K2X10 milling machine. This approach is tested on a milling machine at different depths of cut and various rotational speeds. Discussions are made and the results confirm the accuracy of the proposed methodology.

(2012) to solve the problem of decoupling the rotational velocities around x and y axes of camera frame in robotic visual servoing systems. Based on these two image features and the other four image features used in previous work Chaumette (IEEE Trans. Robot. 20(4):713-723 2004), the interaction matrix has a maximal decoupled structure and thus the singularity of interaction matrix is avoided in Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS). The analytical form of depth is given by using classical geometrical primitives and image moment invariants. The IBVS Proportional Derivative (PD) controller is then designed and the stability of the controller is proved by using Lyapunov method. The tracking performance is thus enhanced for a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system. Experimental results on the robotic system are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We have previously shown that QRFP-43 (43RFa) and QRFP-26 (26RFa) inhibited isoproterenol (ISO)-induced lipolysis in adipocytes. However, the antilipolytic signaling pathways activated by QRFP peptides have not been investigated. In the present study, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to identify the main pathways involved in QRFP-43 decreasing ISO-induced lipolysis. Our results show that QRFP-43 reduced ISO-induced phosphorylation of perilipin A (PLIN) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) on Ser660 by 43 and 25%, respectively, but increased Akt phosphorylation by 44%. However, the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), a regulator of lipolysis activated by Akt, did not reverse the antilipolytic effect of QRFP-43. PDE3B inhibition reversed the decrease of Ser660 HSL phosphorylation associated with QRFP-43 antilipolytic effect. QRFP-43 also prevented PKC activation and ISO-induced Src kinases activation leading to the inhibition of the caveolin-1 (CAV-1) translocation on lipid droplets. Indeed, QRFP-43 attenuated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced lipolysis and ISO-induced extracellular signal-regulated and Src kinases by 28, 37 and 48%, respectively. The attenuation of ISO-induced lipolysis by QRFP-43 was associated with a decrease of phosphorylated Ser660 HSL, PICA-catalytic (PICA-c) subunit and CAV-1 translocation on lipid droplets by 37,50 and 46%, respectively. The decrease in ISO-induced CAV-1 and PICA-c translocation was associated with a reduction of PLIN phosphorylation by 44% in QRFP-43-treated adipocytes. These results suggest that QRFP-43 attenuated ISO-induced lipolysis by preventing the formation of an active complex on lipid droplets and the activation of Src kinases and PKC.

As most workers will not choose to spend their entire workday walking, this study investigated the short-term delayed effect of treadmill desk usage. An experiment was conducted in which participants either sat or walked while they read a text and received emails. Afterward, all participants performed a task to evaluate their attention and memory. Behavioral, neurophysiological, and perceptual evidence showed that participants who walked had a short-term increase in memory and attention, indicating that the use of a treadmill desk has a delayed effect. These findings suggest that the treadmill desk, in addition to having health benefits for workers, can also be beneficial for businesses by enhancing workforce performance. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We tested the performances of 19 women with "restricting-only" eating syndromes and 27 with "binge-eating/purging" variants on a modified n-back task, and used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine task-induced brain activations in frontal regions of interest. When compared with "binge-eating/purging" participants, "restricting-only" participants showed superior performance. Furthermore, in an intermediate-demand condition, "binge-eating/purging" participants showed significantly less event-related activation than did "restricting-only" participants in a right posterior prefrontal region spanning Brodmann areas 6-8-a region that has been linked to planning of motor responses, working memory for sequential information, and management of uncertainty. Our findings suggest that working memory is poorer in eating-disordered individuals with binge-eating/purging behaviors than in those who solely restrict food intake, and that observed performance differences coincide with interpretable group-based activation differences in a frontal region thought to subserve planning and decision making.

Recently, a new method based on the acoustic startle reflex modification was introduced for tinnitus screening in laboratory animals. This method was enthusiastically adopted and now widely used by many scientists in the field due to its seeming simplicity and a number of advantages over the other methods of tinnitus assessment. Furthermore, this method opened an opportunity for tinnitus assessment in humans as well. Unfortunately, multiple modifications of data collection and interpretation implemented in different labs make comparisons across studies very difficult. In addition, recent animal and human studies have challenged the original "filling-in" interpretation of the paradigm. Here, we review the current literature to emphasize on the commonalities and differences in data collection and interpretation across laboratories that are using this method for tinnitus assessment. We also propose future research directions that could be taken in order to establish whether or not this method is warranted as an indicator of the presence of tinnitus.

Coding stimulus amplitude by correlated neural activity	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; SPEECH RECOGNITION; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; 2ND-ORDER MOTION; NEURONS; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; ENVELOPE; SYSTEM; MECHANISMS	While correlated activity is observed ubiquitously in the brain, its role in neural coding has remained controversial. Recent experimental results have demonstrated that correlated but not single-neuron activity can encode the detailed time course of the instantaneous amplitude (i.e., envelope) of a stimulus. These have furthermore demonstrated that such coding required and was optimal for a nonzero level of neural variability. However, a theoretical understanding of these results is still lacking. Here we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework explaining these experimental findings. Specifically, we use linear response theory to derive an expression relating the correlation coefficient to the instantaneous stimulus amplitude, which takes into account key single-neuron properties such as firing rate and variability as quantified by the coefficient of variation. The theoretical prediction was in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of various integrate-and-fire type neuron models for various parameter values. Further, we demonstrate a form of stochastic resonance as optimal coding of stimulus variance by correlated activity occurs for a nonzero value of noise intensity. Thus, our results provide a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon by which correlated but not single-neuron activity can code for stimulus amplitude and how key single-neuron properties such as firing rate and variability influence such coding. Correlation coding by correlated but not single-neuron activity is thus predicted to be a ubiquitous feature of sensory processing for neurons responding to weak input.

RODS Study Cooperative	Personalized versus standardized dosing strategies for the treatment of childhood amblyopia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial	Trials			English	Article						amblyopia; child; occlusion therapy; personalized dosing strategy; randomized clinical trial; standardized dosing strategy; total effective dose; visual acuity	THERAPY; OCCLUSION; BRAIN	Background: Amblyopia is the commonest visual disorder of childhood in Western societies, affecting, predominantly, spatial visual function. Treatment typically requires a period of refractive correction ('optical treatment') followed by occlusion: covering the nonamblyopic eye with a fabric patch for varying daily durations. Recent studies have provided insight into the optimal amount of patching ('dose'), leading to the adoption of standardized dosing strategies, which, though an advance on previous ad-hoc regimens, take little account of individual patient characteristics. This trial compares the effectiveness of a standardized dosing strategy (that is, a fixed daily occlusion dose based on disease severity) with a personalized dosing strategy (derived from known treatment dose-response functions), in which an initially prescribed occlusion dose is modulated, in a systematic manner, dependent on treatment compliance. Methods/design: A total of 120 children aged between 3 and 8 years of age diagnosed with amblyopia in association with either anisometropia or strabismus, or both, will be randomized to receive either a standardized or a personalized occlusion dose regimen. To avoid confounding by the known benefits of refractive correction, participants will not be randomized until they have completed an optical treatment phase. The primary study objective is to determine whether, at trial endpoint, participants receiving a personalized dosing strategy require fewer hours of occlusion than those in receipt of a standardized dosing strategy. Secondary objectives are to quantify the relationship between observed changes in visual acuity (logMAR, logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution) with age, amblyopia type, and severity of amblyopic visual acuity deficit. Discussion: This is the first randomized controlled trial of occlusion therapy for amblyopia to compare a treatment arm representative of current best practice with an arm representative of an entirely novel treatment regimen based on statistical modelling of previous trial outcome data. Should the personalized dosing strategy demonstrate superiority over the standardized dosing strategy, then its adoption into routine practice could bring practical benefits in reducing the duration of treatment needed to achieve an optimal outcome.

Reproducibility of neuroimaging analyses across operating systems	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						reproducibility; operating systems; Freesurfer; CIVET; FSL	BRAIN	Neuroimaging pipelines are known to generate different results depending on the computing platform where they are compiled and executed. We quantify these differences for brain tissue classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness (CT) extraction, using three of the main neuroimaging packages (FSL, Freesurfer and GIVE I) and different versions of GNU/Linux. We also identify some causes of these differences using library and system call interception. We find that these packages use mathematical functions based on single -precision floating-point arithmetic whose implementations in operating systems continue to evolve. While these differences have little or no impact on simple analysis pipelines such as brain extraction and cortical tissue classification, their accumulation creates important differences in longer pipelines such as subcortical tissue classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness extraction. With FSL, most Dice coefficients between subcortical classifications obtained on different operating systems remain above 0.9, but values as low as 0.59 are observed. Independent component analyses (ICA) of fMRI data differ between operating systems in one third of the tested subjects, due to differences in motion correction. With Freesurfer and CIVET, in some brain regions we find an effect of build or operating system on cortical thickness. A first step to correct these reproducibility issues would be to use more precise representations of floating-point numbers in the critical sections of the pipelines. The numerical stability of pipelines should also be reviewed.

Indeed, the existence of age-related compensatory mechanisms allow for some cognitive preservation. This paper attempts to coherently review the existing concepts of neurofunctional compensation when applied to two different cognitive domains, namely executive function and language processing. More precisely, we explore the Cognitive reserve (CR) model in healthy aging as well as its two underlying mechanisms: neural reserve and neural compensation. Furthermore, we review the Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis as well as the Growing Of Life Differences Explains Normal Aging model. Finally, we propose, based on some functional neuroimaging studies, the existence of another compensatory mechanism characterized by age-related delayed cerebral activation allowing for cognitive performance to be preserved at the expense of speed processing: the Temporal Hypothesis for Compensation.

Different methods have explored ways to impede and inhibit amyloid aggregation. Most attempts in the literature involve applying stress to the environment around amyloids. Varying pH levels, modifying temperature, applying pressure through protein crowding and ligand docking are classical examples of these methods. However, environmental stress usually affects molecular pathways and protein functions in the cell and is challenging to construct in vivo. In this paper, we explore destabilizing amyloid proteins through the manipulation of genetic code to create beneficial substitute molecules for patients with certain deficiencies. Results: To unravel sequence mutations that destabilize amyloid fibrils yet simultaneously conserve native fold, we analyze the structural landscape of amyloid proteins and search for potential areas that could be exploited to weaken aggregation. Our tool, FibrilMutant, analyzes these regions and studies the effect of amino acid point mutations on nucleation and aggregation. This multiple objective approach impedes aggregation without stressing the cellular environment. We identified six main regions in amyloid proteins that contribute to structural stability and generated amino acid mutations to destabilize those regions. Full length fibrils were built from the mutated amyloid monomers and a dipolar-solvent model capturing the effect of dipole-dipole interactions between water and very large molecular systems to assess their aqueous stability was used to generate energy plots. Conclusion: Our results are in agreement with experimental studies and suggest novel targeted single point mutations in the Amylin protein, potentially creating a better therapeutic agent than the currently administered Pramlintide drug for diabetes patients.

However, in most cases, significant responses to other complex stimuli, particularly human voice, were also observed. Thus, it remains unknown if the same neurons respond to both stimulus types, albeit with different strengths, or whether the responses observed with fMRI are generated by distinct, overlapping neural populations. To address this question, we conducted an fMRI experiment in which short music excerpts and human vocalizations were presented in a pseudo-random order. Critically, we performed an adaptation-based analysis in which responses to the stimuli were analyzed taking into account the category of the preceding stimulus. Our results confirm the presence of a region in the anterior STG that responds more strongly to music than voice. Moreover, we found a music-specific adaptation effect in this area, consistent with the existence of music-preferred neurons. Lack of differences between musicians and non-musicians argues against an expertise effect. These findings provide further support for neural separability between music and speech within the temporal lobe. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: In total, 294 individuals aged 60 and over participated in the cognitive vitality promotion program immediately for the experimental group or one year later for the controls. They were evaluated using cognitive tests, questionnaires (MoCA, MIA, CVLT, RBMT, MMQ, QAA, Stroop) and PA instruments (an adapted version of the CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire and the 2-minute step test). Correlations were made at the start of the study and multiple regressions were carried out to measure the impact of the program on PA. Results: Participation in the program was associated with an increase in PA (p< 0.05). However, analyses did not show a significant moderating or mediating effect of PA on cognition (p< 0.05). At the start of the study, the most active subjects obtained better results in terms of memory strategies (p< 0.05). Conclusions: These results show that a multifactorial program, including the promotion of PA, can lead participants to become more physically active. Further studies should be implemented to determine whether the practice of PA has a moderating or mediating effect on cognitive vitality. Copyright: (C) 2015 Desgagnes-Cyr et al.

When an astronaut transitions to microgravity or returns to earth, the vestibular input arising from self-motion will not match the brain's expectation. Our recent neurophysiological studies have provided insight into how the nervous system rapidly reorganizes when vestibular input becomes unreliable by both (1) updating its internal model of the sensory consequences of motion and (2) up-weighting more reliable extra-vestibular information. These neural strategies, in turn, are linked to improvements in sensorimotor performance (e.g., gaze and postural stability, locomotion, orienting) and perception characterized by similar time courses. We suggest that furthering our understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie sensorimotor adaptation will have important implications for optimizing training programs for astronauts before and after space exploration missions and for the design of goal-oriented rehabilitation for patients.

The purpose of this study was to determine the factors influencing older MS patients' decision to undergo the procedure in order to develop more specific and targeted health information. Methods: We performed secondary analysis of data collected as part of the 'Canadian Survey of Health Lifestyle and Aging with MS' from people over the age of 55 years with MS symptoms for 20 or more years. The survey consisted of self-reported information on impairments, disability, participation, demographics, personal and environmental factors. In order to compare respondents who underwent the procedure to those who did not and to develop a predictive model, we created a comparison group using a case-control algorithm, controlling for age, gender and education, and matching procedure cases to controls 1:3. We used multivariate stepwise least likelihood regression of 'a priori' variables to determine predictive factors. Results: The prevalence of the 'liberation' procedure in our sample was 12.8% (95/743), substantially lower than reported in previous studies of complementary/alternative treatments in MS. The predictive model contained five factors; living alone (Odds ratio 0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.63), diagnosis of anxiety (Odds ratio 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 - 0.84), rating of neurologist's helpfulness (Odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 - 0.71), Body Mass Index (Odds ratio 0.93, 95% CI, 0.89 - 0.98) and perceived physical impact of MS (Odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.04). Conclusions: Predictive factors differed from previous studies of complementary/alternative treatment use likely due to both the invasiveness of the procedure and the advanced age of our study cohort. Our findings suggest that health professionals should target information on the risks and benefits of unregulated procedures to those patients who feel dissatisfied with their neurologist and they should include family members in discussions since they may be providing the logistical support to travel abroad and undergo the 'liberation' procedure. Our findings may be applicable to others with chronic disabling conditions who contemplate the user-pay unregulated invasive procedures available to them.

Embodied cognition of aging	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						embodiment; aging; dementia; sensory-motor processing; Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson disease	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DISCONNECTION SYNDROME; OLDER-ADULTS; MULTISENSORY STIMULATION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; STRONG CONNECTION; SENSORY ACUITY; RISK-FACTORS; IMPAIRMENT	Embodiment is revolutionizing the way we consider cognition by incorporating the influence of our body and of the current context within cognitive processing. A growing number of studies which support this view of cognition in young adults stands in stark contrast with the lack of evidence in favor of this view in the field of normal aging and neurocognitive disorders. Nonetheless, the validation of embodiment assumptions on the whole spectrum of cognition is a mandatory step in order for embodied cognition theories to become theories of human cognition. More pragmatically, aging populations represent a perfect target to test embodied cognition theories due to concomitant changes in sensory, motor and cognitive functioning that occur in aging, since these theories predict direct interactions between them. Finally, the new perspectives on cognition provided by these theories might also open new research avenues and new clinical applications in the field of aging. The present article aims at showing the value and interest to explore embodiment in normal and abnormal aging as well as introducing some potential theoretical and clinical applications.

Trade-Off in the Sound Localization Abilities of Early Blind Individuals between the Horizontal and Vertical Planes	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						azimuth; blindness; sound localization; vertical	SPECTRAL CUES; MONAURAL LOCALIZATION; PREDICTS PERFORMANCE; SAGITTAL PLANE; HUMANS; DEFICIT; CORTEX	There is substantial evidence that sensory deprivation leads to important cross-modal brain reorganization that is paralleled by enhanced perceptual abilities. However, it remains unclear how widespread these enhancements are, and whether they are intercorrelated or arise at the expense of other perceptual abilities. One specific area where such a trade-off might arise is that of spatial hearing, where blind individuals have been shown to possess superior monaural localization abilities in the horizontal plane, but inferior localization abilities in the vertical plane. While both of these tasks likely involve the use of monaural cues due to the absence of any relevant binaural signal, there is currently no proper explanation for this discrepancy, nor has any study investigated both sets of abilities in the same sample of blind individuals. Here, we assess whether the enhancements observed in the horizontal plane are related to the deficits observed in the vertical plane by testing sound localization in both planes in groups of blind and sighted persons. Our results show that the blind individuals who displayed the highest accuracy at localizing sounds monaurally in the horizontal plane are also the ones who exhibited the greater deficit when localizing in the vertical plane. These findings appear to argue against the idea of generalized perceptual enhancements in the early blind, and instead suggest the possibility of a trade-off in the localization proficiency between the two auditory spatial planes, such that learning to use monaural cues for the horizontal plane comes at the expense of using those cues to localize in the vertical plane.

Brain function impairments have been identified in this disorder, mainly in the frontal and posterior cortical regions. However, the anatomical support for these dysfunctions remains poorly understood. We investigated gray matter thickness, gray matter volume, and white matter integrity in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Twenty-four patients with polysomnography-confirmed idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and 42 healthy individuals underwent a 3-tesla structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging examination using corticometry, voxel-based morphometry, and diffusion tensor imaging. In the patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, decreased cortical thickness was observed in the frontal cortex, the lingual gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus. Gray matter volume was reduced in the superior frontal sulcus only. Patients showed no increased gray matter thickness or volume. Diffusion tensor imaging analyses revealed no significant white matter differences between groups. Using corticometry in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, several new cortical regions with gray matter alterations were identified, similar to those reported in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease. These findings provide some anatomical support for previously identified brain function impairments in this disorder.

Conditioned same-sex partner preference in male rats is facilitated by oxytocin and dopamine: Effect on sexually dimorphic brain nuclei	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Conditioning; Homosexual; Partner preference; Sex; Quinpirole	FEMALE PRAIRIE VOLES; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; PENILE ERECTION; MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER; HOMOSEXUAL-MEN; JUVENILE PLAY; MALE FERRETS; BEHAVIOR; HYPOTHALAMUS	Conditioned same-sex partner preference can develop in male rats that undergo cohabitation under the effects of quinpirole (QNP, D2 agonist). Herein, we assessed the development of conditioned same-sex social/sexual preference in males that received either nothing, saline, QNP, oxytocin (OT), or QNP + OT during cohabitation with another male (+) or single-caged (). This resulted in the following groups: (1) Intact, (2) Saline+, (3) QNP, (4) OT, (5) QNP+, (6) OT+ and (7) QNP/OT+. Cohabitation occurred during 24 h in a clean cage with a male partner that bore almond scent on the back as conditioned stimulus. This was repeated every 4 days for a total of three trials. Social and sexual preference were assessed four days after the last conditioning trial in a drug-free test in which experimental males chose between the scented familiar male and a novel sexually receptive female. Results showed that males from groups Intact, Saline+, QNP and OT displayed a clear preference for the female (opposite-sex), whereas groups QNP+, OT+ and QNP/OT+ displayed socio/sexual preference for the male partner (same-sex). In Experiment 2, the brains were processed for Nissl dye and the area size of two sexually dimorphic nuclei (SDN-POA and SON) was compared between groups. Males from groups OT, OT+ and QNP/OT+ expressed a smaller SDN-POA and groups QNP+ and QNP/OT+ expressed a larger SON. Accordingly, conditioned same-sex social/sexual partner preference can develop during cohabitation under enhanced D2 or OT activity but such preference does not depend on the area size of those sexually dimorphic nuclei.

Information is lacking about mercury methylation (K-m) and demethylation (K-d) rates in periphytic biofilms from the Northern Hemisphere, as well as about the drivers of net MeHg production, hampering ecosystem modeling of Hg cycling. Mercury methylation and demethylation rates were measured in periphytic biofilms growing on submerged plants in a shallow fluvial lake located in a temperate cold region (St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada). Incubations were performed in situ within macrophyte beds using low-level spikes of (HgO)-Hg-199 and (MeHg)-Hg-200 stable isotopes as tracers. A direct relationship was observed between Km (0.002 to 0.137 d(-1)) and [MeHg] in periphyton. A similar relationship was found between K-d (0.096 to 0334 d(-1)) and [inorganic Hg]. Periphyton of Lake St. Pierre reached high levels of net MeHg production that were two orders of magnitude higher than those found in local sediment. This production varied through the plant growing season and was mainly driven by environmental variables such as depth of growth, available light, dissolved oxygen, temperature, plant community structure, and productivity of the habitat.

Convergent Differential Regulation of SLIT-ROBO Axon Guidance Genes in the Brains of Vocal Learners	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						songbird; parrot; hummingbird; neural connectivity; axon guidance; vocal learning	MELOPSITTACUS-UNDULATUS; CONTROL PATHWAYS; NEURAL PATHWAYS; ZEBRA FINCHES; BIRDS; ORGANIZATION; LANGUAGE; COMMUNICATION; BUDGERIGARS; FOREBRAIN	Only a few distantly related mammals and birds have the trait of complex vocal learning, which is the ability to imitate novel sounds. This ability is critical for speech acquisition and production in humans, and is attributed to specialized forebrain vocal control circuits that have several unique connections relative to adjacent brain circuits. As a result, it has been hypothesized that there could exist convergent changes in genes involved in neural connectivity of vocal learning circuits. In support of this hypothesis, expanding on our related study (Pfenning et al. [2014] Science 346: 1256846), here we show that the forebrain part of this circuit that makes a relatively rare direct connection to brainstem vocal motor neurons in independent lineages of vocal learning birds (songbird, parrot, and hummingbird) has specialized regulation of axon guidance genes from the SLIT-ROBO molecular pathway. The SLIT1 ligand was differentially downregulated in the motor song output nucleus that makes the direct projection, whereas its receptor ROBO1 was developmentally upregulated during critical periods for vocal learning. Vocal nonlearning bird species and male mice, which have much more limited vocal plasticity and associated circuits, did not show comparable specialized regulation of SLIT-ROBO genes in their nonvocal motor cortical regions. These findings are consistent with SLIT and ROBO gene dysfunctions associated with autism, dyslexia, and speech sound language disorders and suggest that convergent evolution of vocal learning was associated with convergent changes in the SLIT-ROBO axon guidance pathway.

Coding of envelopes by correlated but not single-neuron activity requires neural variability	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						correlation; envelope; electrosensory; vestibular; neural coding	ELECTROSENSORY NEURONS; SELF-MOTION; HAIR-CELLS; NOISE; RESPONSES; INFORMATION; STATISTICS; AFFERENTS; DYNAMICS; SOUNDS	Understanding how the brain processes sensory information is often complicated by the fact that neurons exhibit trial-to-trial variability in their responses to stimuli. Indeed, the role of variability in sensory coding is still highly debated. Here, we examined how variability influences neural responses to naturalistic stimuli consisting of a fast time-varying waveform (i.e., carrier or first order) whose amplitude (i.e., envelope or second order) varies more slowly. Recordings were made from fish electrosensory and monkey vestibular sensory neurons. In both systems, we show that correlated but not single-neuron activity can provide detailed information about second-order stimulus features. Using a simple mathematical model, we made the strong prediction that such correlation-based coding of envelopes requires neural variability. Strikingly, the performance of correlated activity at predicting the envelope was similarly optimally tuned to a nonzero level of variability in both systems, thereby confirming this prediction. Finally, we show that second-order sensory information can only be decoded if one takes into account joint statistics when combining neural activities. Our results thus show that correlated but not single-neural activity can transmit information about the envelope, that such transmission requires neural variability, and that this information can be decoded. We suggest that envelope coding by correlated activity is a general feature of sensory processing that will be found across species and systems.

Predicting the impending seizures in these patients could significantly enhance their quality of life if the prediction performance is clinically practical. In this study, we investigate the improvement of the performance of a seizure prediction algorithm in 17 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy by means of a novel measure. Scale-free dynamics of the intracerebral EEG are quantified through robust estimates of the scaling exponents-the first cumulants-derived from a wavelet leader and bootstrap based multifractal analysis. The cumulants are investigated for the discriminability between preictal and interictal epochs. The performance of our recently published patient-specific seizure prediction algorithm is then out-of-sample tested on long-lasting data using combinations of cumulants and state similarity measures previously introduced. By using the first cumulant in combination with state similarity measures, up to 13 of 17 patients had seizures predicted above chance with clinically practical levels of sensitivity (80.5%) and specificity (25.1% of total time under warning) for prediction horizons above 25 min. These results indicate that the scale-free dynamics of the preictal state are different from those of the interictal state. Quantifiers of these dynamics may carry a predictive power that can be used to improve seizure prediction performance.

The verbal difficulties of children with SLI have been largely documented, and a growing number of studies suggest that these children may also have difficulties in processing non-verbal complex auditory stimuli (Corriveau et al., 2007: Brandt et al., 2012). In a recent study, we reported that a large proportion of children with SLI present deficits in music perception (Planchou et al., under revision). Little is known, however, about the singing abilities of children with SLI. In order to investigate whether or not the impairments in expressive language extend to the musical domain, we assessed singing abilities in eight children with SLI and 15 children with Typical Language Development (TLD) matched for age and non-verbal intelligence. To this aim, we designed a ludic activity consisting of two singing tasks: a pitch-matching and a melodic reproduction task. In the pitch-matching task, the children were requested to sing single notes. In the melodic reproduction task, children were asked to sing short melodies that were either familiar (FAM-SONG and FAM-TUNE conditions) or unfamiliar (UNFAM-TUNE condition). The analysis showed that children with SLI were impaired in the pitch-matching task, with a mean pitch error of 250 cents (mean pitch error for children with TLD: 154 cents). In the melodic reproduction task, we asked 30 healthy adults to rate the quality of the sung productions of the children on a continuous rating scale. The results revealed that singing of children with SLI received lower mean ratings than the children with TLD. Our findings thus indicate that children with SLI showed impairments in musical production and are discussed in light of a general auditory-motor dysfunction in children with SLI.

Here, using both transformed cell lines and primary neurons, we investigated the functional impact of this disruption in SG dynamics. While stress-induced translational repression and recruitment of key SG proteins was undisturbed, depletion of G3BP1 or its upstream regulator TDP-43 disturbed normal interactions between SGs and processing bodies (PBs). This was concomitant with decreased SG size, reduced SGPB docking, and impaired preservation of polyadenylated mRNA. Reintroduction of G3BP1 alone was sufficient to rescue all of these phenotypes, indicating that G3BP1 is essential for normal SG-PB interactions and SG function.

Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement(2), learning, memory(3) and motivation(4), and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease(5). To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume(5) and intracranial volume(6). These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 X 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.

The firing of brain-wide-projecting LH neurons releases neuropeptides promoting wakefulness (orexin/hypocretin; OH), or sleep (melanin-concentrating hormone; MCH). OH neurons, which coexpress glutamate and dynorphin, have been proposed to excite their neighbors, including MCH neurons, suggesting that LH may sometimes coengage its antagonistic outputs. However, it remains unclear if, when, and how OH actions promote temporal separation of the sleep and wake signals, a process that fails in narcolepsy caused by OH loss. To explore this directly, we paired optogenetic stimulation of OH cells (at rates that promoted awakening in vivo) with electrical monitoring of MCH cells in mouse brain slices. Membrane potential recordings showed that OH cell firing inhibited action potential firing in most MCH neurons, an effect that required GABA(A) but not dynorphin receptors. Membrane current analysis showed that OH cell firing increased the frequency of fast GABAergic currents in MCH cells, an effect blocked by antagonists of OH but not dynorphin or glutamate receptors, and mimicked by bath-applied OH peptide. In turn, neural network imaging with a calcium indicator genetically targeted to MCH neurons showed that excitation by bath-applied OH peptides occurs in a minority of MCH cells. Collectively, our data provide functional microcircuit evidence that intra-LH feedforward loops may facilitate appropriate switching between sleep and wake signals, potentially preventing sleep disorders.

The Increased Sensitivity of Irregular Peripheral Canal and Otolith Vestibular Afferents Optimizes their Encoding of Natural Stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						natural stimuli; optimal coding; sensitivity; vestibular afferent	SELF-MOTION; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; NERVE AFFERENTS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEMS; INNERVATION PATTERNS; DETECTION THRESHOLDS; SEMICIRCULAR CANALS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; HEAD ROTATIONS	Efficient processing of incoming sensory input is essential for an organism's survival. A growing body of evidence suggests that sensory systems have developed coding strategies that are constrained by the statistics of the natural environment. Consequently, it is necessary to first characterize neural responses to natural stimuli to uncover the coding strategies used by a given sensory system. Here we report for the first time the statistics of vestibular rotational and translational stimuli experienced by rhesus monkeys during natural (e.g., walking, grooming) behaviors. We find that these stimuli can reach intensities as high as 1500 deg/s and 8 G. Recordings from afferents during naturalistic rotational and linear motion further revealed strongly nonlinear responses in the form of rectification and saturation, which could not be accurately predicted by traditional linear models of vestibular processing. Accordingly, we used linear-nonlinear cascade models and found that these could accurately predict responses to naturalistic stimuli. Finally, we tested whether the statistics of natural vestibular signals constrain the neural coding strategies used by peripheral afferents. We found that both irregular otolith and semicircular canal afferents, because of their higher sensitivities, were more optimized for processing natural vestibular stimuli as compared with their regular counterparts. Our results therefore provide the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that the neural coding strategies used by the vestibular system are matched to the statistics of natural stimuli.

Maternal depression is associated with DNA methylation changes in cord blood T lymphocytes and adult hippocampi	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; RECEPTOR GENE NR3C1; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; POSTNATAL DEPRESSION; REGULATORY ELEMENTS; DSM-IV; PREGNANCY; SCALE; LIFE	Depression affects 10-15% of pregnant women and has been associated with preterm delivery and later developmental, behavioural and learning disabilities. We tested the hypothesis that maternal depression is associated with DNA methylation alterations in maternal T lymphocytes, neonatal cord blood T lymphocytes and adult offspring hippocampi. Genome-wide DNA methylation of CD3+ T lymphocytes isolated from 38 antepartum maternal and 44 neonatal cord blood samples were analyzed using Illumina Methylation 450 K microarrays. Previously obtained methylation data sets using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and array-hybridization of 62 postmortem hippocampal samples of adult males were re-analyzed to test associations with history of maternal depression. We found 145 (false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05) and 2520 (FDR q < 0.1) differentially methylated CG-sites in cord blood T lymphocytes of neonates from the maternal depression group as compared with the control group. However, no significant DNA methylation differences were detected in the antepartum maternal T lymphocytes of our preliminary data set. We also detected 294 differentially methylated probes (FDR q < 0.1) in hippocampal samples associated with history of maternal depression. We observed a significant overlap (P = 0.002) of 33 genes with changes in DNA methylation in T lymphocytes of neonates and brains of adult offspring. Many of these genes are involved in immune system functions. Our results show that DNA methylation changes in offspring associated with maternal depression are detectable at birth in the immune system and persist to adulthood in the brain. This is consistent with the hypothesis that system-wide epigenetic changes are involved in life-long responses to maternal depression in the offspring.

J	Gilbert, AC; Boucher, VJ; Jemel, B				Gilbert, Annie C.; Boucher, Victor J.; Jemel, Boutheina			The perceptual chunking of speech: A demonstration using ERPs	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Chunking; Perceptual chunking; ERP; Positive shifts; Speech processing; Short-term memory; Grouping effects; Domain-general processes; Prosody	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; IMMEDIATE RECALL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ACTION SEQUENCES; BASAL GANGLIA; SEGMENTATION; ORGANIZATION; CAPACITY; STRESS	In tasks involving the learning of verbal or non-verbal sequences, groupings are spontaneously produced. These groupings are generally marked by a lengthening of final elements and have been attributed to a domain-general perceptual chunking linked to working memory. Yet, no study has shown how this domain-general chunking applies to speech processing, partly because of the traditional view that chunking involves a conceptual recoding of meaningful verbal items like words (Miller, 1956). The present study provides a demonstration of the perceptual chunking of speech by way of two experiments using evoked Positive Shifts (PSs), which capture on-line neural responses to marks of various groups. We observed listeners' response to utterances (Experiment 1) and meaningless series of syllables (Experiment 2) containing changing intonation and temporal marks, while also examining how these marks affect the recognition of heard items. The results show that, across conditions and irrespective of the presence of meaningful items PSs are specifically evoked by groups marked by lengthening. Moreover, this on-line detection of marks corresponds to characteristic grouping effects on listeners' immediate recognition of heard items, which suggests chunking effects linked to working memory. These findings bear out a perceptual chunking of speech input in terms of groups marked by lengthening, which constitute the defining marks of a domain-general chunking. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Capturing the Voice of Practitioners: A Modified Delphi Process	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INAPPROPRIATE MEDICATION USE; OLDER-ADULTS; REDUCE POLYPHARMACY; BENZODIAZEPINE USE; THERAPY; PEOPLE; TRIALS; AGE; APPROPRIATENESS; OVERDIAGNOSIS	Polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use among older adults contribute to adverse drug reactions, falls, cognitive impairment, noncompliance, hospitalization and mortality. While deprescribing - tapering, reducing or stopping a medication - is feasible and relatively safe, clinicians find it difficult to carry out. Deprescribing guidelines would facilitate this process. The aim of this paper is to identify and prioritize medication classes where evidence-based deprescribing guidelines would be of benefit to clinicians. A modified Delphi approach included a literature review to identify potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly, an expert panel to develop survey content and three survey rounds to seek consensus on priorities. Panel participants included three pharmacists, two family physicians and one social scientist. Sixty-five Canadian geriatrics experts (36 pharmacists, 19 physicians and 10 nurse practitioners) participated in the survey. Twenty-nine drugs/drug classes were included in the first survey with 14 reaching the required (>= 70%) level of consensus, and 2 new drug classes added from qualitative comments. Fifty-three participants completed round two, and 47 participants completed round three. The final five priorities were benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, statins, tricyclic antidepressants, and proton pump inhibitors; nine other drug classes were also identified as being in need of evidence-based deprescribing guidelines. The Delphi consensus process identified five priority drug classes for which expert clinicians felt guidance is needed for deprescribing. The classes of drugs that emerged strongly from the rankings dealt with mental health, cardiovascular, gastroenterological, and neurological conditions. The results suggest that deprescribing and overtreatment occurs through the full spectrum of primary care, and that evidence-based deprescribing guidelines are a priority in the care of the elderly.

In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed Austria (the "Anschluss") and the three-time decorated war veteran Gerstmann was dismissed from his professorship in Vienna because of his "race." In 1942, he unknowingly had his doctorate stripped, only to have it returned in 1955. The Gerstmann properties were seized in Vienna, resulting in a bitter postwar reclamation battle. Gerstmann immigrated to the United States quickly after the annexation and had some success in exile but never again directed a hospital. He maintained a private practice throughout his exile and, in the 1940s, had some research and consulting positions in New York. More than 75 years after the Anschluss, many questions remain unanswered about Gerstmann's forced exile and the impact of becoming a refugee on his life and career.

Yet, little is known on the temporal course of the brain processes that decode the category of sounds and how the expertise in one sound category can impact these processes. To address this question, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 15 musicians and 18 non-musicians while they were listening to short musical excerpts (piano and violin) and vocal stimuli (speech and non-linguistic vocalizations). The task of the participants was to detect noise targets embedded within the stream of sounds. Event-related potentials revealed an early differentiation of sound category, within the first 100 ms after the onset of the sound, with mostly increased responses to musical sounds. Importantly, this effect was modulated by the musical background of participants, as musicians were more responsive to music sounds than non-musicians, consistent with the notion that musical training increases sensitivity to music. In late temporal windows, brain responses were enhanced in response to vocal stimuli, but musicians were still more responsive to music. These results shed new light on the temporal course of neural dynamics of auditory processing and reveal how it is impacted by the stimulus category and the expertise of participants. (C) 2015 IBRO.

The kynurenine pathway is at the crossroads of metabolism and immunity and plays an important role in inflammation while also playing an opposing role in the control of acute and chronic infections. In this review we have summarized findings from recent studies reporting modulation of tryptophan degrading the kynurenine pathway in the context of HIV infection. This immuno-metabolic pathway is modulated by three distinct inducible enzymes: indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. Increased expression of these enzymes by antigen-presenting cells leads to local or systemic tryptophan depletion, resulting in a mechanism of defense against certain microorganisms. Conversely, it can also lead to immunosuppression by antigen-specific T-cell exhaustion and recruitment of T regulatory cells. Recently, among these enzymes, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 has been recognized to be an immune response checkpoint that plays an important role in HIV immune dysfunction, even in the context of antiretroviral therapy. In addition to the activation of the kynurenine pathway by HIV proteins Tat and Nef, the tryptophan-degrading bacteria present in the intestinal flora have been associated with dysfunction of gut mucosal CD4 Th17/Th22 cells, leading to microbial translocation and creating a systemic kynurenine pathway activation cycle. This self-sustaining feedback loop has deleterious effects on disease progression and on neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected patients. Therapy designed to break the vicious cycle of induced tryptophan degradation is warranted to revert immune exhaustion in HIV-infected persons.

Paw-Dragging: a Novel, Sensitive Analysis of the Mouse Cylinder Test	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 98; Neuroscience; Medicine; brain; behavioural testing; mouse; cylinder test; focal ischemic stroke; forelimb motor cortex	MOTOR CORTEX STROKE; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; ENDOTHELIN-1; RATS; ISCHEMIA; INJURY; MICE	The cylinder test is routinely used to predict focal ischemic damage to the forelimb motor cortex in rodents. When placed in the cylinder, rodents explore by rearing and touching the walls of the cylinder with their forelimb paws for postural support. Following ischemic injury to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex, rats rely more heavily on their unaffected forelimb paw for postural support resulting in fewer touches with their affected paw which is termed forelimb asymmetry. In contrast, focal ischemic damage in the mouse brain fails to result in comparable consistent deficits in forelimb asymmetry. While forelimb asymmetry deficits are infrequently observed, mice do demonstrate a novel behaviour post stroke termed "paw-dragging". Paw-dragging is the tendency for a mouse to drag its affected paw along the cylinder wall rather than directly push off from the wall when dismounting from a rear to a four-legged stance. We have previously demonstrated that paw-dragging behaviour is highly sensitive to small cortical ischemic injuries to the forelimb motor cortex. Here we provide a detailed protocol for paw-dragging analysis. We define what a paw-drag is and demonstrate how to quantify paw-dragging behaviour. The cylinder test is a simple and inexpensive test to administer and does not require pre-training or food deprivation strategies. In using paw-dragging analysis with the cylinder test, it fills a niche for predicting cortical ischemic injuries such as photothrombosis and Endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced ischemia - two models that are ever-increasing in popularity and produce smaller focal injuries than middle cerebral artery occlusion. Finally, measuring paw-dragging behaviour in the cylinder test will allow studies of functional recovery after cortical injury using a wide cohort of transgenic mouse strains where previous forelimb asymmetry analysis has failed to detect consistent deficits.

Genes which have been implicated in autosomal-recessive PD include PARK2 which codes for parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in a variety of cellular activities. In this study, we compared parkin-mutant primary fibroblasts, from a patient with parkin compound heterozygous mutations, to healthy control cells. Western blot analysis of proteins obtained from patient's fibroblasts showed quantitative differences of many proteins involved in the cytoskeleton organization with respect to control cells. These molecular alterations are accompanied by changes in the organization of actin stress fibers and biomechanical properties, as revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and atomic force microscopy. In particular, parkin deficiency is associated with a significant increase of Young's modulus of null-cells in comparison to normal fibroblasts. The current study proposes that parkin influences the spatial organization of actin filaments, the shape of human fibroblasts, and their elastic response to an external applied force.

Retinal Ganglion Cell Loss and Mild Vasculopathy in Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase (Mthfr)-Deficient Mice: A Model of Mild Hyperhomocysteinemia	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						methylation pathway; homocysteine; retina; retinal degeneration; ERG; mouse	CYSTATHIONINE-BETA-SYNTHASE; METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE; PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE; MACULAR DEGENERATION; DIABETES-MELLITUS; VEIN OCCLUSION; MUTANT MICE; MOUSE; COMPLICATIONS; FOLATE	PURPOSE. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr) is a key enzyme in homocysteine-methionine metabolism. We investigated Mthfr expression in retina and asked whether mild hyperhomocysteinemia, due to Mthfr deficiency, alters retinal neurovascular structure and function. METHODS. Expression of Mthfr was investigated at the gene and protein level using quantitative (q) RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Mthfr(+/-) and Mthfr(+/-) mice were subjected to comprehensive evaluation using ERG, funduscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), HPLC, and morphometric and IHC analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at 8 to 24 weeks. RESULTS. Gene and protein analyses disclosed widespread retinal expression of Mthfr. Electroretinography (ERG) revealed a significant decrease in positive scotopic threshold response in retinas of Mthfr(+/-) mice at 24 weeks. Fundus examination in mice from both groups was normal; FA revealed areas of focal vascular leakage in 20% of Mthfr(+/-) mice at 12 to 16 weeks and 60% by 24 weeks. The SD-OCT revealed a significant decrease in nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness at 24 weeks in Mthfr(+/-) compared to Mthfr(+/-) mice. There was a 2-fold elevation in retinal hey at 24 weeks in Mthfr(+/-) mice by HPLC and IHC. Morphometric analysis revealed an approximately 20% reduction in cells in the ganglion cell layer of Mthfr(+/-) mice at 24 weeks. The IHC indicated significantly increased GFAP labeling suggestive of Muller cell activation. CONCLUSIONS. Mildly hyperhomocysteinemic Mthfr(+/-) mice demonstrate reduced ganglion cell function, thinner NFL, and mild vasculopathy by 24 weeks. The retinal phenotype is similar to that of hyperhomocysteinemic mice with deficiency of cystathionine-beta-synthase (Cbs) reported earlier. The data support the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia may be causative in certain retinal neurovasculopathies.

J	Salami, P; Levesque, M; Gotman, J; Avoli, M				Salami, Pariya; Levesque, Maxime; Gotman, Jean; Avoli, Massimo			Distinct EEG seizure patterns reflect different seizure generation mechanisms	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						seizure onset; high-frequency oscillation; 4-aminopyridine; picrotoxin	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ONSET PATTERNS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; FAST RIPPLES; EPILEPSY; HIPPOCAMPUS; RATS	Low-voltage fast (LVF)- and hypersynchronous (HYP)-seizure onset patterns can be recognized in the EEG of epileptic animals and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) have been linked to each pattern, with ripples predominating during LVF seizures and fast ripples predominating during HYP seizures in the rat pilocarpine model. This evidence led us to hypothesize that these two seizureonset patterns reflect the contribution of neural networks with distinct transmitter signaling characteristics. Here, we tested this hypothesis by analyzing the seizure activity induced with the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 4-5 mg/kg ip), which enhances both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, or the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin (3-5 mg/kg ip); rats were implanted with electrodes in the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, and the subiculum. We found that LVF onset occurred in 82% of 4AP-induced seizures whereas seizures after picrotoxin were always HYP. In addition, high-frequency oscillation analysis revealed that 4AP-induced LVF seizures were associated with higher ripple rates compared with fast ripples (P < 0.05), whereas picrotoxin-induced seizures contained higher rates of fast ripples compared with ripples (P < 0.05). These results support the hypothesis that two distinct patterns of seizure onset result from different pathophysiological mechanisms.

METHODS: Data from TRIBE-AKI, a prospective study of children undergoing cardiac surgery, were used to examine the association of cardiac biomarkers (N-type pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase-MB [CK-MB], heart-type fatty acid binding protein [h-FABP], and troponins I and T) with the development of postoperative AKI. Cardiac biomarkers were collected before and 0 to 6 hours after surgery. AKI was defined as a >= 50% or 0.3 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine, within 7 days of surgery. RESULTS: Of the 106 patients included in this study, 55 (52%) developed AKI after cardiac surgery. Patients who developed AKI had higher median levels of pre- and postoperative cardiac biomarkers compared with patients without AKI (all P < .01). Preoperatively, higher levels of CK-MB and h-FABP were associated with increased odds of developing AKI (CK-MB: adjusted odds ratio 4.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56-13.41; h-FABP: adjusted odds ratio 2.76, 95% CI 1.27-6.03). When combined with clinical models, both preoperative CK-MB and h-FABP provided good discrimination (area under the curve 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.87, and 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.87, respectively) and improved reclassification indices. Cardiac biomarkers collected postoperatively did not significantly improve the prediction of AKI beyond clinical models. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CK-MB and h-FABP are associated with increased risk of postoperative AKI and provide good discrimination of patients who develop AKI. These biomarkers may be useful for risk stratifying patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Neural correlates of taste perception in congenital blindness	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Gustation; Visually impaired; crossmodal plasticity; fMRI	FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; VISUAL FOOD CUES; SENSORY INTEGRATION; CEPHALIC-PHASE; COLOR CUES; RESPONSES; BRAIN; CORTEX; REWARD; REPRESENTATION	Sight is undoubtedly important for the perception and the assessment of the palatability of tastants.. Although many studies have addressed the consequences of visual impairment on food selection, feeding behavior, eating habits and taste perception, nothing is known about the neural correlates of gustation in blindness. In the current study we examined brain responses during gustation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We scanned nine congenitally blind and 14 age- and sex-matched blindfolded sighted control subjects, matched in age, gender and body mass index (BMI), while they made judgments of either the intensity or the (un)pleasantness of different tastes (sweet, bitter) or artificial saliva that were delivered intra-orally. The fMRI data indicated that during gustation, congenitally blind individuals activate less strongly the primary taste cortex (right posterior insula and overlying Rolandic operculum) and the hypothalamus. In sharp contrast with results of multiple other sensory processing studies in congenitally blind subjects, including touch, audition and smell, the occipital cortex was not recruited during taste processing, suggesting the absence of taste-related compensatory crossmodal responses in the occipital cortex. These results underscore our earlier behavioral demonstration that congenitally blind subjects have a lower gustatory sensitivity compared to normal sighted individuals. We hypothesize that due to an underexposure to a variety of tastants, training-induced crossmodal sensory plasticity to gustatory stimulation does not occur in blind subjects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These processes likely involve cancer stem cells (CSCs). EVs represent a unique pathway of cellular export and cell-to-cell transfer of insoluble molecular regulators such as membrane receptors, signalling proteins and metabolites, thereby influencing the functional integration of cancer cell populations. While mechanisms that control biogenesis, cargo and uptake of different classes of EVs (exosomes, microvesicles, ectosomes, large oncosomes) are poorly understood, they likely remain under the influence of stress-responses, microenvironment and oncogenic processes that define the biology and heterogeneity of human cancers. In glioblastoma (GBM), recent molecular profiling approaches distinguished several disease subtypes driven by distinct molecular, epigenetic and mutational mechanisms, leading to formation of proneural, neural, classical and mesenchymal tumours. Moreover, molecularly distinct clonal cellular lineages coexist within individual GBM lesions, where they differentiate according to distinct stem cell hierarchies resulting in several facets of tumour heterogeneity and the related potential for intercellular interactions. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) may carry signatures of either proneural or mesenchymal GBM subtypes and differ in several biological characteristics that are, at least in part, represented by the output and repertoire of EV production (vesiculome). We report that vesiculomes differ between known GBM subtypes. EVs may also reflect and influence the equilibrium of the stem cell hierarchy, contain oncogenic drivers and modulate the microenvironment (vascular niche). The GBM/GSC subtype-specific differentials in EV cargo of proteins, transcripts, microRNA and DNA may enable detection of the dynamics of the stem cell compartment and result in biological effects that remain to be fully characterized.

Ethical Issues Surrounding Concussions and Player Safety in Professional Ice Hockey	NEUROETHICS			English	Article						Concussions; Ice hockey; Professional sports; Safety	CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; BRAIN-INJURY; RECURRENT CONCUSSION; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; LEAGUE PLAYERS; SPORT; VIOLENCE; RISK; HEAD; DEPRESSION	Concussions in professional sports have received increased attention, which is partly attributable to evidence that found concussion incidence rates were much higher than previously thought (Echlin et al. Journal of Neurosurgical Focus 29:1-10, 2010). Further to this, professional hockey players articulated how their concussion symptoms affected their professional careers, interpersonal relationships, and qualities of life (Caron et al. Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology 35:168-179, 2013). Researchers are beginning to associate multiple/repeated concussions with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a structural brain injury that is characterized by tau protein deposits in distinct areas of the brain (McKee et al. Brain 136:43-64, 2013). Taken together, concussions impact many people in the sporting community from current and former professional athletes and their families to medical and health professionals and researchers. In light of the growing awareness and sensitivity towards concussions, the purpose of this paper is to provide recommendations that are designed to improve player safety in professional hockey and address the ethical issues surrounding these suggestions.

The physiological and pathophysiological consequences of LPA signalling are evident and misregulation of LPA signalling can lead to pathologies like cancer, atherosclerosis, ischaemia, and fibrosis. LPA exerts its biological actions mainly through several types of G protein-coupled receptors, some of which display opposing or redundant effects. For this reason, selective LPA receptor small-molecule ligands can shine light on LPA biology and present an exciting opportunity for drug discovery endeavours. This review provides insights into the detailed chemical nature and pharmacological profile of the small-molecules thus far developed as LPA receptor modulators, as well as information on the preparation of key pharmaceuticals. This summary will facilitate future research efforts and nurture collaboration between chemists and biologists working in this emerging field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A gradient in cortical pathology in multiple sclerosis by in vivo quantitative 7 T imaging	BRAIN			English	Article						multiple sclerosis; subpial demyelination; quantitative T-2*; 7 T MRI; sulci; gyri	MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER RATIO; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MENINGEAL INFLAMMATION; SUBPIAL DEMYELINATION; FIELD-STRENGTH; HUMAN BRAIN; LESIONS; IRON; MRI	Mainero et al. use 7 Tesla MR quantitative T-2* imaging to map intracortical laminar pathology in patients with multiple sclerosis. A gradient of cortical pathology is seen across disease stages in association with worsening disability, suggesting that a pathological process driven from the pial surface contributes to disease progression.We used a surface-based analysis of T-2* relaxation rates at 7 T magnetic resonance imaging, which allows sampling quantitative T-2* throughout the cortical width, to map in vivo the spatial distribution of intracortical pathology in multiple sclerosis. Ultra-high resolution quantitative T-2* maps were obtained in 10 subjects with clinically isolated syndrome/early multiple sclerosis (a parts per thousand currency sign3 years disease duration), 18 subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (a parts per thousand yen4 years disease duration), 13 subjects with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and in 17 age-matched healthy controls. Quantitative T-2* maps were registered to anatomical cortical surfaces for sampling T-2* at 25%, 50% and 75% depth from the pial surface. Differences in laminar quantitative T-2* between each patient group and controls were assessed using general linear model (P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). In all 41 multiple sclerosis cases, we tested for associations between laminar quantitative T-2*, neurological disability, Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score, cortical thickness, and white matter lesions. In patients, we measured, T-2* in intracortical lesions and in the intracortical portion of leukocortical lesions visually detected on 7 T scans. Cortical lesional T-2* was compared with patients' normal-appearing cortical grey matter T-2* (paired t-test) and with mean cortical T-2* in controls (linear regression using age as nuisance factor). Subjects with multiple sclerosis exhibited relative to controls, independent from cortical thickness, significantly increased T-2*, consistent with cortical myelin and iron loss. In early disease, T-2* changes were focal and mainly confined at 25% depth, and in cortical sulci. In later disease stages T-2* changes involved deeper cortical laminae, multiple cortical areas and gyri. In patients, T-2* in intracortical and leukocortical lesions was increased compared with normal-appearing cortical grey matter (P < 10(-10) and P < 10(-7)), and mean cortical T-2* in controls (P < 10(-5) and P < 10(-6)). In secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, T-2* in normal-appearing cortical grey matter was significantly increased relative to controls (P < 0.001). Laminar T-2* changes may, thus, result from cortical pathology within and outside focal cortical lesions. Neurological disability and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score correlated each with the degree of laminar quantitative T-2* changes, independently from white matter lesions, the greatest association being at 25% depth, while they did not correlate with cortical thickness and volume. These findings demonstrate a gradient in the expression of cortical pathology throughout stages of multiple sclerosis, which was associated with worse disability and provides in vivo evidence for the existence of a cortical pathological process driven from the pial surface.

WMH are highly heritable, but their genetic underpinnings are incompletely characterized. To identify novel genetic variants influencing WMH burden, we conducted a meta-analysis of multiethnic genome-wide association studies. Methods and Results-We included 21 079 middle-aged to elderly individuals from 29 population-based cohorts, who were free of dementia and stroke and were of European (n=17 936), African (n=1943), Hispanic (n=795), and Asian (n=405) descent. WMH burden was quantified on MRI either by a validated automated segmentation method or a validated visual grading scale. Genotype data in each study were imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference. Within each ethnic group, we investigated the relationship between each single-nucleotide polymorphism and WMH burden using a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume, and principal components of ancestry. A meta-analysis was conducted for each ethnicity separately and for the combined sample. In the European descent samples, we confirmed a previously known locus on chr17q25 (P=2.7x10(-19)) and identified novel loci on chr10q24 (P=1.6x10(-9)) and chr2p21 (P=4.4x10(-8)). In the multiethnic meta-analysis, we identified 2 additional loci, on chr1q22 (P=2.0x10(-8)) and chr2p16 (P=1.5x10(-8)). The novel loci contained genes that have been implicated in Alzheimer disease (chr2p21 and chr10q24), intracerebral hemorrhage (chr1q22), neuroinflammatory diseases (chr2p21), and glioma (chr10q24 and chr2p16). Conclusions-We identified 4 novel genetic loci that implicate inflammatory and glial proliferative pathways in the development of WMH in addition to previously proposed ischemic mechanisms.

J	Lock, M				Lock, Margaret			Comprehending the Body in the Era of the Epigenome	CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article							EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE; ENVIRONMENTAL EPIGENETICS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; DNA METHYLATION; MATERNAL-CARE; GENE; GENOME; LIFE; BRAIN	This paper suggests that it is urgent for anthropologists to respond to a current move in epigenetics in which nature and nurture are no longer understood as dichotomous elements. It is argued that a neobiological reductionism is currently taking shape due to molecularization of the environment by epigeneticists. Anthropological concepts of embodiment should be retheorized in light of this development. The formation of epigenetics as a discipline is discussed, then the habitual black-boxing of the post-Enlightenment material body is noted. Five illustrative examples are given of recent epigenetic findings: the impact of maternal stress on fetal dysfunction, social deprivation and epigenetic changes, food as molecularized epigenetics, aging and epigenetics, and toxins as epigenetic triggers. "Embedded bodies," "local biologies," and "biosocial becomings" are introduced as concepts that enable the insertion of an anthropological perspective into this emerging debate. A brief account of historical trauma and its ongoing effects as experienced by First Nations and Inuit of Canada are given in conclusion. It is argued that historical and ethnographic accounts are indispensable if epigenetic findings are to avoid neoreductionism and contribute to policy changes to improve human well-being.

We evaluated whether chronic treatment with OT could prevent the metabolic and cardiac abnormalities associated with diabetes and obesity using the db/db mice model. Four-week-old male db/db mice and their lean nondiabetic littermates (db/+) serving as controls were treated with OT(125 ng/kg . h) or saline vehicle for a period of 12 weeks. Compared with db/+ mice, the saline-treated db/db mice developed obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia. These mice also exhibited a deficient cardiac OT/natriuretic system and developed systolic and diastolic dysfunction resulting from cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and apoptosis. These abnormalities were associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammation, and suppressed 5'-adenosine monophosphate kinase signaling pathway. The db/db mice displayed reduced serum levels of adiponectin and adipsin and elevated resistin. OT treatment increased circulating OT levels, significantly reduced serum resistin, body fat accumulation (19%; P < .001), fasting blood glucose levels by (23%; P < .001), and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. OT also normalized cardiac OT receptors, atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide, expressions and prevented systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and apoptosis. Furthermore, OT reduced cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation and normalized the 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. The complete normalization of cardiac structure and function by OT treatment in db/db mice contrasted with only partial improvement of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. These results indicate that chronic treatment with OT partially improves glucose and fat metabolism and reverses abnormal cardiac structural remodeling, preventing cardiac dysfunction in db/db mice.

PFSAs and PFCAs of varying chain length have been reported to bio-accumulate in lipid rich tissues of the brain among other tissues such as liver, and can reach high concentrations in top predators including the polar bear. PFCA and PFSA bioaccummulation in the brain has the potential to pose neurotoxic effects and therefore we conducted a study to investigate if variations in neurochemical transmitter systems i.e. the cholinergic, glutaminergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic, could be related to brain-specific bioaccumulation of PFASs in East Greenland polar bears. Nine brain regions from nine polar bears were analyzed for enzyme activity (monoamine oxidase (MAO), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutamine synthetase (GS)) and receptor density (dopamine-2 (D2), muscarinic cholinergic (mAChR) and gamma-butyric acid type A (GABA-A)) along with PFSA and PFCA concentrations. Average brain Sigma PFSA concentration was 25 ng/g ww where PFOS accounted for 91%. Average Sigma PFCA concentration was 88 ng/g ww where PFUnDA, PFDoDA and PFTrDA combined accounted for 79%. The highest concentrations of PFASs were measured in brain stem, cerebellum and hippocampus. Correlative analyses were performed both across and within brain regions. Significant positive correlations were found between PFASs and MAO activity in occipital lobe (e.g. Sigma PFCA; r(p)=0.83, p=0.041, n=6) and across brain regions (e.g. Sigma PFCA; r=0.47, p=0.001, Sigma PFSA; r(p)=0.44, p > 0.001; n=50). GABA-A receptor density was positively correlated with two PFASs across brain regions (PFOS; r=0.33, p=0.02 and PFDoDA; r(p)=0.34, p=0.014; n=52). Significant negative correlations were found between mAChR density and PFASs in cerebellum (e.g. Sigma PFCA; r(p)=0.95, p=0.013, n=5) and across brain regions (e.g. EPFCA; r(p)=0.40, p=0.003, Sigma PFSA; r(p)=0.37, p=0.007; n=52). AChE activity and D2 density were negatively correlated with single PFCAs in several brain regions, whereas GS activity was positively correlated with PFASs primarily in occipital lobe. Results from the present study support the hypothesis that PFAS concentrations in polar bears from East Greenland have exceeded the threshold limits for neurochemical alterations. It is not known whether the observed alterations in neurochemical signaling are currently having negative effects on neurochemistry in East Greenland polar bears. However given the importance of these systems in cognitive processes and motor function, the present results indicate an urgent need for a better understanding of neurochemical effects of PFAS exposure to wildlife.

We aimed to investigate HFO correlates of different pathologic substrates in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and to examine the relation of HFOs with the anatomic location of the dysplastic lesion and surrounding tissue in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). MethodsWe studied consecutive patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) investigations with depth electrodes at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, between November 2004 and May 2013. Inclusion criteria were the following: a focal lesion documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); EEG recording at a 2,000Hz sampling rate; and seizures starting from depth electrode contacts placed in lesion and perilesional tissue. ResultsThirty-seven patients (13 FCD, 12 mesial temporal sclerosis, five cortical atrophy, three polymicrogyria, three nodular heterotopia, and one tuberous sclerosis) were included; 18 were women (median age 34). Ripples and fast ripples were found in all lesion types, except tuberous sclerosis, which showed no fast ripples. There was a significant difference in rates of ripples and fast ripples across different lesions (p<0.001), with higher rates in FCD, mesial temporal sclerosis, and nodular heterotopia than in atrophy, polymicrogyria, and tuberous sclerosis. Regarding patients with FCD, HFOs rates differed significantly across the three types of tissue (lesional, perilesional, and nonlesional; p<0.001), being higher within the borders of the MRI-visible dysplastic lesion, followed by the surrounding area, and rare in the remote cortex. SignificanceOur findings suggest that in patients who are all intractable, the HFO rates vary with different pathologies, and reflect different types of neuronal derangements. Our results also emphasize the potential usefulness of HFOs as an additional method to better define the extent of the epileptogenic dysplastic tissue in FCD.

However, the mechanism of stress contribution to the onset or progression of tinnitus remains unknown. Here, we review the pathways induced by emotional stress and the outcome of their induction: corticosteroid-dependent changes in gene expression, epigenetic modulations, and impact of stress on neuronal plasticity and neurotransmission. Using clinical examples, we demonstrate the presence of emotional stress among tinnitus patients and we present methods to measure the degree of stress. The evidence causally linking emotional stress with tinnitus is still indirect-the main difficulty lies in the inaccessibility of human auditory tissues and the inability to directly measure tinnitus-induced psychological distress in animal models. However, we believe that translational research is the future way of filling this gap, finding the answers, and thereby improving both the diagnosis and treatment of tinnitus patients.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly appreciated as a key determinant of dopaminergic neuronal susceptibility in PD and is a feature of both familial and sporadic disease, as well as in toxin-induced Parkinsonism. Recently, the mechanisms by which PD-associated mitochondrial proteins phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and parkin function and induce neurodegeneration have been identified. In addition, increasing evidence implicates other PD-associated proteins such as alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in mitochondrial dysfunction in genetic cases of PD with the potential for a large functional overlap with sporadic disease. This review highlights how recent advances in understanding familial PD-associated proteins have identified novel mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for addressing mitochondrial dysfunction in PD.

Complication Avoidance in the Resection of Spinal Meningiomas	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Complication; Meningioma; Spinal meningioma; Surgery	SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR APPROACH; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; CORD MENINGIOMA; VERTEBRAL BODY; TUMORS; SURGERY; RADIOSURGERY; EXPERIENCE; LESIONS	BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is considered the treatment of choice for spinal meningiomas and can be safe and effective; however, neurologic and surgical complications occur. This article reviews the factors that may predict susceptibility to this postoperative decline and addresses therapeutic choices, adjunctive therapies, and technologic applications that may help avoid complications. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for articles related to spinal meningiomas addressing surgical treatment, adjuvant treatment, and technologic applications related to management and minimizing of complications. RESULTS: There were 16 surgical series identified, comprising 1090 patients with median mortality of 1% (range, 0%-4%), nonneurologic surgical morbidity of 4% (range, 0%-24%), and permanent neurologic deterioration of 6% (range, 0%-21%). Common complications were cerebrospinal fluid leaks and fistulas, venous thromboembolic disease, myocardial infarction, and neurologic deterioration with either transient or permanent neurologic deficits. Predictive risk factors of neurologic decline included pathoanatomic features of lesion calcification, anterior dural attachment, infiltrative tumor, and tumoral adherence to the spinal cord and patient-specific factors of preoperative neurologic and advanced age. CONCLUSIONS: Alongside surgery, selection of more direct approaches and use of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with higher grade lesions and recurrent disease may lead to improved outcomes. New technologies, including microsurgical technique, intraoperative electrophysiologic monitoring, intraoperative ultrasound, and ultrasonic aspiration, may improve the safety and limit the complications of resection.

We provide a novel, quantitative solution to map vertebral and spinal cord levels accounting for anatomic variability within the human spinal cord. For the first time, we report a population distribution of the segmental anatomy of the cervical spinal cord that has direct implications for the interpretation of advanced imaging studies most often conducted across groups of subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent a T2-weighted, 3T MRI of the cervical spinal cord. Two experts marked the C3-C8 cervical nerve rootlets, C3-C7 vertebral bodies, and pontomedullary junction. A semiautomated algorithm was used to locate the centerline of the spinal cord and measure rostral-caudal distances from a fixed point in the brain stem, the pontomedullary junction, to each of the spinal rootlets and vertebral bodies. Distances to each location were compared across subjects. Six volunteers had 2 additional scans in neck flexion and extension to measure the effects of patient positioning in the scanner. RESULTS: We demonstrated that substantial variation exists in the rostral-caudal position of spinal cord segments among individuals and that prior methods of predicting spinal segments are imprecise. We also show that neck flexion or extension has little effect on the relative location of vertebral-versus-spinal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for spinal level variation is lacking in existing imaging studies. Future studies should account for this variation for accurate interpretation of the neuroanatomic origin of acquired MR signals.	[Cadotte, D. W.; Cadotte, A.; Wilson, J. R.; Fehlings, M.

We review this idea in the context of auditory perception. Using speech as an exemplar, we illustrate how hierarchically organized oscillations can be used to parse and encode complex input streams. We then consider the motor system as a major source of rhythms (temporal priors) in auditory processing, that act in concert with attention to sharpen sensory representations and link them across areas. We discuss the circuits that could mediate this audio-motor interaction, notably the potential role of the somatosensory system. Finally, we reposition temporal predictions in the context of internal models, discussing how they interact with feature-based or spatial predictions. We argue that complementary predictions interact synergistically according to the organizational principles of each sensory system, forming multidimensional filters crucial to perception.

By means of a Lyapunov-like analysis, we determine stability conditions for the on-line identification. Then, a sliding mode controller is designed for trajectory tracking with consideration of the modeling error and disturbance. The main contributions of the paper lie in the following aspects. First, we extend our prior identification results of single-layer dynamic neural networks with multi-time scales to those of multilayer case. Second, the e-modification in standard use in adaptive control is introduced in the on-line update laws to guarantee bounded weights and bounded identification errors. Third, the potential singularity problem in controller design is solved by using new update laws for the NN weights so that the control signal is guaranteed bounded. The stability of proposed controller is proved by using Lyapunov function. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The current study examined whether an objective and reliable marker of response inhibition, the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), is associated with body mass index (BMI) z-scores and/or food intake during a snack test in pre-school children. METHODS: The current sample consisted of 193 pre-school children taking part in a longitudinal study of early brain development (Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (the MAVAN project)). Linear mixed-effect models were used to examine whether the SSRT measured at age 48 months associated with BMI z-scores and/or dietary intake during a laboratory-based snack test. RESULTS: After controlling for significant covariates including maternal BMI, there was a significant gender by SSRT interaction effect in predicting 48-month BMI z-scores. Post-hoc analysis revealed an association between longer SSRTs (poor response inhibition) and higher BMIs in girls but not boys. Across both girls and boys, longer SSRTs were associated with greater intake of carbohydrates and sugars during the snack test. The association between SSRT scores and BMI z-scores in girls was not statistically mediated by carbohydrate or sugar intake. CONCLUSIONS: At 48 months of age, slower response inhibition on the Stop-Signal Task associates with higher BMI z-scores in girls, and with higher intake of carbohydrates and sugars during a snack test across both genders. Ongoing follow-up of these children will help clarify the implications of these associations for longer term macronutrient intake, eating-related pathology and/or pathological weight gain over time.

Using transgenic mice that overproduce Ab (APP mice) or TGF-beta 1 (TGF mice), we found that both induce impairments of cerebrovascular function and structural changes of the vessel wall. Soluble Ab species affect blood vessel primarily by increasing oxidative stress, which results in reduced nitric oxide-mediated dilations and impaired signaling of endothelial transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 and smooth muscle KATP channels. These impairments occur early in the disease process and can be rescued by either antioxidants (Tempol, N-acetylcysteine) or therapy with antioxidant properties (simvastatin). In contrast, comparable impairments in TGF mice were insensitive to antioxidants and could only be rescued by therapy with pleiotropic effects. The blood flow response evoked by whisker stimulation was impaired in both APP and TGF mice. In contrast, the cerebral uptake of glucose induced by this stimulus was reduced only in APP mice, pointing to preserved neuronal function in the TGF mice. Accordingly, despite similar but mechanistically different cerebrovascular deficits in APP and TGF mice, overt cognitive deficits were seen only in APP mice and could be rescued depending on age.

This study aimed to describe these patients' treatment patterns, symptoms, and costs. Research design and methods: Retrospective study pooling data from three large administrative databases in the US (08/2011-06/2013). ALK+NSCLC patients with BM and continuous enrollment for >= 60 days before and >= 30 days after the first observed BM diagnosis were identified by pharmacy records for crizotinib among patients with lung cancer and BM diagnostic codes. Main outcome measures: Treatment patterns, symptoms, healthcare resource utilization, and costs, before and after BM diagnosis. Results: Of the 213 crizotinib patients with BM diagnoses meeting the selection criteria, 23.0% had BM prior to NSCLC diagnosis; 47.4% had BM prior to crizotinib initiation; 19.2% during crizotinib treatment; and 10.3% post-crizotinib treatment. For those diagnosed with BM after NSCLC diagnosis, the median time between the NSCLC and BM diagnoses was 88 days. Following the first observed BM diagnosis, 88.7% used chemotherapy, 63.4% had radiotherapy, and 31.9% had stereotactic radiosurgery. The prevalence of BM-related symptoms substantially increased post-BM-diagnosis: fatigue (from 15% to 39%), headaches (from 5% to 24%), and depression (from 5% to 15%). Monthly costs per patient averaged $5983 before the BM diagnosis and $22,645 after diagnosis. Patients' resource utilization increased significantly post-BM-diagnosis, with a 3-fold increase in OP visits and a 6-fold increase in IP stays. Post-BM-diagnosis costs were driven by pharmacy (42.0%), inpatient (29.6%), and outpatient costs (26.0%). Limitations: The study sample was limited to crizotinib-treated patients. Conclusions: Post-BM-diagnosis, patients experience high symptom burden. Post-BM-diagnosis, treatment is highly variable and costly: average monthly costs per patient almost quadrupled post-BM-diagnosis.

Several studies have suggested that ACBP acts as an acyl-CoA pool former and regulates long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) metabolism in peripheral tissues. In the brain, ACBP is known as Diazepam-Binding Inhibitor, a secreted peptide acting as an allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor. However, its role in central LCFA metabolism remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated ACBP cellular expression, ACBP regulation of LCFA intracellular metabolism, FA profile, and FA metabolism-related gene expression using ACBP-deficient and control mice. ACBP was mainly found in astrocytes with high expression levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus. We demonstrate that ACBP deficiency alters the central LCFA-CoA profile and impairs unsaturated (oleate, linolenate) but not saturated (palmitate, stearate) LCFA metabolic fluxes in hypothalamic slices and astrocyte cultures. In addition, lack of ACBP differently affects the expression of genes involved in FA metabolism in cortical versus hypothalamic astrocytes. Finally, ACBP deficiency increases FA content and impairs their release in response to palmitate in hypothalamic astrocytes. Collectively, these findings reveal for the first time that central ACBP acts as a regulator of LCFA intracellular metabolism in astrocytes.

Despite in-depth examination of tissues like skeletal muscle, brain microcirculation has remained largely unexplored due to methodological limitations. Recent, technological advances have, however, started to grant greater access to this vital microcirculatory bed. This overview is part of a Special Topics Issue centered on the methodology, theory, and mechanistic basis of neurovascular coupling.

The mechanism responsible to couple CBF to neuronal activity is termed NVC. Ang II, a key player in hypertension, impairs NVC and has been found to be of significant importance in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. The presence of Ang II and its metabolites, as well as their receptors have been detected in many areas of the brain. Findings indicate that disruption of NVC by Ang II is mediated by its AT1R and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent ROS production independently of its effect on blood pressure. Although the process causing ROS to interfere with NVC has yet to be elucidated, data label peroxynitrite as the leading ROS to do so. The same common pathway is involved in NVC impairment in AD experimental models. This review investigates recent data concerning the effects of Ang II on NVC with the intent of exploring new treatment perspectives for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) has dramatically improved and systematized the diagnosis of LDs and gLEs, and in combination with specific clinical features, such as Addison's disease in Adrenoleukodystrophy or hypodontia in Pol-III related or 4H leukodystrophy, can often resolve a case with a minimum of testing. The diagnostic odyssey for the majority LD and gLE patients, however, remains extensive many patients will wait nearly a decade for a definitive diagnosis and at least half will remain unresolved. The combination of MRI, careful clinical evaluation and next generation genetic sequencing holds promise for both expediting the diagnostic process and dramatically reducing the number of unresolved cases. Here we present a workflow detailing the Global Leukodystrophy Initiative (GLIA) consensus recommendations for an approach to clinical diagnosis, including salient clinical features suggesting a specific diagnosis, neuroimaging features and molecular genetic testing. We also discuss recommendations on the use of broad-spectrum next-generation sequencing in instances of ambiguous MRI or clinical findings. We conclude with a proposal for systematic trials of genome-wide agnostic testing as a first line diagnostic in LDs and gLEs given the increasing number of genes associated with these disorders.

Leukodystrophy patients manifest many of the same symptoms and medical complications despite the wide spectrum of genetic origins. Although no definitive cures exist, all of these conditions are treatable. This report provides the first expert consensus on the recognition and treatment of medical and psychosocial complications associated with leukodystrophies.

Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Final 12-Month, Open-Label Results	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						dyskinesia; infusion; levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel; "off" time; percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SUBCUTANEOUS APOMORPHINE INFUSION; NONMOTOR COMPLICATIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS; MEDICAL THERAPY; EFFICACY; NEUROPATHY; SAFETY	Motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with long-term oral levodopa treatment and linked to pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation. l-dopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is delivered continuously by percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube (PEG-J), which reduces l-dopa-plasma-level fluctuations and can translate to reduced motor complications. We present final results of the largest international, prospective, 54-week, open-label LCIG study. PD patients with severe motor fluctuations (>3 h/day off time) despite optimized therapy received LCIG monotherapy. Additional PD medications were allowed >28 days post-LCIG initiation. Safety was the primary endpoint measured through adverse events (AEs), device complications, and number of completers. Secondary endpoints included diary-assessed off time, on time with/without troublesome dyskinesia, UPDRS, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes. Of 354 enrolled patients, 324 (91.5%) received PEG-J and 272 (76.8%) completed the study. Most AEs were mild/moderate and transient; complication of device insertion (34.9%) was the most common. Twenty-seven (7.6%) patients withdrew because of AEs. Serious AEs occurred in 105 (32.4%), most commonly complication of device insertion (6.5%). Mean daily off time decreased by 4.4 h/65.6% (P<0.001). On time without troublesome dyskinesia increased by 4.8 h/62.9% (P<0.001); on time with troublesome dyskinesia decreased by 0.4 h/22.5% (P=0.023). Improvements persisted from week 4 through study completion. UPDRS and HRQoL outcomes were also improved throughout. In the advanced PD population, LCIG's safety profile consisted primarily of AEs associated with the device/procedure, l-dopa/carbidopa, and advanced PD. LCIG was generally well tolerated and demonstrated clinically significant improvements in motor function, daily activities, and HRQoL sustained over 54 weeks. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Approximately 1 in 5 patients with mTBI will develop chronic pain (headache and widespread pain, possibly of central origin) and/or sleep problems (insomnia, disordered breathing, periodic limb movements). However, the predisposing mechanisms for chronic pain in patients with mTBI are unknown. Mild traumatic brain injury is a rare model to prospectively assess the risk factors and mechanisms for pain chronification from the injury onset in the absence of pretrauma comorbidity or medication. In the acute phase, headaches and sleep disturbances seem to predict the poorest long-term cognitive and mood outcomes. Although recent studies suggest that certain brain biomarkers and mood alterations (eg, anxiety, depression) contribute, the causality of chronic pain remains unclear. In mTBI patients with pain, poor sleep quality was correlated with fast beta and gamma electroencephalographic activity in frontal, central, and occipital electroencephalographic (EEG) derivations in all sleep stages. Sleep recuperative function seems to be disturbed by persistent wake EEG activity, corroborating patient complaints such as feeling awake when asleep. Pain and sleep management in mTBI is not yet evidence-based. Treatments include cognitive behavioral and light therapies, medications, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or oral appliances for disordered sleep breathing. Customized approaches are indicated for mTBI, pain, and sleep complaints. Further studies in pediatric, sport, and transportation populations are needed to prevent TBI chronification. Improvements are emerging in biomarker sensitivity and specificity and management strategies for TBI, pain, and sleep comorbidities.

Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in social neuroscience and have revealed the ability of pain stimuli to alter social interactions. These experiments suggest that rodents are capable of producing simplified versions of any number of social phenomena involving empathy, previously thought to be the sole province of human beings. This review describes the state of science in both humans and nonhuman animals, and notes intriguing parallels in observations from both species. Indeed, my laboratory is starting to demonstrate perfectly translatable findings regarding social modulation of pain in rodents and humans.

Visual deficits often accompany TBI but physiological and anatomical evidence for injury in mild TBI is lacking. Axons traversing the corpus callosum are particularly vulnerable to TBI. Hemifield representations of early visual areas are linked by bundles of fibers that together cross the corpus callosum while maintaining their topographic relations. Given the increased vulnerability of the long visual axons traversing the corpus callosum, we hypothesized that inter-hemispheric transmission for vision will be impaired following mild TBI. Using the travelling wave paradigm (Wilson, Blake, & Lee 2001), we measured inter-hemispheric transmission in terms of both speed and propagation failures in 14 mild TBI patients and 14 age-matched controls. We found that relative to intra-hemispheric waves, inter-hemispheric waves were faster and that the interhemispheric propagation failures were more common in TBI patients. Furthermore, the transmission failures were topographically distributed, with a bias towards greater failures for transmission across the upper visual field. We discuss the results in terms of increased local inhibition and topographically-selective axonal injury in mild TBI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In later extra-striate areas neurons with larger receptive fields integrate information across the visual field. For example, local luminance-defined features can be integrated into contours and shapes. Evidence for the global integration of features defined by contrast-modulation is less well established. While good performance in some shape tasks has been demonstrated with 2nd order stimuli, the integration of contours fails with 2nd order elements. Recently we developed a global orientation coherence task that is more basic than contour integration, bearing similarity to the well-established global motion coherence task. Similar to our previous 1st order result for this task, we find 2nd order coherence detection to be scale-invariant. There was a small but significant threshold elevation for 2nd order relative to 1st order. We used a noise masking approach to compare the efficiency of orientation integration for the 1st and 2nd order. We find a significant deficit for 2nd order detection at both the local and global level, however the small size of this effect stands in stark contrast against previous results from contour-integration experiments, which are almost impossible with 2nd order stimuli.

The neural activities of posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex (PMLS) of cats are directly linked to the perception of visual motion speed. To date, there have been no studies on the effects of acute alcohol exposure in vivo upon the representation of speed in PMLS neurons. MethodsAlcohol was administered intravenously as a 20% (v/v) saline solution via a syringe at a dose levels of 0.5, 1, or 2g/kg to generate a series of blood alcohol concentrations. Using extracellular single-unit recording technique, we recorded the speed-tuning properties of PMLS neurons that responded to random-dot patterns before and after alcohol administration, and simultaneously monitored the concentration of ethanol by detecting the breath alcohol concentration using a breath analyzer. ResultsAfter acute alcohol treatment, PMLS cells preferred lower speeds. A broadened speed-tuning bandwidth of PMLS cells was also observed after acute alcohol administration. Additionally, response modulation and discriminative capacity for speed of visual motion in the PMLS cells were significantly impaired after acute alcohol exposure. Concurrently, PMLS cells after acute alcohol exposure showed decreased spontaneous activity, peak responses, and signal-to-noise ratios. ConclusionsThere is a significant functional degradation in the neural representation of visual motion speed in PMLS of cats after acute alcohol exposure. These neural changes may contribute to the alcohol-related deficits in visual motion perception observed in behavioral studies.

We obtained quantitative PET measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in 12 smokers who had refrained from smoking overnight, and in a historical group of nonsmokers, testing the prediction that overnight abstinence results in widespread, coupled reductions of CBF and CMRO2. At the end of the abstention period, global grey-matter CBF and CMRO2 were both reduced by 17% relative to nonsmokers. At 15 minutes after renewed smoking, global CBF had increased insignificantly, while global CMRO2 had increased by 11%. Regional analysis showed that CMRO2 had increased in the left putamen and thalamus, and in right posterior cortical regions at this time. At 60 and 105 minutes after smoking resumption, CBF had increased by 8% and CMRO2 had increased by 11-12%. Thus, we find substantial and global impairment of CBF/CMRO2 in abstaining smokers, and acute restoration by resumption of smoking. The reduced CBF and CMRO2 during acute abstention may mediate the cognitive changes described in chronic smokers.

In this study, we use the intersection of Lmx1b and Hoxb8::Cre expression in the spinal cord to genetically define nociceptive circuits. Specifically, we show that Lmx1b, previously shown to be expressed in glutamatergic dorsal horn neurons and critical for dorsal horn development, is expressed in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons and that its deletion results in the specific loss of excitatory dorsal horn neurons by apoptosis, without any effect on inhibitory neuron numbers. To assess the behavioral consequences of Lmx1b deletion in the spinal cord, we used the brain-sparing driver Hoxb8:: Cre. We show that such a deletion of Lmxb1 leads to a robust reduction in sensitivity to mechanical and thermal noxious stimulation. Furthermore, such conditional mutant mice show a loss of a subpopulation of glutamatergic dorsal horn neurons, abnormal sensory afferent innervations, and reduced spinofugal innervation of the parabrachial nucleus and the periaqueductal gray, important nociceptive structures. Together, our results demonstrate an important role for the intersection of Lmx1b and Hoxb8::cre expression in the development of nociceptive dorsal horn circuits critical for mechanical and thermal pain processing.

To limit this possibility, we assessed newborn neuronal microstructures using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and assessed neonatal microstructure variation in relation to antenatal anxiety and in prediction of infant socio-emotional behavior at age 1 year. Method: Dyads were drawn from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort, and included mothers who completed the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26 weeks gestation (scoring >90, n = 20; scoring <70, n = 34) and their neonates (5-17 days postnatal) who took part in DTI. Results: Antenatal anxiety predicted variation in fractional anisotropy (FA) of regions important to cognitive-emotional responses to stress (i.e., the right insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), sensory processing (e.g., right middle occipital), and socio-emotional function (e.g., the right angular gyrus, uncinate fasciculus, posterior cingulate, and parahippocampus). In a subset of infants with Infant Toddler Socio-Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) data, some of these right lateralized clusters predicted infant internalizing (e.g., insula: beta = 0.511, p=.03) but not externalizing behavior 1 year later, although these analyses failed to withstand the correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: These findings suggest the need for larger-scale investigations of the role that corticolimbic structures play in regulating cognitive-emotional responses to threat, and potentially in mediating the cross-generational transmission of anxiety, as well as in underscoring the importance of early mother infant intervention programs.

Moreover, neurological symptoms can significantly impact the child's quality of life and contribute to distress among parents, families, care-givers and health care providers. Knowing how to manage and alleviated these symptoms is essential for providing good palliative care. In the present article, the more common neurological symptoms of agitation/irritability, spasticity and dystonia will be reviewed. The aim of the present brief review is to provide a basic approach to both the identification and treatment of these neurological symptoms. A medication table is provided for quick reference. A brief commentary and guidance for the management of pain are also incorporated, with reference to further literature sources.

This remains rooted in the Harvard criteria and based on the characteristics of a permanently nonfunctioning brain. Medicine is evolving toward a single unified determination of death based on the cessation of brain function subsequent to catastrophic brain injury or circulatory arrest. Clarity in lexicon could be established, including movement toward functional definitions and away from anatomically based terms such as cardiac and brain death that erroneously imply death of the organ. The cessation of clinical functions of the brain that will not resume is determined by the absence of capacity for consciousness, centrally mediated motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and capacity to breathe. A known proximate cause and the absence of confounding or reversible conditions must be confirmed. Regional medical, legal, cultural, religious, or socioeconomic factors may require testing beyond this minimal clinical standard.

SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain injury; Electroencephalography; Sleep; Slow oscillations; Sleep spindles	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; PRIMARY INSOMNIA; EEG ACTIVITY; QUALITY INDEX; SPINDLES; DISTURBANCE; FREQUENCY; AGE	Introduction: Sleep complaints are common after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). While recent findings suggest that sleep macro-architecture is preserved in mTBI, features of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep micro-architecture including electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power, slow waves (SW), and sleep spindles could be affected. This study aimed to compare NREM sleep in mTBI and healthy controls, and explore whether NREM sleep characteristics correlate with sleep complaints in these groups. Methods: Thirty-four mTBI participants (mean age: 34.2 +/- 11.9 yrs; post-injury delay: 10.5 +/- 10.4 weeks) and 29 age-matched controls (mean age: 32.4 +/- 8.2 yrs) were recruited for two consecutive nights of polysomnographic (PSG) recording. Spectral power was computed and SW and spindles were automatically detected in three derivations (F3, C3, O1) for the first three sleep cycles. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: mTBI participants reported significant poorer sleep quality than controls on the PSQI and showed significant increases in beta power during NREM sleep at the occipital derivation only. Conversely, no group differences were found in SW and spindle characteristics. Interestingly, changes in NREM sleep characteristics were not associated with mTBI estimation of sleep quality. Conclusions: Compared to controls, mTBI were found to have enhanced NREM beta power. However, these changes were not found to be associated with the subjective evaluation of sleep. While increases in beta bands during NREM sleep may be attributable to the occurrence of a brain injury, they could also be related to the presence of pain and anxiety as suggested in one prior study.

We aimed to further extend the role of DEPDC5 to focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). MethodsSeven patients from 4 families with DEPDC5 mutations and focal epilepsy associated with FCD were recruited and investigated at the clinical, neuroimaging, and histopathological levels. The DEPDC5 gene was sequenced from genomic blood and brain DNA. ResultsAll patients had drug-resistant focal epilepsy, 5 of them underwent surgery, and 1 had a brain biopsy. Electroclinical phenotypes were compatible with FCD II, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was typical in only 4 cases. Histopathology confirmed FCD IIa in 2 patients (including 1 MRI-negative case) and showed FCD I in 2 other patients, and remained inconclusive in the last 2 patients. Three patients were seizure-free postsurgically, and 1 had a worthwhile improvement. Sequencing of blood DNA revealed truncating DEPDC5 mutations in all 4 families; 1 mutation was found to be mosaic in an asymptomatic father. A brain somatic DEPDC5 mutation was identified in 1 patient in addition to the germline mutation. InterpretationGermline, germline mosaic, and brain somatic DEPDC5 mutations may cause epilepsy associated with FCD, reinforcing the link between mTORC1 pathway and FCDs. Similarly to other mTORopathies, a 2-hit mutational model could be responsible for cortical lesions. Our study also indicates that epilepsy surgery is a valuable alternative in the treatment of drug-resistant DEPDC5-positive focal epilepsies, even if the MRI is unremarkable.

Little is known about these functional architectural changes, particularly during the second half of the first year of life. We used multivariate pattern classification of resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data obtained in an on-going, multi-site, longitudinal study of brain and behavioral development to explore whether fcMRI data contained information sufficient to classify infant age. Analyses carefully account for the effects of fcMRI motion artifact. Support vector machines (SVMs) classified 6 versus 12 month-old infants (128 datasets) above chance based on fcMRI data alone. Results demonstrate significant changes in measures of brain functional organization that coincide with a special period of dramatic change in infant motor, cognitive, and social development. Explorations of the most different correlations used for SVM lead to two different interpretations about functional connections that support 6 versus 12-month age categorization.

Thus, disassociating disease effects from those of medication become exceedingly difficult. For the first time, using a longitudinally studied sample of structural magnetic resonance images from patients with childhood onset schizophrenia (COS; neurobiologically contiguous with the adult onset form of schizophrenia), their nonpsychotic siblings (COSSIBs), and novel shape mapping algorithms that are volume independent, we report the familial contribution of striatal morphology in schizophrenia. The results of our volumetric analyses demonstrate age-related increases in overall striatal volumes specific only to COS. However, both COS and COSSIBs showed overlapping shape differences in the striatal head, which normalized in COSSIBs by late adolescence. These results mirror previous studies from our group, demonstrating cortical thickness deficits in COS and COSSIBs as these deficits normalize in COSSIBs in the same age range as our striatal findings. Finally, there is a single region of nonoverlapping outward displacement in the dorsal aspect of the caudate body, potentially indicative of a response to medication. Striatal shape may be considered complimentary to volume as an endophenotype, and, in some cases may provide information that is not detectable using standard volumetric techniques. Our striatal shape findings demonstrate the striking localization of abnormalities in striatal the head. The neuroanatomical localization of these findings suggest the presence of abnormalities in the striatal-prefrontal circuits in schizophrenia and resilience mechanisms in COSSIBs with age dependent normalization.

It is realized by calculating the instantaneous conductance and the junction conductance of the array. The first one is done using the array voltage and current, whereas the second one, which is a function of the array junction current, is estimated using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) solar cell model. Knowing the difficulties of measuring solar radiation and cell temperature, since those require two extra sensors that will increase the hardware circuitry and measurement noise, an analytical model is proposed to estimate them with a denoising-based wavelet algorithm. The proposed MPPT technique helps to reduce the hardware setup using only one voltage sensor, while increases the array power efficiency and MPPT response time. The simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the MPPT algorithm operation as well as the climatic parameters estimation capabilities.

Algorithm and Architecture for a Low-Power Content-Addressable Memory Based on Sparse Clustered Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS			English	Article						Associative memory; content-addressable memory (CAM); low-power computing; recurrent neural networks; sparse clustered networks (SCNs)	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CAM; DESIGN	We propose a low-power content-addressable memory (CAM) employing a new algorithm for associativity between the input tag and the corresponding address of the output data. The proposed architecture is based on a recently developed sparse clustered network using binary connections that on-average eliminates most of the parallel comparisons performed during a search. Therefore, the dynamic energy consumption of the proposed design is significantly lower compared with that of a conventional low-power CAM design. Given an input tag, the proposed architecture computes a few possibilities for the location of the matched tag and performs the comparisons on them to locate a single valid match. TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology was used for simulation purposes. Following a selection of design parameters, such as the number of CAM entries, the energy consumption and the search delay of the proposed design are 8%, and 26% of that of the conventional NAND architecture, respectively, with a 10% area overhead. A design methodology based on the silicon area and power budgets, and performance requirements is discussed.

J	Hansson, N; Schlich, T				Hansson, Nils; Schlich, Thomas			"Highly Qualified Loser"? Harvey Cushing and the Nobel Prize	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						history of brain surgery; Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine; Harvey Cushing; Victor Horsley; Egas Moniz		Neurosurgery, in particular surgery of the brain, was recognized as one of the most spectacular transgressions of the traditional limits of surgical work. With their audacious, technically demanding, laboratory-based, and highly promising new interventions, prominent neurosurgeons were primary candidates for the Nobel Prize. Accordingly, neurosurgical pioneers such as Victor Horsley and, in particular, Harvey Cushing continued to be nominated for the prize. However, only Antonio Egas Moniz was eventually awarded the prestigious award in 1949 for the introduction of frontal lobotomy, an intervention that would no longer be prize-worthy from today's perspective. Horsley and Cushing, who were arguably the most important proponents of early neurosurgery, remained "highly qualified losers,'' as such cases have been called. This paper examines the nominations, reviews, and discussions kept in the Nobel Archives to understand the reasons for this remarkable choice. At a more general level, the authors use the example of neurosurgery to explore the mechanisms of scientific recognition and what could be called the enacting of excellence in science and medicine.

Results of these studies suggest possible clinical efficacy and an excellent safety profile. Therefore, a larger international multicenter proof-of-concept trial was launched, to directly compare the safety and efficacy of rTMS, tDCS, and sham stimulation as adjuvant therapy to speech and language therapy in subacute poststroke aphasia. In the 4 participating centers, subacute stroke patients with aphasia are randomized between 5 and 30 days after ischemic stroke to either receive rTMS, tDCS, or sham stimulation in combination with a daily 45 minutes speech and language therapy session for 10 days. Efficacy is evaluated at 1 and 30 days after the last of the 10 treatment sessions using 3 outcome measures, validated in all participating languages: Boston naming test, Token test, and verbal fluency test. Additionally, adverse events are recorded to prove safety. In this study, a total of 90 patients will be recruited, and data analysis will be completed in 2016. This is the first multilingual and multinational randomized and controlled trial in poststroke aphasia and if positive, will add an effective new strategy for early stage poststroke aphasia rehabilitation.

Misfolded and aggregated proteins bind to pattern recognition receptors on microglia and astroglia, and trigger an innate immune response characterised by release of inflammatory mediators, which contribute to disease progression and severity. Genome-wide analysis suggests that several genes that increase the risk for sporadic Alzheimer's disease encode factors that regulate glial clearance of misfolded proteins and the inflammatory reaction. External factors, including systemic inflammation and obesity, are likely to interfere with immunological processes of the brain and further promote disease progression. Modulation of risk factors and targeting of these immune mechanisms could lead to future therapeutic or preventive strategies for Alzheimer's disease.

There is increasing evidence that this homomeric purinoceptor, which is expressed in several neuronal and immune cell types, is involved in chronic pain and inflammation. The current paucity of unambiguous pharmacological tools available to interrogate or modulate P2X4 function led us to pursue the search for selective antagonists. In the high-throughput screen of a compound library, we identified the phenylurea BX430 (1-(2,6-dibromo-4-isopropyl-phenyl)-3-(3-pyridyl) urea, molecular weight = 413), with antagonist properties on human P2X4-mediated calcium uptake. Patch-clamp electrophysiology confirmed direct inhibition of P2X4 currents by extracellular BX430, with submicromolar potency (IC50 = 0.54 mu M). BX430 is highly selective, having virtually no functional impact on all other P2X subtypes, namely, P2X1-P2X3, P2X5, and P2X7, at 10-100 times its IC50. Unexpected species differences were noticed, as BX430 is a potent antagonist of zebrafish P2X4 but has no effect on rat and mouse P2X4 orthologs. The concentration-response curve for ATP on human P2X4 in the presence of BX430 shows an insurmountable blockade, indicating a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism of action. Using a fluorescent dye uptake assay, we observed that BX430 also effectively suppresses ATP-evoked and ivermectin-potentiated membrane permeabilization induced by P2X4 pore dilation. Finally, in single-cell calcium imaging, we validated its selective inhibitory effects on native P2X4 channels at the surface of human THP-1 cells that were differentiated into macrophages. In summary, this ligand provides a novel molecular probe to assess the specific role of P2X4 in inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, where ATP signaling has been shown to be dysfunctional.

Role of Tet1 and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in cocaine action	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DNA DEMETHYLATION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; GENE-EXPRESSION; DELTA-FOSB; MEMORY FORMATION; DRUG-ADDICTION; MAMMALIAN DNA; 5-METHYLCYTOSINE; TRANSCRIPTION; ENHANCERS	Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes mediate the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is enriched in brain, and its ultimate DNA demethylation. However, the influence of TET and 5hmC on gene transcription in brain remains elusive. We found that ten-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1) was downregulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward structure, by repeated cocaine administration, which enhanced behavioral responses to cocaine. We then identified 5hmC induction in putative enhancers and coding regions of genes that have pivotal roles in drug addiction. Such induction of 5hmC, which occurred similarly following TET1 knockdown alone, correlated with increased expression of these genes as well as with their alternative splicing in response to cocaine administration. In addition, 5hmC alterations at certain loci persisted for at least 1 month after cocaine exposure. Together, these reveal a previously unknown epigenetic mechanism of cocaine action and provide new insight into how 5hmC regulates transcription in brain in vivo.

Clinical and angiographic outcomes of 97 patients with unruptured aneurysms treated with stenting, 51 after BRT (BRT+) and 46 without balloon assistance (BRT-), were retrieved from the SENAT database. Technical, clinical, and angiographic outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS:Periprocedural morbimortality and midterm clinical outcomes were not different between groups. Residual aneurysms were observed in 7.8% of BRT+ and in 21.7% of BRT- (P = .08) at the end of the stenting procedure. Four retreatments were performed during the follow-up period (2 BRT+, 2 BRT-). Twelve- to 18-month anatomic results showed a significant difference between groups, with a residual aneurysm being observed in 6.1% of BRT+ as compared to 22.7% of BRT- patients (P = .03).CONCLUSION:Primary BRT followed by stent-assisted coiling may be associated with fewer residual aneurysms at 12 to 18 months as compared to stent-assisted coiling alone.ABBREVIATIONS:BRT, balloon remodeling techinquemRS, modified Rankin ScaleSAC, stent-assisted coilingSENAT, Safety and Efficacy of Neuroform for Treatment of intracranial Aneurysms	[Gentric, Jean-Christophe] CHUM Montreal, Neuroradiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gentric, Jean-Christophe] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, GETBO, EA 3878, Brest, France; [Biondi, Alessandra] CHU Besancon, Dept Neuroradiol & Endovasc Therapy, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Piotin, Michel] Fdn Ophtalmol Adolphe Rothschild, Neuroradiol, Paris, France; [Mounayer, Charbel] CHU Dupuytren, Neuroradiol, Limoges, France; [Lobotesis, Kyriakos] Charing Cross Hosp, Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, Dept Imaging, Paris, France; [Bonafe, Alain; Costalat, Vincent] CHU Montpellier, Neuroradiol, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France	Costalat, V (reprint author), CHU Montpellier, Hop Gui de Chauliac, Neuroradiol, Av Augustin Fliche, F-34295 Montpellier 5, France.	vincentcost@hotmail.fr		BONAFE, ALAIN/0000-0002-9187-1375	France Stryker	Alain Bonafe and Alessandra Biondi are the principal investigators of the SENAT study.

J	Bell, E				Bell, Emily			A Room with a View of Integrity and Professionalism: Personal Reflections on Teaching Responsible Conduct of Research in the Neurosciences	SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS			English	Article						Responsible conduct of research; Professionalism; Neuroscience; Neuroethics; Education	REPORTED GOALS; ETHICS; CANADA	Neuroscientists are increasingly put into situations which demand critical reflection about the ethical and appropriate use of research tools and scientific knowledge. Students or trainees also have to know how to navigate the ethical domains of this context. At a time when neuroscience is expected to advance policy and practice outcomes, in the face of academic pressures and complex environments, the importance of scientific integrity comes into focus and with it the need for training at the graduate level in the responsible conduct of research (RCR). I describe my experience teaching RCR in a graduate neuroscience program and identify three personal reflections where further dialogue could be warranted: (1) mobilizing a common set of competencies and virtues standing for professionalism in the neurosciences; (2) tailoring RCR for the neurosciences and empowering students through the active engagement of mentors; (3) soliciting shared responsibility for RCR training between disciplines, institutions and governmental or funding agencies.

Automatic Modulation Recognition in Wireless Multi-carrier Wireless Systems with Cepstral Features	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						ADMR; OFDM; MFCC; DT; SVM; RPROANN; AWGN; SDR		Automatic digital modulation recognition (ADMR) has become an interesting problem in wireless communication systems with various civil and military applications. In this paper, an ADMR algorithm is proposed for both orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and multi-carrier code division multiple access systems using discrete transforms and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The proposed algorithm uses one of the discrete cosine transform, discrete sine transform, and discrete wavelet transform with MFCCs to extract the modulated signal coefficients, and uses also either a support vector machine (SVM) or an artificial neural network (ANN) for modulation classification. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides higher recognition rates than those obtained in previous studies, in addition to a superiority of SVM performance compared to ANN performance at low signal-to-noise ratios.

In this paper, we present a microfluidic device for facilitating chemical testing using C. elegans. For testing chemicals on chip, the device houses single nematodes in microfluidic chambers and precisely adjusts the chamber's chemical environment during experiments. Eight nematodes can be readily loaded into the chambers through separate loading channels in a quick and gentle manner. In addition, a custom-made software with a graphic user interface is also created for quantitative analysis of locomotion parameters (swimming frequency and bend amplitude) of the nematodes in response to chemical stimuli, thus greatly enhancing the efficiency of data collection. We perform proof-of-concept experiments using two chemicals, zinc ion (Zn2+) and glucose, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the microfluidic device.

A post hoc analysis of integrated data from DEFINE and CONFIRM was conducted to determine the temporal profile of the clinical and neuroradiological effects of DMF. MethodsEligible patients were randomized to receive placebo, DMF 240mg twice (BID) or three times (TID) daily or glatiramer acetate (GA; reference comparator; CONFIRM only) for up to 96weeks. Patients in the GA group were excluded from this analysis. ResultsA total of 2301 patients were randomized and received treatment with placebo (n=771) or DMF BID (n=769) or TID (n=761). DMF significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate beginning in weeks 0-12 (BID, P=0.0159; TID, P=0.0314); the proportion of patients relapsed beginning at week 10 (BID, P=0.0427) and week 12 (TID, P=0.0451); and the proportion of patients with 12-week confirmed disability progression beginning at week 62 (BID, P=0.0454) and week 72 (TID, P=0.0399), compared with placebo. These effects were sustained throughout the 2-year study period. DMF significantly reduced the odds of having a higher number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions by 88% (BID) and 75% (TID) and the mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions by 72% (BID) and 67% (TID), from the first post-baseline magnetic resonance imaging assessment at 24weeks (all P<0.0001 versus placebo). ConclusionsIn phase 3 clinical trials, DMF demonstrated rapid and sustained clinical and neuroradiological efficacy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

The 2014 update of the Canadian Secondary Prevention of Stroke guideline is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based recommendations for clinicians in a range of settings, who provide care to patients following stroke. Notable changes in this 5th edition include an emphasis on treating the highest risk patients who present within 48h of symptom onset with transient or persistent motor or speech symptoms, who need to be transported to the closest emergency department with capacity for advanced stroke care; a recommendation for brain and vascular imaging (of the intra- and extracranial vessels) to be completed urgently using computed tomography/computed tomography angiography; prolonged cardiac monitoring for patients with suspective cardioembolic stroke but without evidence for atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram or holter monitoring; and de-emphasizing the need for routine echocardiogram. The CanadianStrokeBestPracticeRecommendations include a range of supporting materials such as implementation resources to facilitate the adoption of evidence to practice, and related performance measures to enable monitoring of uptake and effectiveness of the recommendations using a standardized approach.

Intriguingly, adolescence is a period of dynamic refinement in the organization of neuronal connectivity, in particular medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dopamine circuitry. The guidance cue receptor, DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), is highly expressed by dopamine neurons and orchestrates their innervation to the mPFC during adolescence. Furthermore, we have shown that amphetamine in adolescence regulates DCC expression in dopamine neurons. Drugs in adolescence may therefore induce their enduring behavioral effects via DCC-mediated disruption in mPFC dopamine development. In this study, we investigated the impact of repeated exposure to amphetamine during adolescence on both the development of mPFC dopamine connectivity and on salience attribution to drug context in adulthood. We compare these effects to those induced by adult exposure to an identical amphetamine regimen. Finally, we determine whether DCC signaling within dopamine neurons is necessary for these events. Exposure to amphetamine in adolescence, but not in adulthood, leads to an increase in the span of dopamine innervation to the mPFC, but a reduction of presynaptic sites present on these axons. Amphetamine treatment in adolescence, but not in adulthood, also produces an increase in salience attribution to a previously drug-paired context in adulthood. Remarkably, DCC signaling within dopamine neurons is required for both of these effects. Drugs of abuse in adolescence may therefore induce their detrimental behavioral consequences by disrupting mesocortical dopamine development through alterations in the DCC signaling cascade.

We report here that similar synchronous oscillatory events are recorded in the PC in response to single-shock, electrical stimuli delivered in LA. In addition, we found that the latency of these responses progressively increased when the stimulus interval was varied from 10 to 1 s; for example, the response latency during stimuli delivered at 1 Hz was more than twofold longer than that seen during stimulation at 0.1 Hz. This prolongation in latency occurred after approximately 5 stimuli, attained a steady value after 24-35 stimuli, and recovered to control values 30 s after stimulation arrest. These frequency-dependent changes in latency continued to occur during NMDA receptor antagonism but weakened following application of GABA(A) and/or GABA(B) receptor blockers. Our findings identify a new type of short-term plasticity that is mediated by GABA receptor function and may play a role in decreasing neuronal network synchronization during repeated activation. We propose that this frequency-dependent adaptive mechanism influences the excitability of limbic networks, thus potentially controlling epileptiform synchronization.

Astrocyte Overexpression of Heme Oxygenase-1 Improves Outcome After Intracerebral Hemorrhage	STROKE			English	Article						blood-brain barrier; heme oxygenase (decyclizing); ischemic preconditioning; stroke	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; EXPERIMENTAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; MURINE SPINAL-CORD; HEMOGLOBIN TOXICITY; OXIDATIVE INJURY; IN-VIVO; EXPRESSION; NEURONS; MICE; ISCHEMIA	Background and Purpose-Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction of heme breakdown and may have both antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects. In previous studies, HO-1 overexpression protected astrocytes from heme-mediated injury in vitro. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that selective astrocyte overexpression of HO-1 improves outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods-Male and female transgenic mice overexpressing human HO-1 driven by the GFAP promoter (GFAP.HMOX1) and wild-type controls received striatal injections of autologous blood (25 mu L). Blood-brain barrier disruption was assessed by Evans blue assay and striatal cell viability by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Neurological deficits were quantified by digital analysis of spontaneous cage activity, adhesive removal, and elevated body swing tests. Results-Mortality rate for wild-type mice was 34.8% and was similar for males and females; all GFAP.HMOX1 mice survived. Striatal Evans blue leakage at 24 hours was 23.4 +/- 3.2 ng in surviving wild-type mice, compared with 10.9 +/- 1.8 ng in transgenics. Perihematomal cell viability was reduced to 61 +/- 4% of contralateral at 3 days in wild-type mice, versus 80 +/- 4% in transgenics. Focal neurological deficits were significantly reduced and spontaneous cage activity was increased in GFAP.HMOX1 mice. Conclusions-Selective HO-1 overexpression in astrocytes reduces mortality, blood-brain barrier disruption, perihematomal cell injury, and neurological deficits in an autologous blood injection intracerebral hemorrhage model. Genetic or pharmacological therapies that acutely increase astrocyte HO-1 may be beneficial after intracerebral hemorrhage.

MethodA total of 1500 homeless adults with mental illness enrolled in the At Home Chez Soi study completed neuropsychological measures assessing speed of information processing, memory, and executive functioning. Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected. Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine factors associated with neurocognitive performance. ResultsApproximately half of our sample met criteria for psychosis, major depressive disorder, and alcohol or substance use disorder, and nearly half had experienced severe traumatic brain injury. Overall, 72% of participants demonstrated cognitive impairment, including deficits in processing speed (48%), verbal learning (71%) and recall (67%), and executive functioning (38%). The overall statistical model explained 19.8% of the variance in the neurocognitive summary score, with reduced neurocognitive performance associated with older age, lower education, first language other than English or French, Black or Other ethnicity, and the presence of psychosis. ConclusionHomeless adults with mental illness experience impairment in multiple neuropsychological domains. Much of the variance in our sample's cognitive performance remains unexplained, highlighting the need for further research in the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in this population.

The enzyme displays ribonucleolytic activity with a strong preference for uracil-containing RNA substrates, a feature only shared with human eosinophil derived-neurotoxin (EDN, or RNase 2) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP, or RNase 3). It is also the shortest member of the human family, with a significantly truncated C-terminal tail. Its unique active-site pocket and high degree of conservation among vertebrates suggest that the enzyme plays a crucial biological function. Here, we report on the H-1, C-13 and N-15 backbone resonance assignments of RNase 4, providing means to characterize its molecular function at the atomic level by NMR.

Susceptibility of Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) eggs to different life stages of three generalist predators	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							COLEOMEGILLA-MACULATA; PREY; HETEROPTERA; BEETLE; PLANT	The invasive stink bug Halyomorpha halys Stal (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) has recently become established in Canada, but little information is available regarding the ability of natural enemies to attack this pest in its invaded range. We tested the capacity of several life stages of three generalist predators, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), Coleomegilla maculata De Geer (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), to attack H. halys eggs. The relative susceptibility of H. halys eggs to predator attack was compared to P. maculiventris eggs. We found evidence for differential ability to consume H. halys and P. maculiventris eggs both among predator species and within species among life stages. The most H. halys eggs were consumed by late-instar C. carnea, while fewest were consumed by second-instar and adult C. maculata, and second-instar C. carnea. The susceptibility of H. halys eggs to predators was similar to that of P. maculiventris eggs, with only early-instar P. maculiventris nymphs consuming significantly less H. halys eggs than P. maculiventris eggs. Our results provide a baseline for further testing of generalist predators against H. halys and illustrate the potential importance of considering the breadth of ontogeny across which candidates are able to attack the invasive pest.

REDD2-mediated inhibition of mTOR promotes dendrite retraction induced by axonal injury	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION			English	Article							RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; MESSENGER-RNA TRANSLATION; OPTIC-NERVE; MAMMALIAN TARGET; RAPAMYCIN MTOR; EXPERIMENTAL GLAUCOMA; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS; SYNAPSE FORMATION; IN-VIVO	Dendritic defects occur in neurodegenerative diseases accompanied by axonopathy, yet the mechanisms that regulate these pathologic changes are poorly understood. Using Thy1-YFPH mice subjected to optic nerve axotomy, we demonstrate early retraction of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites and selective loss of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, which precede soma loss. Axonal injury triggered rapid upregulation of the stress-induced protein REDD2 (regulated in development and DNA damage response 2), a potent inhibitor of mTOR. Short interfering RNA-mediated REDD2 knockdown restored mTOR activity and rescued dendritic length, area and branch complexity in a rapamycin-dependent manner. Whole-cell recordings demonstrated that REDD2 depletion leading to mTOR activation in RGCs restored their light response properties. Lastly, we show that REDD2-dependent mTOR activity extended RGC survival following axonal damage. These results indicate that injury-induced stress leads to REDD2 upregulation, mTOR inhibition and dendrite pathology causing neuronal dysfunction and subsequent cell death.

In this paper, we bring together experts from psychology and neuroscience, with the aim of providing a succinct but comprehensive overview of key findings related to the involvement of the cerebellum in sensory perception. The contributions cover such topics as anatomical and functional connectivity, evolutionary and comparative perspectives, visual and auditory processing, biological motion perception, nociception, self-motion, timing, predictive processing, and perceptual sequencing. While no single explanation has yet emerged concerning the role of the cerebellum in perceptual processes, this consensus paper summarizes the impressive empirical evidence on this problem and highlights diversities as well as commonalities between existing hypotheses. In addition to work with healthy individuals and patients with cerebellar disorders, it is also apparent that several neurological conditions in which perceptual disturbances occur, including autism and schizophrenia, are associated with cerebellar pathology. A better understanding of the involvement of the cerebellum in perceptual processes will thus likely be important for identifying and treating perceptual deficits that may at present go unnoticed and untreated. This paper provides a useful framework for further debate and empirical investigations into the influence of the cerebellum on sensory perception.

We employed a multitarget rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) approach and examined the electrophysiological P3 component elicited by a target terminating an RSVP sequence. Target-locked P3 activity was detected both at frontal and parietal recording sites and an independent component analysis confirmed the presence of two distinct P3 components. The posterior P3b varied with intertarget lag, with diminished amplitude and postponed latency at short relative to long lagsan electroencephalographic signature of the attentional blink (AB). Under analogous conditions, the anterior P3a was also reduced in amplitude but did not vary in latency. Collectively, the results provide an electrophysiological record of the interaction between frontal and posterior components linked to detection (P3a) and encoding (P3b) of visual information. Our findings suggest that, although the AB delays target encoding into working memory, it does not slow down detection of a target but instead reduces the efficacy of this process. A functional characterization of P3a in attentive tasks is discussed with reference to current models of the AB phenomenon.

Firstly, an artificial intelligence methodology is presented for partitioning the Hydro-Quebec network into smaller and separated areas. The proposed methodology uses a self-organizing map (SOM) and is based on an original concept in which competitive and learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural networks are used to partition the power system. Secondly, pilot buses are chosen to represent the most controllable buses in each area. Finally, discrete controllers are designed to overcome and avoid propagation of disturbances on the network. The proposed methodology and the results obtained with the Hydro-Quebec network are presented in this paper and show the effectiveness and performance of the controllers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: At 5 ICUs, we administered a questionnaire daily to nurses and physicians, asking whether they liked using the assigned strategy, reasons for their responses, and concerns regarding DI. Results: A total of 301 questionnaires were completed, for 31 patients (15 protocol only and 16 DI); 117 (59 physicians and 58 nurses) were the first questionnaire completed by that health care provider for that patient and were included in analyses. Most respondents liked using the assigned strategy (81% protocol only and 81% DI); more physicians than nurses liked DI (100% vs 61%; P < .001). Most common reasons for liking the assigned sedation strategy were better neurologic assessment (70% DI), ease of use (58% protocol only), and improved patient outcomes (51% protocol only and 44% DI). Only 19% of clinicians disliked the assigned sedation strategy (equal numbers for protocol only and DI). Respondents' concerns during DI were respiratory compromise (61%), pain (48%), agitation (45%), and device removal (26%). More questionnaires from nurses than physicians expressed concerns about DI. Conclusions: Most respondents liked both sedation strategies. Nurses and physicians had different preferences and rationales for liking or disliking each strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Dopamine neurons burst fire in response to unexpected rewards and pause following negative outcomes. This dual signaling mechanism is hypothesized to drive both approach and avoidance behavior. Here we test a prediction deriving from a computational reinforcement learning model, in which approach is mediated via activation of the direct cortico-striatal pathway due to striatal D1 receptor stimulation, while avoidance occurs via disinhibition of indirect pathway striatal neurons secondary to a reduction of D2 receptor stimulation. Using positron emission tomography with two separate radioligands, we demonstrate that individual differences in human approach and avoidance learning are predicted by variability in striatal D1 and D2 receptor binding, respectively. Moreover, transient dopamine precursor depletion improved learning from negative outcomes. These findings support a bidirectional modulatory role for striatal dopamine in reward and avoidance learning via segregated D1 and D2 cortico-striatal pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in the pgACC is associated with decision-making behavior, knowledge regarding the relationship of GABA concentrations in subdivisions of the ACC with gambling task performance is still limited. The aim of our magnetic resonance spectroscopy study is to investigate in 20 healthy males the relationship of concentrations of GABA and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) in the pgACC, mid-ACC, and occipital cortex (OC) with multiple indexes of decision-making behavior under conditions of risk, using the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT). The GABA/creatine (Cr) ratio in the pgACC negatively correlated with delay aversion score, which corresponds to the impulsivity index. The Glx/Cr ratio in the pgACC negatively correlated with risk adjustment score, which is reported to reflect the ability to change the amount of the bet depending on the probability of winning or losing. The scores of CGT did not significantly correlate with the GABA/Cr or Glx/Cr ratio in the mid-ACC or OC. Results of this study suggest that in the pgACC, but not in the mid-ACC or OC, GABA and Glx concentrations play a distinct role in regulating impulsiveness and risk probability during decision-making behavior under conditions of risk, respectively.

Heightened graft failure risk during emerging adulthood and transition to adult care	PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY			English	Review						Emerging adulthood; Kidney transplantation; Transfer; Adherence; Risk	CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; SOLID-ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION; STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; MEDICATION ADHERENCE; ADOLESCENT BRAIN; CHRONIC ILLNESS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; RECIPIENTS; OUTCOMES; NONCOMPLIANCE	Emerging adulthood, defined as the interval between 18 and 25 years of age, is a socially-defined developmental stage. Although people in this age group appear physically mature, brain maturation is not complete until the end of this period. Perhaps due to this immaturity and a resulting inferior ability to manage chronic illness emerging adults with a variety of chronic health conditions are at a high risk for adverse outcomes. In this review I will summarize evidence that emerging adulthood constitutes a high-risk period for kidney transplant recipients, and consider the possible reasons for the spike in graft failure risk during this age interval-including age-related adherence behaviour and the changes in care organization, processes and structures associated with transfer from pediatric to adult-oriented care. I will also discuss evidence showing transfer from pediatric to adult-oriented care contributes to this elevated risk, and highlight the limitations and challenges of studies examining this question. Finally, I will direct readers to resources providing guidance on the best practices for care of patients transitioning to adult care.

The same is true of addiction to videogames (Hellman, Schoenmakers, Nordstrom, & Van Hoist 2013; Coulombe 2010); or to Facebook (Andreassen et al., 2012; Levard & Soulas, 2010). While certain researchers wished to see this condition included in the DSM-5 (Block, 2008), others question the operational and practical bases for the diagnostic criteria. Some see cyberaddiction as a problem linked more to time management, to brain deficits, to an impulse-control disorder or to psychosocial conditions while others consider it to be a pre-existing comorbidity. Considering that most addiction problems are generally understood more as individual and pathological problems rather than the result of psychosocial conditions (poverty, unemployment, weak social ties, social exclusion, hyper individualism, etc), the aim of this article is to propose a psychosocial perspective for this emerging trend in cyberaddictions. To what extent social conditions and cyberaddiction behaviors constitute a potential pathology? Can we include a psychosocial approach to gain a more general picture of this contemporary issue? In response to these questions, a contextualization and an attempt to define cyberaddiction will be followed by an analysis of some major issues in the development of this type of addiction. A demonstration of the cycle of addiction on how people develop addictions, including cyberaddictions, will be done within a psychosocial perspective in order to seize the multifactorial aspects of this addiction.

Evidence-based guideline summary: Evaluation, diagnosis, and management of congenital muscular dystrophy Report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Issues Review Panel of the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							WALKER-WARBURG-SYNDROME; EYE-BRAIN DISEASE; DEFECTIVE GLYCOSYLATION; ALPHA-DYSTROGLYCAN; POMT1 GENE; MUTATIONS; MUSCLE; DEFICIENCY; PHENOTYPE; VI	Objective: To delineate optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) through a systematic review and analysis of the currently available literature. Methods: Relevant, peer-reviewed research articles were identified using a literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases. Diagnostic and therapeutic data from these articles were extracted and analyzed in accordance with the American Academy of Neurology classification of evidence schemes for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic studies. Recommendations were linked to the strength of the evidence, other related literature, and general principles of care. Results: The geographic and ethnic backgrounds, clinical features, brain imaging studies, muscle imaging studies, and muscle biopsies of children with suspected CMD help predict subtype-specific diagnoses. Genetic testing can confirm some subtype-specific diagnoses, but not all causative genes for CMD have been described. Seizures and respiratory complications occur in specific subtypes. There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of various treatment interventions to optimize respiratory, orthopedic, and nutritional outcomes, and more data are needed regarding complications. Recommendations: Multidisciplinary care by experienced teams is important for diagnosing and promoting the health of children with CMD. Accurate assessment of clinical presentations and genetic data will help in identifying the correct subtype-specific diagnosis in many cases. Multi-organ system complications occur frequently; surveillance and prompt interventions are likely to be beneficial for affected children. More research is needed to fill gaps in knowledge regarding this category of muscular dystrophies.

Twenty normal controls (NC), 20 mild (MP) and 17 severe (SP) POAG patients were recruited and scanned using magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical thickness analyses with regions of interest (V1, V2, ventral V3, V4 and V5/MT+) were used to assess the cortical changes among the three groups. Furthermore, the associations of cortical thickness with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and mean deviation of visual field were analyzed. Compared with the NC group, decreased cortical thickness was detected in the bilateral V5/MT+ areas in the MP group and the left V1, bilateral V2 and V5/MT+ areas in the SP group. Cortical thinning of the bilateral V2 areas was detected in the SP group compared with the MP group. In addition, cortical thinning of these visual areas was related to the ophthalmologic measurements. In conclusion, POAG patients exhibit cortical thinning in the bilateral V5/MT+ in the early stage of disease. The cortical degeneration in visual areas is discrepant with disease progressing and the dorsal pathway might be selectively damaged in POAG. Therefore, the cortical thinning of these visual areas may play a key role in the progression of POAG and can serve as a novel biomarker for accurately evaluating the severity of POAG.

FALS Sequencing Consortium	Exome sequencing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis identifies risk genes and pathways	SCIENCE			English	Article							AUTOPHAGY RECEPTOR; SPASTIN GENE; D-SERINE; OPTINEURIN; MUTATIONS; ALS; GRANULES; DISEASE; BINDING; PROTEIN	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurological disease with no effective treatment. We report the results of a moderate-scale sequencing study aimed at increasing the number of genes known to contribute to predisposition for ALS. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 2869 ALS patients and 6405 controls. Several known ALS genes were found to be associated, and TBK1 (the gene encoding TANK-binding kinase 1) was identified as an ALS gene. TBK1 is known to bind to and phosphorylate a number of proteins involved in innate immunity and autophagy, including optineurin (OPTN) and p62 (SQSTM1/sequestosome), both of which have also been implicated in ALS. These observations reveal a key role of the autophagic pathway in ALS and suggest specific targets for therapeutic intervention.

Loss of dysbindin-1, a risk gene for schizophrenia, leads to impaired group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor function in mice	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						schizophrenia; animal model; cognition; memory; hippocampus; synaptic plasticity	POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MESSENGER-RNA; DEVELOPMENTAL DISRUPTION; NMDA RECEPTOR; DTNBP1; EXPRESSION; MEMORY; PLASTICITY	The expression of dysbindin-1, a protein coded by the risk gene dtnbp1is reduced in the brains of schizophrenia patients. Evidence indicates a role of dysbindin-1in dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission. Glutamatergic transmission and plasticity at excitatory synapses is critically regulated by G-protein coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) family members, that have been implicated in schizophrenia. Here, we report a role of dysbindin-1in hippocampal group 1mGluR (mGluRI) function in mice. In hippocampal synaptoneurosomal preparations from sandy (sdy) mice, that have a loss of function mutation in dysbindin-1gene, we observed a striking reduction in rhGluR1agonist [(S)-3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine] (DHPG)-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). This mGluR-ERK1/2 deficit occurred in the absence of significant changes in protein levels of the two members of the mGluRI family (i.e., mGluR1and mGluR5) or in another mGluRI signaling pathway, i.e., protein kinase C (PKC). Aberrant mGluRI-ERK1/2 signaling affected hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the sdy mutants as DHPG-induced long-term depression (LTD) at CA1 excitatory synapses was significantly reduced. Behavioral data suggest that the mGluRI hypofunction may underlie some of the cognitive abnormalities described in sdy mice as the administration of CDPPB (3-cyano-N-(1, 3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl benzamide), a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR5, rescued short-term object recognition and spatial learning and memory deficits in these mice. Taken together, our data suggest a novel role of dysbindin-1in regulating mGluRI functions.

Because of limited earlier epidemiological studies with birth cohort follow up design, it still remains inconclusive that either the associations of cord blood level of toxic, and essential elements, and postnatal raising environment on neurodevelopment of children remains constant throughout childhood or change over time. Aims This study aims to investigate the influence of in utero toxic [lead (Pb) and arsenic (As)] and essential elements [zinc (Zn)] levels on neurodevelopment of 36 months children in Chitwan valley, Nepal taking the postnatal environment into account. Study Designs and Subjects In this birth cohort study, participants (N= 100 mother-infants' pairs) were recruited in Chitwan district, Nepal. We measured Pb, As and Zn concentrations in cord blood. Postnatal raising environment (i.e., Home score or home environment hereafter) was evaluated using Home Observation for Measurement of Environment (HOME) scale. Neurodevelopment of children at 36 months of age (n=70) were assessed using Bayley Scale of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID II). Multivariate regression was performed (n=70) to see the association of in utero toxic and essential elements level and home environment with neurodevelopment score adjusted for covariates. Results Cord blood levels of Pb, As and Zn were not associated with any BSID II cluster scores of 36 months children. The children with relatively superior HOME score and concurrent nutritional status (weight at 36 months) showed better cognitive development (i.e., MDI scores) and motor functions than their counterparts, respectively. Conclusion In this general population in Nepal, prenatal Pb, As and Zn levels are not important determinants of the neurodevelopment of 36-month-old children while a consistent beneficial effect of a stimulating home environment on neurodevelopmental indicators is continued.

We have previously hypothesized that the altered excitability of hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifests as increased in vivo susceptibility to seizures in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD, may be related to disruption of hippocampal GABAergic neurons. In agreement, our previous study in TgCRND8 mice has shown that hippocampal GABAergic neurons are more vulnerable to AD-related neuropathology than other types of neurons. To further explore the mechanisms behind the observed decrease of GABAergic neurons in 6 month old TgCRND8 mice, we assessed the relative proportion of somatostatin (SOM), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and paravalbumin (PV) sub-types of GABAergic neurons at the regional and sub-regional level of the hippocampus. We found that NPY expressing GABAergic neurons were the most affected, as they were decreased in CA1-CA2 (pyramidal-, stratum oriens, stratum radiatum and molecular layers), CA3 (specifically in the stratum oriens) and dentate gyrus (specifically in the polymorphic layer) in TgCRND8 mice as compared to non-transgenic controls. SOM expressing GABAergic neurons were decreased in CA1-CA2 (specifically in the stratum oriens) and in the stratum radiatum of CA3, whereas PV neurons were significantly altered in stratum oriens sub-region of CA3. Taken together, these data provide new evidence for the relevance of hippocampal GABAergic neuronal network disruption as a mechanism underlying AD sequelae such as aberrant neuronal excitability, and further point to complex hippocampal regional and sub regional variation in susceptibility to AD related neuronal loss.

What are the mechanisms that mediate the long-term consequences of painful experiences and embed them in the genome? We hypothesize that alterations in DNA methylation, an enzymatic covalent modification of cytosine bases in DNA, serve as a "genomic" memory of pain in the adult cortex. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism for long-term regulation of gene expression. Neuronal plasticity at the neuroanatomical, functional, morphological, physiological and molecular levels has been demonstrated throughout the neuroaxis in response to persistent pain, including in the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC). We have previously reported widespread changes in gene expression and DNA methylation in the PFC many months following peripheral nerve injury. In support of this hypothesis, we show here that up-regulation of a gene involved with synaptic function, Synaptotagmin II (syt2), in the PFC in a chronic pain model is associated with long-term changes in DNA methylation. The challenges of understanding the contributions of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation within the PFC to pain chronicity and their therapeutic implications are discussed.

Most studies focus on how supralinear summation of excitatory synaptic responses arising from clustered inputs within single dendrites result in the enhancement of neuronal firing, enabling simple computations such as feature detection. Recent reports have shown that sublinear summation is also a prominent dendritic operation, extending the range of subthreshold input-output (sI/O) transformations conferred by dendrites. Like supralinear operations, sublinear dendritic operations also increase the repertoire of neuronal computations, but feature extraction requires different synaptic connectivity strategies for each of these operations. In this article we will review the experimental and theoretical findings describing the biophysical determinants of the three primary classes of dendritic operations: linear, sublinear, and supralinear. We then review a Boolean algebra-based analysis of simplified neuron models, which provides insight into how dendritic operations influence neuronal computations. We highlight how neuronal computations are critically dependent on the interplay of dendritic properties (morphology and voltage-gated channel expression), spiking threshold and distribution of synaptic inputs carrying particular sensory features. Finally, we describe how global (scattered) and local (clustered) integration strategies permit the implementation of similar classes of computations, one example being the object feature binding problem.

In the visual cortex, neurons are organized into orientation columns. In a column, most neurons respond optimally to the same axis of an oriented edge, that is, the preferred orientation. This orientation selectivity is believed to be absolute in adulthood. However, in a fully mature brain, it has been established that neurons change their selectivity following sensory experience or visual adaptation. Here, we show that after applying an adapter away from the tested cells, neurons whose receptive fields were located remotely from the adapted site also exhibit a novel selectivity in spite of the fact that they were not adapted. These results indicate a robust reconfiguration and remapping of the orientation domains with respect to each other thus removing the possibility of an orientation hole in the new hypercolumn. These data suggest that orientation columns transcend anatomy, and are almost strictly functionally dynamic.

An original model consists of the parasitoid Dinocampus coccinellae and its coccinellid host, Coleomegilla maculata; during the behaviour manipulation, the parasitoid is not in contact with its host anymore. We report herein the discovery and characterization of a new RNA virus of the parasitoid (D. coccinellae paralysis virus, DcPV). Using a combination of RT-qPCR and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that DcPV is stored in the oviduct of parasitoid females, replicates in parasitoid larvae and is transmitted to the host during larval development. Next, DcPV replication in the host's nervous tissue induces a severe neuropathy and antiviral immune response that correlate with the paralytic symptoms characterizing the behaviour manipulation. Remarkably, virus clearance correlates with recovery of normal coccinellid behaviour. These results provide evidence that changes in ladybeetle behaviour most likely result from DcPV replication in the cerebral ganglia rather than by manipulation by the parasitoid. This offers stimulating prospects for research on parasitic manipulation by suggesting for the first time that behaviour manipulation could be symbiont-mediated.

On this basis, a combinatorial cadherin code has long been proposed to underlie neuronal sorting and to be ultimately responsible for the layers, columns and nuclei of the brain. However, experimental proof of this particular function of cadherins has proven difficult to obtain and the question is still not clear. Alternatively, non-specific, non combinatorial, purely quantitative adhesive differentials have been proposed to explain neuronal sorting in the brain. Do cadherin combinations underlie brain cytoarchitecture? We approached this question using as model a well-defined forebrain nucleus, the mammillary body (MBO), which shows strong, homogeneous expression of one single cadherin (Cdh11) and patterned, combinatorial expression of Cdh6, -8 and -10. We found that, besides the known combinatorial Colh pattern, MBO cells are organized into a second, nonoverlapping pattern grouping neurons with the same date of neurogenesis. We report that, in the Foxbl mouse mutant, Cdh1 expression fails to be maintained during MBO development. This disrupted the combination-based as well as the birthdate-based sorting in the mutant MAO. In utero RNA interference (RNAi) experiments knocking down Cdh11 in MBO-fated migrating neurons at one specific age showed that Cdh11 expression is required for chronological entrance in the MBO. Our results suggest that neuronal sorting in the developing MAO is caused by adhesion-based, noncombinatorial mechanisms that keep neurons sorted according to birthdate information (possibly matching them to target neurons chronologically sorted in the same manner). Non-specific adhesion mechanisms would also prevent cadherin combinations from altering the birthdate-based sorting. Cadherin combinations would presumably act later to support specific synaptogenesis through specific axonal fasciculation and final target recognition.

Our recent work showed that Nlgn1 knockout (KO) mice cannot sustain neuronal activity occurring during wakefulness for a prolonged period of time. Since NMDAR-dependent neuronal activity drives an important vascular response, we used multispectral optical imaging to determine if the hemodynamic response to neuronal stimulation is modified in Nlgn1 KO mice. We observed that Nlgn1 KO mice show a 10% lower response rate to forepaw electrical stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) and heterozygote (HET) littermates on both the contra-and ipsilateral sides of the somatosensory cortex. Moreover, Nlgn1 mutant mice showed an earlier oxyhemoglobin peak response that tended to return to baseline faster than in WT mice. Analysis of the time course of the hemodynamic response also showed that HET mice express a faster dynamics of cerebrovascular response in comparison to WT. Taken together, these data are indicative of an altered immediate response of the brain to peripheral stimulation in Nlgn1 KO mice, and suggest a role for NLGN1 in the regulation of cerebrovascular responses.

Without it no music: cognition, biology and evolution of musicality Introduction	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						musicality; music perception; music cognition; evolution of music; multicomponent view	ORIGINS; INNATENESS; TRAIT; BEAT	Musicality can be defined as a natural, spontaneously developing trait based on and constrained by biology and cognition. Music, by contrast, can be defined as a social and cultural construct based on that very musicality. One critical challenge is to delineate the constituent elements of musicality. What biological and cognitive mechanisms are essential for perceiving, appreciating and making music? Progress in understanding the evolution of music cognition depends upon adequate characterization of the constituent mechanisms of musicality and the extent to which they are present in non-human species. We argue for the importance of identifying these mechanisms and delineating their functions and developmental course, as well as suggesting effective means of studying them in human and non-human animals. It is virtually impossible to underpin the evolutionary role of musicality as a whole, but a multicomponent perspective on musicality that emphasizes its constituent capacities, development and neural cognitive specificity is an excellent starting point for a research programme aimed at illuminating the origins and evolution of musical behaviour as an autonomous trait.

Neural overlap in processing music and speech	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						neural overlap; music; speech; fMRI	VOXEL PATTERN-ANALYSIS; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; OPERA HYPOTHESIS; FMRI DATA; LANGUAGE; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATION; COMMUNICATION; ACTIVATIONS	Neural overlap in processing music and speech, as measured by the co-activation of brain regions in neuroimaging studies, may suggest that parts of the neural circuitries established for language may have been recycled during evolution for musicality, or vice versa that musicality served as a springboard for language emergence. Such a perspective has important implications for several topics of general interest besides evolutionary origins. For instance, neural overlap is an important premise for the possibility of music training to influence language acquisition and literacy. However, neural overlap in processing music and speech does not entail sharing neural circuitries. Neural separability between music and speech may occur in overlapping brain regions. In this paper, we review the evidence and outline the issues faced in interpreting such neural data, and argue that converging evidence from several methodologies is needed before neural overlap is taken as evidence of sharing.

Increasing sample size at the time of health assessment would be beneficial If predictive tools could reliably back-extrapolate prenatal levels in newly enrolled children.. We evaluated the performance of three approaches to back-extrapolate prenatal levels of p,p'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and four polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners from maternal and/or child levels 9 years after delivery: a pharmacokinetic model and predictive models using deletion/substitution/addition or Super Learner algorithms. Model performance was assessed uSing the root mean squared error (RMSE), R-2, and slope and intercept of the back-extrapolated versus measured levels. Super Learner outperformed the Other approaches with RMSEs Of 0,10 to 0.31, R(2)s of 0.58 to 0.97, slopes of 0.42 to 0.93 and intercepts of 0.08 to 0.60. Typically, models performed better for p,p'-DDT/E than PBDE congeners. The pharmacokinetic model performed well when back-extrapolating prenatal levels from maternal levels for compounds with longer half-lives like p,p'-DDE and BDE-153. Results demonstrate the ability to reliably back-extrapolate prenatal POP levels from levels 9 years after delivery, with Super Learner performing best based on our fit criteria.

Serotonin is also crucial for brain development. For instance, animal studies have demonstrated that early disruptions in the serotonin system affect brain development and emotion regulation in later life. A plausible explanation is that environmental stressors reprogram the serotonin system through epigenetic processes by altering serotonin system gene expression. This in turn may affect brain development, including the hippocampus, a region with dense serotonergic innervations and important in stress-regulation. The aim of this study was to test whether greater DNA methylation in specific CpG sites at the serotonin transporter promoter in peripheral cells is associated with childhood trauma, depression, and smaller hippocampal volume. We were particularly interested in those CpG sites whose state of methylation in peripheral cells had previously been associated with in vivo measures of brain serotonin synthesis. Thirty-three adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (23 females) and 36 matched healthy controls (21 females) were included in the study. Depressive symptoms, childhood trauma, and high-resolution structural MRI for hippocampal volume were assessed. Sitespecific serotonin transporter methylation was assessed using pyrosequencing. Childhood trauma, being male, and smaller hippocampal volume were independently associated with greater peripheral serotonin transporter methylation. Greater serotonin transporter methylation in the depressed group was observed only in SSRI-treated patients. These results suggest that serotonin transporter methylation may be involved in physiological gene-environment interaction in the development of stress-related brain alterations. The results provide some indications that site-specific serotonin transporter methylation may be a biomarker for serotonin-associated stress-related psychopathology.

Parkinson risk in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder Preparing for neuroprotective trials	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; IMPENDING NEURODEGENERATION; DELAYED EMERGENCE; COLOR-VISION; TASK-FORCE; DISEASE; DEMENTIA; PERSONALITY; STATEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Objective:To precisely delineate clinical risk factors for conversion from idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) to Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, in order to enable practical planning and stratification of neuroprotective trials against neurodegenerative synucleinopathy.Methods:In a 10-year prospective cohort, we tested prodromal Parkinson disease markers in 89 patients with idiopathic RBD. With Kaplan-Meier analysis, we calculated risk of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, and using Cox proportional hazards, tested the ability of prodromal markers to identify patients at higher disease risk. By combining predictive markers, we then designed stratification strategies to optimally select patients for definitive neuroprotective trials.Results:The risk of defined neurodegenerative synucleinopathy was high: 30% developed disease at 3 years, rising to 66% at 7.5 years. Advanced age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07), olfactory loss (HR = 2.8), abnormal color vision (HR = 3.1), subtle motor dysfunction (HR = 3.9), and nonuse of antidepressants (HR = 3.5) identified higher risk of disease conversion. However, mild cognitive impairment (HR = 1.8), depression (HR = 0.63), Parkinson personality, treatment with clonazepam (HR = 1.3) or melatonin (HR = 0.55), autonomic markers, and sex (HR = 1.37) did not clearly predict clinical neurodegeneration. Stratification with prodromal markers increased risk of neurodegenerative disease conversion by 200%, and combining markers allowed sample size reduction in neuroprotective trials by >40%. With a moderately effective agent (HR = 0.5), trials with fewer than 80 subjects per group can demonstrate definitive reductions in neurodegenerative disease.Conclusions:Using stratification with simply assessed markers, it is now not only possible, but practical to include patients with RBD in neuroprotective trials against Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Different Trigeminal Chemoreceptors Share the Same Central Pathway	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; OLFACTORY FUNCTION; CHEMICAL SENSES; HUMAN AWARENESS; IMAGING DATA; ION-CHANNEL; TRP CHANNEL; PAIN; STIMULI	Intranasal trigeminal sensations are important in everyday life of human beings, as they play a governing role in protecting the airways from harm. Trigeminal sensations arise from the binding of a ligand to various sub-types of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels located on mucosal branches of the trigeminal nerve. Which underlying neural networks are involved in the processing of various trigeminal inputs is still unknown. To target this unresolved question fourteen healthy human subjects were investigated by completing three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning sessions during which three trigeminal substances, activating varying sub-types of chemoreceptors and evoking different sensations in the nose were presented: CO2, menthol and cinnamaldehyde. We identified similar functional networks responding to all stimuli: an olfactory network, a somatosensory network and an integrative network. The processing pathway of all three stimulants was represented by the same functional networks, although CO2 evokes painful but virtually odor-less sensations, and the two other stimulants, menthol and cinnamaldehyde are perceived as mostly non painful with a clear olfactory percept. Therefore, our results suggest a common central processing pathway for trigeminal information regardless of the trigeminal chemoreceptor and sensation type.

Before being secreted by osteoblasts in the bone extracellular matrix, OCN is gamma-carboxylated by the gamma-carboxylase (GGCX) on three glutamic acid residues, a cellular process requiring reduction of vitamin K (VK) by a second enzyme, a reductase called VKORC1. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that gamma-carboxylation may inhibit OCN endocrine functions, genetic evidence that it is the case is still lacking. Here we show using cell-specific gene inactivation models that gamma-carboxylation of OCN by GGCX inhibits its endocrine function. We further show that VKORC1 is required for OCN gamma-carboxylation in osteoblasts, whereas its paralogue, VKORC1L1, is dispensable for this function and cannot compensate for the absence of VKORC1 in osteoblasts. This study genetically and biochemically delineates the functions of the enzymes required for OCN modification and demonstrates that it is the uncarboxylated form of OCN that acts as a hormone.

We tracked the behavioral, structural, and neurofunctional changes occurring in an early and severely visually impaired patient before and 1.5 and 7 mo after sight restoration with magnetic resonance imaging. Robust presurgical auditory responses were found in occipital cortex despite residual preoperative vision. In primary visual cortex, crossmodal auditory responses overlapped with visual responses and remained elevated even 7 mo after surgery. However, these crossmodal responses decreased in extrastriate occipital regions after surgery, together with improved behavioral vision and with increases in both gray matter density and neural activation in low-level visual regions. Selective responses in high-level visual regions involved in motion and face processing were observable even before surgery and did not evolve after surgery. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that structural and functional reorganization of occipital regions are present in an individual with a long-standing history of severe visual impairment and that such reorganizations can be partially reversed by visual restoration in adulthood.

It is well established that inter-and intralimb coordination show considerable variations during ongoing locomotion. Much less is known about the flexibility of the axial musculoskeletal system during locomotion and the neural mechanisms involved. Here we examined this issue in the salamander Pleurodeles waltlii, which is capable of locomotion in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Kinematics of the trunk and electromyograms from the mid-trunk epaxial myotomes were recorded during four locomotor behaviors in freely moving animals. A similar approach was used during rhythmic struggling movements since this would give some insight into the flexibility of the axial motor system. Our results show that each of the forms of locomotion and the struggling behavior is characterized by a distinct combination of mid-trunk motor patterns and cycle durations. Using in vitro electrophysiological recordings in isolated spinal cords, we observed that the spinal networks activated with bath-applied N-methylD- aspartate could generate these axial motor patterns. In these isolated spinal cord preparations, the limb motor nerve activities were coordinated with each mid-trunk motor pattern. Furthermore, isolated mid-trunk spinal cords and hemicords could generate the mid-trunk motor patterns. This indicates that each side of the cord comprises a network able to generate coordinated axial motor activity. The roles of descending and sensory inputs in the behavior-related changes in axial motor coordination are discussed.	[Ryczko, D.; Lamarque, S.; Mathou, A.; Cabelguen, J.

Converging evidence from patients with psychiatric disorders and use of antipsychotics suggests that imbalance of dopamine signaling deeply alters hippocampal functions. However, given the lack of full characterization of a functional mesohippocampal pathway, the precise role of dopamine transmission in memory deficits associated with these disorders and their dedicated therapies is unknown. In particular, the positive outcome of antipsychotic treatments, commonly antagonizing D-2 dopamine receptors (D2Rs), on cognitive deficits and memory impairments remains questionable. METHODS: Following pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of dopamine transmission, we performed anatomic, neurochemical, electrophysiologic, and behavioral investigations to uncover the role of D2Rs in hippocampaldependent plasticity and learning. Naive mice (n = 4-21) were used in the different procedures. RESULTS: Dopamine modulated both long-term potentiation and long-term depression in the temporal hippocampus as well as spatial and recognition learning and memory in mice through D2Rs. Although genetic deletion or pharmacologic blockade of D2Rs led to the loss of long-term potentiation expression, the specific genetic removal of presynaptic D2Rs impaired long-term depression and performances on spatial memory tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Presynaptic D2Rs in dopamine fibers of the temporal hippocampus tightly modulate long-term depression expression and play a major role in the regulation of hippocampal learning and memory. This direct role of mesohippocampal dopamine input as uncovered here adds a new dimension to dopamine involvement in the physiology underlying deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

The multivalent chromatin regulator BRPF1 (bromodomain- and plant homeodomain-linked (PHD) zinc finger-containing protein 1) recognizes different epigenetic marks and activates three histone acetyltransferases, so it is both a reader and a co-writer of the epigenetic language. The three histone acetyltransferases are MOZ, MORF, and HBO1, which are also known as lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A), KAT6B, and KAT7, respectively. The MORF gene is mutated in four neurodevelopmental disorders sharing the characteristic of intellectual disability and frequently displaying callosal agenesis. Here, we report that forebrain-specific inactivation of the mouse Brpf1 gene caused early postnatal lethality, neocortical abnormalities, and partial callosal agenesis. With respect to the control, the mutant forebrain contained fewer Tbr2-positive intermediate neuronal progenitors and displayed aberrant neurogenesis. Molecularly, Brpf1 loss led to decreased transcription of multiple genes, such as Robo3 and Otx1, important for neocortical development. Surprisingly, elevated expression of different Hox genes and various other transcription factors, such as Lhx4, Foxa1, Tbx5, and Twist1, was also observed. These results thus identify an important role of Brpf1 in regulating forebrain development and suggest that it acts as both an activator and a silencer of gene expression in vivo.

Previous studies have suggested that iron overload can suppress the generation of a cytotoxic immune response; however, the effect of iron on experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) is yet unknown. Here we determined that the incidence of ECM was markedly reduced in mice treated with iron dextran. Protection was concomitant with a significant decrease in the sequestration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells within the brain. CD4(+) T cells demonstrated markedly decreased CXCR3 expression and had reduced IFN gamma-responsiveness, as indicated by mitigated expression of IFN gamma R2 and T-bet. Additional analysis of the splenic cell populations indicated that parenteral iron supplementation was also associated with a decrease in NK cells and increase in regulatory T cells. Altogether, these results suggest that iron is able to inhibit ECM pathology by attenuating the capacity of T cells to migrate to the brain.

These cannabinoid receptors have been well characterized in rodent and monkey retinae. Here, we investigated the expression and localization of the eCB system beyond the retina, namely the first thalamic relay, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), of vervet monkeys using immunohistochemistry methods. Our results show that CB1R is expressed throughout the dLGN with more prominent labeling in the magnocellular layers. The same pattern is observed for the degradation enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). However, the synthesizing enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) is expressed homogenously throughout the dLGN with no preference for any of the layers. These proteins are weakly expressed in the koniocellular layers. These results suggest that the presence of the eCB system throughout the layers of the dLGN may represent a novel site of neuro-modulatory action in normal vision. The larger amount of CB1R in the dLGN magnocellular layers may explain some of the behavioral effects of cannabinoids associated with the integrity of the dorsal visual pathway that plays a role in visual-spatial localization and motion perception.

In macaques, 2/3 of the STG is occupied by an auditory cortical region, the "parabelt," which is part of a network of inferior temporal areas subserving communication and social cognition as well as object recognition and other functions. However, due to its location beneath the squamous temporal bone and temporalis muscle, the STG, like other inferior temporal regions, has been a challenging target for physiological studies in awake-behaving macaques. We designed a new procedure for implanting recording chambers to provide direct access to the STG, allowing us to evaluate neuronal properties and their topography across the full extent of the STG in awake-behaving macaques. Initial surveys of the STG have yielded several new findings. Unexpectedly, STG sites in monkeys that were listening passively responded to tones with magnitudes comparable to those of responses to 1/3 octave band-pass noise. Mapping results showed longer response latencies in more rostral sites and possible tonotopic patterns parallel to core and belt areas, suggesting the reversal of gradients between caudal and rostral parabelt areas. These results will help further exploration of parabelt areas.

Local Population Synchrony and the Encoding of Eye Position in the Primate Neural Integrator	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						correlations; electrophysiology; prepositus; simultaneous recordings	HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; NUCLEUS-PREPOSITUS; ALERT CAT; ANATOMICAL CONNECTIONS; DISCHARGE DYNAMICS; ABDUCENS NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; NETWORK MODEL; NEURONS; OCULOMOTOR	Encoding horizontal eye position in the oculomotor system occurs through temporal integration of eye velocity inputs to produce tonic outputs. The nucleus prepositus is commonly believed to be the "neural integrator" that accomplishes this function through the activity of its ensemble of predominantly burst-tonic neurons. Single-unit characterizations and labeling studies of these neurons have suggested that their collective output is achieved through local feedback loops produced by direct connections between them. If this is the case, then the ensemble of burst-tonic neurons should exhibit correlated activity. To obtain electrophysiological evidence of local interactions between neurons, we simultaneously recorded pairs (n = 29) of burst-tonic neurons in the nucleus prepositus of rhesus macaque monkeys using eight-channel linear microelectrode arrays. We computed the magnitude of synchrony between their spike trains as a function of eye position during ocular fixations and as a function of distance between neurons. Importantly, we found that neurons exhibit unexpected levels of positive synchrony, which is maximal during contralateral fixations and weakest when neurons are located far apart from one another (>300 mu m). Together, our results support a role for shared inputs to ipsilateral pairs of burst-tonic neurons in the encoding of eye position in the primate nucleus prepositus.

Bidirectional Regulation of eEF2 Phosphorylation Controls Synaptic Plasticity by Decoding Neuronal Activity Patterns	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						elongation factor 2; facilitation; intermediate memory; protein kinase C; synaptic plasticity; translational control	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; APLYSIA SENSORY NEURONS; ELONGATION FACTOR-2 PHOSPHORYLATION; INTERMEDIATE-TERM FACILITATION; PRESYNAPTIC FACILITATION; TRANSLATION INITIATION; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; MOTOR SYNAPSES; APL-II	At the sensory-motor neuron synapse of Aplysia, either spaced or continuous (massed) exposure to serotonin (5-HT) induces a form of intermediate-term facilitation (ITF) that requires new protein synthesis but not gene transcription. However, spaced and massed ITF use distinct molecular mechanisms to maintain increased synaptic strength. Synapses activated by spaced applications of 5-HT generate an ITF that depends on persistent protein kinase A (PKA) activity, whereas an ITF produced by massed 5-HT depends on persistent protein kinase C (PKC) activity. In this study, we demonstrate that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which catalyzes the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during protein synthesis, acts as a biochemical sensor that is tuned to the pattern of neuronal stimulation. Specifically, we find that massed training leads to a PKC-dependent increase in phosphorylation of eEF2, whereas spaced training results in a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of eEF2. Importantly, by using either pharmacological or dominant-negative strategies to inhibit eEF2 kinase (eEF2K), we were able to block massed 5-HT-dependent increases in eEF2 phosphorylation and subsequent PKC-dependent ITF. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of eEF2K during the longer period of time required for spaced training was sufficient to reduce eEF2 phosphorylation and induce ITF. Finally, we find that the massed 5-HT-dependent increase in synaptic strength requires translation elongation, but not translation initiation, whereas the spaced 5-HT-dependent increase in synaptic strength is partially dependent on translation initiation. Thus, bidirectional regulation of eEF2 is critical for decoding distinct activity patterns at synapses by activating distinct modes of translation regulation.

An explanation and analysis of how world religions formulate their ethical decisions on withdrawing treatment and determining death	PHILOSOPHY ETHICS AND HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Determination of death; Defining death; Deceased organ and tissue donation; Withdrawing treatment; World religions; Ethics; Judaism; Christianity; Islam; Hinduism; Buddhism	END-OF-LIFE; BRAIN-DEATH	Introduction: This paper explores definitions of death from the perspectives of several world and indigenous religions, with practical application for health care providers in relation to end of life decisions and organ and tissue donation after death. It provides background material on several traditions and explains how different religions derive their conclusions for end of life decisions from the ethical guidelines they proffer. Methods: Research took several forms beginning with a review of books and articles written by ethicists and observers of Bon, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous Traditions, Islam, Judaism, Shinto and Taoism. It then examined sources to which these authors referred in footnotes and bibliographies. In addition, material was gathered through searches of data bases in religious studies, general humanities, social sciences and medicine along with web-based key word searches for current policies in various traditions. Results: Religious traditions provide their adherents with explanations for the meaning and purpose of life and include ethical analysis for the situations in which their followers find themselves. This paper aims to increase cultural competency in practitioners by demonstrating the reasoning process religions use to determine what they believe to be the correct decision in the face of death. Conclusion: Patterns emerge in the comparative study of religious perspectives on death. Western traditions show their rootedness in Judaism in their understanding of the human individual as a finite, singular creation. Although the many branches of Western religions do not agree on precisely how to determine death, they are all able to locate a moment of death in the body. In Eastern traditions personhood is not defined in physical terms. From prescribing the location of death, to resisting medical intervention and definitions of death, Eastern religions, in their many forms, incorporate the beliefs and practices that preceded them. Adding to the complexity for these traditions is the idea that death is a process that continues after the body has met most empirical criteria for determining death. For Hinduism and Buddhism, the cessation of heart, brain and lung function is the beginning of the process of dying-not the end.

Its first exon-more specifically the first 17 amino acids (Htt17)-is crucial for the physiological and pathological functions of huntingtin. It regulates huntingtin's activity through posttranslational modifications and serves as an anchor to membrane-containing organelles of the cell. Recently, structure and orientation of the Htt17 membrane anchor were determined using a combined solution and solid-state NMR approach. This prompted us to refine this model by investigating the dynamics and thermodynamics of this membrane anchor on a POPC bilayer using all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics and Hamiltonian replica exchange. Our simulations are combined with various experimental measurements to generate a high-resolution atomistic model for the huntingtin Htt17 membrane anchor on a POPC bilayer. More precisely, we observe that the single alpha-helix structure is more stable in the phospholipid membrane than the NMR model obtained in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine detergent micelles. The resulting Htt17 monomer has its hydrophobic plane oriented parallel to the bilayer surface. Our results further unveil the key residues interacting with the membrane in terms of hydrogen bonds, salt-bridges, and nonpolar contributions. We also observe that Htt17 equilibrates at a well-defined insertion depth and that it perturbs the physical properties-order parameter, thickness, and area per lipid-of the bilayer in a manner that could favor its dimerization. Overall, our observations reinforce and refine the NMR measurements on the Htt17 membrane anchor segment of huntingtin that is of fundamental importance to its biological functions.

We conducted an etiological study on two siblings with Sotos features without mutations in NSD1 and detected a homozygous frameshift mutation in the APC2 gene by whole-exome sequencing, which resulted in the loss of function of cytoskeletal regulation in neurons. Apc2-deficient (Apc2(-/-)) mice exhibited impaired learning and memory abilities along with an abnormal head shape. Endogenous Apc2 expression was downregulated by the knockdown of Nsd1, indicating that APC2 is a downstream effector of NSD1 in neurons. Nsd1 knockdown in embryonic mouse brains impaired the migration and laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as observed in Apc2(-/-) mice, and this defect was rescued by the forced expression of Apc2. Thus, APC2 is a crucial target of NSD1, which provides an explanation for the intellectual disability associated with Sotos syndrome.

Design A systematic assessment of the availability of published research reports for publicly registered trials testing drugs stalling in clinical development ("stalled drugs") and drugs receiving regulatory licensure in the same time period ("licensed drugs"). Data sources Searches of clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, and electronic query of contacts in registries to identify trials and assess publication status. Eligibility criteria The cohort of licensed drugs consisted of all disease modifying drugs in cancer, cardiovascular disease, or neurological disorders that received Food and Drug Administration licensure during 2005 to 2009 inclusive. The cohort of stalled drugs included unlicensed drugs in the same disease areas that had at least one completed phase III trial before 2009 and no evidence of any clinical trial activity after 31 December 2009. Inclusion criteria for registered trials advanced into publication searching were an intervention tested in a disease modifying, phase II, III, or IV trial registered on clinicaltrials. gov, with enrolment of at least one patient, that reported primary outcome collection end date between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2008. Results The unadjusted publication proportion for registered trials of licensed drugs was 75% (72/96) versus 37% (30/81) for stalled drugs. The adjusted hazard ratio for publication was 2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 4.3) in favour of licensed drug trials. Higher publication rates for licensed drug trials were observed regardless of disease type, sponsorship, trial phase, and geography. The rate of non-publication of stalled drug trials was significantly higher for studies that did not complete enrolment compared with licensed drug trials. A total of 20 135 patients participated in trials of stalled drugs that were never published. Conclusions Much of the information collected in unsuccessful drug trials is inaccessible to the broader research and practice communities. These findings provide an evidence base and rationale for policy reforms aimed at promoting transparency, ethics, and accountability in clinical research.

The new dual ligands were tested in vitro and subsequently two compounds (lead structure 4 and one of the new analogues 22, Dmt-D-Arg-Aba-beta-Ala-NMe-Bn) were selected for in vivo behavioural assays, which were conducted in acute (tail-flick) and neuropathic pain models (cold plate and von Frey) in rats. Compared to the parent opioid compound 33 (without NK1R pharmacophore), hybrid 22 was more active in the neuropathic pain models. Attenuation of neuropathic pain emerged from NK1R antagonism as demonstrated by the pure NK1R antagonist 6. Surprisingly, despite a lower in vitro activity at NK1R in comparison with 4, compound 22 was more active in the neuropathic pain models. Although potent analgesic effects were observed for 4 and 22, upon chronic administration, both manifested a tolerance profile similar to that of morphine and cross tolerance with morphine in a neuropathic pain model in rat.

Folding of an intrinsically disordered protein by phosphorylation as a regulatory switch	NATURE			English	Article							TRANSLATION INITIATION; ORDER TRANSITION; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; EIF4E; BINDING; 4E-BP1; EUKARYOTES; SYSTEM; REGION	Intrinsically disordered proteins play important roles in cell signalling, transcription, translation and cell cycle regulation(1.2). Although they lack stable tertiary structure, many intrinsically disordered proteins undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to partners(3,4). Similarly, several folded proteins use regulated order-to-disorder transitions to mediate biological function(5,6). In principle, the function of intrinsically disordered proteins may be controlled by post-translational modifications that lead to structural changes such as folding, although this has not been observed. Here we show that multisite phosphorylation induces folding of the intrinsically disordered 4E-BP2, the major neural isoform of the family of three mammalian proteins that bind eIF4E and suppress cap-dependent translation initiation. In its non-phosphorylated state, 4E-BP2 interacts tightly with eIF4E using both a canonical YXXXXL Phi motif (starting at Y54) that undergoes a disorder-to-helix transition upon binding and a dynamic secondary binding site(7-11). We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T37 and T46 induces folding of residues P18-R62 of 4E-BP2 into a four-stranded beta-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXL Phi motif into a partly buried beta-strand, blocking its accessibility to eIF4E. The folded state of pT37pT46 4E-BP2 is wealdy stable, decreasing affinity by 100-fold and leading to an order-to-disorder transition upon binding to eIF4E, whereas fully phosphorylated 4E-BP2 is more stable, decreasing affinity by a factor of approximately 4,000. These results highlight stabilization of a phosphorylation-induced fold as the essential mechanism for phospho-regulation of the 4E-BP:eIF4E interaction and exemplify a new mode of biological regulation mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins.

In a minority of individuals, known as amusics, the processing of tonality is disordered, which results in severe musical deficits. It has been shown that the tonal rules of music are neurally encoded, but not consciously available in amusics. Previous neurophysiological studies have not explicitly controlled the level of attention in tasks where participants ignored the tonal structure of the stimuli. Here, we test whether access to tonal knowledge can be demonstrated in congenital amusia when attention is controlled. Electric brain responses were recorded while asking participants to detect an individually adjusted near-threshold click in a melody. In half the melodies, a note was inserted that violated the tonal rules of music. In a second task, participants were presented with the same melodies but were required to detect the tonal deviation. Both tasks required sustained attention, thus conscious access to the rules of tonality was manipulated. In the click-detection task, the pitch deviants evoked an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) in both groups. In the pitch-detection task, the pitch deviants evoked an ERAN and P600 in controls but not in amusics. These results indicate that pitch regularities are represented in the cortex of amusics, but are not consciously available. Moreover, performing a pitch-judgment task eliminated the ERAN in amusics, suggesting that attending to pitch information interferes with perception of pitch. We propose that an impaired top-down frontotemporal projection is responsible for this disorder.

We report the unique neurologic presentation of the micturition dysfunction in Pol III-related leukodystrophy and describe the novel endocrine abnormalities in this entity. Case presentation: A 32-year-old Caucasian female exhibited chronic urinary incontinence that commenced at the age of 7 years and remained the unexplained symptom more than two decades before the onset of progressive neurologic decline. A transient growth failure and absent sexual development with hypoprolactinemia appeared in the meanwhile. Neurologic, endocrine, neuroradiologic, and genetic evaluation performed only in the patient's thirties, confirmed the diagnosis of 4H leukodystrophy as the only cause of the micturition disturbance. Conclusion: The report shows for the first time that an unexplained chronic bladder dysfunction should be evaluated also as a possible 4H leukodystrophy, thus alerting to the unexpected neurologic and endocrine features in 4H leukodystrophy.

The Cooking Task is an ecological and valid test of EF involving multi-tasking in a real environment. Given its complex scoring system, it is important to establish the tool's reliability. The objective of the study was to examine the reliability of the Cooking Task (internal consistency, inter-rater and test-retest reliability). A total of 160 patients with ABI (113 men, mean age 37 years, SD = 14.3) were tested using the Cooking Task. For test-retest reliability, patients were assessed by the same rater on two occasions (mean interval 11 days) while two raters independently and simultaneously observed and scored patients' performances to estimate inter-rater reliability. Internal consistency was high for the global scale (Cronbach alpha = .74). Inter-rater reliability (n = 66) for total errors was also high (ICC = .93), however the test-retest reliability (n = 11) was poor (ICC = .36). In general the Cooking Task appears to be a reliable tool. The low test-retest results were expected given the importance of EF in the performance of novel tasks.

The trajectory of gray matter development in Broca's area is abnormal in people who stutter	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						developmental stuttering; Broca's area; speech production; motor control; cortical thickness; neurodevelopment; inferior frontal gyrus; developmental disorders	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL; CORTICAL THICKNESS; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; FLUENT SPEECH; ADULTS; BRAIN; CHILDREN; MRI	The acquisition and mastery of speech-motor control requires years of practice spanning the course of development. People who stutter often perform poorly on speech-motor tasks thereby calling into question their ability to establish the stable neural motor programs required for masterful speech motor control. There is evidence to support the assertion that these neural motor programs are represented in the posterior part of Broca's area, specifically the left pars opercularis. Consequently, various theories of stuttering causation posit that the disorder is related to a breakdown in the formation of the neural motor programs for speech early in development and that this breakdown is maintained throughout life. To date, no study has examined the potential neurodevelopmental signatures of the disorder across pediatric and adult populations. The current study aimed to fill this gap in our knowledge. We hypothesized that the developmental trajectory of cortical thickness in people who stutter would differ across the lifespan in the left pars opercularis relative to a group of control participants. We collected structural magnetic resonance images from 116 males (55 people who stutter) ranging in age from 6 to 48 years old. Differences in cortical thickness across ages and between patients and controls were investigated in 30 brain regions previously implicated in speech motor control. An interaction between age and group was found for the left pars opercularis only In people who stutter, the pars opercularis did not demonstrate the typical maturational pattern of gradual gray matter thinning with age across the lifespan that we observed in control participants. In contrast, the developmental trajectory of gray matter thickness in other regions of interest within the neural network for speech-motor control was similar for both groups. Our findings indicate that the developmental trajectory of gray matter in left pars opercularis is abnormal in people who stutter.

Methods: All articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to March 2014), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature were searched. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education methodology by two independent reviewers. Results: Overall, 19 studies were identified, with 16 manuscripts and 3 meeting abstracts. A total of 46 patients were treated. Adult (n = 28) and pediatric patients (n = 18) displayed 92.9% and 94.4% seizure control with treatment, respectively. Isoflurane was used in the majority of cases. Hypotension was the only complication described. Conclusions: Oxford level 4, Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education D evidence exists to support the use of isoflurane in refractory status epilepticus to obtain burst suppression. Insufficient data exist to comment on the efficacy of desflurane and xenon at this time.

The brain integrates this information, providing a complete representation of our surrounding world and giving us the ability to react optimally to the environment. Infancy is a period of great changes in brain structure and function that are reflected by the increase of processing capacities of the developing child. However, it is unclear if the optimal use of multisensory information is present early in childhood or develops only later, with experience. The first part of this review has focused on the typical development of multisensory integration (MSI). We have described the two hypotheses on the developmental process of MSI in neurotypical infants and children, and have introduced MSI and its neuroanatomic correlates. The second section has discussed the neurodevelopmental trajectory of MSI in cognitively-challenged infants and children. A few studies have brought to light various difficulties to integrate sensory information in children with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Consequently, we have exposed certain possible neurophysiological relationships between MSI deficits and neurodevelopmental disorders, especially dyslexia and attention deficit disorder with/without hyperactivity.

Assessing Bimanual Performance in Brain Tumor Resection With NeuroTouch, a Virtual Reality Simulator	OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Brain tumor; NeuroTouch; Performance metrics; Virtual reality simulator	SURGERY; VENTRICULOSTOMY; NEURONAVIGATION; EDUCATION; IMPACT	BACKGROUND: Validated procedures to objectively measure neurosurgical bimanual psychomotor skills are unavailable. The NeuroTouch simulator provides metrics to determine bimanual performance, but validation is essential before implementation of this platform into neurosurgical training, assessment, and curriculum development. OBJECTIVE: To develop, evaluate, and validate neurosurgical bimanual performance metrics for resection of simulated brain tumors with NeuroTouch. METHODS: Bimanual resection of 8 simulated brain tumors with differing color, stiffness, and border complexity was evaluated. Metrics assessed included blood loss, tumor percentage resected, total simulated normal brain volume removed, total tip path lengths, maximum and sum of forces used by instruments, efficiency index, ultrasonic aspirator path length index, coordination index, and ultrasonic aspirator bimanual forces ratio. Six neurosurgeons and 12 residents (6 senior and 6 junior) were evaluated. RESULTS: Increasing tumor complexity impaired resident bimanual performance significantly more than neurosurgeons. Operating on black vs glioma-colored tumors resulted in significantly higher blood loss and lower tumor percentage, whereas altering tactile cues from hard to soft decreased resident tumor resection. Regardless of tumor complexity, significant differences were found between neurosurgeons, senior residents, and junior residents in efficiency index and ultrasonic aspirator path length index. Ultrasonic aspirator bimanual force ratio outlined significant differences between senior and junior residents, whereas coordination index demonstrated significant differences between junior residents and neurosurgeons. CONCLUSION: The NeuroTouch platform incorporating the simulated scenarios and metrics used differentiates novice from expert neurosurgical performance, demonstrating NeuroTouch face, content, and construct validity and the possibility of developing brain tumor resection proficiency performance benchmarks.

TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCE AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Misconception; Inhibition; Scientific expertise; Conceptual change; Science education; fMRI	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FRONTAL-CORTEX; TASK; CONFLICT	Science education is often challenged by students misconceptions about various phenomena. Recent studies show that these misconceptions coexist with scientific conceptions, even after a conceptual change occurs. However, the mechanisms involve in overcoming the interference caused by this coexistence remain poorly understood. A possible explanation is that inhibition could play a role in teaming science. An IMRI protocol was used to obtain functional brain images of novices and experts while performing a cognitive task in mechanics, a scientific discipline for which misconceptions are known to be frequent and persistent. The results show that experts, significantly more than novices, activate brain areas associated with inhibition: the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This suggests that the experts' misconceptions in mechanics have not been eradicated or transformed during learning; they would rather have remained encoded in their brain and were then inhibited to provide a correct answer.

Aerothermal Optimization and Experimental Verification for Discrete Turbine Airfoil Film Cooling	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article							SHAPE OPTIMIZATION; AERODYNAMIC LOSSES; HOLE GEOMETRY; HEAT-TRANSFER; COEFFICIENTS; PERFORMANCE; DENSITY	The optimization aims to maximize the film cooling performance while minimizing the corresponding aerodynamic penalty. The cooling performance is assessed using the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, while the aerodynamic penalty is measured with a mass-averaged total pressure loss coefficient. Two design variables are selected: the coolant-to-mainstream temperature ratio and the coolant-to-mainstream total pressure ratio. Two staggered rows of discrete cylindrical film cooling holes on the suction surface of a turbine vane are considered. Anondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN) to perform a multiple-objective optimization of the coolant flow parameters on the vane suction surface. Three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are employed to construct the ANN network that produces low-fidelity predictions of the objective functions during the optimization. The effect of varying the coolant flow parameters on the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and the aerodynamic loss is analyzed using the optimization method and RANS simulations. The computational fluid dynamics predictions of the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and aerodynamic performance are assessed and validated against corresponding experimental measurements. The optimal solutions are reproduced in the experimental facility and the Pareto front is substantiated with experimental data.	[El Ayoubi, C.; Ghaly, W. S.; Hassan, I.

Humor in systemic lupus erythematosus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Epidemiology; cytokine; rheumatoid arthritis; humor; systemic lupus erythematosus	MIRTHFUL LAUGHTER; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; DISEASE-ACTIVITY; RELIABILITY; STRESS; INDEX	Objective: Humor has neurophysiological effects influencing the release of cortisol, which may have a direct impact on the immune system. Laughter is associated with a decreased production of inflammatory cytokines both in the general population and in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our objective was to explore the effects of humor on serum cytokines [particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and cortisol levels in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), after a standard intervention (120 min of visual comedy). Material and Methods: We enrolled 58 females with SLE from consecutive patients assessed in the Montreal General Hospital lupus clinic. The subjects who consented to participate were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (watching 120 min of comedy) or control group (watching a 120 min documentary). Measurements of cytokine and serum cortisol levels as well as 24-h urine cortisol were taken before, during, and after the interventions. We compared serum cytokine levels and serum and 24-h urine cortisol levels in the humor and control groups and performed regression analyses of these outcomes, adjusting for demographics and the current use of prednisone. Results: There were no significant differences between the control and humor groups in demographics or clinical variables. Baseline serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and B-cell activating factor were also similar in both groups. There was no evidence of a humor effect in terms of decreasing cytokine levels, although there was some suggestion of lowered cortisol secretion in the humor group based the 24-h urinary cortisol levels in a subgroup. Conclusion: In contrast to what has been published for RA, we saw no clear effects of humor in altering cytokine levels in SLE, although interesting trends were seen for lower cortisol levels after humor intervention compared with the control group.

In response to the need for briefer personality measures, a 30-item version of the NEO-FFI (NEO-FFI-30) was developed and its factor structure replicated. Method: The study examines the psychometric quality of NEO-FFI-30 and provides population-based norms (n=1908 adults). Reliability coefficients, kurtosis, skewness, correlations and effect sizes illustrate the psychometric properties of the measure. Results: The relationships between neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and sociodemographic characteristics confirm previous research findings and speak to the validity of the brief version. Namely, women report higher neuroticism and agreeableness. Younger individuals indicate more extraversion but less agreeableness and conscientiousness. Finally, openness to experience was related to higher education. Percentile ranks are provided for the total sample and for subgroups by age and gender. Conclusions: The 30-item-version of the NEO-FFI constitutes an assessment tool comparable with the full-length instrument with regard to its psychometric properties. As such, the NEO-FFI-30 is a promising alternative to longer questionnaires, as well as to single-item measures of personality used in research and clinical practice.

The mechanisms behind cognitive decline are not well understood. We studied here whether postsynaptic glutamate receptor and presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) levels may change in the course of aging and be related to cognitive abilities using various age-impaired (AI) or age-unimpaired rat strains. Twenty-four-month-old Long-Evans (LE) rats with intact spatial memory maintained postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptor levels in the hippocampal-adjacent cortex similar to those of young animals. In contrast, AI rats showed significantly reduced expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor GluR2, NR2A and NR2B subunits. In AI LE rats, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 levels were increased and negatively correlated with receptor levels as shown by principal component analysis and correlation matrices. We also investigated whether glutamatergic receptors and VGLUT levels were altered in the obesity-resistant LOU/C/Jall (LOU) rat strain which is characterized by intact memory despite aging. No difference was observed between 24-month-old LOU rats and their young counterparts. Taken together, the unaltered spatial memory performance of 24-month-old age-unimpaired LE and LOU rats suggests that intact coordination of the presynaptic and postsynaptic hippocampal-adjacent cortex glutamatergic networks may be important for successful cognitive aging. Accordingly, altered expression of presynaptic and postsynaptic glutamatergic components, such as in AI LE rats, could be considered a marker of age-related cognitive deficits. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, even if currently considered as the gold standard, it is associated with potentially severe short- and long-term adverse effects. Thus, bladder tissue engineering is a promising approach to bladder reconstruction. Recent findings: In the last few years, progress has been made with the development of new biomaterials for bladder tissue replacement and in deciphering the role of stem cells as well as their contribution to bladder scaffold integration and tissue regeneration. Summary: This review of recently published articles allows us to forecast the characteristics of efficient and safe bladder biomaterials. However, several factors, such as native bladder traits, the specific involvement of urine, and bladder tissue replacement indications, have to be assessed with caution before including bladder tissue engineering in clinical trials. Many authors agree that these challenging techniques could deliver significant benefits with clinical application, reducing morbidity and global long-term costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These studies mainly assessed the efficacy of three strategies: semantic, phonological and sensorimotor. Following these previous treatments, the performance of most participants improved on treated verbs, while improvement on untreated stimuli and tasks was inconsistent. Aims: This study aimed to measure the effectiveness of a semantic-phonological strategy and a sensorimotor strategy for verb anomia in post-stroke aphasia. Methods: A multiple baseline single-subject experimental study was conducted with two participants (9-37 years post-stroke). Four phases were completed: (1) background assessment, (2) baselines, (3) therapy, and (4) follow-up. Three equivalent lists of verbs were created for each participant and two of them were trained with a different strategy: action observation + semantic-phonological cues, action observation alone. The stimuli of the third list (control list) were not treated. Results: The semantic-phonological cueing strategy led to a significant improvement. No improvement was observed after action observation. No generalization to untreated verbs was found. Conclusions: Verb naming can be enhanced by semantic/phonological cueing. In addition, other studies (clinical, neuroimaging, etc.) are needed to document the effect of action observation for the treatment of verb anomia. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to (1) describe semantic-phonological therapies used in post-stroke verb anomia, (2) describe sensorimotor therapies used in post-stroke verb anomia, and (3) identify factors contributing to the efficacy of therapies to improve action naming in aphasia.

EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Pediatric epilepsy; Intelligence; Memory; Attention; Executive functions; Hippocampus; Neuropsychological assessment; Cognition	WORKING-MEMORY; VERBAL MEMORY; VISUAL MEMORY; LATERALIZATION; IMPAIRMENT; DYSFUNCTION; DEFICITS; DAMAGE	Unilateral hippocampal atrophy (HA) is considered as a precursor of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) in some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. However, in other cases, it has been suggested that HA without MTS may constitute a distinct epileptic entity. Hippocampal atrophy without MTS was defined as HA without T2-weighted hyperintensity, loss of internal architecture, or associated lesion seen on the MRI data. To date, no study has focused on the cognitive pattern of children with epilepsy with HA without MTS. The objectives of the present study were to characterize the cognitive profile of these children and to investigate the presence (or the absence) of material-specific memory deficits in these young patients, as found in patients with MTS. Toward this end, 16 young patients with epilepsy with either left or right HA without MTS completed a set of neuropsychological tests, assessing overall intelligence, verbal memory and nonverbal memory, and some aspects of attention and executive functions. Results showed normal intellectual functioning without specific memory deficits in these patients. Furthermore, comparison between patients with left HA and patients with right HA failed to reveal a material-specific lateralized memory pattern. Instead, attention and executive functions were found to be impaired in most patients. These results suggest that HA may constitute a distinct epileptic entity, and this information may help health-care providers initiate appropriate and timely interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Alirocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, is in Phase III development for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In Phase II studies, 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) was the highest Q2W dose studied, and it is currently the highest Q2W dose under development. To better assess the safety and efficacy of this dose, data across three Phase II studies were pooled. Methods. We analyzed data from three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II studies of 8 or 12 weeks' duration. In the current analysis, 77 patients were randomized to the control group and 108 were randomized to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W administered via a single 1 mL subcutaneous injection. Results. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 58.3% of alirocumab patients compared with 54.5% of placebo-controlled patients. The most common AE was mild, transient injection-site reactions. No signal for muscle symptoms such as myalgia and no cases of neurocognitive effects were reported or observed. One alirocumab patient, also receiving atorvastatin 80 mg/day, had an increase in aspartate transaminase 3 to 5 times the upper limit of normal. Alirocumab 150 mg Q2W reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline by 68.4% compared with 10.5% for the control group. More than 90% of patients achieved an LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL with alirocumab versus 8% with control. Marked reductions in other atherogenic lipids and modest increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also observed. Conclusion. At the highest Q2W dose under development (150 mg), alirocumab appears well tolerated and produces robust LDL-C reductions. These data suggest that alirocumab 150 mg Q2W is an appropriate dose for further evaluation in Phase III trials.

The Hmox1 promoter contains numerous consensus sequences that render the gene exquisitely sensitive to induction by diverse pro-oxidant and inflammatory stimuli. In "stressed" astroglia, HO-1 hyperactivity promotes mitochondrial iron sequestration and macroautophagy and may thereby contribute to the pathological iron deposition and bioenergetic failure documented in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and certain neurodevelopmental conditions. Glial HO-1 expression may also impact neuroplasticity and cell survival by modulating brain sterol metabolism and the proteasomal degradation of neurotoxic proteins. The glial HO-1 response may represent a pivotal transducer of noxious environmental and endogenous stressors into patterns of neural damage and repair characteristic of many human degenerative and developmental CNS disorders.

Differences in findings may result from variation in valence and dose of the environmental factor, and/or failure to take account of gene-by-gene interactions. The present study investigated interactions between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF Val66Met), the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA-uVNTR) polymorphisms, family conflict, sexual abuse, the quality of the child-parent relationship, and teenage delinquency. Methods: In 2006, as part of the Survey of Adolescent Life in Vastmanland, Sweden, 1 337 high-school students, aged 1718 years, anonymously completed questionnaires and provided saliva samples for DNA analyses. Results: Teenage delinquency was associated with two-, three-, and four-way interactions of each of the genotypes and the three environmental factors. Significant four-way interactions were found for BDNF Val66Met x 5-HTTLPRxMAOA-uVNTR x family conflicts and for BDNF Val66Met x 5-HTTLPRxMAOA-uVNTR x sexual abuse. Further, the two genotype combinations that differed the most in expression levels (BDNF Val66Met Val, 5-HTTLPR LL, MAOA-uVNTR LL [girls] and L [boys] vs BDNF Val66Met Val/Met, 5-HTTLPR S/LS, MAOA-uVNTR S/SS/LS) in interaction with family conflict and sexual abuse were associated with the highest delinquency scores. The genetic variants previously shown to confer vulnerability for delinquency (BDNF Val66Met Val/Met x 5-HTTLPR S x MAOA-uVNTR S) were associated with the lowest delinquency scores in interaction with a positive child-parent relationship. Conclusions: Functional variants of the MAOA-uVNTR, 5-HTTLPR, and BDNF Val66Met, either alone or in interaction with each other, may be best conceptualized as modifying sensitivity to environmental factors that confer either risk or protection for teenage delinquency.

J	Vold, K				Vold, Karina			The Parity Argument for Extended Consciousness	JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES			English	Article							NEURONAL SYNCHRONY	Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998) argue that certain mental states and processes can be partially constituted by objects located beyond one's brain and body: this is their extended mind thesis (EM). But they maintain that consciousness relies on processing that is too high in speed and bandwidth to be realized outside the body (see Chalmers, 2008, and Clark, 2009). I evaluate Clark's and Chalmers' reason for denying that consciousness extends while still supporting unconscious state extension. I argue that their reason is not well grounded and does not hold up against foreseeable advances in technology. I conclude that their current position needs re-evaluation. If their original parity argument works as a defence of EM, they have yet to identify a good reason why it does not also work as a defence of extended consciousness. lend by advancing a parity argument for extended consciousness and consider some possible replies.

BI 1200 36 Trial Grp; Canadian Brain Tumour Consortium	Phase I/randomized phase II study of afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, with or without protracted temozolomide in adults with recurrent glioblastoma	NEURO-ONCOLOGY			English	Article						afatinib; EGFRvIII; ErbB family; glioblastoma; temozolomide	NEWLY-DIAGNOSED GLIOBLASTOMA; GROWTH-FACTOR-RECEPTOR; EGFR KINASE INHIBITORS; NEURO-ONCOLOGIA GICNO; HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; CELL LUNG-CANCER; OPEN-LABEL; RADIATION-THERAPY; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL	Background. This phase I/II trial evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of afatinib plus temozolomide as well as the efficacy and safety of afatinib as monotherapy (A) or with temozolomide (AT) vs temozolomide monotherapy (T) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Methods. Phase I followed a traditional 3 + 3 dose-escalation design to determine MTD. Treatment cohorts were: afatinib 20, 40, and 50 mg/day (plus temozolomide 75 mg/m(2)/day for 21 days per 28-day cycle). In phase II, participants were randomized (stratified by age and KPS) to receive A, T or AT; A was dosed at 40 mg/day and T at 75 mg/m(2) for 21 of 28 days. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6). Participants were treated until intolerable adverse events (AEs) or disease progression. Results. Recommended phase II dose was 40 mg/day (A) + T based on safety data from phase I (n = 32). Most frequent AEs in phase II (n = 119) were diarrhea (71% [A], 82% [AT]) and rash (71% [A] and 69% [AT]). Afatinib and temozolomide pharmacokinetics were unaffected by coadministration. Independently assessed PFS-6 rate was 3% (A), 10% (AT), and 23% (T). Median PFS was longer in afatinib-treated participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) vIII-positive tumors versus EGFRvIII-negative tumors. Best overall response included partial response in 1 (A), 2 (AT), and 4 (T) participants and stable disease in 14 (A), 14 (AT), and 21 (T) participants. Conclusions. Afatinib has a manageable safety profile but limited single-agent activity in unselected recurrent GBM patients.

Bromodomain-and PHD finger-containing protein 1 (BRPF1) is a multidomain histone binder and a master activator of three lysine acetyltransferases, MOZ, MORF and HBO1, which are also known as KAT6A, KAT6B and KAT7, respectively. While the MOZ and MORF genes are rearranged in leukemia, the MORF gene is also mutated in prostate and other cancers and in four genetic disorders with intellectual disability. Here we show that forebrain-specific inactivation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes hypoplasia in the dentate gyrus, including underdevelopment of the suprapyramidal blade and complete loss of the infrapyramidal blade. We trace the developmental origin to compromised Sox2(+) neural stem cells and Tbr2(+) intermediate neuronal progenitors. We further demonstrate that Brpf1 loss deregulates neuronal migration, cell cycle progression and transcriptional control, thereby causing abnormal morphogenesis of the hippocampus. These results link histone binding and acetylation control to hippocampus development and identify an important epigenetic regulator for patterning the dentate gyrus, a brain structure critical for learning, memory and adult neurogenesis.

We describe a case of severe CBZ intoxication treated with different extracorporeal modalities during which CBZ toxicokinetics were compared. Case details: A 58-year-old man was transferred to our facility 24 hours after ingesting over 14 g of sustained-release CBZ. Because of worsening neurological condition requiring mechanical ventilation and CBZ levels reaching 47.6 mu g/mL, he underwent three intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), two continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and one IHD with HP (IHD-HP). IHD and CVVH removed 1.73 g of carbamazepine over 43 hours. Mean apparent half-life was 8.8 hours during IHD, 49.1 hours during CVVH, and 5.1 hours during IHD-HP, while measured endogenous half-life after extracorporeal therapies was 81.4 hours. Mean CBZ clearances were 106.2 mL/min during IHD and 21.2 mL/min during CVVH. His neurological status improved during extracorporeal elimination, and he was discharged without sequela after 16 days. Treatments were well tolerated aside from thrombocytopenia during IHDHP. Discussion: All extracorporeal treatments facilitated CBZ elimination, although CVVH was significantly less efficient than IHD and IHD-HP. IHD-HP may be better than IHD alone but must be weighed against its risks. IHD appears sufficient to eliminate CBZ and may need to be repeated or prolonged according to the clinical context if CBZ absorption is delayed.

Here, we introduce a fluorescence reconstruction technique based on a diffusion light transport model that can be used during surgery, including guiding resection of brain tumors, for depth-resolved quantitative imaging of near-infrared fluorescent markers. Hyperspectral fluorescence images are used to compute a topographic map of the fluorophore distribution, which yields structural and optical constraints for a three-dimensional subsequent hyperspectral diffuse fluorescence reconstruction algorithm. Using the model fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 and brain-like tissue phantoms, the technique yielded estimates of fluorophore concentration within +/- 25% of the true value to depths of 5 to 9 mm, depending on the concentration. The approach is practical for integration into a neurosurgical fluorescence microscope and has potential to further extend fluorescence-guided resection using objective and quantified metrics of the presence of residual tumor tissue.

Mice defective for either Shh or Netrin-1 signaling have commissural axon guidance defects, suggesting that both Shh and Netrin-1 are required for correct axon guidance. However, how Shh and Netrin-1 collaborate to guide axons is not known. We first quantified the steepness of the Shh gradient in the spinal cord and found that it is mostly very shallow. We then developed an in vitro microfluidic guidance assay to simulate these shallow gradients. We found that axons of dissociated commissural neurons respond to steep but not shallow gradients of Shh or Netrin-1. However, when we presented axons with combined Shh and Netrin-1 gradients, they had heightened sensitivity to the guidance cues, turning in response to shallower gradients that were unable to guide axons when only one cue was present. Furthermore, these shallow gradients polarized growth cone Src-family kinase (SFK) activity only when Shh and Netrin-1 were combined, indicating that SFKs can integrate the two guidance cues. Together, our results indicate that Shh and Netrin-1 synergize to enable growth cones to sense shallow gradients in regions of the spinal cord where the steepness of a single guidance cue is insufficient to guide axons, and we identify a novel type of synergy that occurs when the steepness (and not the concentration) of a guidance cue is limiting.

Abnormal brain perfusion is often a key mechanism underlying neonatal brain injury. A better understanding of how alternations in brain perfusion can affect normal brain development will permit the development of therapeutic strategies that prevent and/or minimize brain injury and improve the neurodevelopmental outcome of these high-risk newborns. Recently, non-invasive MR perfusion imaging of the brain has been successfully applied to the neonatal brain, which is known to be smaller and have lower brain perfusion compared to older children and adults. This article will present an overview of the potential role of non-invasive perfusion imaging by MRI to study maturation, injury, and repair in perinatal brain injury and demonstrate why this perfusion sequence is an important addition to current neonatal imaging protocols, which already include different sequences to assess the anatomy and metabolism of the neonatal brain.

Here, using a novel approach based on the recording of steady-state-evoked potentials (SS-EPs), we examine how distant brain areas supporting these processes coordinate their dynamics. The electroencephalogram was recorded while subjects listened to a 2.4-Hz auditory beat and tapped their hand on every second beat. When subjects tapped to the beat, the EEG was characterized by a 2.4-Hz SS-EP compatible with beat-related entrainment and a 1.2-Hz SS-EP compatible with movement-related entrainment, based on the results of source analysis. Most importantly, when compared with passive listening of the beat, we found evidence suggesting an interaction between sensory-and motor-related activities when subjects tapped to the beat, in the form of 1) additional SS-EP appearing at 3.6 Hz, compatible with a nonlinear product of sensorimotor integration; 2) phase coupling of beat-and movement-related activities; and 3) selective enhancement of beat-related activities over the hemisphere contralateral to the tapping, suggesting a top-down effect of movement-related activities on auditory beat processing. Taken together, our results are compatible with the view that rhythmic sensorimotor synchronization is supported by a dynamic coupling of sensory and motor related activities.

An algorithm based on Stockwell's transform and artificial neural network-based classifier and a rule-based decision tree is proposed in this paper. The analysis and classification of single stage PQ disturbances consisting of both events and variations such as sag, swell, interruption, harmonics, transients, notch, spike, and flicker are presented. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is also applied on multiple PQ disturbances such as harmonics with sag, swell, flicker, and interruption. A database of these PQ disturbances based on IEEE-1159 standard is generated in MATLAB for simulation studies. The proposed algorithm extracts significant features of various PQ disturbances using S-transform, which are used as input to this hybrid classifier for the classification of PQ disturbances. Satisfactory results of effective recognition and classification of PQ disturbances are obtained with the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed method is also implemented on real-time PQ events acquired in a laboratory to confirm the validity of this algorithm in practical conditions.

Previous studies demonstrated that it could transport a broad spectrum of substrates, including endogenous molecules and clinically relevant drugs, such as several beta-blockers and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. The primary objective of this study was to investigate OATP1A2 transport activity using rosuvastatin as a probe substrate and evaluate competitive inhibition of its transport by beta-blockers. Rosuvastatin transport was saturable, with a K-m of 60.2 mu M. With the exception of carvedilol (IC50 of 3.2 mu M), all of the other beta-blockers that were evaluated had a small or insignificant effect on OATP1A2-mediated uptake of rosuvastatin. Carvedilol differs from the other beta-blockers by the tricyclic moiety in its chemical structure. As a secondary objective, the transport of a series of tricyclic compounds by OATP1A2 and their potential for rosuvastatin transport inhibition were evaluated. Tricyclic compounds were not OATP1A2 substrates. On the other hand, tricyclic compounds with a short aliphatic amine chain inhibited OATP1A2-mediated rosuvastatin transport. Our data suggest that these drugs may modulate the transport of OATP1A2 substrates and may affect drug actions.
