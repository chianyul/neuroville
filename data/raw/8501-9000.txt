Methods-In 147 consecutive dissection of the cervical artery patients with (n = 88) and without stroke (n = 59), we compared the number, volume, and patterns of cerebral diffusion-weighted imaging stroke lesions among patients with <70% stenosis (Group 1), >= 70% stenosis (Group 2), and occlusion (Group 3). Results-The presence (26 of 45 in Group 1, 32 of 59 in Group 2, 30 of 43 in Group 3; P = 0.27) and the number of diffusion-weighted imaging lesions (mean +/- SD [interquartile range], 3.5 +/- 3.9 [1-4] in Group 1; 4.2 +/- 4.1 [1-5] in Group 2; 3.3 +/- 4.0 [1-3] in Group 3; P = 0.85) were independent of lumen patency, whereas volume of diffusion-weighted imaging lesions was larger in occlusive dissection of the cervical artery (82 +/- 90 mm [17-91] versus 34 +/- 54 [2-48]; P = 0.03). There were no differences in the breakdown of diffusion-weighted imaging lesion patterns according to degree of stenosis. Conclusions-The occurrence and diffusion-weighted imaging lesion patterns in dissection of the cervical artery patients may not be influenced by the degree of stenosis of the dissected artery. Occlusive dissection of the cervical artery was associated with larger infarcts. (Stroke. 2012;43:1150-1152.)

Systemic oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema in rats with chronic liver failure	FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Hepatic encephalopathy; Hyperammonemia; Bile-duct ligation; Portacaval anastomosis; Allopurinol; Reactive oxygen species	MINIMAL HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; DUCT-LIGATED RATS; CIRRHOTIC-PATIENTS; AMMONIA LEVELS; BARRIER PERMEABILITY; PARTIAL-PRESSURE; CEREBRAL EDEMA; DISEASE; BLOOD; ALLOPURINOL	Chronic liver failure leads to hyperammonemia, a central component in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, a correlation between blood ammonia levels and HE severity remains controversial. It is believed oxidative stress plays a role in modulating the effects of hyperammonemia. This study aimed to determine the relationship between chronic hyperammonemia, oxidative stress, and brain edema (BE) in two rat models of HE: portacaval anastomosis (PCA) and bile-duct ligation (BDL). Ammonia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, BE, oxidant and antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as lipid peroxidation were assessed both systemically and centrally in these two different animal models. Then, the effects of allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor, 100 mg/kg for 10 days) on ROS and BE and the temporal resolution of ammonia, ROS, and BE were evaluated only in BDL rats. Similar arterial and cerebrospinal fluid ammonia levels were found in PCA and BDL rats, both significantly higher compared to their respective sham-operated controls (p<0.05). BE was detected in BDL rats (p<0.05) but not in PCA rats. Evidence of oxidative stress was found systemically but not centrally in BDL rats: increased levels of ROS, increased activity of xanthine oxidase (oxidant enzyme), enhanced oxidative modifications on lipids, as well as decreased antioxidant defense. In PCA rats, a preserved oxidant/antioxidant balance was demonstrated. Treatment with allopurinol in BDL rats attenuated both ROS and BE, suggesting systemic oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of BE. Analysis of ROS and ammonia temporal resolution in the plasma of BDL rats suggests systemic oxidative stress might be an important "first hit", which, followed by increases in ammonia, leads to BE in chronic liver failure. In conclusion, chronic hyperammonemia and oxidative stress in combination lead to the onset of BE in rats with chronic liver failure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tian, ZG				Tian, Zhigang			An artificial neural network method for remaining useful life prediction of equipment subject to condition monitoring	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Remaining useful life; Prediction; Artificial neural network; Accurate; Bearing	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; RESIDUAL LIFE; HEALTH DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSIS; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS; POLICY	Accurate equipment remaining useful life prediction is critical to effective condition based maintenance for improving reliability and reducing overall maintenance cost. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) based method is developed for achieving more accurate remaining useful life prediction of equipment subject to condition monitoring. The ANN model takes the age and multiple condition monitoring measurement values at the present and previous inspection points as the inputs, and the life percentage as the output. A function generalized from the Weibull failure rate function is used to fit each condition monitoring measurement series for a failure history, and the fitted measurement values are used to form the ANN training set so as to reduce the effects of the noise factors that are irrelevant to the equipment degradation. A validation mechanism is introduced in the ANN training process to improve the prediction performance of the ANN model. The proposed ANN method is validated using real-world vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field. A comparative study is performed between the proposed ANN method and an adapted version of a reported method, and the results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in achieving more accurate remaining useful life prediction.

METHOD The participation levels of 136 children and young people (88 males; 48 females; age range 4y 11mo-17y 6mo; mean age 11y 6mo) after acquired brain injury (3 <= Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 15; mean 12.8) were assessed three times: at their return to school, and at 8 and 12 months after returning to school. The Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment measured the participants' diversity and intensity of participation in out-of-school activities. At baseline, information on general family functioning and medical and demographic information was collected as possible predictors. Mixed-effect model analyses of participation scores were performed while controlling for child's age at injury. RESULTS The severity of the injury explained rates of change across time for participation intensity in recreational, physical, and social activities. Household income influenced changes in the intensity of recreational activities, whereas family functioning predicted changes in the diversity of skill-based activities. INTERPRETATION Participation is a relevant outcome of recovery that needs to be assessed and monitored post brain injury. Special attention can be directed to severity of injury and family functioning when developing intervention plans.

Subjects with schizophrenia and autism are reported to exhibit reduced levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), a marker for GABA neurons, in various brain regions. Reduced levels of reelin, a secretory glycoprotein present in a subpopulation of GABA neurons, have also been found in these disorders. To test if prenatal infection can cause abnormalities in GAD67 and reelin in the brains of offspring, this study used a rat model of prenatal exposure to the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and assessed numbers of GAD67-immunoreactive (GAD67+) and reelin-immunoreactive (reelin+) neurons in the hippocampus of offspring. In offspring at postnatal day 14 (PD14), GAD67+ cell counts were reduced in the dentate gyrus of the prenatal LPS group compared to prenatal saline controls, while at PD28, GAD67+ cells counts were reduced in the prenatal LPS group in both the dentate gyrus and the CA1. There was a decrease in the number of reelin+ cells in the prenatal LPS offspring compared to controls in the dentate gyrus at PD14. However using Western blotting, no significant effects of prenatal LPS on levels of GAD67 or reelin protein were observed in various brain regions at PD14. These findings support the idea that prenatal infection can cause reductions in postnatal expression of GAD67 and reelin, and in this way, possibly contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia or autism.

Canadian Stroke Consortium; Stroke Outcome Res Canada SORCan	Fabry's disease: A prospective multicenter cohort study in young adults with cryptogenic stroke	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE			English	Article						cryptogenic; disability; Fabry disease; prospective; stroke; stroke in the young	ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY; MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; TRIAL; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREVALENCE; ALPHA	Background Stroke in young adults is etiologically diverse and may represent a diagnostic challenge remaining cryptogenic in one-fourth of cases. Limited information is available on the prevalence of Fabry's disease, a treatable multisystem inherited lysosomal storage disorder, and disability in young patients with cryptogenic stroke. Design and methods The Canadian Fabry Stroke Screening Initiative (CFSSI) is a prospective multicenter cohort study of young adults (age 18-55) presenting with an ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral haemorrhage of unknown etiology to stroke centres across Canada. Diagnosis of Fabry's disease is made by direct DNA analysis of blood samples for a-galactosidase gene mutations or polymorphisms. Demographics, clinical information, and investigations including brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are collected. Functional neurological assessment includes neurological examination, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scale, modified Rankin scale, and the Barthel index. A follow-up interview is conducted by telephone or in person approximately six-months after the index stroke/transient ischemic attack/intracerebral haemorrhage to determine patient outcomes, quality of life, and patient use of medications. Main outcome Prevalence of positive DNA mutation or single nucleotide polymorphism screens for Fabry's disease as a proportion of total cryptogenic stroke. Secondary outcomes include incident risk of new or recurrent vascular event at six-months, discharge disposition, disability at six-months as measured by the modified Rankin scale, mean time from symptoms onset to the definite etiological diagnosis, and length of hospital stay. Conclusion This study constitutes the first initiative to determine the prevalence of a positive screen for Fabry's disease in young adults with stroke in Canada. Moreover, the Canadian Fabry Stroke Screening Initiative will provide information on recurrent vascular events, disability at six-months (modified Rankin scale), and disposition in this understudied population.

Because activation of VTA dopaminergic neurons by ethanol is a cellular mechanism underlying the reinforcement of ethanol consumption, we hypothesized that ethanol may exert different effects on dopaminergic neurons in the p-VTA and a-VTA. In patch-clamp recordings in midbrain slices from young rats (postnatal days 22-32), we detected no significant difference in electrophysiological properties between p-VTA and a-VTA dopaminergic neurons. However, acute exposure to ethanol (21-86 mM) stimulated p-VTA dopaminergic neurons but suppressed a-VTA dopaminergic neurons. Conversely, ethanol (>21 mM) dose-dependently reduced the frequency of the GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) generated by inhibitory neuronal firing but not miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in p-VTA dopaminergic neurons. By contrast, ethanol increased the frequency and amplitude of both sIPSCs and mIPSCs in a-VTA dopaminergic neurons. All of these effects of ethanol were abolished by a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. There was a strong negative correlation between ethanol-evoked modulation of sIPSCs and neuronal firing in VTA dopaminergic neurons. These results indicate that GABAergic inputs play an important role in ethanol's actions in the VTA. The differential effects of ethanol on sIPSCs and neuronal firing in the p-VTA and a-VTA could be the basis for ethanol reinforcement via the p-VTA.

Although opioid receptors, especially the mu-opioid receptors (MORs), may be involved, the cellular mechanisms mediating the effects of salsolinol have not been fully explored. In the current study, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to examine the effects of salsolinol on dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in acute brain slices from Sprague-Dawley rats. Salsolinol (0.01-1 mu M) dose-dependently and reversibly increased the ongoing firing of dopamine neurons; this effect was blocked by naltrexone, an antagonist of MORs, and gabazine, an antagonist of GABA(A) receptors. We further showed that salsolinol reduced the frequency without altering the amplitude of spontaneous GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in dopamine neurons. The salsolinol-induced reduction was blocked by both naltrexone and [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol] enkephalin, an agonist of MORs. Thus, salsolinol excites VTA-dopamine neurons indirectly by activating MORs, which inhibit GABA neurons in the VTA. This form of disinhibition seems to be a novel mechanism underlying the effects of salsolinol.

Exome sequencing reveals SPG11 mutations causing juvenile ALS	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						SPG11; ARJALS; HSP-TCC	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; THIN CORPUS-CALLOSUM; SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA; SPATACSIN; LINKAGE	We report here the description of a nonconsanguineous family with 2 affected individuals with a recessively inherited juvenile motor neuron disease. Exome sequencing of these 2 affected individuals led us to identify 2 compound heterozygous deletions leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon in the SPG11 gene. One of these deletions, c.5199delA in exon 30, has not been previously reported. Interestingly, these deletions are associated with an intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity as one affected has atypical juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the other has classical hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum. Our findings confirm SPG11 as a genetic cause of juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and indicate that SPG11 mutations could be associated with 2 different clinical phenotypes within the same family.

Sodium intake and physical activity impact cognitive maintenance in older adults: the NuAge Study	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Diet; Sodium intake; Cognition; Aging	CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIETARY-INTAKE; ACTIVITY SCALE; UNITED-STATES; ELDERLY PASE; SALT INTAKE; DEMENTIA; EXERCISE	This study examines the association between sodium intake and its interaction with physical activity on cognitive function over 3 years in older adults residing in Quebec, Canada. We analyzed a subgroup from the NuAge cohort (aged 67-84 years) with nutrient intake data, including sodium, from a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Baseline physical activity was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE; high-low). Modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MS) was administered at baseline and annually for 3 additional years. Controlling for age, sex, education, waist circumference, diabetes, and dietary intakes, analyses showed an association between sodium intake and cognitive change over time in the low PASE group only. Specifically, in the low PASE group, elders in the low sodium intake tertile displayed better cognitive performance over time (mean decline in 3MS over years: mean [M] = -0.57, standard error [SE] = 0.002) compared with the highest (M = -1.72, SE = 0.01) and mid sodium intake (M = -2.07, SE = 0.01) groups. This finding may have significant public health implications, emphasizing the importance of addressing multiple lifestyle factors rather than a single domain effect on brain health.

No therapy is currently available for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. A systematic review of experimental animal studies and in vitro experiments was conducted to evaluate gene therapy as a potential future therapeutic option. Data Sources: Eligible studies were identified through searches of electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, PubMed, Biosis Previews, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library. Study Selection: Articles obtained from the search were independently reviewed by 2 authors using specific criteria to identify experimental animal studies and in vitro experiments conducted to evaluate gene therapy for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. No restriction was applied to publication dates or languages. Data Extraction: Data extracted included experiment type, cell type, species, targeted gene, gene expression, method, administration, inner ear site evaluated, outcome measures for cytotoxicity, and significant results. Results: Fourteen articles were included in this review. In vitro and in vivo experiments have been performed to evaluate the potential of gene expression manipulation for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Twelve different genes were targeted including NTF3, GDNF, HO-1, XIAP, Trpv1, BCL2, Otos, Nfe2l2, Nox1, Nox3, Nox4, and Ctr1. All of the included articles demonstrated a benefit of gene therapy on cytotoxicity caused by cisplatin. Conclusion: Experimental animal studies and in vitro experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of gene therapy for cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. However, further investigation regarding safety, immunogenicity, and consequences of genetic manipulation in the inner ear tissues must be completed to develop future therapeutic options.

The neuroanatomy of the autistic phenotype	RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism; Fragile X syndrome; Williams syndrome; Gray matter; White matter; Neuroimaging	FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WILLIAMS-SYNDROME; YOUNG-CHILDREN; MRI DATA; BRAIN; DISORDERS; ABNORMALITIES; REGISTRATION; NEUROBIOLOGY	The autism phenotype is associated with an excess of brain volume due in part to decreased pruning during development. Here we aimed at assessing brain volume early in development to further elucidate previous findings in autism and determine whether this pattern is restricted to idiopathic autism or shared within the autistic phenotype (fragile X syndrome [FXS]). We investigated brain volume in 37 participants, using the fully automated Civet pipeline anatomical magnetic resonance imaging. 3 groups with intellectual deficiency: autism (AUT); its most associated FXS; and its most opposite Williams syndrome (WS) were compared with each other and with normal controls (NC). We report increased total and regional gray and white matter brain volume in AUT and FXS relative to WS and NC. These findings are discussed in light of the possibilities leading for the enlarged brain volume in children with the AUT phenotype. We speculate that this excess suggests reduced regression of neuronal processes "pruning" in cortical and subcortical regions in AUT/FXS, which may be due to a mutation in specific genes involved in pruning and/or a lack of socio-emotional environmental experience during a critical developmental period.(C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured tumor remnant growth volumetrically in an attempt to determine potential predictors for postoperative recurrence following subtotal resection. We reviewed the charts of patients who had undergone VS surgery between 1998 and 2007. Thirty patients had an incomplete resection. The principal outcome measure was change in tumor volume (TV) on serial imaging. At a median follow-up of 6.8 years, volumetric measurements showed that 12 patients (40%) developed further tumor growth, while 18 patients remained with stable residual disease. The median rate of growth was 0.53 cm(3)/year. Two-dimensional measurements confirmed growth in only eight of these patients. The postoperative residual TV correlated significantly with subsequent tumor growth (p 0.038). All patients with residual volumes in excess of 2.5 cm(3) exhibited recurrence. On univariate analysis, only postoperative TV was significantly associated with growth. Median time to failure was 21.5 months. This is the first report of volumetric measurements of VS tumor growth postoperatively. Volumetric measurements appear to be superior to two-dimensional measurements in documenting VS growth and patients with residual tumors >2.5 cm(3) have a significantly higher rate of recurrence.

Different techniques are proposed to establish the models and are evaluated with data collected from two chillers installed in an existing central cooling and heating plant. Both chillers have identical capacity and performance characteristics: however, they have quite different operating hours. The results show that models developed in this case study with 7 days of data monitored at the beginning of the summer season provide accurate results over the remaining of the summer and for the following summer. The proposed Multivariable Polynomial (MP) models for chillers provide the most accurate prediction with CV(RMSE) below 7% over the remaining of the summer season, and below 8% for the following summer season.

Methods: The detector first finds localized increments of the signal power in narrow frequency bands. A simple classification based on two features, a narrowband to wideband signal amplitude ratio and an absolute narrowband signal amplitude, then allows for an important reduction in the number of false positives. Results: When compared to an expert, the performance in 15 focal epilepsy patients resulted in 3.6 false positives per minute at 95% sensitivity, with at least 40% of the detected events being true positives. In most of the patients the channels showing the highest number of events according to the expert and the automatic detector were the same. Conclusions: A high sensitivity is achieved with the proposed automatic detector, but results should be reviewed by an expert to remove false positives. Significance: The time required to mark fast oscillations on scalp EEG recordings is drastically reduced with the use of the proposed detector. Thus, the automatic detector is a useful tool in studies aiming to create a better understanding of the fast oscillations visible on the scalp.

Methods: We contrasted a short (250 ms) and a long (1000 ms) stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) in two different experiments, using a relatively low proportion of related words (30%). One group of participants performed a lexical decision task (LDT) and a second group performed an explicit semantic matching task with the same words (except for pseudowords) and the same task parameters. In both tasks, word stimuli consisted solely of two prime and two target words repeated throughout the experiment. Results: The effects of semantic priming on reaction time (RT) and the amplitude of the N400 ERP were absent for both the short and the long SOA in the LDT. In contrast, in the explicit semantic task, these effects were significant. In this task, the activity of N400 generators in the left superior temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal cortex significantly differentiated primed and unprimed trials but this effect did not interact with SOA. Conclusions: Our results indicate that task instruction is critical to preserve semantic processing with repeated presentations. Significance: Using explicit semantic designs, it may be possible to study associative or categorical relations between individual concepts.

Expression patterns of Ephs and ephrins throughout retinotectal development in Xenopus laevis	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						visual system; axon guidance; topographic mapping; optic tectum; ocular dominance	RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES; MAMMALIAN VISUAL-SYSTEM; RETINAL AXONS; IN-VIVO; RANA-PIPIENS; DORSOVENTRAL AXIS; SYNAPSE FORMATION; BRANCH EXTENSION; RETINOTOPIC MAP; NMDA RECEPTOR	The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands the ephrins play an essential role in the targeting of retinal ganglion cell axons to topographically correct locations in the optic tectum during visual system development. The African claw-toed frog Xenopus laevis is a popular animal model for the study of retinotectal development because of its amenability to live imaging and electrophysiology. Its visual system undergoes protracted growth continuing beyond metamorphosis, yet little is known about ephrin and Eph expression patterns beyond stage 39 when retinal axons first arrive in the tectum. We used alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins of EphA3, ephrin-A5, EphB2, and ephrin-B1 as affinity probes to reveal the expression patterns of ephrin-As, EphAs, ephrin-Bs, and EphBs, respectively. Analysis of brains from stage 40 to adult frog revealed that ephrins and Eph receptors are expressed throughout development. As observed in other species, staining for ephrin-As displayed a high caudal to low rostral expression pattern across the tectum, roughly complementary to the expression of EphAs. In contrast with the prevailing model, EphBs were found to be expressed in the tectum in a high dorsal to low ventral gradient in young animals. In animals with induced binocular tectal innervation, ocular dominance bands of alternating input from the two eyes formed in the tectum; however, ephrin-A and EphA expression patterns were unmodulated and similar to those in normal frogs, confirming that the segregation of axons into eye-specific stripes is not the consequence of a respecification of molecular guidance cues in the tectum.

Here, we describe a dataset collected in the context of a multi-centre study of the adolescent brain, namely the IMAGEN Study. We focus on one of the functional paradigms included in the project to probe the brain network underlying processing of ambiguous and angry faces. Using functional MR (fMRI) data collected in 1,110 adolescents, we constructed probabilistic maps of the neural network engaged consistently while viewing the ambiguous or angry faces; 21 brain regions responding to faces with high probability were identified. We were also able to address several methodological issues, including the minimal sample size yielding a stable location of a test region, namely the fusiform face area (FFA), as well as the effect of acquisition site (eight sites) and scanner (four manufacturers) on the location and magnitude of the fMRI response to faces in the FFA. Finally, we provided a comparison between male and female adolescents in terms of the effect sizes of sex differences in brain response to the ambiguous and angry faces in the 21 regions of interest. Overall, we found a stronger neural response to the ambiguous faces in several cortical regions, including the fusiform face area, in female (vs. male) adolescents, and a slightly stronger response to the angry faces in the amygdala of male (vs. female) adolescents.

In the past 10 years, the psychopharmacological treatment of aggression has changed dramatically owing to the introduction of atypical antipsychotics on the market and the increased use of anticonvulsants and lithium in the treatment of aggressive patients. This review (second of 2 parts) uses a translational medicine approach to examine the neurobiology of aggression, discussing the major neurotransmitter systems implicated in its pathogenesis (serotonin, glutamate, norepinephrine, dopamine, and F-aminobutyric acid) and the neuropharmacological rationale for using atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and lithium in the therapeutics of aggressive behavior. A critical review of all clinical trials using atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, clozapine, loxapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, and amisulpride), anticonvulsants (topiramate, valproate, lamotrigine, and gabapentin), and lithium are presented. Given the complex, multifaceted nature of aggression, a multifunctional combined therapy, targeting different receptors, seems to be the best strategy for treating aggressive behavior. This therapeutic strategy is supported by translational studies and a few human studies, even if additional randomized, double-blind, clinical trials are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of this framework.

Explicit and Implicit Second Language Training Differentially Affect the Achievement of Native-like Brain Activation Patterns	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							POTENTIAL EVIDENCE; MEMORY-SYSTEMS; LANGUAGE; ERP; VIOLATIONS; AGREEMENT; LEARNERS; FEEDBACK; 1ST-LANGUAGE; METAANALYSIS	It is widely believed that adults cannot learn a foreign language in the same way that children learn a first language. However, recent evidence suggests that adult learners of a foreign language can come to rely on native-like language brain mechanisms. Here, we show that the type of language training crucially impacts this outcome. We used an artificial language paradigm to examine longitudinally whether explicit training (that approximates traditional grammar-focused classroom settings) and implicit training (that approximates immersion settings) differentially affect neural (electrophysiological) and behavioral (performance) measures of syntactic processing. Results showed that performance of explicitly and implicitly trained groups did not differ at either low or high proficiency. In contrast, electrophysiological (ERP) measures revealed striking differences between the groups' neural activity at both proficiency levels in response to syntactic violations. Implicit training yielded an N400 at low proficiency, whereas at high proficiency, it elicited a pattern typical of native speakers: an anterior negativity followed by a P600 accompanied by a late anterior negativity. Explicit training, by contrast, yielded no significant effects at low proficiency and only an anterior positivity followed by a P600 at high proficiency. Although the P600 is reminiscent of native-like processing, this response pattern as a whole is not. Thus, only implicit training led to an electrophysiological signature typical of native speakers. Overall, the results suggest that adult foreign language learners can come to rely on native-like language brain mechanisms, but that the conditions under which the language is learned may be crucial in attaining this goal.

However, the fractionation of the central executive among the elderly has been less well explored, and Miyake's et al. latent structure has not yet been integrated with other models that propose additional components, such as access to long-term information. Here we administered a battery of classic and newer neuropsychological tests of executive functions to 122 healthy individuals aged between 48 and 91 years. The test scores were subjected to a latent variable analysis (LISREL), and yielded four factors. The factor structure obtained was broadly consistent with Miyake et al.'s three-factor model. However, an additional factor, which was labeled 'efficiency of access to long-term memory', and a mediator factor ('speed of processing') were apparent in our structural equation analysis. Furthermore, the best model that described executive functioning in our sample of healthy elderly adults included a two-factor solution, thus indicating a possible mechanism of dedifferentiation, which involves larger correlations and interdependence of latent variables as a consequence of cognitive ageing. These results are discussed in the light of current models of prefrontal cortex functioning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A novel hybrid CNN-SVM classifier for recognizing handwritten digits	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Hybrid model; Convolutional Neural Network; Support Vector Machine; Handwritten digit recognition	RECOGNITION	This paper presents a hybrid model of integrating the synergy of two superior classifiers: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which have proven results in recognizing different types of patterns. In this model, CNN works as a trainable feature extractor and SVM performs as a recognizer. This hybrid model automatically extracts features from the raw images and generates the predictions. Experiments have been conducted on the well-known MNIST digit database. Comparisons with other studies on the same database indicate that this fusion has achieved better results: a recognition rate of 99.81% without rejection, and a recognition rate of 94.40% with 5.60% rejection. These performances have been analyzed with reference to those by human subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Batista, L; Granger, E; Sabourin, R				Batista, Luana; Granger, Eric; Sabourin, Robert			Dynamic selection of generative-discriminative ensembles for off-line signature verification	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Off-line signature verification; Ensemble of classifiers; Dynamic selection; Hybrid generative-discriminative systems; Hidden Mackov Models; Incremental learning	NEURAL CLASSIFIERS; PARAMETERS	In practice, each writer provides only a limited number of signature samples to design a signature verification (SV) system. Hybrid generative-discriminative ensembles of classifiers (EoCs) are proposed in this paper to design an off-line SV system from few samples, where the classifier selection process is performed dynamically. To design the generative stage, multiple discrete left-to-right Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are trained using a different number of states and codebook sizes, allowing the system to learn signatures at different levels of perception. To design the discriminative stage, HMM likelihoods are measured for each training signature, and assembled into feature vectors that are used to train a diversified pool of two-class classifiers through a specialized Random Subspace Method. During verification, a new dynamic selection strategy based on the K-nearest-oracles (KNORA) algorithm and on Output Profiles selects the most accurate EoCs to classify a given input signature. This SV system is suitable for incremental learning of new signature samples. Experiments performed with real-world signature data (composed of genuine samples, and random, simple and skilled forgeries) indicate that the proposed dynamic selection strategy can significantly reduce the overall error rates, with respect to other EoCs formed using well-known dynamic and static selection strategies. Moreover, the performance of the SV system proposed in this paper is significantly greater than or comparable to that of related systems found in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study provides the first comprehensive description of PIST distribution in the mammalian central nervous system and of its subcellular localization by immunocytochemistry. PIST is distributed widely throughout the neuraxis, predominantly associated with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. In hippocampal neurons, in vitro and in situ, PIST displayed a patchy subcellular distribution in an area surrounding the nucleus and extending into one of the major dendrites. By colocalization with the trans-Golgi marker TGN38, we were able to show that PIST is associated largely but not exclusively with the trans-Golgi network in central neurons. High or moderate to high levels of PIST-like immunoreactivity were found in cortical areas, in particular in layer V of the neocortex. The motor cortex was most strongly labeled. Also, the piriform and insular cortices displayed strong PIST labeling. In the hippocampus, CA2 but not CA1 or CA3 pyramidal cells displayed strong PIST-labeling, extending into their apical dendrites. In the thalamus, ventrolateral and laterodorsal nuclei were most strongly stained, whereas in the hypothalamus the supraoptic nucleus stood out with strong immunoreactivity. Strikingly, in the brainstem all cranial nerve motor nuclei were PIST-positive at varying levels, which is in keeping with the prominent expression of PIST in forebrain motor areas. This selective distribution of PIST suggests that the protein serves distinctive roles in specific neuronal populations, establishing functionally distinct zones, for instance, in the hippocampus. J.

In particular, BMP7 is critical for the formation of the nervous system and it is considered to have therapeutic potential in brain injury and stroke. One approach to make BMP7 more suitable for therapeutic purposes is the development of efficient vectors that allow the consistent, reliable and cost-effective production of the BMP7 protein. In this study, we developed an efficient BMP7 delivery system, using a third generation lentiviral vector to produce functional BMP7 protein. The lentiviral transduction of several human cell types, including human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, amniotic fluid cells. NTera2 neurons (NT2-N) and primary neuronal cultures resulted in BMP7 expression. The production of BMP7 protein was achieved for at least 4 weeks post-transduction, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SMAD phosphorylation and neuronal differentiation assays verified the bioactivity and functionality of the lentiviral-based BMP7 protein, respectively. In addition, the intracerebroventricular injection of the lentivirus resulted in exogenous BMP7 expression in both neurons and astrocytes in the mouse brain. Taken together, this gene delivery system provides a reliable source of functional BMP7 protein for future in vitro and in vivo studies. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present investigation further examined this advantage using three tasks previously found to be sensitive to the effect. Furthermore, both behavioral and event-related brain potential (ERP) measures were included. Monolingual (n=25) and highly proficient bilingual (n=26) young adults completed a Stroop, Simon, and Eriksen flanker task while electrophysiological recording took place. Behaviorally there were no language group differences on any of the tasks. The ERP measures demonstrated differences between monolinguals and bilinguals with respect to conflict monitoring, resource allocation, stimulus categorization, and error-processing; however, these differences were not consistent across tasks. Given the similar behavioral performance across the groups the observed differences in brair. responses may not represent an advantage for bilinguals. The results are discussed with respect to previous findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Low, LA; Fitzgerald, M				Low, Lucie A.; Fitzgerald, Maria			Acute Pain and a Motivational Pathway in Adult Rats: Influence of Early Life Pain Experience	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NEONATAL INTENSIVE-CARE; LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES; HYPOTHALAMIC OREXIN NEURONS; EXTREMELY PRETERM CHILDREN; RECEPTIVE-FIELD SIZE; SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN; DORSAL-HORN; MATERNAL-CARE; NEUROPATHIC PAIN	Background: The importance of neonatal experience upon behaviour in later life is increasingly recognised. The overlap between pain and reward pathways led us to hypothesise that neonatal pain experience influences reward-related pathways and behaviours in adulthood. Methodology/Principal Findings: Rat pups received repeat plantar skin incisions (neonatal IN) or control procedures (neonatal anesthesia only, AN) at postnatal days (P)3, 10 and 17. When adult, rats with neonatal 'pain history' showed greater sensory sensitivity than control rats following acute plantar skin incision. Motivational behaviour in the two groups of rats was tested in a novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) paradigm. The sensitivity of this paradigm to pain-induced changes in motivational behaviour was shown by significant increases in the time spent in the central zone of the arena (43.7 +/- 5.9% vs. 22.5 +/- 6.7%, p<0.05), close to centrally placed food treats, and decreased number of rears (9.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 19.2 +/- 2.3, p<0.001) in rats with acute plantar skin incision compared to naive, uninjured animals. Rats with a neonatal 'pain history' showed the same pain-induced behaviour in the novelty-induced hypophagia paradigm as controls. However, differences were observed in reward-related neural activity between the two groups. Two hours after behavioural testing, brains were harvested and neuronal activity mapped using c-Fos expression in lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons, part of a specific reward seeking pathway. Pain-induced activity in orexin neurons of control rats (18.4 +/- 2.8%) was the same as in uninjured naive animals (15.5 +/- 2.6%), but in those rats with a 'pain history', orexinergic activity was significantly increased (27.2 +/- 4.1%, p<0.01). Furthermore the extent of orexin neuron activation in individual rats with a 'pain history' was highly correlated with their motivational behaviour (r = 20.86, p = 0.01). Conclusions/Significance: These results show that acute pain alters motivational behaviour and that neonatal pain experience causes long-term changes in brain motivational orexinergic pathways, known to modulate mesolimbic dopaminergic reward circuitry.

Ligation of the Jugular Veins Does Not Result in Brain Inflammation or Demyelination in Mice	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; CEREBROSPINAL VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MEDICAL PROGRESS; IRON DEPOSITION; MYELOPEROXIDASE; MOUSE; FLOW; PATHOGENESIS; AGENTS	An alternative hypothesis has been proposed implicating chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) as a potential cause of multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to evaluate the validity of this hypothesis in a controlled animal model. Animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee. The jugular veins in SJL mice were ligated bilaterally (n = 20), and the mice were observed for up to six months after ligation. Sham-operated mice (n = 15) and mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (n = 8) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The animals were evaluated using CT venography and Tc-99m-exametazime to assess for structural and hemodynamic changes. Imaging was performed to evaluate for signs of blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and neuroinflammation. Flow cytometry and histopathology were performed to assess inflammatory cell populations and demyelination. There were both structural changes (stenosis, collaterals) in the jugular venous drainage and hemodynamic disturbances in the brain on Tc99m-exametazime scintigraphy (p = 0.024). In the JVL mice, gadolinium MRI and immunofluorescence imaging for barrier molecules did not reveal evidence of BBB breakdown (p = 0.58). Myeloperoxidase, matrix metalloproteinase, and protease molecular imaging did not reveal signs of increased neuroinflammation (all p>0.05). Flow cytometry and histopathology also did not reveal increase in inflammatory cell infiltration or population shifts. No evidence of demyelination was found, and the mice remained without clinical signs. Despite the structural and hemodynamic changes, we did not identify changes in the BBB permeability, neuroinflammation, demyelination, or clinical signs in the JVL group compared to the sham group. Therefore, our murine model does not support CCSVI as a cause of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

The previous motor experience of the observer has been shown to enhance the activity in this network. Yet visual experience could also have a determinant influence when watching more complex actions, as in dance performances. Here we tested the impact visual experience has on motor simulation when watching dance, by measuring changes in corticospinal excitability. We also tested the effects of empathic abilities. To fully match the participants' long-term visual experience with the present experimental setting, we used three live solo dance performances: ballet, Indian dance, and non-dance. Participants were either frequent dance spectators of ballet or Indian dance, or "novices'' who never watched dance. None of the spectators had been physically trained in these dance styles. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to measure corticospinal excitability by means of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in both the hand and the arm, because the hand is specifically used in Indian dance and the arm is frequently engaged in ballet dance movements. We observed that frequent ballet spectators showed larger MEP amplitudes in the arm muscles when watching ballet compared to when they watched other performances. We also found that the higher Indian dance spectators scored on the fantasy subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the larger their MEPs were in the arms when watching Indian dance. Our results show that even without physical training, corticospinal excitability can be enhanced as a function of either visual experience or the tendency to imaginatively transpose oneself into fictional characters. We suggest that spectators covertly simulate the movements for which they have acquired visual experience, and that empathic abilities heighten motor resonance during dance observation.

The RNA-binding protein Staufen1 is increased in DM1 skeletal muscle and promotes alternative pre-mRNA splicing	JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							EXPANDED CUG REPEAT; ROUGH ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; MYOTONIC-DYSTROPHY; CTG REPEATS; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; MAMMALIAN STAUFEN; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZES; MODEL; DIFFERENTIATION	In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), dystrophia myotonica protein kinase messenger ribonucleic acids (RNAs; mRNAs) with expanded CUG repeats (CUG(exP)) aggregate in the nucleus and become toxic to cells by sequestering and/or misregulating RNA-binding proteins, resulting in aberrant alternative splicing. In this paper, we find that the RNA-binding protein Staufen1 is markedly and specifically increased in skeletal muscle from DM1 mouse models and patients. We show that Staufen1 interacts with mutant CUGexP mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export and translation. This effect is critically dependent on the third double-stranded RNA binding domain of Staufen1 and shuttling of Staufen1 into the nucleus via its nuclear localization signal. Moreover, we uncover a new role of Staufen1 in splicing regulation. Overexpression of Staufen1 rescues alternative splicing of two key pre-mRNAs known to be aberrantly spliced in DM1, suggesting its increased expression represents an adaptive response to the pathology. Altogether, our results unravel a novel function for Staufen1 in splicing regulation and indicate that it may positively modulate the complex DM1 phenotype, thereby revealing its potential as a therapeutic target.

Predicting nicotine dependence profiles among adolescent smokers: the roles of personal and social-environmental factors in a longitudinal framework	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Adolescents; Smoking; Nicotine dependence; Personality; Parental/peer smoking	SMOKING INITIATION; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; UNITED-STATES; SELF-REPORTS; BEHAVIOR; SYMPTOMS; VALIDITY; TOBACCO; INTERVENTIONS; ASSOCIATION	Background: Although several studies have reported that symptoms of nicotine dependence can occur after limited exposure to smoking, the majority of research on nicotine dependence has focused on adult smokers. Insufficient knowledge exists regarding the epidemiology and aetiology of nicotine dependence among adolescent smokers. The objective of the present study is to identify the effects of theoretically driven social and individual predictors of nicotine dependence symptom profiles in a population-based sample of adolescent smokers. Method: A longitudinal study among 6,783 adolescents (12 to 14 years old at baseline) was conducted. In the first and second year of secondary education, personality traits and exposure to smoking in the social environment were assessed. Two and a half years later, adolescents' smoking status and nicotine dependence symptom profiles were assessed. A total of 796 adolescents were identified as smokers and included in the analyses. Results: At follow-up, four distinct dependence symptom profiles were identified: low cravings only, high cravings and withdrawal, high cravings and behavioural dependence, and overall highly dependent. Personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion did not independently predict nicotine dependence profiles, whereas exposure to smoking in the social environment posed a risk for the initial development of nicotine dependence symptoms. However, in combination with environmental exposure to smoking, extraversion and neuroticism increased the risk of developing more severe dependence symptom profiles. Conclusions: Nicotine dependence profiles are predicted by interactions between personal and environmental factors. These insights offer important directions for tailoring interventions to prevent the onset and escalation of nicotine dependence.

EphA Signaling Promotes Actin-based Dendritic Spine Remodeling through Slingshot Phosphatase	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SEMLIKI-FOREST-VIRUS; AMPA RECEPTOR TRAFFICKING; FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; COFILIN DEPHOSPHORYLATION; HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPSES; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES; CORTICAL-NEURONS; ADULT CORTEX	Actin cytoskeletal remodeling plays a critical role in transforming the morphology of subcellular structures across various cell types. In the brain, restructuring of dendritic spines through actin cytoskeleletal reorganization is implicated in the regulation of synaptic efficacy and the storage of information in neural circuits. However, the upstream pathways that provoke actin-based spine changes remain only partly understood. Here we show that EphA receptor signaling remodels spines by triggering a sequence of events involving actin filament rearrangement and synapse/spine reorganization. Rapid EphA signaling over minutes activates the actin filament depolymerizing/severing factor cofilin, alters F-actin distribution in spines, and causes transient spine elongation through the phosphatases slingshot 1 (SSH1) and calcineurin/protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B). This early phase of spine extension is followed by synaptic reorganization events that take place over minutes to hours and involve the relocation of pre/postsynaptic components and ultimately spine retraction. Thus, EphA receptors utilize discrete cellular and molecular pathways to promote actin-based structural plasticity of excitatory synapses.

Recently, research has focused on the implementation of stimulation protocols that would adapt to the patients need (adaptive stimulation) and deliver electrical stimuli only when it is most useful. A formal mathematical description of the effects of electrical stimulation on neuronal networks is a prerequisite for the development of adaptive DBS algorithms. Using tools from non-linear dynamic analysis, we describe an evidence-based, mathematical modeling approach that (1) accurately simulates epileptiform activity at time-scales of single and multiple ictal discharges, (2) simulates modulation of neural dynamics during epileptiform activity in response to fixed, low-frequency electrical stimulation, (3) defines a mapping from real-world observations to model state, and (4) defines a mapping from model state to real-world observations. We validate the real-world utility of the model's properties by statistical comparison between the number, duration, and interval of ictal-like discharges observed in vitro and those simulated in silica under conditions of repeated stimuli at fixed-frequency. These validation results confirm that the evidence-based modeling approach captures robust, informative features of neural network dynamics of in vitro epileptiform activity under periodic pacing and support its use for further implementation of adaptive DBS protocols for epilepsy treatment.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) combined with EEG (fNIRS-EEG) is another imaging technique based on the measurement of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin with complementary clinical potential in epilepsy, for continuous patient monitoring, language lateralization, and focus localization. In this work fMRI-EEG and fNIRS-EEG are used to quantify nonlinear hemodynamic responses in three cases of human refractory focal epilepsy, by using the Volterra kernel expansion up to second order. Prior to analyzing real data, extensive simulations are carried out to show that nonlinearities are estimable. The Volterra methodology is then applied to multimodal data recorded from 3 epileptic patients selected for their frequent spiking activity. Care is taken to account for variability of hemodynamic responses due to other causes than Volterra nonlinearities. Statistically significant nonlinearities are observed for all patients and all modalities. Good concordance between fNIRS and fMRI is found for both the amplitude of the Volterra responses, and, with limitations, in the localization of the epileptic focus and regions of inverted responses (negative BOLD signals). In one patient, Volterra nonlinearities allowed epileptic focus identification with fMRI, while analyses without nonlinearities failed to see it. In simulations when nonlinearities were included, analysis without Volterra nonlinearities performed poorly. These two observations suggest routinely checking for nonlinearities in functional imaging of patients presenting with frequent spikes., (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Increased Stress-Induced Dopamine Release in Psychosis	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Dopamine; neuroimaging; positron emission tomography; prodrome; schizophrenia; stress	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; IN-VIVO; D-3 RECEPTOR; HUMAN BRAIN; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; AGONIST RADIOTRACER; PREDICTIVE-VALIDITY; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE	Background: A pathologic response to common life stressors, in which a hyperresponsive dopaminergic system is thought to play a key role, is a potential etiologic factor in the triggering and relapse of psychosis. However, there is no direct evidence that brain dopaminergic response to stress is exaggerated in psychosis. Methods: Using the ability of endogenous dopamine (DA) to compete with [C-11]-(+)-PHNO binding, as measured with positron emission tomography, we examined stress-induced DA release in response to a validated psychosocial stress task. We studied 12 clinical high-risk (CHR), 10 antipsychotic-naive subjects with schizophrenia (SCZ), and 12 matched healthy volunteers (HV). Stress-induced DA release was estimated as the percent change in binding potential between conditions (stress and control scan) in the striatal subdivisions: limbic striatum (LST), associative striatum (AST), and sensorimotor striatum (SMST). Results: We found a significant difference between groups in the AST (F = 8.13, df = 2,31, p = .001), and at the SMST (F = 3,64, df = 2,31, p = .03) but not in the LST (F = .43, df = 2,31, p = .40) with CHR and SCZ having larger [C-11]-(+)-PHNO displacement in response to the stress. Bonferroni-corrected comparisons confirmed that HV displacement (-2.86%) in the AST was significantly different in CHR (6.97%) and SCZ (11.44%) (with no significant difference between CHR and SCZ). Conclusions: This study reveals a sensitized dopaminergic response to stress in a psychiatric condition and may have important theoretical and clinical implications regarding efforts to abort or delay relapse and/or conversion to psychosis.

Loss of Neuronal Potassium/Chloride Cotransporter 3 (KCC3) Is Responsible for the Degenerative Phenotype in a Conditional Mouse Model of Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Associated with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							K+-CL-COTRANSPORTER; CATION-CHLORIDE COTRANSPORTERS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ABNORMAL-DEVELOPMENT; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MICE LACKING; EXPRESSION; FOREBRAIN; BRAIN	Disruption of the potassium/chloride cotransporter 3 (KCC3), encoded by the SLC12A6 gene, causes hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder affecting both the peripheral nervous system and CNS. However, the precise role of KCC3 in the maintenance of ion homeostasis in the nervous system and the pathogenic mechanisms leading to HMSN/ACC remain unclear. We established two Slc12a6 Cre/LoxP transgenic mouse lines expressing C-terminal truncated KCC3 in either a neuron-specific or ubiquitous fashion. Our results suggest that neuronal KCC3 expression is crucial for axon volume control. We also demonstrate that the neuropathic features of HMSN/ACC are predominantly due to a neuronal KCC3 deficit, while the auditory impairment is due to loss of non-neuronal KCC3 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KCC3 plays an essential role in inflammatory pain pathways. Finally, we observed hypoplasia of the corpus callosum in both mouse mutants and a marked decrease in axonal tracts serving the auditory cortex in only the general deletion mutant. Together, these results establish KCC3 as an important player in both central and peripheral nervous system maintenance.

Results: Here, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen in C. elegans strains that express N-terminal huntingtin (htt) in touch receptor neurons. These neurons control the response to light touch. Their function is strongly impaired by expanded polyglutamines (128Q) as shown by the nearly complete loss of touch response in adult animals, providing an in vivo model in which to manipulate the early phases of expanded-polyQ neurotoxicity. In total, 6034 genes were examined, revealing 662 gene inactivations that either reduce or aggravate defective touch response in 128Q animals. Several genes were previously implicated in HD or neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that this screen has effectively identified candidate targets for HD. Network-based analysis emphasized a subset of high-confidence modifier genes in pathways of interest in HD including metabolic, neurodevelopmental and pro-survival pathways. Finally, 49 modifiers of 128Q-neuron dysfunction that are dysregulated in the striatum of either R/2 or CHL2 HD mice, or both, were identified. Conclusions: Collectively, these results highlight the relevance to HD pathogenesis, providing novel information on the potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection in HD.

High-spatial resolution T1 weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain (1 mm(3)) and standardised memory tests were performed once more in order to compare brain morphology and memory performance originally assessed 3-13 months after head injury (first study) and after 8-10 yr (present study). An overall improvement of memory test performance was demonstrated in the latest assessment, indicating that cognitive recovery in severe nmTBI subjects had not been completed within 3-13 months post-injury. It is notable that the volumes of the fornix and the hippocampus were reduced significantly from normal controls, but these volumes do not differ appreciatively between nmTBI subjects at first (after 1 yr) and at second (after similar to 8yr) scans. On the contrary, a clear reduction in the volume of the corpus callosus can be observed after similar to 1 yr and a further significant reduction is evident after similar to 8yr, indicating that the neural degeneration in severe nmTBI continues long after the head trauma and relates to specific structures and not to the overall brain.

Antidepressant medications with a fast onset have not yet been developed. In addition to the monoaminergic systems, the brain glutaminergic system has been implicated in the etiology of depression. Animal studies of depression have gained importance because they permit a more invasive manipulation of the subjects than human studies. In the present study, we measured the densities of the brain regional metabotropic glutaminergic receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat model of depression and two groups of control rats, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) and Sprague Dawley (SPD), the parent strain for both the FSL and FRL rats. The FSL rats showed lower densities of mGluR5 in many brain regions compared to either the SPD and/or FRL rats. In addition, the densities in the FRL rats were larger than in the SPD rats, suggesting possible problems in using FRL rats as controls. The presented data suggest that mGluR5 is lower in animal models of depression which could be related to the cognitive and emotional dysfunctions in the FSL rat model of depression and could be relevant to a better understanding of depression in humans.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are newly discovered regulators of gene expression that have recently been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including neuropsychiatric diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study was undertaken to examine whether the miRNA network is altered in the brain of depressed suicide subjects. Expression of miRNAs was measured in prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9) of antidepressant-free depressed suicide (n = 18) and well-matched non-psychiatric control subjects (n = 17) using multiplex RT-PCR plates. We found that overall miRNA expression was significantly and globally down-regulated in prefrontal cortex of depressed suicide subjects. Using individual tests of statistical significance, 21 miRNAs were significantly decreased at p = 0.05 or better. Many of the down-regulated miRNAs were encoded at nearby chromosomal loci, shared motifs within the 5'-seeds, and shared putative mRNA targets, several of which have been implicated in depression. In addition, a set of 29 miRNAs, whose expression was not pairwise correlated in the normal controls, showed a high degree of co-regulation across individuals in the depressed suicide group. Conclusions/Significance: The findings show widespread changes in miRNA expression that are likely to participate in pathogenesis of major depression and/or suicide. Further studies are needed to identify whether the miRNA changes lead to altered expression of prefrontal cortex mRNAs, either directly (by acting as miRNA targets) or indirectly (e. g., by affecting transcription factors).

From 10/2005 to 07/2006, we recruited immunocompetent subjects aged >= 50 years with HZ within 14 days of rash onset across Canada. Of the 249 patients recruited, 88 were employed. Data on employment status, absences from work, reasons for absence and effectiveness at work were documented at recruitment, 7-14-21-30-60-90-120-150 and 180 days later. The majority (64%) of employed subjects missed work because of HZ and 76% reported decreased effectiveness at work (i.e. presenteeism) because of HZ/PHN. Mean hours of absenteeism and presenteeism per working individual were 27 and 34h, respectively. Pain severity and duration were associated with greater productivity loss. These results provide new information about the burden of HZ and PHN, which is useful for public health planning and cost-effectiveness analyses of HZ vaccination among individuals of working age.

In chronic disease monitoring, investigators have identified several factors that predict the accuracy of case definitions based on diagnoses in administrative data, and some have even incorporated these predictors into novel case detection methods, resulting in a significant improvement in case definition accuracy. Based on findings from these studies, we sought to identify physician, patient, encounter, and billing characteristics associated with the positive predictive value (PPV) of case definitions for 5 syndromes (fever, gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, and respiratory (including influenza like illness)). Methods: The study sample comprised 4,330 syndrome-positive visits from the claims of 1,098 randomly-selected physicians working in Quebec, Canada in 2005-2007. For each visit, physician-facilitated chart review was used to assess whether the same syndrome was present in the medical chart (gold standard). We used multivariate logistic regression analyses to estimate the association between claim-chart agreement about the presence of a syndrome and physician, patient, encounter, and billing characteristics. Results: The likelihood of the medical chart agreeing with the physician claim about the presence of a syndrome was higher when the treating physician had billed many visits for the same syndrome recently (ORper 10 visit, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08), had a lower workload (ORper 10 claims, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90- 0.97), and when the patient was younger (ORper 5 years of age, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94- 0.97), and less socially deprived (ORmost versus least deprived, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.95). Conclusions: Many physician, patient, encounter, and billing characteristics associated with the PPV of surveillance case definition are accessible to public health, and could be used to reduce false-positive alerts by surveillance systems, either by focusing on the data most likely to be accurate, or by adjusting the observed data for known biases in diagnosis reporting and performing surveillance using the adjusted values.

However, aligning multiple sequences of DNA, an essential intermediate step for most types of analyses, is a difficult computational task. In parallel, citizen science, an approach that takes advantage of the fact that the human brain is exquisitely tuned to solving specific types of problems, is becoming increasingly popular. There, instances of hard computational problems are dispatched to a crowd of non-expert human game players and solutions are sent back to a central server. Methodology/Principal Findings: We introduce Phylo, a human-based computing framework applying "crowd sourcing" techniques to solve the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem. The key idea of Phylo is to convert the MSA problem into a casual game that can be played by ordinary web users with a minimal prior knowledge of the biological context. We applied this strategy to improve the alignment of the promoters of disease-related genes from up to 44 vertebrate species. Since the launch in November 2010, we received more than 350,000 solutions submitted from more than 12,000 registered users. Our results show that solutions submitted contributed to improving the accuracy of up to 70% of the alignment blocks considered. Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that, combined with classical algorithms, crowd computing techniques can be successfully used to help improving the accuracy of MSA. More importantly, we show that an NP-hard computational problem can be embedded in casual game that can be easily played by people without significant scientific training. This suggests that citizen science approaches can be used to exploit the billions of "human-brain peta-flops" of computation that are spent every day playing games.

Together with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPAR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors induction of many forms of synaptic plasticity. Regulation of NMDAR function by cortisol/corticosterone (CORT) may be fundamental to the effects of stress on synaptic plasticity. Recent report of the efficacy of NMDAR antagonists in treating certain stress-associated psychopathologies further highlight the importance of understanding the regulation of NMDAR function by CORT. Knowledge of how corticosteroids regulate belief that NMDAR function is stable in the adult brain. We review recent result from our laboratory and others demonstrating dynamic regulation of NMDAR function by CORT in the adult brain. In addition, we consider the issue of how differences in the early life environment may program differential sensitivity to modulation of NMDAR function by CORT and how this may influence synaptic function durning stress. Findings from these studies demonstrate that NMDAR function in the adult hippocampus remains sensitive to even brief exposures to CORT and that the capacity for modulation of NMDAR may be programmed, in part, by the early life environment. Modulation of NMDAR function may contribute to dynamic regulation of synaptic plasticity and adaptation in the face of stress, however, enhanced NMDAR function may be implicated in mechanisms of stress-related psychopathologies including depression.

Organization and Reorganization of Sensory-Deprived Cortex	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Review							CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; CONGENITALLY BLIND HUMANS; VISUAL-CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; MULTISENSORY CONVERGENCE; WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; DEAF	The scientific literature has grown rich in research illustrating the remarkable ability of the brain to reorganize itself following sensory loss. In particular, visually deafferented regions within the occipital cortex of early blind individuals have been repeatedly shown to be functionally recruited to carry out a wide variety of nonvisual tasks. While the novelty of such a finding might be wearing off, more recent research has begun to examine whether this crossmodal takeover of the occipital cortex in blindness follows some sort of organizational principle. Here we first review the most recent evidence from neuroimaging studies that illustrate how the pre-existing functional specialization of cortical sub-regions appears to be preserved following sensory deprivation. We discuss and compare work on visual and auditory deprivation, as well as research on individuals with intact sensory systems. We suggest avenues for future exploration of these issues, such as identifying the neuroanatomical markers of crossmodal plasticity and elucidating the behavioral relevance of observed changes.

Musical pitch fluctuations follow a 1/f power law that precisely achieves this balance. Musical rhythms, especially those of Western classical music, are considered highly regular and predictable, and this predictability has been hypothesized to underlie rhythm's contribution to our enjoyment of music. Are musical rhythms indeed entirely predictable and how do they vary with genre and composer? To answer this question, we analyzed the rhythm spectra of 1,788 movements from 558 compositions of Western classical music. We found that an overwhelming majority of rhythms obeyed a 1/f(beta) power law across 16 subgenres and 40 composers, with beta ranging from similar to 0.5-1. Notably, classical composers, whose compositions are known to exhibit nearly identical 1/f pitch spectra, demonstrated distinctive 1/f rhythm spectra: Beethoven's rhythms were among the most predictable, and Mozart's among the least. Our finding of the ubiquity of 1/f rhythm spectra in compositions spanning nearly four centuries demonstrates that, as with musical pitch, musical rhythms also exhibit a balance of predictability and surprise that could contribute in a fundamental way to our aesthetic experience of music. Although music compositions are intended to be performed, the fact that the notated rhythms follow a 1/f spectrum indicates that such structure is no mere artifact of performance or perception, but rather, exists within the written composition before the music is performed. Furthermore, composers systematically manipulate (consciously or otherwise) the predictability in 1/f rhythms to give their compositions unique identities.

Along the radial or apicobasal axis, retinal neurons and their dendritic and axonal arbors are segregated into layers, while perpendicular to this axis, in the tangential plane, four of the six neuronal types form patterned cellular arrays, or mosaics. Currently, the molecular cues that control retinal cell positioning are not well-understood, especially those that operate in the tangential plane. Here we investigated the role of the PTEN phosphatase in establishing a functional retinal architecture. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the developing retina, PTEN was localized preferentially to ganglion, amacrine and horizontal cells, whose somata are distributed in mosaic patterns in the tangential plane. Generation of a retina-specific Pten knock-out resulted in retinal ganglion, amacrine and horizontal cell hypertrophy, and expansion of the inner plexiform layer. The spacing of Pten mutant mosaic populations was also aberrant, as were the arborization and fasciculation patterns of their processes, displaying cell type-specific defects in the radial and tangential dimensions. Irregular oscillatory potentials were also observed in Pten mutant electroretinograms, indicative of asynchronous amacrine cell firing. Furthermore, while Pten mutant RGC axons targeted appropriate brain regions, optokinetic spatial acuity was reduced in Pten mutant animals. Finally, while some features of the Pten mutant retina appeared similar to those reported in Dscam-mutant mice, PTEN expression and activity were normal in the absence of Dscam. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that Pten regulates somal positioning and neurite arborization patterns of a subset of retinal cells that form mosaics, likely functioning independently of Dscam, at least during the embryonic period. Our findings thus reveal an unexpected level of cellular specificity for the multi-purpose phosphatase, and identify Pten as an integral component of a novel cell positioning pathway in the retina.

Search for standard model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; UPGRADE; DETECTOR	We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson in proton-antiproton collisions (p (p) over bar -> W+ H -> lvb (b) over bar) at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The search employs data collected with the CDF II detector which correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 2.7 fb(-1). We recorded this data with two kinds of triggers. The first kind required high-p(T) charged leptons and the second required both missing transverse energy and jets. The search selects events consistent with a signature of a single lepton (e(+/-)/mu(+/-)),missing transverse energy, and two jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary vertex tagging method and a jet probability tagging method. Kinematic information is fed in an artificial neural network to improve discrimination between signal and background. The search finds that both the observed number of events and the neural network output distributions are consistent with the standard model background expectations, and sets 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio. The limits are expressed as a ratio to the standard model production rate. The limits range from 3.6 (4.3 expected) to 61.1 (43.2 expected) for Higgs masses from 100 to 150 GeV/c(2), respectively.

During metaphase, the spindle positioning protein Kar9 accumulates asymmetrically, localizing specifically to astral microtubules emanating from the old spindle pole body (SPB) and driving its segregation to the bud. Here, we show that the SPB component Nud1/centriolin acts through the mitotic exit network (MEN) to specify asymmetric SPB inheritance. In the absence of MEN signaling, Kar9 asymmetry is unstable and its preference for the old SPB is disrupted. Consistent with this, phosphorylation of Kar9 by the MEN kinases Dbf2 and Dbf20 is not required to break Kar9 symmetry but is instead required to maintain stable association of Kar9 with the old SPB throughout metaphase. We propose that MEN signaling links Kar9 regulation to SPB identity through biasing and stabilizing the age-insensitive, cyclin-B-dependent mechanism of symmetry breaking.

Present in high concentrations in brain cell membranes, sphingolipids are now known to possess important cell signaling functions in addition to their structural role. In the past 20 y, additional support for vitamin K functions in the nervous system has come from the discovery and characterization of vitamin K-dependent proteins that are now known to play key roles in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Notably, protein Gas6 has been shown to be actively involved in cell survival, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, and cell growth of neurons and glial cells. Although limited in number, studies focusing on the relationship between vitamin K nutritional status and behavior and cognition have also become available, pointing to diet and certain drug treatments (i.e., warfarin derivatives) as potential modulators of the action of vitamin K in the nervous system. This review presents an overview of the research that first identified vitamin K as an important nutrient for the nervous system and summarizes recent findings that support this notion. Adv.

Little is known about the factors influencing professionals' use of wikis. Objectives : To identify and compare the beliefs of emergency physicians (EPs) and allied health professionals (AHPs) about using a wiki-based reminder that promotes evidence-based care for traumatic brain injuries. Methods : Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, we conducted semistructured interviews to elicit EPs' and AHPs' beliefs about using a wiki-based reminder. Previous studies suggested a sample of 25 EPs and 25 AHPs. We purposefully selected participants from three trauma centers in Quebec, Canada, to obtain a representative sample. Using univariate analyses, we assessed whether our participants' gender, age, and level of experience were similar to those of all eligible individuals. Participants viewed a video showing a clinician using a wiki-based reminder, and we interviewed participants about their behavioral, control, and normative beliefs-that is, what they saw as advantages, disadvantages, barriers, and facilitators to their use of a reminder, and how they felt important referents would perceive their use of a reminder. Two reviewers independently analyzed the content of the interview transcripts. We considered the 75% most frequently mentioned beliefs as salient. We retained some less frequently mentioned beliefs as well. Results : Of 66 eligible EPs and 444 eligible AHPs, we invited 55 EPs and 39 AHPs to participate, and 25 EPs and 25 AHPs (15 nurses, 7 respiratory therapists, and 3 pharmacists) accepted. Participating AHPs had more experience than eligible AHPs (mean 14 vs 11 years; P =.04). We noted no other significant differences. Among EPs, the most frequently reported advantage of using a wiki-based reminder was that it refreshes the memory (n = 14); among AHPs, it was that it provides rapid access to protocols (n = 16). Only 2 EPs mentioned a disadvantage (the wiki added stress). The most frequently reported favorable referent was nurses for EPs (n = 16) and EPs for AHPs (n = 19). The most frequently reported unfavorable referents were people resistant to standardized care for EPs (n = 8) and people less comfortable with computers for AHPs (n = 11). The most frequent facilitator for EPs was ease of use (n = 19); for AHPs, it was having a bedside computer (n = 20). EPs' most frequently reported barrier was irregularly updated wiki-based reminders (n = 18); AHPs'was undetermined legal responsibility (n = 10). Conclusions : We identified EPs' and AHPs' salient beliefs about using a wiki-based reminder. We will draw on these beliefs to construct a questionnaire to measure the importance of these determinants to EPs' and AHPs' intention to use a wiki-based reminder promoting evidence-based care for traumatic brain injuries.

An Endovascular Perforation Model of Subarachnoid Haemorrhage in Rat Produces Heterogeneous Infarcts that Increase with Blood Load	TRANSLATIONAL STROKE RESEARCH			English	Article						Subarachnoid haemorrhage; Model; Infarct; Blood load; Neuronal damage	DELAYED CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; CASE-FATALITY; VASOSPASM; BRAIN; PRESSURE; DAMAGE; DEATH; FLOW	Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating disease and a major burden on society. Despite this, pharmacological treatment options are limited. Appropriate animal modelling of SAH is essential for the development of neuroprotective drugs, but experimental SAH often fails to produce widespread neuronal loss, as frequently seen in humans. We report that a recently described modification of the endovascular perforation model in rat produced widespread heterogeneous infarcts 72 h after SAH. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored, with or without intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement, for 1 h after induction of SAH. Blood load size was assessed, and brain injury was quantified at 72 h using histological staining, blood brain barrier breakdown assessment and immunofluorescent imaging of neuronal viability and microglial activation. Results showed that ICP measurement allowed for faster recovery of CBF, potentially reducing brain injury. Larger subarachnoid blood loads predicted more extensive neuronal damage which was easily quantified with the combination of histological and immunohistochemical techniques. Thus, for the investigation of neuroprotective strategies after SAH, the present protocol produces quantifiable, clinically relevant, heterogeneous patterns of infarct due to large blood loads, high ICP and low CBF.

In such settings, the RBM only yields a preprocessing or an initialization for some other model, instead of acting as a complete supervised model in its own right. In this paper, we argue that RBMs can provide a self-contained framework for developing competitive classifiers. We study the Classification RBM (ClassRBM), a variant on the RBM adapted to the classification setting. We study different strategies for training the ClassRBM and show that competitive classification performances can be reached when appropriately combining discriminative and generative training objectives. Since training according to the generative objective requires the computation of a generally intractable gradient, we also compare different approaches to estimating this gradient and address the issue of obtaining such a gradient for problems with very high dimensional inputs. Finally, we describe how to adapt the ClassRBM to two special cases of classification problems, namely semi-supervised and multitask learning.

There were two experimental (attention to pleasantness and attention to unpleasantness) and one control (baseline) condition. The stimuli presented during the two experimental conditions were exactly the same (three binary mixtures, each consisting of one pleasant and one unpleasant compound), but the affective property to which participants' attention was directed was different: They indicated with a mouse click whether each stimulus contained a pleasant (during attention to pleasantness) or unpleasant (during attention to unpleasantness) odor. During baseline, odorless stimuli were presented, and participants pressed the mouse button randomly after each one. Several brain regions were involved in both types of attention, and these included ventral striatum, right orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Subtle differences were also revealed: Attending to pleasantness was associated preferentially with a sensory/perceptual network (piriform cortex and amygdala), whereas attending to unpleasantness engaged a component of the attentional (right parietal) network. Thus, we delineate neural substrates of attending to olfactory pleasantness and unpleasantness, some of which are common to both and others that are specific to pleasantness or to unpleasantness. Our results suggest that the view of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system as the reward network that responds selectively to positive reinforcers is somewhat limited: Our findings are more in keeping with a view of this set of structures as the salience system of the brain.

Our purpose was to determine the mean needle placement error in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, and midbrain of a canine cadaver brain using the modified Brainsight (TM) stereotactic system. Relocatable reference markers (fiducial markers) were attached to the cadaver head using a dental bite block. A T1-weighted gradient echo three-dimensional (3D) sequence was acquired using set parameters. Fiducial markers were used to register the head to the acquired MR images in reference to a 3D position sensor. This allowed the planning of trajectory path to brain targets in real time. Coordinates (X, Y, Z) were established for each target and 0.5 mu l of diluted gadolinium was injected at each target using a 26-gauge needle to create a lesion. The center of the gadolinium deposition was identified on the postoperative MR images and coordinates (X', Y', Z') were established. The precision of this system in bringing the needle to target (needle placement error) was calculated. Seventeen sites were targeted in the brain. The mean needle placement error for all target sites was 1.79 +/- 0.87 mm. The upper bound of error for this stereotactic system was 3.31 mm. There was no statistically significant relationship between needle placement error and target depth (P = 0.23). The ease of use and precision of this stereotactic system support its development for clinical use in dogs with brain lesions >3.31 mm. (C) 2012 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.

These modified responses may stem from a direct alteration of how emotional stimuli are coded, and/or the cognitive function implicated in emotion modulation, such as self-regulation or inhibition. These ES effects have been probed on tasks either targeting reward and inhibitory function. Findings revealed deficits in both reward processing and inhibitory control in ES youths. However, no work has yet examined whether incentives can improve automatic response or inhibitory control in ES youths. Method: To determine whether incentives would only improve self-regulated voluntary actions or generalize to automated motoric responses, participants were tested on a mixed eye movement task that included reflex-like prosaccades and voluntary controlled antisaccade eye movements. Seventeen adopted children (10 females, mean age 11.3 years) with a documented history of neglect and 29 typical healthy youths (16 females, mean age 11.9 years) performed the mixed prosaccade/antisaccade task during monetary incentive conditions or during no-incentive conditions. Results: Across both saccade types, ES adolescents responded more slowly than controls. As expected, control participants committed fewer errors on antisaccades during the monetary incentive condition relative to the no-incentive condition. By contrast, ES youths failed to show this incentive-related improvement on inhibitory control. No significant incentive effects were found with prepotent prosaccades trials in either group. Finally co-morbid psychopathology did not modulate the findings. Conclusions: These data suggest that youths with experience of early stress exhibit deficient modulation of inhibitory control by reward processes, in tandem with a reward-independent deficit in preparation for both automatic and controlled responses. These data may be relevant to interventions in ES youths. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Memory for facial expressions in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy: Preliminary findings	ESTUDIOS DE PSICOLOGIA			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; emotional memory; amygdala; facial expressions	UNILATERAL AMYGDALA DAMAGE; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; SURGERY; FMRI	Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (ME) is associated with memory and emotional impairments. However, the majority of previous studies examined patients after the affected structures (hippocampus and amygdala) were surgically removed, so it remains unclear to what extent these deficits are associated with the diners itself or are a consequence of the surgery. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare recognition memory for facial emotional expressions in pre- and post-surgery TLE patients, and its relationship to neuropsychological and clinical variables. We observed higher memory accuracy in pre-surgical patients than in those who had undergone surgery. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the task and the executive functions and memory subtests of the neuropsychological battery, as well as a negative correlation with illness duration. These preliminary results suggest a possible effect of the surgical resection on memory, and highlight the importance of an early intervention for reducing cognitive decline.

Studies in human, mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish have shown that only a limited number of claudins are expressed in endothelial cells. Here, we report the expression pattern of Claudin-5 during chick development. Between HH stage 4 and 6 Claudin-5 expression was observed exclusively in extraembryonic tissue. Claudin-5 expression was not observed in the embryo until HH stage 8, coincident with the onset of embryonic vascularization. Claudin-5 expression was maintained in the developing vasculature in the embryonic and extraembryonic tissue throughout organogenesis (HH stage 19-35), including the vasculature of the ectoderm and of organs derived from the mesoderm and endoderm lineages. These data describe a conserved expression pattern for Claudin-5 in the endothelial tight junction barrier and is the first report of the onset of Claudin-5 expression in a vertebrate embryo.

INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Working memory; Executive functions; Cognitive control; Cognitive skills; Learning-related behavior; School readiness	EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; LATER ACHIEVEMENT; SELF-DISCIPLINE; YOUNG-CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; BIRTH; INTERVENTION	Converging findings in psychology, neuroscience, education, and economics suggests that child persistence in learning represents an important determinant of academic success during the school years. Nevertheless, the developmental origins of productive learning behaviors are not well understood. Some findings suggest that executive function skills may be developmental precursors to learning-related behaviors. The present study examines how toddler working memory skills predict subsequent achievement and classroom engagement in kindergarten. Participants are 1824 children from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Children were individually assessed on working memory at age 29 and 41 months, using the Imitation Sorting Task. When children were 74 months of age, kindergarten teachers rated classroom engagement and trained examiners assessed number knowledge and receptive vocabulary. Multiple regression analyses revealed a positive prospective association between early working memory scores and later classroom engagement, (standardized beta=.076), number knowledge, (standardized beta=.133), and receptive vocabulary (standardized beta=.059). These results were above and beyond child sex, verbal and nonverbal intellectual skills, and socioeconomic status. The findings propose a robust, easily accessible, and cost effective assessment method of early childhood executive function for the development of early childhood interventions that improve school readiness.

To establish best practice recommendations, it is necessary to appraise the evidence regarding specific executive function interventions post stroke. This systematic review aims to determine whether executive function intervention is more effective than no or alternative intervention in improving executive functions and functional abilities in the acute, subacute, and chronic stages post stroke. Method: A systematic review was performed up to January 2011 of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, OTseeker, and Cochrane databases. Eligible studies needed to include a cognitive intervention to remediate executive function impairments post stroke or to improve functional tasks compromised by these impairments. Methodological quality of randomized trials was rated by 2 authors. The level of evidence for each intervention, according to stage of recovery, was determined. Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria 1 evaluating treatment in the subacute and 9 in the chronic stage. Limited evidence from the 1 study in the subacute stage (level 2b) and 9 studies (including 3 randomized controlled trials) in the chronic stage (level 2a) support using remedial (eg, computerized working memory training) and compensatory interventions (eg, problem-solving strategies, paging system) for improving executive functioning and, possibly, functional abilities. Conclusion: These findings suggest that persons with stroke may possibly benefit from specific executive function training and learn compensatory strategies to reduce the consequences of executive impairments. Further research is needed in acute and subacute stroke, when the impact of treatment is potentially great and where few studies have been undertaken.

We performed a systematic review of the literature on the treatment of tic disorders. A multi-institutional group of 14 experts in psychiatry, child psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, and psychology engaged in a consensus meeting. The evidence was presented and discussed, and nominal group techniques were employed to arrive at consensus on recommendations. A strong recommendation is made when the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks and burdens, and can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation. With a weak recommendation, the benefits, risks, and burdens are more closely balanced, and the best action may differ depending on the circumstances. Based on these principles, weak recommendations were made for the use of pimozide, haloperidol, fluphenazine, metoclopramide (children only), risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, topiramate, baclofen (children only), botulinum toxin injections, tetrabenazine, and cannabinoids (adults only). Strong recommendations were made for the use of clonidine and guanfacine (children only). While the evidence supports the efficacy of many of the antipsychotics for the treatment of tics, the high rates of side effects associated with these medications resulted in only weak recommendations for these drugs. In situations where tics are not severe or disabling, the use of a medication with only a weak recommendation is not warranted. However, when tics are more distressing and interfering, the need for tic suppression to improve quality of life is stronger, and patients and clinicians may be more willing to accept the risks of pharmacotherapy.

We conducted a systematic literature search for clinical trials on the treatment of tics. One evidence-based review (including 30 studies) and 3 studies on behavioural interventions, 3 studies on deep brain stimulation (DBS), and 3 studies on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) met our inclusion criteria. Based on this evidence, we have made strong recommendations for the use of habit reversal therapy and exposure and response prevention, preferably embedded within a supportive, psychoeducational program, and with the option to combine either of these approaches with pharmacotherapy. Although evidence exists for the efficacy of DBS, the quality of this evidence is poor and the risks and burdens of the procedure are finely balanced with the perceived benefits. Our recommendation is that this intervention continues to be considered an experimental treatment for severe, medically refractory tics that have imposed severe limitations on quality of life. We recommend that the procedure should only be performed within the context of research studies and by physicians expert in DBS programming and in the management of tics. There is no evidence to support the use of TMS in the treatment of tics. However, the procedure is associated with a low rate of known complications and could continue to be evaluated within research protocols. The recommendations we provide are based on current knowledge, and further studies may result in their revision in future.

By using combined EEG-fNIRS recordings, we sought to better understand the pathophysiology of temporal lobe seizures. Results: Nine patients (5 males; mean age 35 years; range 11-56 years) with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy underwent combined EEG-fNIRS recordings. Eight complex partial seizures from 3 patients were successfully recorded. All seizures were associated with significant local and remote haemodynamic changes which outlasted the duration of seizures. Over the epileptogenic temporal lobe, increased oxygenation [increase in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and oxyhaemoglobin (HbO), decrease in deoxyhaemoglobin (HbR)] was followed by a deoxygenated state [increase in HbR]. A similar haemodynamic profile was seen over the contralateral temporal lobe (even without evidence of epileptic propagation) though variations generally had lower amplitudes. Heterogeneous haemodynamic changes in remote frontal and/or parietal areas were also noted early on when epileptic activity was limited to the temporal lobe. Conclusion: EEG-fNIRS reveals complex local and remote oxygenation changes during temporal lobe seizures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ventral striatum is implicated in the analgesic effect of mood changes. Pain Res Manage 2012; 17(2): 69-74. BACKGROUND: The ventral striatum, particularly the nucleus accumbens, is commonly associated with the processing of reward and positive stimuli, positive affect as well as antinociceptive processes. OBJECTIVES: The present study examined whether the ventral striatum is implicated in analgesia resulting from positive mood change induced by pleasant odours. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies were conducted in healthy individuals receiving painful heat stimuli in the presence of pleasant or unpleasant odours, which were used to induce positive and negative mood states. Ventral striatum activity was examined in the two mood states. RESULTS: For most subjects, pleasant odours improved mood and reduced pain unpleasantness perception relative to unpleasant odours. In the pleasant odour condition, the maximum activation of both the left and right ventral striatum was positively correlated with the amount of pain reduction. Furthermore, the left and right ventral striatum activations positively covaried with one another, and the right ventral striatum activation positively correlated with that in the periaqueductal grey matter. Both ventral striatum activations negatively covaried with the activation of the right mediodorsal thalamus, left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, left medial prefrontal cortex and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Because both the mediodorsal thalamus and anterior cingulate are involved in pain affect perception, and activation within the prefrontal areas and periaqueductal grey matter were previously shown to correlate with mood-related pain modulation, it is concluded that the ventral striatum is likely implicated in the analgesic effect of positive mood changes induced by pleasant odours on pain unpleasantness.

Cerecyte Coil Trial: Procedural Safety and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Ruptured and Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							MATCHED-PAIR ANALYSIS; BARE PLATINUM COILS; ENDOVASCULAR COILING; CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; EMBOLIZATION; EXPERIENCE; OCCLUSION; ISAT; COMPLICATIONS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study arose from a need to systematically evaluate the clinical and angiographic outcomes of intracranial aneurysms treated with modified coils. We report the procedural safety and clinical outcomes in a prospective randomized controlled trial of endovascular coiling for ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms, comparing polymer-loaded Cerecyte coils with bare platinum coils in 23 centers worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred patients between 18 and 70 years of age with a ruptured or unruptured target aneurysm planning to undergo endovascular coiling were randomized to receive Cerecyte or bare platinum coils. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-nine patients were allocated to Cerecyte coils and 251 to bare platinum coils. Baseline characteristics were balanced. For ruptured aneurysms, in-hospital mortality was 2/114 (1.8%) with Cerecyte versus 0/119 (0%) bare platinum coils. There were 8 (3.4%) adverse procedural events resulting in neurological deterioration: 5/114 (4.4%) with Cerecyte versus 3/119 (2.5%) with bare platinum coils (P = .22). The 6-month mRS score of <= 2 was not significantly different in 103/109 (94.5%) patients with Cerecyte and 110/112 (98.2%) patients with bare platinum coils. Poor outcome (mRS score of >= 3 or death) was 6/109 (5.5%) with Cerecyte versus 2/112 (1.8%) with bare platinum coils (P = .0701. For UlAs, there was no in-hospital mortality. There were 7 (2.7%) adverse procedural events with neurological deterioration, 5/133 (3.8%) with Cerecyte versus 2/131 (1.5%) with bare platinum coils (P = .13). There was a 6-month mRS score of <= 2 in 114/119 (95.8%) patients with Cerecyte versus 123/123 (100%) patients with bare platinum coils. There was poor outcome (mRS >= 3 and 1 death) in 5/119 (4.2%) patients with Cerecyte versus 0/123 (0%) patients with bare platinum coils (P = .011). CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistical excess of poor outcomes in the Cerecyte arm at discharge in the ruptured aneurysm group and at 6-month follow-up in the unruptured group. Overall adverse clinical outcomes and in-hospital mortality were exceptionally low in both groups.

As a unique cofactor to the ?-glutamyl carboxylase enzyme, vitamin K contributes to the biological activation of proteins Gas6 and protein S, ligands for the receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer). Functionally, Gas6 has been involved in a wide range of cellular processes that include cell growth, survival, and apoptosis. In brain, vitamin K also participates in the synthesis of sphingolipids, an important class of lipids present in high concentrations in brain cell membranes. In addition to their structural role, sphingolipids are now known to partake in important cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, senescence and cellcell interactions. In recent years, studies have linked alterations in sphingolipid metabolism to age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging data also point to unique actions of the K vitamer menaquinone-4 (MK-4) against oxidative stress and inflammation. Finally, there is now data to suggest that vitamin K has the potential to influence psychomotor behavior and cognition. This review presents an overview of what is known of the role of vitamin K in brain function.

Defects in the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway have been strongly associated with NTDs in animal models and human cohorts. In this genetic study, we examined the core PCP gene CELSR1 in NTDs and caudal agenesis cases to determine whether mutations at this gene predispose to these defects. METHODS: We sequenced the coding region and the exon-intron junctions of CELSR1 in a cohort of 473 patients affected with various forms of open and closed NTDs (412) or caudal agenesis (61). Novel and rare variants (<1%) were genotyped in a cohort of 639 ethnically-matched individuals. The effect of novel missense mutations absent in controls and in public databases on protein function was predicted in silico. RESULTS: We identified in our cohort one nonsense mutation in exon 1 of CELSR1 that truncates the majority of the protein in one patient with NTD and one in-frame 12 bp deletion that removes a putative PKC phosphorylation "SSR'' motif in one caudal agenesis patient. We also detected a total of 13 novel missense variants in 12 patients (11 NTDs and 1 caudal agenesis) that were predicted to be pathogenic in silico. CONCLUSIONS: We detected novel CELSR1 mutations predicted to be pathogenic in 2.9% of our NTD cohort and 3.3% of our caudal agenesis cohort. Our findings implicate CELSR1 as a risk factor for NTDs or caudal agenesis and provide additional evidence for a pathogenic role of PCP signaling in these malformations.

A phase I dose-escalation and pharmacokinetic study of sunitinib in combination with pemetrexed in patients with advanced solid malignancies, with an expanded cohort in non-small cell lung cancer	CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Antiangiogenic; Pemetrexed; Phase I; Solid tumors; Sunitinib; Tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Lung cancer	TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR; CISPLATIN PLUS GEMCITABINE; ANTIANGIOGENIC THERAPY; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY; III TRIAL; SU11248; CHEMOTHERAPY; BEVACIZUMAB; CARCINOMA	Purpose The primary objective of this phase I dose-escalation study was to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sunitinib plus pemetrexed in patients with advanced cancer. Methods Using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design, patients received oral sunitinib qd by continuous daily dosing (CDD schedule; 37.5 or 50 mg) or 2 weeks on/1 week off treatment schedule (Schedule 2/1; 50 mg). Pemetrexed (300-500 mg/m(2) IV) was administered q3w. At the proposed recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), additional patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled. Results Thirty-five patients were enrolled on the CDD schedule and seven on Schedule 2/1. MTDs were sunitinib 37.5 mg/day (CDD/RP2D) or 50 mg/day (Schedule 2/1) with pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicities included grade (G) 5 cerebral hemorrhage, G3 febrile neutropenia, and G3 anorexia. Common G3/4 drug-related non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) at the CDD MTD included fatigue, anorexia, and hand-foot syndrome. G3/4 hematologic AEs included lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. No significant drug-drug interactions were identified. Five (24%) NSCLC patients had partial responses. Conclusions In patients with advanced solid malignancies, the MTD of sunitinib plus 500 mg/m(2) pemetrexed was 37.5 mg/day (CDD schedule) or 50 mg/day (Schedule 2/1). The CDD schedule MTD was tolerable and demonstrated promising clinical benefit in NSCLC.	[Chow, L. Q. M.; Jonker, D. J.; Laurie, S.

J	Oropeza, D; Horb, M				Oropeza, Daniel; Horb, Marko			Transient expression of Ngn3 in Xenopus endoderm promotes early and ectopic development of pancreatic beta and delta cells	GENESIS			English	Article						diabetes; reprogramming; endoderm progenitor; microarray; endocrine; transcription factor; hormone inducible	EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; ISLET DIFFERENTIATION; PROGENITOR CELLS; FAMILY PROTEINS; NEUROGENIN3; LIVER; GUT; REVEALS; LAEVIS	Promoting ectopic development of pancreatic beta cells from other cell types is one of the strategies being pursued for the treatment of diabetes. To achieve this, a detailed outline of the molecular lineage that operates in pancreatic progenitor cells to generate beta cells over other endocrine cell types is necessary. Here, we demonstrate that early transient expression of the endocrine progenitor bHLH protein Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) favors the promotion of pancreatic beta and delta cell fates over an alpha cell fate, while later transient expression promotes ectopic development of all three endocrine cell fates. We found that short-term activation of Ngn3 in Xenopus laevis endoderm just after gastrulation was sufficient to promote both early and ectopic development of beta and delta cells. By examining gene expression changes 4 h after Ngn3 activation we identified several new downstream targets of Ngn3. We show that several of these are required for the promotion of ectopic beta cells by Ngn3 as well as for normal beta cell development. These results provide new detail regarding the Ngn3 transcriptional network operating in endocrine progenitor cells to specify a beta cell phenotype and should help define new approaches to promote ectopic development of beta cells for diabetes therapy. genesis 50:271285, 2012.

Using countries as replicates has, however, several potential confounding factors, particularly because detection rates vary with country wealth. Using an independent dataset entirely within France, we further establish the significance of the association between T. gondii and brain cancer and find additional demographic resolution. In adult age classes 55 years and older, regional mortality rates due to brain cancer correlated positively with the local seroprevalence of T. gondii. This effect was particularly strong for men. While this novel evidence of a significant statistical association between T. gondii infection and brain cancer does not demonstrate causation, these results suggest that investigations at the scale of the individual are merited.

How should bladder sensation be measured?: ICI-RS 2011	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Review						afferent; bladder sensation	LOWER URINARY-TRACT; YOUNG HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION; OVERACTIVE BLADDER; MICTURITION REFLEX; URGE INCONTINENCE; SENSORY THRESHOLD; AFFERENT NERVES; URETHRAL SENSATION	Aims Disturbed bladder sensations, or in broader terms, sensory dysfunctions are increasingly recognized as key elements in the origin and manifestation of symptom syndromes of urinary dysfunction. Adequate assessment of bladder sensation is crucial to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of urinary dysfunction. This manuscript summarizes the discussions of a think tank on How to measure bladder sensation held at the ICI-RS meeting in 2011. Methods: Based upon literature reviews on bladder sensation presented at the think tank in the ICI-RS meeting, discussions evolved which were summarized in the ICI-RS report. Different physicians/researchers further elaborated on this report, which is presented in this manuscript. Results: Bladder sensations are not merely the result of bladder distension. Other factors inside the bladder or bladder wall: central processing and/or cognitive manipulation may play an important role. Current methods to measure sensations such as urodynamics, voiding diaries, forced diuresis, electrical stimulation and brain imaging are likely sub-optimal as they only consider part of these factors in isolation. Conclusions: Different methods to measure bladder sensations have been described and are used in clinical practice. Current methods only address part of the parameters responsible for the generation and perception of urinary sensations.

Mutations in the Mitochondrial Methionyl-tRNA Synthetase Cause a Neurodegenerative Phenotype in Flies and a Recessive Ataxia (ARSAL) in Humans	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION-ARRAY; DROSOPHILA-PARKIN MUTANTS; UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; PINK1/PARKIN PATHWAY; RETINAL DEGENERATION; FRIEDREICHS-ATAXIA; DNA DEPLETION; COPY-NUMBER; GENE; DISEASE	An increasing number of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, or function have been found to be mutated in metabolic disorders and neurological diseases such as Leigh Syndrome. In a forward genetic screen to identify genes required for neuronal function and survival in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons, we have identified mutations in the mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase, Aats-met, the homologue of human MARS2. The fly mutants exhibit age-dependent degeneration of photoreceptors, shortened lifespan, and reduced cell proliferation in epithelial tissues. We further observed that these mutants display defects in oxidative phosphorylation, increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and an upregulated mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response. With the aid of this knowledge, we identified MARS2 to be mutated in Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia with Leukoencephalopathy (ARSAL) patients. We uncovered complex rearrangements in the MARS2 gene in all ARSAL patients. Analysis of patient cells revealed decreased levels of MARS2 protein and a reduced rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Patient cells also exhibited reduced Complex I activity, increased ROS, and a slower cell proliferation rate, similar to Drosophila Aats-met mutants.

More recently, emphasis has been placed on enhancing remyelination and providing oligodendrocyte-protection after a spinal cord injury (SCI). Demyelination post-SCI is part of the cascading secondary injury that takes place immediately after the primary insult; therefore, therapeutic measures are needed to reduce oligodendrocyte death and/or enhance remyelination during the acute stage, preserving neurological functions that would be lost otherwise. In this review a thorough investigation of the oligodendrocyte-protective and remyelinative molecular therapies available to date is provided. The advent of new biomaterials shown to promote remyelination post-SCI is discussed mainly in the context of a combinatorial approach where the biomaterial also provides drug delivery capabilities. The aim of these molecular and biomaterial-based therapies is twofold: (1) oligodendrocyte-protective therapy, which involves protecting already existing oligodendrocytes from undergoing apoptosis/necrosis; and (2) inductive remyelination, which involves harnessing the remyelinative capabilities of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at the lesion site by providing a suitable environment for their migration, survival, proliferation and differentiation. From the evidence reported in the literature, we conclude that the use of a combinatorial approach including biomaterials and molecular therapies would provide advantages such as: (1) sustained release of the therapeutic molecule, (2) local delivery at the lesion site, and (3) an environment at the site of injury that promotes OPC migration, differentiation and remyelination.

This network composed of neurons mostly associated to the trigeminal system is found between the rostral borders of the trigeminal motor nucleus and facial nucleus. This review summarizes current knowledge on the anatomical organization, the development, the connectivity and the cellular properties of these trigeminal circuits in relation to mastication. Emphasis is put on a population of rhythmogenic neurons in the dorsal part of the trigeminal sensory nucleus. These neurons have intrinsic bursting capabilities, supported by a persistent Na+ current (I-NaP), which are enhanced when the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ diminishes. Presented evidence suggest that the Ca2+ dependency of this current combined with its voltage-dependency could provide a mechanism for cortical and sensory afferent inputs to the nucleus to interact with the rhythmogenic properties of its neurons to adjust and adapt the rhythmic output. Astrocytes are postulated to contribute to this process by modulating the extracellular Ca2+ concentration and a model is proposed to explain how functional microdomains defined by the boundaries of astrocytic syncitia may form under the influence of incoming inputs.

Methods: The study is a prospective cohort of a convenient sample of patients younger than 18 years old diagnosed with migraine and treated with intravenous prochlorperazine in adjunction with diphenhydramine in the emergency department. The evaluation of pain and akathisia was performed before the treatment and was repeated 60 minutes later and before discharge. A telephone follow-up was completed to assess relapse in pain and presence of akathisia. The effectiveness of prochlorperazine was determined using different outcomes: 50% reduction of pain, pain-free patients, treatment failure, and relapse of pain. Results: Of the 79 patients included in the study for 25 months, 64 (81%) either met the International Headache Society criteria or had a diagnosis of migraine confirmed by a neurologist at follow-up. Among these patients, 47 (100%) of 47 had a 50% reduction of pain, and 24 (50%) of 48 were pain free at discharge. Only 14 (22%) of 64 patients had a treatment failure. However, 43 (68%) of 63 patients had a relapse of their headache within the first week after discharge. Overall, among the 79 patients, 4 (5%) had a definitive diagnosis of akathisia, but 27 (34%) other patients presented symptoms suggesting a possible diagnosis of akathisia. Conclusion: Prochlorperazine seems very effective to decrease pain on a short-term basis in children. However, more than two thirds of the patients, overall, had a relapse of their migraine at home in the first week. Despite the use of diphenhydramine, akathisia remains a concern.

Although the CRI parameters are sufficiently precise to exhibit significant correlations with macromolecular content in tissue, their accuracy is hindered by the CRI modeling and measurement variability. In this article, several sources of CRI variability are examined, such as T1 mapping bias, magnetization transfer signal drift, and inaccuracies due to tissue modeling. Simple corrections schemes are proposed to account for these effects and to improve the CRI accuracy. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nonhomogeneous transfer reveals specificity in speech motor learning. J Neurophysiol 107: 1711-1717, 2012. First published December 21, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00773.2011.-Does motor learning generalize to new situations that are not experienced during training, or is motor learning essentially specific to the training situation? In the present experiments, we use speech production as a model to investigate generalization in motor learning. We tested for generalization from training to transfer utterances by varying the acoustical similarity between these two sets of utterances. During the training phase of the experiment, subjects received auditory feedback that was altered in real time as they repeated a single consonant-vowel-consonant utterance. Different groups of subjects were trained with different consonant-vowel-consonant utterances, which differed from a subsequent transfer utterance in terms of the initial consonant or vowel. During the adaptation phase of the experiment, we observed that subjects in all groups progressively changed their speech output to compensate for the perturbation (altered auditory feedback). After learning, we tested for generalization by having all subjects produce the same single transfer utterance while receiving unaltered auditory feedback. We observed limited transfer of learning, which depended on the acoustical similarity between the training and the transfer utterances. The gradients of generalization observed here are comparable to those observed in limb movement. The present findings are consistent with the conclusion that speech learning remains specific to individual instances of learning.

Effect of treatment gaps in elderly patients with dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; VASCULAR DEMENTIA; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; CACHE COUNTY; RISK-FACTORS; NSAID USE; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; METAANALYSIS	Objective: To determine the effect of treatment gaps on the risk of institutionalization or death among community-dwelling elderly patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChIs). Methods: A survival analysis was conducted among a cohort of community-dwelling elderly patients (age 66+) newly treated with ChIs identified in the Quebec drug claims databases (Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec [RAMQ]) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007. Treatment nonpersistence during the year following ChI initiation was defined as treatment discontinuation or gaps of at least 6 weeks. To account for reverse causality, Cox proportional hazard modeling was conducted only among patients who did not discontinue treatment, in order to assess the association between treatment nonpersistence and institutionalization or death. Results: Among the 24,394 elderly ChI users, 4,108 (16.8%) experienced a treatment gap during the year following ChI treatment initiation while 596 (2.4%) discontinued their treatment within the first 3 months (early stoppers) and 4,038 (16.6%) after 3 months of treatment (late stoppers). Of all treated patients, 4,409 (18.1%) were institutionalized or died during follow-up. In patients who did not stop their treatment, the risk of institutionalization or death appeared lower in patients who experienced a treatment gap (hazard ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.86-0.96).

We have previously shown that HuD stimulates translation. Key for this enhancer function is the linker region and the poly(A) binding domain of HuD that are also critical for its function in neurite outgrowth. Here, we further explored the underlying molecular interactions and found that HuD but not the ubiquitously expressed HuR interacts directly with active Akt1. We identify that the linker region of HuD is required for this interaction. We also show by using chimeric mutants of HuD and HuR, which contain the reciprocal linker between RNA-binding domain 2 (RBD2) and RBD3, respectively, and by overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of Akt1 that the HuD-Akt1 interaction is functionally important, as it is required for the induction of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. These results suggest the model whereby RNA-bound HuD functions as an adapter to recruit Akt1 to trigger neurite outgrowth. These data might also help to explain how HuD enhances translation of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in neuronal development.

However, other types of compensatory mutations can provide higher-order structural and evolutionary information. Here, we present a helix-length compensation study for investigating structure-function relationships in RNA. The approach is demonstrated for stem-loop I and stem-loop V of the Neurospora VS ribozyme, which form a kissing-loop interaction important for substrate recognition. To rapidly characterize the substrate specificity (k(cat)/K-M) of several substrate/ribozyme pairs, a procedure was established for simultaneous kinetic characterization of multiple substrates. Several active substrate/ribozyme pairs were identified, indicating the presence of limited substrate promiscuity for stem Ib variants and helix-length compensation between stems Ib and V. 3D models of the I/V interaction were generated that are compatible with the kinetic data. These models further illustrate the adaptability of the VS ribozyme architecture for substrate cleavage and provide global structural information on the I/V kissing-loop interaction. By exploring higher-order compensatory mutations in RNA our approach brings a deeper understanding of the adaptability of RNA structure, while opening new avenues for RNA research.

Some explanations highlight cultural variations in experience and expression of symptoms; others emphasize language use and social positioning. We propose an alternative to this dichotomy, starting from a model of culture, mind, and brain as 3 deeply interconnected levels of one system. We can then propose ways in which the social world shapes depressive symptom presentation, including the personal experience of these symptoms. Such a view has potential impact on how mental health professionals think about, study and treat depression.

Here we investigated whether similar sex dimorphism exists already in adolescence. A population-based sample of adolescent boys (n = 237) and girls (n = 262), age 12 to 18 years, was studied. Total body fat (TBF) was assessed with multifrequency bioelectrical impedance, and visceral fat (VF) was quantified with MRI. Blood pressure (BP) was measured beat by beat during an hour-long protocol, including supine, standing, sitting, mental stress, and poststress sections. Multivariate mixed-model analysis was used to assess the relative contributions of TBF and VF to BP during these sections. In boys, BP was strongly positively associated with VF (P<.0001), whereas it was less strongly and negatively associated with TBF (P=.004); these relationships did not substantially vary during the protocol. In contrast, in girls, BP was strongly positively associated with TBF (P=0.0006), whereas it was not associated with VF (P=0.08); the relationship with TBF varied during the protocol and was most apparent during mental stress (TBF*section interaction: P=0.002). Furthermore, when waist circumference was included in multivariate models instead of VF, it was not associated with BP in either sex; this indicates that waist circumference may not be an appropriate surrogate for VF. Thus, in adolescence, adiposity-related BP elevation is driven mainly by visceral fat in males and by fat deposited elsewhere in females. This dimorphism suggests sex-specific mechanisms of obesity-induced hypertension and the need for sex-specific criteria of its prevention. (Hypertension. 2012; 59: 572-579.).

One way to implement this, is to use the anatomical image for defining the a priori distribution in a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) reconstruction algorithm. In this contribution, we use the PET-SORTEO Monte Carlo simulator to evaluate the quantitative accuracy reached by three different anatomical priors when reconstructing positron emission tomography (PET) brain images, using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide the anatomical information. The priors are: 1) a prior especially developed for FDG PET brain imaging, which relies on a segmentation of the MR-image (Baete et al., 2004); 2) the joint entropy-prior (Nuyts, 2007); 3) a prior that encourages smoothness within a position dependent neighborhood, computed from the MR-image. The latter prior was recently proposed by our group in (Vunckx and Nuyts, 2010), and was based on the prior presented by Bowsher et al. (2004). The two latter priors do not rely on an explicit segmentation, which makes them more generally applicable than a segmentation-based prior. All three priors produced a compromise between noise and bias that was clearly better than that obtained with postsmoothed maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) or MAP with a relative difference prior. The performance of the joint entropy prior was slightly worse than that of the other two priors. The performance of the segmentation-based prior is quite sensitive to the accuracy of the segmentation. In contrast to the joint entropy-prior, the Bowsher-prior is easily tuned and does not suffer from convergence problems.

Two important transporter proteins are phosphoglycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which are mainly expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast where they actively extrude a wide range of xenobiotics. The expression profile of these transporters varies with advancing gestation. P-gp has been shown to decline near term, leaving the fetus susceptible to potentially teratogenic drugs commonly administered to pregnant women (i.e. synthetic glucocorticoids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, glyburide, antiretrovirals, etc.). Drug transporter expression is regulated by a number of transcription factors, and steroid hormones present during pregnancy, such as progesterone, estrogen and corticosteroids. Drug transporter levels have also been found to be altered in pathological pregnancies (preterm, pre-eclampsia, growth restriction and infection). Genetic variation in the genes that encode these drug transporters can significantly alter transporter function and may play a significant role in determining the susceptibility of a fetus to maternally-administered therapeutic drugs. Understanding the regulation of placental drug transporters in normal and pathological pregnancies is critical to further our knowledge of fetal development, and may lead to the development of more selectively-targeted maternal and fetal drug treatments.

The vestibular system plays a vital role in everyday life, contributing to a wide range of functions from reflexes to the highest levels of voluntary behavior. Recent experiments establishing that vestibular (self-motion) processing is inherently multimodal also provide insight into a set of interrelated questions. What neural code is used to represent sensory information in vestibular pathways? How do the interactions between the organism and the environment shape encoding? How is self-motion information processing adjusted to meet the needs of specific tasks? This review highlights progress that has recently been made towards understanding how the brain encodes and processes selfmotion to ensure accurate motor control.

Treatment Comfort of Adult Neurologists in Childhood Onset Conditions	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							CEREBRAL-PALSY; HEALTH-CARE; YOUNG-ADULTS; SPINA-BIFIDA; TRANSITION; SURVIVAL	Background: The majority of children with chronic neurodevelopmental disabilities are surviving to adulthood. Our goal was to assess how prepared and comfortable adult neurologists are in treating young adults with childhood onset chronic neurological conditions and evaluate the difficulty pediatric neurologists experience when transferring these patients to adult care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using two postal surveys of all pediatric and adult neurologists in the province of Quebec, Canada. Results: The response rate was 51.5%, with 119 neurologists completing the survey. Half of neurologists agreed that adult neurologists may not have adequate training in childhood onset disorders to prepare them to manage the disorders in adulthood, and 60% of pediatric neurologists reported having difficulty finding an adult provider for their patients. Adult neurologists were least comfortable treating patients with autism, chromosomal or metabolic disorders, and cognitive or behavioral disorders. Conclusion: Almost half of those surveyed believed that adult neurologists are not adequately trained to care for this growing patient population. Improving treatment comfort and knowledge among adult neurologists in childhood onset chronic neurological conditions may smooth the transition of these young adults from pediatric to adult care.

Background: HSPs are a large group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive upper motor neuron signs. Mutations in the proteolipid protein (PLP1) gene have been identified in families linked to the SPG2 locus on chromosome Xq22. However, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is also an X-linked recessive neurological disorder caused by PLP1 mutations. Methods: The SPG2 locus was investigated by linkage analysis in the family. The PLP1 gene was screened by sequencing. We present findings in a large French-Canadian family with an X-linked recessive HSP. The proband presented early with developmental delay and developed progressive spastic paraplegia. He has been wheelchair-bound since the age of three years. At the latest follow-up, he was 20 years-old and had severe spasticity predominantly affecting the lower extremities, moderate cerebellar dysfunction, and optic atrophy. Results: Linkage to SPG2 was established and a G to A mutation (MIR) in the initiation codon of the PLP1 gene was identified, likely resulting in the complete absence of proteolipid protein. Conclusions: We report a new PLP1 gene mutation in a patient with a clinical phenotype consistent with a PLP1 null syndrome.

J	Tranel, D; McNutt, A; Bechara, A				Tranel, Daniel; McNutt, Ashton; Bechara, Antoine			Smoking Cessation After Brain Damage Does Not Lead to Increased Depression: Implications for Understanding the Psychiatric Complications of Varenicline	COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						smoking cessation; depression; brain damage; nicotine withdrawal; varenicline	RECEPTOR PARTIAL AGONIST; SUSTAINED-RELEASE BUPROPION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; TOBACCO DEPENDENCE; GENERAL-PRACTICE; MENTAL-ILLNESS; DOUBLE-BLIND; FOLLOW-UP; PLACEBO; PATIENT	Background: There are concerns that varenicline (Chantix/Champix), a prescription medication used to treat smoking addiction, might cause serious neuropsychiatric side effects, such as depression, self-injurious behavior, and suicide. However, the cause of depression and related symptoms in persons who quit smoking after taking varenicline remains uncertain, because smoking cessation itself can cause such symptoms. Method: We studied 70 patients with brain lesions: 32 had stopped smoking after suffering their lesion (Quitters) and 38 had kept smoking (Non-Quitters). Results: There was no indication of increased depression in the Quitters compared with the Non-Quitters. The 2 groups, which were statistically indistinguishable on demographic and neuropsychological variables, showed the same rates and levels of severity of depression and related symptoms. Moreover, in a subgroup of 16 Quitters who had stopped smoking immediately after their neurological injury in the context of losing their craving to smoke, rates of depression-related symptoms were no higher than in the other Quitters and the Non-Quitters. Conclusions: Smoking cessation did not lead to elevated levels of depression in patients with brain lesions, suggesting that psychiatric complications (particularly depression) observed after varenicline use are caused by the medication rather than the smoking cessation itself.

Here, we used EEG frequency-tagging to track cortical activities elicited by auditory and visual inputs separately, in the form of steady-state evoked potentials (SS-EPs). We tested whether SS-EPs could reveal a dynamic coupling of cortical activities related to the binding of auditory and visual inputs conveying synchronous vs. non-synchronous temporal periodicities, or beats. The temporally congruent audiovisual condition elicited markedly enhanced auditory and visual SS-EPs, as compared to the incongruent condition. Furthermore, an increased inter-trial phase coherence of both SS-EPs was observed in that condition. Taken together, these observations indicate that temporal congruency enhances the processing of multisensory inputs at sensory-specific stages of cortical processing, possibly through a dynamic binding by synchrony of the elicited activities and/or improved dynamic attending. Moreover, we show that EEG frequency-tagging with SS-EPs constitutes an effective tool to explore the neural dynamics of multisensory integration in the human brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Using infrared laser stimulation, we recently showed that SSEPs can be used to explore nociceptive cortical processing. Here, we implemented a novel approach to elicit such responses, using a periodic intra-epidermal electrical stimulation of cutaneous A delta-nociceptors (A delta-SSEPs). Using a wide range of frequencies (3-43 Hz), we compared the scalp topographies and temporal dynamics of these A delta-SSEPs to the A beta-SSEPs elicited by non-nociceptive transcutaneous electrical stimulation, as well as to the transient ERPs elicited by the onsets of the 10-s stimulation trains, applied to the left and right hand. At 3 Hz, we found that the topographies of A beta- and A delta-SSEPs were both maximal at the scalp vertex, and resembled closely that of the late P2 wave of transient ERPs, suggesting activity originating from the same neuronal populations. The responses also showed marked habituation, suggesting that they were mainly related to unspecific, attention-related processes. In contrast, at frequencies > 3 Hz, the topographies of A beta- and A delta-SSEPs were markedly different. A beta-SSEPs were maximal over the contralateral parietal region, whereas A delta-SSEPs were maximal over midline frontal regions, thus indicating an entrainment of distinct neuronal populations. Furthermore, the responses showed no habituation, suggesting more obligatory and specific stages of sensory processing. Taken together, our results indicate that A beta- and A delta-SSEP5 offer a unique opportunity to study the cortical representation of nociception and touch. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A crucial element in the pathophysiology of all forms of glaucoma is the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a population of CNS neurons with their soma in the inner retina and axons in the optic nerve. Strategies that delay or halt RGC loss have been recognized as potentially beneficial to preserve vision in glaucoma; however, the success of these approaches depends on an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that lead to RGC dysfunction and death. In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in valuable information regarding the molecular basis of RGC death stemming from animal models of acute and chronic optic nerve injury as well as experimental glaucoma. The emerging landscape is complex and points at a variety of molecular signals - acting alone or in cooperation - to promote RGC death. These include: axonal transport failure, neurotrophic factor deprivation, toxic pro-neurotrophins, activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signals, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxic damage, oxidative stress, misbehaving reactive glia and loss of synaptic connectivity. Collectively, this body of work has considerably updated and expanded our view of how RGCs might die in glaucoma and has revealed novel, potential targets for neuroprotection.

Decision-making style may contribute to driving while impaired with alcohol (DWI) in some offenders as well. The Somatic Marker Framework theorizes that decision making is the product of two interacting affective neural systems, an impulsive, rapid, amygdala-dependent process for emotionally signalling the immediate negative or positive consequences of an option, and a reflective, longer-lasting, ventral medial prefrontal cortex dependent system for emotionally signalling the future negative or positive prospects of an option. This study tested the hypothesis that offenders who showed disadvantageous decision-making would be at higher risk for recidivism than those who showed more advantageous decision-making. In addition, in line with the Somatic Marker Hypothesis, offenders who showed disadvantageous decision-making would exhibit a distinct pattern of somatic activation compared to offenders who showed more advantageous decision-making. Methods: A sample of 21 DWI offenders with from 2 to 7 past DWI convictions and a reference group consisting of 19 non-offender (N-O) drivers were recruited and administered the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), as well as evaluated on sociodemographic, driving and alcohol use dimensions. In addition, anticipatory skin conductance response (aSCR) was measured in the 5s prior to each of a 100 card draws on the IGT. Results: Median split of the DWI offender sample based upon overall performance on the IGT yielded two subgroups (IGT-R Hi and IGT-R Lo). Hypothesis 1 was supported, as the IGT-R Lo group possessed significantly greater frequency of past DWI convictions and severity of past drinking. Descriptive analyses revealed that on the IGT. IGT-R Hi group performed similarly to the N-O reference group while the IGT-R Lo group performed significantly worse. Hypothesis 2 was not supported. Conclusions: Decision making is a plausible explanatory neurocognitive pathway to severer forms of DWI. The role of emotional processing in DWI risk is uncertain. Subtyping DWI offenders using neurocognitive criteria seems a promising avenue for improving clinically meaningful methods of DWI risk assessment and intervention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The numbers of both 24-hr-old BrdU+ cells and proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells in 8-week-old 1a-(OH)ase-/- mice increased approximately twofold compared with wild-type littermates. In contrast, the numbers of 7- and 28-day-old BrdU+ cells in 1a-(OH)ase-/- mice decreased by 50% compared with wild-type mice, while the proportion of BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in BrdU+ population showed no difference between 1a-(OH)ase-/- and wild-type mice. Apoptotic cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of DG markedly increased in 1a-(OH)ase-/- mice. Replenishment of 1,25-(OH)2D3, but not correction of serum calcium and phosphorus levels, completely prevented changes in the neurogenesis in 1a-(OH)ase-/- mice. The absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 led to an increase in the expression of L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (L-VGCC) and a decrease in the nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA level. Treatment with the L-VGCC inhibitor nifedipine blocked the increased cell proliferations by 1,25-(OH)2D3 deficiency. Administration of NGF significantly attenuated the loss of newborn neurons in 1a-(OH)ase-/- mice. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A Kohonen neural network description of scoliosis fused regions and their corresponding Lenke classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Neural network; Lenke classification; Fusion level; Computer-aided decision	ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS; INSTRUMENTATION; VARIABILITY; INTRAOBSERVER; SHAPE	Surgical instrumentation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a complex procedure where selection of the appropriate curve segment to fuse, i.e., fusion region, is a challenging decision in scoliosis surgery. Currently, the Lenke classification model is used for fusion region evaluation and surgical planning. Retrospective evaluation of Lenke classification and fusion region results was performed. Using a database of 1,776 surgically treated AIS cases, we investigated a topologically ordered self organizing Kohonen network, trained using Cobb angle measurements, to determine the relationship between the Lenke class and the fusion region selection. Specifically, the purpose was twofold (1) produce two spatially matched maps, one of Lenke classes and the other of fusion regions, and (2) associate these two maps to determine where the Lenke classes correlate with the fused spine regions. Topologically ordered maps obtained using a multi-center database of surgically treated AIS cases, show that the recommended fusion region agrees with the Lenke class except near boundaries between Lenke map classes.

The Pediatric Workgroup's recommendations address primary clinical research objectives including characterizing course of recovery from TBI, prediction of later outcome, measurement of treatment effects, and comparison of outcomes across studies. Consistent with other Common Data Elements (CDE) Workgroups, the Pediatric TBI Outcomes Workgroup adopted the standard three-tier system in its selection of measures. In the first tier, core measures included valid, robust, and widely applicable outcome measures with proven utility in pediatric TBI from each identified domain including academics, adaptive and daily living skills, family and environment, global outcome, health-related quality of life, infant and toddler measures, language and communication, neuropsychological impairment, physical functioning, psychiatric and psychological functioning, recovery of consciousness, social role participation and social competence, social cognition, and TBI-related symptoms. In the second tier, supplemental measures were recommended for consideration in TBI research focusing on specific topics or populations. In the third tier, emerging measures included important instruments currently under development, in the process of validation, or nearing the point of published findings that have significant potential to be superior to measures in the core and supplemental lists and may eventually replace them as evidence for their utility emerges.

ARIA include MRI signal abnormalities suggestive of vasogenic oedema and sulcal effusions (ARIA-E) and microhaemorrhages and haemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H). Our aim was to investigate the incidence of ARIA during treatment with bapineuzumab, and evaluate associated risk factors. Methods Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed 2572 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI scans from 262 participants in two phase 2 studies of bapineuzumab and an open-label extension study. Readers were masked to the patient's treatment, APOE epsilon 4 genotype, medical history, and demographics. Patients were included in risk analyses if they had no evidence of ARIA-E in their pre-treatment MRI, had received bapineuzumab, and had at least one MRI scan after treatment. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to examine the distribution of incident ARIA-E from the start of bapineuzumab treatment and proportional hazards regression models to assess risk factors associated with ARIA. Findings 210 patients were included in the risk analyses. 36 patients (17%) developed ARIA-E during treatment with bapineuzumab; 15 of these ARIA-E cases (42%) had not been detected previously. 28 of these patients (78%) did not report associated symptoms. Adverse events, reported in eight symptomatic patients, included headache, confusion, and neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. Incident ARIA-H occurred in 17 of the patients with ARIA-E (47%), compared with seven of 177 (4%) patients without ARIA-E. 13 of the 15 patients in whom ARIA were detected in our study received additional treatment infusions while ARIA-E were present, without any associated symptoms. Occurrence of ARIA-E increased with bapineuzumab dose (hazard ratio [HR] 2.24 per 1 mg/kg increase in dose, 95% CI 1.40-3.62; p=0.0008) and presence of APOE epsilon 4 alleles (HR 2.55 per allele, 95% CI 1.57-4.12; p=0.0001). Interpretation ARIA consist of a spectrum of imaging findings with variable clinical correlates, and some patients with ARIA-E remain asymptomatic even if treatment is continued. The increased risk of ARIA among APOE e4 carriers, its association with high bapineuzumab dose, and its timecourse in relation to dosing suggest an association between ARIA and alterations in vascular amyloid burden.

The neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (nVHL) has emerged as a model of schizophrenia-related behavior. Our group has previously shown hyperresponsiveness to novel environment, neuronal atrophy in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) neurons as well as abnormal levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the PFC of the nVHL rat. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of repeated clozapine administration (2 mg/kg/day for 21 days) in a novel environment, neuronal rearrangement in PFC. NAcc and basolateral amygdala (BLA) as well as NO levels in this model. Clozapine administration reversed the hyperlocomotion observed in a novel environment in the nVHL rat with no effect on locomotion in sham animals. Quantitative morphological analysis demonstrated a retracted neuronal arborization and decreased spinogenesis in the NAcc, PFC and BLA in nVHL rat. Interestingly, clozapine administration also rescued neuronal atrophy in these brain regions. The nVHL also displayed increased NO levels in PFC, striatum and occipital cortex. Clozapine administration selectively reversed these abnormal levels of NO in striatum in nVHL rat while NO levels were increased in the PFC of sham animals. Our results further extend the usefulness of the nVHL as a model of schizophrenia-related behavior and suggest that clozapine reverses behavioral deficits in these animals by modulating neuronal reorganization and NO levels in the brain.

CANNABINOIDS AND EMOTIONALITY: A NEUROANATOMICAL PERSPECTIVE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						cannabinoid; corticolimbic network; emotional behavior; stress; microinfusion; rat	ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITY; RECEPTOR KNOCKOUT MICE; PLUS-MAZE TEST; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; CB1 RECEPTORS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION	The endocannabinoid system has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of stress-related emotional disorders. A growing literature base has collectively demonstrated that facilitation of endocannabinoid signaling promotes antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like responses in preclinical animal models, while disruption of this system profoundly affects emotion, cognition, and neuroendocrine functioning. Although these findings are encouraging, the role of endocannabinoid signaling within discrete corticolimbic brain structures is considerably complex. Consequently, researchers have recently shifted focus to examining the effects of local cannabinoid manipulations on emotion from a neuroanatomical standpoint. This review provides an overview of the site-specific effects of cannabinergic compounds in preclinical tests of emotionality, as well as the alterations in endocannabinoid signaling observed in animal models of depression. Broadly speaking, these studies indicate that CB, receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus appear to be responsible for the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like phenotype elicited by systemic CB, receptor agonists, which parallels biochemical studies showing that endocannabinoids are downregulated in these two regions following exposure to chronic stress. Conversely, CB, receptor activation within distinct amygdalar nuclei yields opposing effects on emotional behavior, such that local stimulation of CB, receptors in the basolateral amygdala and central amygdala promoting anxiogenesis and anxiolysis, respectively. Moreover, a series of elegant studies has revealed that cannabinoid transmission in the basolateral amygdala strongly modulates the acquisition and processing of associative fear memory via interactions with the medial prefrontal cortex. Given the crucial role of this corticolimbic network in regulating emotional behavior, it is palpable that alterations in endocannabinoid signaling within any of these structures could have profound implications for the pathophysiological development of affective illnesses. Accordingly, local pharmacological augmentation of endocannabinoid signaling within discrete corticolimbic subregions may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these debilitating disorders.

However, if inappropriately managed, the transition metal is capable of generating neurotoxic reactive oxygen species. A number of hereditary conditions perturb body iron homeostasis and some, collectively referred to as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), promote pathological deposition of the metal predominantly or exclusively within the central nervous system (CNS). In this article, we discuss seven NBIA disorders with emphasis on the clinical syndromes and neuroimaging. The latter primarily entails magnetic resonance scanning using iron-sensitive sequences. The conditions considered are Friedreich ataxia (FA), pantothenate kinase 2-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN). FA2H-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN).

Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Ninety-six athletes (9-12 years, n = 32; 13-16 years, n = 34; adults, n = 30), half of whom had a sport concussion. Intervention: Cognitive functioning was assessed using standardized neuropsychological tests and event-related potentials elicited by a visual 3-stimulus oddball paradigm. The PCSS was used to assess symptoms experienced at the time of injury. Main outcome measurements: Neuropsychological assessment with an adaptation of the battery used by the National Hockey League. Latencies and amplitudes of the P3a and P3b were analysed in terms of group (concussed vs. control) and age. Results: All concussed athletes had significantly lower amplitude for the P3b component compared to their non-injured teammates (p > 0.05). Adolescents also showed persistent deficits in working memory (p > 0.05). Conclusions: These data suggest persistent neurophysiological deficits that are present at least 6 months following a concussion. Moreover, adolescents are more sensitive to the consequences of concussions than are children or adults.

These toxins are well-known hepatotoxic agents that proceed by inhibiting protein phosphatase in aquatic biota; recent studies have also reported oxidative stress and disruption of ion regulation in aquatic organisms. In the present study, young trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to crude extracts of Microsystis aeruginosa for four days at 15 degrees C. The level of microcystins was calculated to confirm the presence of toxins in these crude extracts: 0, 0.75, 1.8 and 5 mu g/L. Protein phosphatase measured in the liver increased by at least 3-fold and is significantly as a result of exposure to these sublethal concentrations of crude extract, his indicates an early defense response against protein phosphatase inhibition from cyanotoxins. This was corroborated by the decreased phosphate content in proteins found in the liver and brain. No increase in glutathione-S transferase (GST) activity was observed and lipid peroxidation was unaffected in both liver and brain tissue exposed to the cyanobacterial extracts. The data revealed that the proportion of the reduced (metal-binding) form of metallothionein (MT) decreased by two-fold relative to the control group (with a concomitant increase in the proportion of the oxidized form). The level of phosphate associated with MT increased by 1.5-fold at the highest concentration of crude extract. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain tissue was decreased after exposure to the highest concentration of crude extract, suggesting a slowdown in neural activity. However, no biotransformation processes or detoxification of GST was triggered. Our findings show early sign of biochemical effects of MC-LR in young trout.

Herein, we have characterized some electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of the spontaneous epileptiform activity generated by PC networks maintained in vitro. Methods: We performed field potential recordings from the PC in coronal or sagittal rat brain slices along with pharmacologic manipulations of c-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic signaling during application of the convulsant drug 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 mu M). Key Findings: Coronal and sagittal preparations generated interictal-like and ictal-like epileptiform discharges with similar duration and frequency. Ictal-like discharges in sagittal slices were initiated mostly in the PC anterior subregion, whereas interictal activity did not have any preferential site of origin. In sagittal slices, high frequency oscillations (HFOs) at 80-200 Hz were detected mainly at the beginning of the ictal discharge in both posterior and anterior subregions. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism abolished ictal discharges, but failed to influence interictal activity. In the absence of ionotropic glutamatergic transmission, PC networks generated slow, GABA receptor-dependent events. Finally, GABA(A) receptor antagonism during application of 4AP only, abolished ictal discharges and disclosed recurrent interictal activity. Significance: Our findings demonstrate that PC networks can sustain in vitro epileptiform activity induced by 4AP. HFOs, which emerge at the onset of ictal activity, may be involved in PC ictogenesis. As reported in several cortical structures, ionotropic glutamatergic neurotransmission is necessary but not sufficient for ictal discharge generation, a process that also requires operative GABA(A) receptor-mediated signaling.

Normal role of the low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein in mitochondrial dynamics and disruption in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						NFL; axonal trafficking; neuropathy; fusion	CU/ZN-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; DOMINANT OPTIC ATROPHY; AXONAL-TRANSPORT; INTERMEDIATE-FILAMENTS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; MITOFUSIN 2; MUTATIONS; COMPLEMENTATION; NETWORK; MODEL	Intermediate filaments serve important structural roles, but other cellular functions are increasingly recognized. This study demonstrated normal function of the low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein (NFL) in mitochondrial dynamics and disruption in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) due to mutations in the Nefl gene. In motor neurons of spinal cord cultured from Nefl-knockout mice, mitochondrial length and the rate of fusion were decreased concomitant with increased motility. These parameters were normalized after expression of NFLwt on the Nefl(-/-) background, but not by overexpression of the profusion protein, mitofusin 2 (MFN2). The effects of CMT-causing NFL mutants bore similarities to and differences from Nefl knockout. In the early phase of toxicity before disruption of the neurofilament network, NFLQ333P and NFLP8R integrated into neurofilaments and had effects on mitochondria similar to those with Nefl knockout. The reduction of fusion rate by NFLQ333P was partly due to interference with the function of the profusion protein MFN2, which is mutated in CMT2A, functionally linking these forms of CMT. In the later phase of toxicity, mitochondria essentially stopped moving in neurons expressing NFL mutants, probably a consequence of cytoskeletal disruption. Overall, the data point to important functions of neurofilaments in mitochondrial dynamics as well as primary involvement in CMT2E/1F.-Gentil, B. J. Minotti, S., Beange, M., Baloh, R.

Here, we first extended these AVP and CRH coregulation processes to the adrenal medulla. We demonstrate that costimulation of chromaffin cells by AVP and CRH simultaneously induces a catecholamine secretion exceeding the one induced by each hormone alone, thus demonstrating a net potentiation. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this synergism, we coexpressed human V1b and CRH receptor (CRHR)1 receptor in HEK293 cells. In this heterologous system, AVP also potentiated CRH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. This effect was only partially mimicked by phorbol ester or inhibited by a phospholipase C inhibitor respectively. This finding suggests the existence of an new molecular mechanism, independent from second messenger cross talk. Similarly, CRH potentiated the AVP-induced inositol phosphates production. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, coimmunoprecipitation, and receptor rescue experiments, we demonstrate that V1b and CRHR1 receptors assemble as heterodimers. Moreover, new pharmacological properties emerged upon receptors cotransfection. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that direct molecular interactions between V1b and CRHR1 receptors play an important role in mediating the synergistic interactions between these two receptors.

Since Barrestins are well known to regulate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling and trafficking, we therefore investigated the role of Barrestin1 (the only isoform expressed in our cellular model) in the context of the hDOR. We established clonal cell lines of SK-N-BE cells over-expressing Barrestin1, its dominant negative mutant (Barrestin1(319-418)), and shRNA directed against endogenous Barrestin1. Interestingly, both binding and confocal microscopy approaches demonstrated that Barrestin1 is required for hDOR endocytosis only when activated by etorphine. Conversely, functional experiments revealed that Barrestin1 is exclusively involved in hDOR desensitization promoted by the peptides. Taken together, these results provide substantial evidence for a Barrestin1-biased agonism at hDOR, where Barrestin1 is differentially involved during receptor desensitization and endocytosis depending on the ligand.

We report the case of a 19-year-old female with de novo diagnosis of right hemimegalencephaly, normal intellectual function, and history of non-refractory epilepsy. She presented with weakness and paraesthesia of the left leg. Extensive evaluation was negative for other causes for the weakness, which was attributed to progressive neurological damage secondary to long-standing subclinical epileptic activity in the hemimegalencephalic hemisphere. This patient underwent a cerebral fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography that demonstrated near-normal cortical metabolism. Formal neuropsychological evaluation revealed mild deficits in the affected hemisphere, but preserved general intellectual function. This case illustrates the wide phenotypic variations in this condition and raises questions about prenatal counselling for hemimegalencephaly.

Studies using voxel-based morphometry image analysis were included. Ten studies reported on a total of 236 people with a current or past eating disorder and 257 healthy controls. Sample heterogeneity prohibited a meta-analytic approach. The findings do not unequivocally indicate grey or white matter volume abnormalities in people with an eating disorder. Nevertheless, these preliminary data suggest that, compared with healthy controls, people with anorexia nervosa have decreased grey matter in a range of brain regions and that those with bulimia nervosa have increased grey matter volumes in frontal and ventral striatal areas. Research in the recovery phase and longitudinal studies suggest that potential brain tissue abnormalities may recover with clinical improvement. Overall, as the available data are inconclusive, further efforts in this field are warranted. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

Rapid changes in corticospinal excitability during force field adaptation of human walking	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Adaptation; Locomotion; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TIBIALIS ANTERIOR MUSCLE; MOTOR CORTEX; LOCOMOTOR ADAPTATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SPINAL CATS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; TRANSCORTICAL PATHWAY; GAIT MODIFICATIONS; BRAIN-STIMULATION	Force field adaptation of locomotor muscle activity is one way of studying the ability of the motor control networks in the brain and spinal cord to adapt in a flexible way to changes in the environment. Here, we investigate whether the corticospinal tract is involved in this adaptation. We measured changes in motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle before, during, and after subjects adapted to a force field applied to the ankle joint during treadmill walking. When the force field assisted dorsiflexion during the swing phase of the step cycle, subjects adapted by decreasing TA EMG activity. In contrast, when the force field resisted dorsiflexion, they increased TA EMG activity. After the force field was removed, normal EMG activity gradually returned over the next 5 min of walking. TA MEPs elicited in the early swing phase of the step cycle were smaller during adaptation to the assistive force field and larger during adaptation to the resistive force field. When elicited 5 min after the force field was removed, MEPs returned to their original values. The changes in TA MEPs were larger than what could be explained by changes in background TA EMG activity. These effects seemed specific to walking, as similar changes in TA MEP were not seen when seated subjects were tested during static dorsiflexion. These observations suggest that the corticospinal tract contributes to the adaptation of walking to an external force field.	[Alain, S.; Bouyer, L.

Dosimetric Study of Current Treatment Options for Radiotherapy in Retinoblastoma	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article						IMRT; Pediatric; Radiotherapy; Retinoblastoma; Treatment planning	RADIATION-THERAPY; INTRAOCULAR RETINOBLASTOMA; PLAQUE RADIOTHERAPY; IRRADIATION; MANAGEMENT; SARCOMA; CANCER; CHEMOREDUCTION; COMPLICATIONS; CRYOTHERAPY	Purpose: To determine the best treatment technique for patients with retinoblastoma requiring radiotherapy to the whole eye. Methods and Materials: Treatment plans for 3 patients with retinoblastoma were developed using 10 radiotherapy techniques including electron beams, photon beam wedge pair (WP), photon beam three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), fixed gantry intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), photon volumetric arc therapy (VMAT), fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, and helical tomotherapy (HT). Dose-volume analyses were carried out for each technique. Results: All techniques provided similar target coverage; conformity was highest for VMAT, nine-field (9F) IMRT, and HT (conformity index [CI] = 1.3) and lowest for the WP and two electron techniques (CI = 1.8). The electron techniques had the highest planning target volume dose gradient (131% of maximum dose received [D-max]), and the CRT techniques had the lowest (103% D-max) gradient. The volume receiving at least 20 Gy (V-20Gy) for the ipsilateral bony orbit was lowest for the VMAT and HT techniques (56%) and highest for the CRT techniques (90%). Generally, the electron beam techniques were superior in terms of brain sparing and delivered approximately one-third of the integral dose of the photon techniques. Conclusions: Inverse planned image-guided radiotherapy delivered using HT or VMAT gives better conformity index, improved orbital bone and brain sparing, and a lower integral dose than other techniques.

Dega Osteotomy for the Correction of Acetabular Dysplasia of the Hip: A Radiographic Review of 21 Cases	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Review						congenital dislocation; pelvic osteotomy; acetabulum; open reduction	SALTER INNOMINATE OSTEOTOMY; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA; CONGENITAL DISLOCATION; OPEN REDUCTION; SEVERIN CLASSIFICATION; PERICAPSULAR OSTEOTOMY; PEMBERTON OSTEOTOMY; MEDIAL APPROACH; FEMORAL-HEAD; CHILDREN	Background: The Dega osteotomy is a versatile procedure that is widely used to treat neuromuscular hip dysplasia. There is a paucity of the English language literature on its use in acetabular dysplasia seen in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Methods: A retrospective radiographic and chart review was performed for all patients diagnosed with DDH who underwent a modified Dega osteotomy between March 1995 and December 2008 at the Shriners Hospital for Children or the Montreal Children's Hospital (Montreal, Canada) by 2 orthopaedic surgeons. Radiographic parameters were measured at the preoperative, immediate postoperative, and final follow-up time points. These parameters included the acetabular index, center edge angle, Reimer's extrusion index, Shenton line, and grading by the Severin classification. Results: A total of 20 patients (21 hips), of which 18 were female, underwent a modified Dega osteotomy at an average age of 55.6 months (range, 20 to 100 mo). Of the 21 hips (1 bilateral and 19 single cases), 9 hips involved the right side and 12 hips involved the left side. Before surgery, 9 patients had a subluxated hip, 7 patients had a dislocated hip, and 5 patients had a dysplastic hip. Ten hips underwent concomitant procedures including 10 open reductions with capsulorraphy. The acetabular index improved from 37 degrees (SD 8) preoperatively to 19 degrees (SD 8) on the date of last visit. The center edge angle improved from 2 (SD 17) to 25 degrees (SD 12). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that the modified Dega osteotomy produces near-normal lateral coverage parameters in children with DDH. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic study, clinical case series: level IV.

This may be especially important during adolescence, a transition period marked by approach behavior and a propensity toward risk taking, novelty seeking and alteration of the social landscape. However, little is known about the relative contribution of personality, behavior, and brain responses for prediction of alcohol use in adolescents. In this study, we applied factor analyses and structural equation modeling to reward-related brain responses assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task. In addition, novelty seeking, sensation seeking, impulsivity, extraversion, and behavioral measures of risk taking were entered as predictors of early onset of drinking in a sample of 14-year-old healthy adolescents (N = 324). Reward-associated behavior, personality, and brain responses all contributed to alcohol intake with personality explaining a higher proportion of the variance than behavior and brain responses. When only the ventral striatum was used, a small non-significant contribution to the prediction of early alcohol use was found. These data suggest that the role of reward-related brain activation may be more important in addiction than initiation of early drinking, where personality traits and reward-related behaviors were more significant. With up to 26% of explained variance, the interrelation of reward-related personality traits, behavior, and neural response patterns may convey risk for later alcohol abuse in adolescence, and thus may be identified as a vulnerability factor for the development of substance use disorders.

Effects of mitochondrial poisons on the neuropathic pain produced by the chemotherapeutic agents, paclitaxel and oxaliplatin	PAIN			English	Article						Allodynia; Auranofin; Hyperalgesia; Neuropathic pain; Oligomycin; Rotenone	ACETYL-L-CARNITINE; PRIMARY AFFERENT NEURONS; RAT SCIATIC-NERVE; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; LANGERHANS CELLS; A-FIBER; THIOREDOXIN; ANIMALS	The dose-limiting side effect of taxane, platinum-complex, and other kinds of anticancer drugs is a chronic, distal, bilaterally symmetrical, sensory peripheral neuropathy that is often accompanied by neuropathic pain. Work with animal models of these conditions suggests that the neuropathy is a consequence of toxic effects on mitochondria in primary afferent sensory neurons. If this is true, then additional mitochondrial insult ought to make the neuropathic pain worse. This prediction was tested in rats with painful peripheral neuropathy due to the taxane agent, paclitaxel, and the platinum-complex agent, oxaliplatin. Rats with established neuropathy were given 1 of 3 mitochondrial poisons: rotenone (an inhibitor of respiratory Complex I), oligomycin (an inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate synthase), and auranofin (an inhibitor of the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase mitochondrial antioxidant defense system). All 3 toxins significantly increased the severity of paclitaxel-evoked and oxaliplatin-evoked mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia while having no effect on the mechano-sensitivity of chemotherapy-naive rats. Chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy is associated with an abnormal spontaneous discharge in primary afferent A fibers and C fibers. Oligomycin, at the same dose that exacerbated allodynia and hyperalgesia, significantly increased the discharge frequency of spontaneously discharging A fibers and C fibers in both paclitaxel-treated and oxaliplatin-treated rats, but did not evoke any discharge in naive control rats. These results implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in the production of chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain and suggest that drugs that have positive effects on mitochondrial function may be of use in its treatment and prevention.

However, inadequate research efforts in the analog domain are holding back the exploitation of advanced technologies. A dearth of design expertise in the analog domain is the principal driving force for the growth of Design Automation (DA) tools. Transistor sizing is one of the most crucial steps in the analog IC design. In this paper, we put forward a new computer aided design framework for the sizing of transistors in MOS Integrated Circuit (IC) amplifiers by incorporating powerful modeling capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANNs have proven to be efficient and accurate modeling tools in several applications. The proposed tool is capable of directly computing transistor related design parameters, of the MOS IC amplifier and associated peripheral circuitry. The proposed tool thus avoids several time-consuming simulations and/or tuning runs at the very bottom level of analog IC amplifier implementation, using a given CMOS process. It also reduces manual intervention in the design process, thus enhancing the automation of the design process. This paper presents design examples of several analog IC functional modules that are developed and verified successfully.

The purpose of the present work was to investigate how cognitive control can affect the purported automaticity of word processing by examining the impact of task switching on semantic processing using the ERP technique. In the context of the psychological refractory period dual-task paradigm, two experiments contrasted the context-sensitive N400 ERP elicited by the second of two target words under conditions that involved either a task switch or no-task switch. Although the N400 was not affected by SOA in the absence of switching, it was strongly attenuated at short SOAs when the psychological refractory period procedure involved a switch from a perceptual to a semantic task (Experiment 1) or a switch between two different semantic tasks (Experiment 2). These findings suggest that semantic processing cannot be performed in parallel with task switching and illustrate limitations in the ability of the cognitive system to adapt flexibly to the dynamically changing challenges of the environment according to task demands and behavioral goals.

J	Braude, H; Kimmelman, J				Braude, Hillel; Kimmelman, Jonathan			THE ETHICS OF MANAGING AFFECTIVE AND EMOTIONAL STATES TO IMPROVE INFORMED CONSENT: AUTONOMY, COMPREHENSION, AND VOLUNTARINESS	BIOETHICS			English	Article						affect; autonomy; authenticity; comprehension; emotion; informed consent; voluntariness	THERAPEUTIC MISCONCEPTION; DECISION-MAKING; CORE AFFECT; BEHAVIOR; RISK; COMPETENCE; COGNITION; CAPACITY; THOUGHTS; BRAIN	Over the past several decades the affective revolution in cognitive psychology has emphasized the critical role affect and emotion play in human decision-making. Drawing on this affective literature, various commentators have recently proposed strategies for managing therapeutic expectation that use contextual, symbolic, or emotive interventions in the consent process to convey information or enhance comprehension. In this paper, we examine whether affective consent interventions that target affect and emotion can be reconciled with widely accepted standards for autonomous action. More specifically, the ethics of affective consent interventions is assessed in terms of key elements of autonomy, comprehension and voluntariness. While there may appear to be a moral obligation to manage the affective environment to ensure valid informed consent, in circumstances where volunteers may be prone to problematic therapeutic expectancy, this moral obligation needs to be weighed against the potential risks of human instrumentalization. At this point in time we do not have enough information to be able to justify clearly the programmatic manipulation of human subjects' affective states. The lack of knowledge about affective interventions requires corresponding caution in its ethical justification.

We constructed structural brain networks composed of 90 regions in young, middle, and old age groups. We randomly selected 350 healthy subjects for each group from a Japanese magnetic resonance image database. Structural brain networks in three age groups showed economical small-world properties, providing high global and local efficiency for parallel information processing at low connection cost. The small-world efficiency and node betweenness varied significantly and revealed a U- or inverted U-curve model tendency among three age groups. Results also demonstrated that structural brain networks exhibited a modular organization in which the connections between regions are much denser within modules than between them. The modular organization of structural brain networks was similar between the young and middle age groups, but quite different from the old group. In particular, the old group showed a notable decrease in the connector ratio and the intermodule connections. Combining the results of small-world efficiency, node betweenness and modular organization, we concluded that the brain network changed slightly, developing into a more distributed organization from young to middle age. The organization eventually altered greatly, shifting to a more localized organization in old age. Our findings provided quantitative insights into topological principles of structural brain networks and changes related to normal aging. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On the other hand, model users which include policy makers and systems operators tend to favor transparent, interpretable models not only for predictive decision-making but also for after-the-fact auditing and forensic purposes. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off between the accuracy and the transparency of data-mining-based models in the context of catastrophe predictors for power grid response-based remedial action schemes, at both the protective and operator levels. Wide area severity indices (WASI) are derived from PMU measurements and fed to the corresponding predictors based on data-mining models such as decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), neural networks (NNET), support vector machines (SVM), and fuzzy rule based models (Fuzzy_DT and Fuzzy_ID3). It is observed that while switching from black-box solutions such as NNET, SVM, and RF to transparent fuzzy rule-based predictors, the accuracy deteriorates sharply while transparency and interpretability are improved. Although transparent automation schemes are historically preferred in power system control and operations, we show that, with existing modeling tools, this philosophy fails to achieve the "3-nines" accuracy figures expected from a modern power grid. The transparency and accuracy trade-offs between the developed catastrophe predictors is demonstrated thoroughly on a data base with more than 60 000 instances from a test (10%) and an actual (90%) system combined.

Hepatic glutathione Stransferase (GST) activity and biliary concentrations of BaP, 1-OH BaP, 3-OH BaP and 7,8D BaP were quantified in juvenile Clarias gariepinus injected intramuscularly or intraperitoneally with 10-50 mg/kg benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) 1-3 d earlier. A feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN resulted in more accurate prediction of timing, route and exposure dose than a linear neural network or a radial basis function (RBF) ANN. MLP sensitivity analyses revealed contribution of all five biomarkers to predicting route of exposure but no contribution of hepatic GST activity or one of the two hydroxylated BaP metabolites to predicting time of exposure and dose of exposure. We conclude that information content of biomarkers collected from fish can be extended by judicious use of ANNs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Modulation of Olfactory Perception by Visual Cortex Stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TACTILE DISCRIMINATION; ODORS; BRAIN; RTMS; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT; ATTENTION; LOAD	When attempting to identify an object based on smell alone, people often visualize the perceived source of the odorant. This close association between olfactory and visual functions is supported by neuroimaging studies demonstrating activation of visual cortex during performance of purely olfactory tasks. Such activation might simply reflect the correlation between olfactory percepts and the corresponding visual images, or it might reflect a causal contribution of visual processing to olfactory perception. Here we provide evidence in support of the latter possibility. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that stimulating human visual cortex improves performance on a task requiring discrimination among different odor qualities. No significant improvement is found for tasks involving discrimination between intensities of the same odor, from stimulation of auditory cortex, or from "sham" stimulation. These results are thus consistent with a specific visual cortical influence on high-level olfactory perception. They also demonstrate that unimodal perceptual tasks are influenced by processing within cortical areas of other, seemingly unrelated, sensory systems.

Searching for roots of entrainment and joint action in early musical interactions	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						music; joint action; entrainment; ensemble skills; development; dance	MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; 12-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; MOTOR RESONANCE; AUDITORY PITCH; TURN-TAKING; PERCEPTION; IMITATION	When people play music and dance together, they engage in forms of musical joint action that are often characterized by a shared sense of rhythmic timing and affective state (i.e., temporal and affective entrainment). In order to understand the origins of musical joint action, we propose a model in which entrainment is linked to dual mechanisms (motor resonance and action simulation), which in turn support musical behavior (imitation and complementary joint action). To illustrate this model, we consider two generic forms of joint musical behavior: chorusing and turn-taking. We explore how these common behaviors can be founded on entrainment capacities established early in human development, specifically during musical interactions between infants and their caregivers. If the roots of entrainment are found in early musical interactions which are practiced from childhood into adulthood, then we propose that the rehearsal of advanced musical ensemble skills can be considered to be a refined, mimetic form of temporal and affective entrainment whose evolution begins in infancy.

It was similarly effective in reversing behavioral deficits and plaque load in APPSwInd mice (line J20). The temporal sequence involved an increase in plasma A beta and a decrease in brain A beta monomer after 7 d, indicating increased transport of A beta from the brain to the periphery. Enhanced expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in brain microvessels and the A beta-degrading protease neprilysin (NEP) occurred 14-21 d after a substantial decrease in brain A beta levels. However, significant increase in liver LRP and NEP occurred much earlier, at 7 d, and were accompanied by a rise in plasma sLRP, a peripheral sink for brain A beta. In WT mice, the extract induced liver, but not brain, LRP and NEP and decreased plasma and brain A beta, indicating that increase in liver LRP and sLRP occurring independent of A beta concentration could result in clearance of A beta. Selective down-regulation of liver LRP, but not NEP, abrogated the therapeutic effects of the extract. The remarkable therapeutic effect of W. somnifera mediated through up-regulation of liver LRP indicates that targeting the periphery offers a unique mechanism for A beta clearance and reverses the behavioral deficits and pathology seen in Alzheimer's disease models.

One of the most common treatments is lithium (Li), with successful response in 30-60% of patients. Synapsin II (SYN2) is a neuronal phosphoprotein that we have previously identified as a possible candidate gene for the etiology of BD and/or response to Li treatment in a genome-wide linkage study focusing on BD patients characterized for excellent response to Li prophylaxis. In the present study we investigated the role of this gene in BD, particularly as it pertains to Li treatment. We investigated the effect of lithium treatment on the expression of SYN2 in lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients characterized as excellent Li-responders, non-responders, as well as non-psychiatric controls. Finally, we sought to determine if Li has a cell-type-specific effect on gene expression in neuronal-derived cell lines. In both in vitro models, we found SYN2 to be modulated by the presence of Li. By focusing on Li-responsive BD we have identified a potential mechanism for Li response in some patients.

Inactivation of the Polycomb group gene Bmi1 in mice results in growth retardation, cerebellar degeneration, and development of a premature aging-like phenotype. This progeroid phenotype is characterized by formation of lens cataracts, apoptosis of cortical neurons, and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, owing to p53-mediated repression of antioxidant response (AOR) genes. Herein we report that Bmi1 expression progressively declines in the neurons of aging mouse and human brains. In old brains, p53 accumulates at the promoter of AOR genes, correlating with a repressed chromatin state, down-regulation of AOR genes, and increased oxidative damages to lipids and DNA. Comparative gene expression analysis further revealed that aging brains display an up-regulation of the senescence-associated genes IL-6, p19(Arf) and p16(Ink4a), along with the pro-apoptotic gene Noxa, as seen in Bmi1-null mice. Increasing Bmi1 expression in cortical neurons conferred robust protection against DNA damage-induced cell death or mitochondrial poisoning, and resulted in suppression of ROS through activation of AOR genes. These observations unveil that Bmi1 genetic deficiency recapitulates aspects of physiological brain aging and that Bmi1 over-expression is a potential therapeutic modality against neurodegeneration.

Clonal selection drives genetic divergence of metastatic medulloblastoma	NATURE			English	Article							BEAUTY TRANSPOSON SYSTEM; CANCER METASTASIS; SOLID TUMORS; MOUSE; CELLS; MICE; ABERRATIONS; MUTAGENESIS; EXPRESSION; DISEASE	Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, arises in the cerebellum and disseminates through the cerebrospinal fluid in the leptomeningeal space to coat the brain and spinal cord(1). Dissemination, a marker of poor prognosis, is found in up to 40% of children at diagnosis and inmost children at the time of recurrence. Affected children therefore are treated with radiation to the entire developing brain and spinal cord, followed by high-dose chemotherapy, with the ensuing deleterious effects on the developing nervous system(2). The mechanisms of dissemination through the cerebrospinal fluid are poorly studied, and medulloblastoma metastases have been assumed to be biologically similar to the primary tumour(3,4). Here we show that in both mouse and human medulloblastoma, the metastases from an individual are extremely similar to each other but are divergent from the matched primary tumour. Clonal genetic events in the metastases can be demonstrated in a restricted subclone of the primary tumour, suggesting that only rare cells within the primary tumour have the ability to metastasize. Failure to account for the bicompartmental nature of metastatic medulloblastoma could be a major barrier to the development of effective targeted therapies.

We predicted that T. gondii could increase the risk of brain cancer because it is a long-lived parasite that encysts in the brain, where it provokes inflammation and inhibits apoptosis. We used a medical geography approach based on the national incidence of brain cancers and seroprevalence of T. gondii. We corrected reports of incidence for national gross domestic product because wealth probably increases the ability to detect cancer. We also included gender, cell phone use and latitude as variables in our initial models. Prevalence of T. gondii explained 19 per cent of the residual variance in brain cancer incidence after controlling for the positive effects of gross domestic product and latitude among nations. Infection with T. gondii was associated with a 1.8-fold increase in the risk of brain cancers across the range of T. gondii prevalence in our dataset (4-67%). These results, though correlational, suggest that T. gondii should be investigated further as a possible oncogenic pathogen of humans.

The causative effect of Jak3(W81R) was verified by complementation testing in Jak3(W81R/-) double heterozygotes that were fully protected against CM. Jak3(W81R) homozygotes showed defects in thymic development with depletion of CD8(+) T cell, B cell, and NK cell compartments, and defective T cell-dependent production of IFN-gamma. Adoptive transfer of normal splenocytes abrogates CM resistance in Jak3(W81R) homozygotes, an effect attributed to the CD8(+) T cells. Jak3(W81R) behaves as a dominant negative variant, with significant CM resistance of Jak3(W81R/+) heterozygotes, compared to CM-susceptible Jak3(+/+) and Jak3(+/-) controls. CM resistance in Jak3(W81R/+) heterozygotes occurs in presence of normal T, B and NK cell numbers. These findings highlight the pathological role of CD8(+) T cells and Jak3-dependent IFN-gamma-mediated Th1 responses in CM pathogenesis.

Intracellular accumulations of wild type TDP-43 and FUS are observed in a growing number of late-onset diseases suggesting that TDP-43 and FUS proteinopathies may contribute to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. To better understand the mechanisms of TDP-43 and FUS toxicity we have created transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strains that express full-length, untagged human TDP-43 and FUS in the worm's GABAergic motor neurons. Transgenic worms expressing mutant TDP-43 and FUS display adult-onset, age-dependent loss of motility, progressive paralysis and neuronal degeneration that is distinct from wild type alleles. Additionally, mutant TDP-43 and FUS proteins are highly insoluble while wild type proteins remain soluble suggesting that protein misfolding may contribute to toxicity. Populations of mutant TDP-43 and FUS transgenics grown on solid media become paralyzed over 7 to 12 days. We have developed a liquid culture assay where the paralysis phenotype evolves over several hours. We introduce C. elegans transgenics for mutant TDP-43 and FUS motor neuron toxicity that may be used for rapid genetic and pharmacological suppressor screening.

This work presents a comprehensive study aiming to evaluate current and novel matrix candidates for high spatial resolution MALDI imaging mass spectrometry of lipids from tissue section after deposition by sublimation. For this purpose, 12 matrices including 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), sinapinic acid (SA), alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), 2,6-dihydroxyacetphenone (DHA), 2',4',6'-trihydroxyacetophenone (THAP), 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3-HPA), 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene (DMAN), 1,8,9-anthracentriol (DIT), 1,5-diaminonapthalene (DAN), p-nitroanifine (NIT), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) were investigated for lipid detection efficiency in both positive and negative ionization modes, matrix interferences, and stability under vacuum. For the most relevant matrices, ion maps of the different lipid species were obtained from tissue sections at high spatial resolution and the detected peaks were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. First proposed for imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) after sublimation, DAN has demonstrated to be of high efficiency providing rich lipid signatures in both positive and negative polarities with high vacuum stability and sub-20 mu m resolution capacity. Ion images from adult mouse brain were generated with a 10 pm scanning resolution. Furthermore, ion images from adult mouse brain and whole-body fish tissue sections were also acquired in both polarity modes from the same tissue section at 100 pm spatial resolution. Sublimation of DAN represents an interesting approach to improve information with respect to currently employed matrices providing a deeper analysis of the lipidome by IMS.

BASIS Team	Infant Neural Sensitivity to Dynamic Eye Gaze Is Associated with Later Emerging Autism	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							BROADER PHENOTYPE; CHILDREN; FACE; CONTACT; HUMANS; BRAIN; RISK; ACTIVATION; LANGUAGE; SPECTRUM	Autism spectrum disorders (henceforth autism) are diagnosed in around 1% of the population [1]. Familial liability confers risk for a broad spectrum of difficulties including the broader autism phenotype (BAP) [2, 3]. There are currently no reliable predictors of autism in infancy, but characteristic behaviors emerge during the second year, enabling diagnosis after this age [4, 5]. Because indicators of brain functioning may be sensitive predictors, and atypical eye contact is characteristic of the syndrome [6-9] and the BAP [10, 11], we examined whether neural sensitivity to eye gaze during infancy is associated with later autism outcomes [12, 13]. We undertook a prospective longitudinal study of infants with and without familial risk for autism. At 6-10 months, we recorded infants' event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to viewing faces with eye gaze directed toward versus away from the infant [14]. Longitudinal analyses showed that characteristics of ERP components evoked in response to dynamic eye gaze shifts during infancy were associated with autism diagnosed at 36 months. ERP responses to eye gaze may help characterize developmental processes that lead to later emerging autism. Findings also elucidate the mechanisms driving the development of the social brain in infancy.

PrionHome: A Database of Prions and Other Sequences Relevant to Prion Phenomena	PLOS ONE			English	Article							YEAST PRION; DISORDERED PROTEINS; COMPOSITIONAL BIAS; GENETIC-VARIATION; APLYSIA CPEB; PROPAGATION; REGIONS; FORM; DOMAINS; SCRAPIE	Prions are units of propagation of an altered state of a protein or proteins; prions can propagate from organism to organism, through cooption of other protein copies. Prions contain no necessary nucleic acids, and are important both as both pathogenic agents, and as a potential force in epigenetic phenomena. The original prions were derived from a misfolded form of the mammalian Prion Protein PrP. Infection by these prions causes neurodegenerative diseases. Other prions cause non-Mendelian inheritance in budding yeast, and sometimes act as diseases of yeast. We report the bioinformatic construction of the PrionHome, a database of >2000 prion-related sequences. The data was collated from various public and private resources and filtered for redundancy. The data was then processed according to a transparent classification system of prionogenic sequences (i.e., sequences that can make prions), prionoids (i.e., proteins that propagate like prions between individual cells), and other prion-related phenomena. There are eight PrionHome classifications for sequences. The first four classifications are derived from experimental observations: prionogenic sequences, prionoids, other prion-related phenomena, and prion interactors. The second four classifications are derived from sequence analysis: orthologs, paralogs, pseudogenes, and candidate-prionogenic sequences. Database entries list: supporting information for PrionHome classifications, prion-determinant areas (where relevant), and disordered and compositionally-biased regions. Also included are literature references for the PrionHome classifications, transcripts and genomic coordinates, and structural data (including comparative models made for the PrionHome from manually curated alignments). We provide database usage examples for both vertebrate and fungal prion contexts. Using the database data, we have performed a detailed analysis of the compositional biases in known budding-yeast prionogenic sequences, showing that the only abundant bias pattern is for asparagine bias with subsidiary serine bias. We anticipate that this database will be a useful experimental aid and reference resource. It is freely available at: http://libaio.biol.mcgill.ca/prion.	[Harbi, Djamel; Gendoo, Deena M.

Several organ systems including the retina, cranial nerves, inner ear and heart are affected in CHARGE syndrome. However, the mechanistic link between mutations in CHD7 and many of the organ systems dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we show that Chd7 is required for the organization of the neural retina in zebrafish. We observe an abnormal expression or a complete absence of molecular markers for the retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors, indicating that Chd7 regulates the differentiation of retinal cells and plays an essential role in retinal cell development. In addition, zebrafish with reduced Chd7 display an abnormal organization and clustering of cranial motor neurons. We also note a pronounced reduction in the facial branchiomotor neurons and the vagal motor neurons display aberrant positioning. Further, these fish exhibit a severe loss of the facial nerves. Knock-down of Chd7 results in a curvature of the long body axis and these fish develop irregular shaped vertebrae and have a reduction in bone mineralization. Chd7 knockdown also results in a loss of proper segment polarity illustrated by flawed efnb2a and ttna expression, which is associated with later vascular segmentation defects. These critical roles for Chd7 in retinal and vertebral development were previously unrecognized and our results provide new insights into the role of Chd7 during development and in CHARGE syndrome pathogenesis.

This process relies in part on cross-repressive interactions between specific transcription factors whose expression is regulated by Sonic hedgehog. Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) proteins are transcriptional corepressors suggested to be recruited by at least certain Sonic hedgehog-controlled transcription factors to mediate the formation of spatially distinct progenitor domains within the ventral spinal cord. The aim of this study was to characterize the involvement of TLE in mechanisms regulating the establishment of the boundary between the most ventral spinal cord progenitor domains, termed pMN and p3. Because the pMN domain gives rise to somatic motor neurons while the p3 domain generates V3 interneurons, we also examined the involvement of TLE in the acquisition of these neuronal fates. Methodology and Principal Findings: A combination of in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies in the developing chick spinal cord was performed to characterize the role of TLE in ventral progenitor domain formation. It is shown here that TLE overexpression causes increased numbers of p3 progenitors and promotes the V3 interneuron fate while suppressing the motor neuron fate. Conversely, dominant-inhibition of TLE increases the numbers of pMN progenitors and postmitotic motor neurons. Conclusion: Based on these results, we propose that TLE is important to promote the formation of the p3 domain and subsequent generation of V3 interneurons.

CHARACTERIZATION OF OXALIPLATIN-INDUCED CHRONIC PAINFUL PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY IN THE RAT AND COMPARISON WITH THE NEUROPATHY INDUCED BY PACLITAXEL	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						chemotherapy neuropathy; carnitine; olesoxime; mitotoxicity; sensory neuropathy	ACETYL-L-CARNITINE; PRIMARY AFFERENT NEURONS; CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NEUROPATHY; GATED SODIUM-CHANNELS; POTENTIAL VANILLOID 1; SPONTANEOUS DISCHARGE; A-FIBER; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTIONS; LANGERHANS CELLS; SENSORY NEURONS	Anti-neoplastic agents in the platinum-complex, taxane, vinca alkaloid, and proteasome-inhibitor classes induce a dose-limiting, chronic, distal, symmetrical, sensory peripheral neuropathy that is often accompanied by neuropathic pain. Clinical descriptions suggest that these conditions are very similar, but clinical data are insufficient to determine the degree of similarity and to determine if they share common pathophysiological mechanisms. Animal models do not have the limitations of clinical studies and so we have characterized a rat model of chronic painful peripheral neuropathy induced by a platinum-complex agent, oxaliplatin, in order to compare it with a previously characterized model of chronic painful peripheral neuropathy induced by a taxane agent, paclitaxel. The oxaliplatin model evokes mechano-allodynia, mechano-hyperalgesia, and cold-allodynia that have a delayed onset, gradually increasing severity, a distinct delay to peak severity, and duration of about 2.5 months. There is no effect on heat sensitivity. Electron microscopy (EM) analyses found no evidence for axonal degeneration in peripheral nerve, and there is no upregulation of activating transcription factor-3 in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia. There is a statistically significant loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers in the plantar hind paw skin. Oxaliplatin treatment causes a significant increase in the incidence of swollen and vacuolated mitochondria in peripheral nerve axons, but not in their Schwann cells. Nerve conduction studies found significant slowing of sensory axons, but no change in motor axons. Single fiber recordings found an abnormal incidence of A- and C-fibers with irregular, low-frequency spontaneous discharge. Prophylactic dosing with two drugs that are known to protect mitochondria, acetyl-L-carnitine and olesoxime, significantly reduced the development of pain hypersensitivity. Our results are very similar to those obtained previously with paclitaxel, and support the hypothesis that these two agents, and perhaps other chemotherapeutics, produce very similar conditions because they have a mitotoxic effect on primary afferent neurons.

Here, using NIH3T3 cells, we identified transcriptionally related events associated with the expression of Polyomavirus Large-T antigen (PyLT), a potent viral oncogene. We propose that a subset of these alterations in gene expression may be related to the early events that contribute to carcinogenesis. The proposed tumor suppressor Necdin, known to be regulated by p53, was within a group of genes that was consistently upregulated in the presence of PyLT. While Necdin is induced following p53 activation with different genotoxic stresses, Necdin induction by PyLT did not involve p53 activation or the Rb-binding site of PyLT. Necdin depletion by shRNA conferred a proliferative advantage to NIH3T3 and PyLT-expressing NIH3T3 (NIHLT) cells. In contrast, our results demonstrate that although overexpression of Necdin induced a growth arrest in NIH3T3 and NIHLT cells, a growing population rapidly emerged from these arrested cells. This population no longer showed significant proliferation defects despite high Necdin expression. Moreover, we established that Necdin is a negative regulator of p53-mediated growth arrest induced by nutlin-3, suggesting that Necdin upregulation could contribute to the bypass of a p53-response in p53 wild type tumors. To support this, we characterized Necdin expression in low malignant potential ovarian cancer (LMP) where p53 mutations rarely occur. Elevated levels of Necdin expression were observed in LMP when compared to aggressive serous ovarian cancers. We propose that in some contexts, the constitutive expression of Necdin could contribute to cancer promotion by delaying appropriate p53 responses and potentially promote genomic instability.

The performance of automatic segmentation in TLE has so far been considered unsatisfactory. In addition to atrophy, about 40% of patients present with developmental abnormalities (referred to as malrotation) characterized by atypical morphologies of the hippocampus and collateral sulcus. Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of malrotation and atrophy on the performance of three state-of-the-art automated algorithms. We segmented the hippocampus in 66 patients and 35 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects using a region-growing algorithm constrained by anatomical priors (SACHA), a freely available atlas-based software (FreeSurfer) and a multi-atlas approach (ANIMAL-multi). To quantify malrotation, we generated 3D models from manual hippocampal labels and automatically extracted collateral sulci. The accuracy of automated techniques was evaluated relative to manual labeling using the Dice similarity index and surface-based shape mapping, for which we computed vertex-wise displacement vectors between automated and manual segmentations. We then correlated segmentation accuracy with malrotation features and atrophy. ANIMAL-multi demonstrated similar accuracy in patients and healthy controls (p > 0.1), whereas SACHA and FreeSurfer were less accurate in patients (p < 0.05). Surface-based analysis of contour accuracy revealed that SACHA over-estimated the lateral border of malrotated hippocampi (r = 0.61; p < 0.0001), but performed well in the presence of atrophy (vertical bar r vertical bar < 0.34; p > 0.2). Conversely, FreeSurfer and ANIMAL-multi were affected by both malrotation (FreeSurfer: r = 0.57; p= 0.02, ANIMAL-multi: r = 0.50; p = 0.05) and atrophy (FreeSurfer: r = 0.78, p < 0.0001, ANIMAL-multi: r = 0.61; p < 0.0001). Compared to manual volumetry, automated procedures underestimated the magnitude of atrophy (Cohen's d: manual: 1.68; ANIMAL-multi: 1.11; SACHA: 1.10; FreeSurfer: 0.90, p < 0.0001). In addition, they tended to lateralize the seizure focus less accurately in the presence of malrotation (manual: 64%; ANIMAL-multi: 55%, p = 0.4; SACHA: 50%, p = 0.1; FreeSurfer: 41%, p = 0.05). Hippocampal developmental anomalies and atrophy had a negative impact on the segmentation performance of three state-of-the-art automated methods. These shape variants should be taken into account when designing segmentation algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we tested the hypothesis that different unimanual motor tasks are specifically associated with distinct patterns of oscillatory coupling in human sensorimotor cortical areas. In 13 healthy, right-handed subjects, we recorded task-induced neural activity with 122-channel electroencephalography (EEG) while subjects performed fast self-paced extension-flexion movements with the right index finger and an isometric contraction of the right forearm. Task-related modulations of inter-regional coupling within a core motor network comprising the left primary motor cortex (M1), lateral premotor cortex (IPM) and supplementary motor area (SMA) were then modeled using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). A network model postulating coupling both within and across frequencies best captured observed spectral responses according to Bayesian model selection. DCM revealed dominant coupling within the beta-band (13-30 Hz) between M1 and SMA during isometric contraction of the forearm, whereas fast repetitive finger movements were characterized by strong coupling within the gamma-band (31-48 Hz) and between the theta- (4-7 Hz) and the gamma-band. This coupling pattem was mainly expressed in connections from IPM to SMA and from IPM to M1. We infer that human manual motor control involves task-specific modulation of inter-regional oscillatory coupling both within and across distinct frequency bands. The results highlight the potential of DCM to characterize context-specific changes in coupling within functional brain networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The specific role of the different components of the fronto-striatal system in this type of learning is still unclear and was examined in the present functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study in humans. The subjects had to learn by trial and error arbitrary associations between visual stimuli and motor responses in an experimental paradigm designed to dissociate between the neuronal substrates specifically involved in the selection of the appropriate response and in the analysis of the feedback obtained during the learning and post-learning periods. First, the results demonstrate that the dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex is the critical structure for the acquisition and execution of arbitrary mappings of visual stimuli to motor responses. Second, they reveal an important shift in activation from the cognitive fronto-striatal network (involving the caudate nucleus, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the PMd) to the motor fronto-striatal network (involving the putamen and the PMd) as we move from initial learning of sensori-motor relations to the post-learning selection of the responses. Finally, they show that feedback processing, but not response selection, increased activity in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortical regions, demonstrating the selective involvement of these limbic frontal regions in the processing of the consequences of a given action. Altogether our data suggest that, in conditional visuo-motor learning, the associations are critically regulated by the dorsal premotor cortex and the striatum, with additional brain areas contributing to specific aspects of the learning and performance of such associations.

This may be explained by discrepancies and limitations in study population and study design. We report a study on brain tissue volumes in one of the largest cohorts of individuals studied to date of subjects with high mean age (mean +/- standard deviation (SD) 76 +/- 6 years). These analyses are based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired at baseline on 4303 non-demented elderly, and 367 who had a second MRI, on average 2.5 +/- 0.2 years later. Tissue segmentation was performed with an automatic image analysis pipeline. Total brain parenchymal (TBP) volume decreased with increasing age while there was an increase in white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in both sexes. A reduction in both normal white matter (NWM)- and gray matter (GM) volume contributed to the brain shrinkage. After adjusting for intra-cranial volume, women had larger brain volumes compared to men (3.32%, p<0.001) for TBP volume in the cross-sectional analysis. The longitudinal analysis showed a significant age-sex interaction in TBP volume with a greater rate of annual change in men (-0.70%, 95%CI: -0.78% to -0.63%) than women (-0.55%, 95%CI: -0.61% to -0.49%). The annual change in the cross-sectional data was approximately 40% less than the annual change in the longitudinal data and did not show significant age-sex interaction. The findings indicate that the cross-sectional data underestimate the rate of change in tissue volumes with age as the longitudinal data show greater rate of change in tissue volumes with age for all tissues.

Whether developmental cortical thinning is influenced by genes and if independent genetic factors influence different parts of the cortex is not known. Magnetic resonance brain imaging was done in twins at age 9 (N = 190) and again at age 12 (N = 125; 113 repeated measures) to assess genetic influences on changes in cortical thinning. We find considerable thinning of the cortex between over this three year interval (on average 0.05 mm; 1.5%), particularly in the frontal poles, and orbitofrontal, paracentral, and occipital cortices. Cortical thinning was highly heritable at age 9 and age 12, and the degree of genetic influence differed for the various areas of the brain. One genetic factor affected left inferior frontal (Broca's area), and left parietal (Wernicke's area) thinning; a second factor influenced left anterior paracentral (sensory-motor) thinning. Two factors influenced cortical thinning in the frontal poles: one of decreasing influence over time, and another independent genetic factor emerging at age 12 in left and right frontal poles. Thus, thinning of the cerebral cortex is heritable in children between the ages 9 and 12. Furthermore, different genetic factors are responsible for variation in cortical thickness at ages 9 and 12, with independent genetic factors acting on cortical thickness across time and between various brain areas during childhood brain development.

Quantification of the cortical contribution to the NIRS signal over the motor cortex using concurrent NIRS-fMRI measurements	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						NIRS-fMRI; Pial vasculature; Balloon Model; Monte Carlo simulations	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; CEREBRAL OXYGEN-METABOLISM; BRAIN ACTIVATION; BALLOON MODEL; BLOOD-VOLUME; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; BOLD; FLOW; RESOLUTION	Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measures the functional hemodynamic response occurring at the surface of the cortex. Large pial veins are located above the surface of the cerebral cortex. Following activation, these veins exhibit oxygenation changes but their volume likely stays constant. The back-reflection geometry of the NIRS measurement renders the signal very sensitive to these superficial pial veins. As such, the measured NIRS signal contains contributions from both the cortical region as well as the pial vasculature. In this work, the cortical contribution to the NIRS signal was investigated using (1) Monte Carlo simulations over a realistic geometry constructed from anatomical and vascular MRI and (2) multimodal NIRS-BOLD recordings during motor stimulation. A good agreement was found between the simulations and the modeling analysis of in vivo measurements. Our results suggest that the cortical contribution to the deoxyhemoglobin signal change (Delta HbR) is equal to 16-22% of the cortical contribution to the total hemoglobin signal change (Delta HbT). Similarly, the cortical contribution of the oxyhemoglobin signal change (,Delta HbO) is equal to 73-79% of the cortical contribution to the Delta HbT signal. These results suggest that Delta HbT is far less sensitive to pial vein contamination and therefore, it is likely that the Delta HbT signal provides better spatial specificity and should be used instead of Delta HbO or Delta HbR to map cerebral activity with NIRS. While different stimuli will result in different pial vein contributions, our finger tapping results do reveal the importance of considering the pial contribution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Neural Signature of Reconsolidation Impairments by Propranolol in Humans	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Amygdala; emotional memory; hippocampus; noradrenaline; propranolol; reconsolidation	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; EMOTIONAL MEMORY; FEAR MEMORY; RETRIEVAL; AMYGDALA; HIPPOCAMPAL; NEUROSCIENCE; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES	Background: The retrieval of consolidated memories may result in their destabilization, requiring a restabilization process called reconsolidation. During reconsolidation, memories become sensitive to psychological and pharmacological modifications again, thus providing an opportunity to alter unwanted memories. Although such reconsolidation manipulations might open the door to novel treatment approaches for psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, the brain mechanisms underlying reconsolidation processes in humans are completely unknown. Here, we asked whether a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist might interfere with the reconsolidation of emotional episodic memories and what brain mechanisms are involved in these effects. Methods: Healthy participants were administered the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol or a placebo before they reactivated previously learned neutral and emotional material. Recognition memory was tested 24 hours later. Functional magnetic resonance images were collected during reactivation and recognition testing. Results: Propranolol during reactivation specifically reduced the subsequent memory for emotional pictures; memory for neutral pictures remained unaffected. This emotional memory impairment was associated with significantly increased activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus for correctly recognized pictures at test. Most interestingly, the same structures were active (but not modulated by propranolol) during memory reactivation. Memory reactivation alone or propranolol without reactivation had no effect on subsequent memory. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate how the consequences of memory reconsolidation processes are represented in the human brain, suggesting that the brain areas that are recruited during reactivation undergo changes in activity that are associated with subsequent memory recall.

Modeling runoff and evapotranspiration dynamics play a vital role in assessing the hydrology cycle and function of forest ecosystems. Based on the hydrological and meteorological data collected over 20 years from January of 1988 to December of 2007 at Huitong National Forest Ecosystem Research Station, we used back propagation neural network (BPNN) and genetic neural network (GNN) models to simulate runoff and evapotranspiration of Chinese fir plantations for two watersheds located in Huitong county of Hunan Province, China. The purpose of this study was to accurately simulate runoff and evapotranspiration dynamics using both BPNN and GNN models. The model simulations of the runoff and evapotranspiration indicated that the GNN model concurrently possesses efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness. Moreover, the simulated results of GNN and BPNN model were compared with a multivariate statistics (M-slat) model. We found that the GNN model performed better than M-slat and BPNN models for modeling both runoff and evapotranspiration of Chinese fir plantations in China. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Mutations in KAT6B, Encoding a Histone Acetyltransferase, Cause Genitopatellar Syndrome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							ABSENT PATELLAE; STEM-CELLS; PHENOTYPE; PROTEIN; FEMALE; IDENTIFICATION; COACTIVATOR; ANOMALIES; TUMOR; LMX1B	Genitopatellar syndrome (GPS) is a skeletal dysplasia with cerebral and genital anomalies for which the molecular basis has not yet been determined. By exome sequencing, we found de novo heterozygous truncating mutations in KAT6B (lysine acetyltransferase 6B, formerly known as MYST4 and MORF) in three subjects; then by Sanger sequencing of KAT6B, we found similar mutations in three additional subjects. The mutant transcripts do not undergo nonsense-mediated decay in cells from subjects with GPS. In addition, human pathological analyses and mouse expression studies point to systemic roles of KAT6B in controlling organismal growth and development. Myst4 (the mouse orthologous gene) is expressed in mouse tissues corresponding to those affected by GPS. Phenotypic differences and similarities between GPS, the Say-Barber-Biesecker variant of Ohdo syndrome (caused by different mutations of KAT6B), and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (caused by mutations in other histone acetyltransferases) are discussed. Together, the data support an epigenetic dysregulation of the limb, brain, and genital developmental programs.

Cys-27 Variant of Human delta-Opioid Receptor Modulates Maturation and Cell Surface Delivery of Phe-27 Variant via Heteromerization	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE RECEPTOR; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONES; SPLICE VARIANT; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; QUALITY-CONTROL; LIVING CELLS; PROTEIN	The important role of G protein-coupled receptor homo/heteromerization in receptor folding, maturation, trafficking, and cell surface expression has become increasingly evident. Here we investigated whether the human delta-opioid receptor (h delta OR) Cys-27 variant that shows inherent compromised maturation has an effect on the behavior of the more common Phe-27 variant in the early secretory pathway. We demonstrate that h delta OR-Cys-27 acts in a dominant negative manner and impairs cell surface delivery of the co-expressed h delta OR-Phe-27 and impairs conversion of precursors to the mature form. This was demonstrated by metabolic labeling, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy in HEK293 and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells using differentially epitope-tagged variants. The h delta OR-Phe-27 precursors that were redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation were, however, rescued by a pharmacological chaperone, the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Co-immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled variants revealed that both endoplasmic reticulum-localized precursors and mature receptors exist as homo/heteromers. The existence of homo/heteromers was confirmed in living cells by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer measurements, showing that the variants have a similar propensity to form homo/heteromers. By forming both homomers and heteromers, the h delta OR-Cys-27 variant may thus regulate the levels of receptors at the cell surface, possibly leading to altered responsiveness to opioid ligands in individuals carrying the Cys-27 variant.

However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases(1-4). To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)(5) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres(6,7), were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles.

Coding of Microsaccades in Three-Dimensional Space by Premotor Saccadic Neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; PRIMATE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; FIXATIONAL EYE-MOVEMENTS; COVERT ATTENTION; BURST GENERATOR; VISUAL-CORTEX; DYNAMICS; VERGENCE; MECHANISMS	Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements that are produced during fixation. While accurate visual perception requires precise binocular coordination during fixation, previous studies of the neural control of microsaccades measured the movement of one eye only. Here we show how premotor saccadic neurons control these small fixational eye movements in three-dimensional space. Microsaccadic eye movements, produced by monkeys trained to fixate targets presented at different depths, were similarly distributed in three-dimensional space during both near and far viewing. Single unit recordings of the neural activity of premotor neurons further revealed that the brainstem saccadic circuitry controls these minute disconjugate shifts of gaze by preferentially encoding the dynamic movement of an individual eye (i.e., integrated control of conjugate and vergence motion). These findings challenge the traditional notion that microsaccades are strictly conjugate and have important implications for studies that use microsaccades to evaluate visual and attentional processing, as well as certain neurological disorders.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the neurotrophin responsible for the phenotypic maintenance of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the mature and fully differentiated CNS. In consequence, its implication in cholinergic atrophy has been suspected; however, no mechanistic explanation has been provided. We have previously shown that the precursor of NGF (proNGF) is cleaved extracellularly by plasmin to form mature NGF (mNGF) and that mNGF is degraded by matrix metalloproteinase 9. Using cognitive-behavioral tests, Western blotting, and confocal and electron microscopy, this study demonstrates that a pharmacologically induced chronic failure in extracellular NGF maturation leads to a reduction in mNGF levels, proNGF accumulation, cholinergic degeneration, and cognitive impairment in rats. It also shows that inhibiting NGF degradation increases endogenous levels of the mature neurotrophin and increases the density of cortical cholinergic boutons. Together, the data point to a mechanism explaining cholinergic loss in neurodegenerative conditions such as AD and provide a potential therapeutic target for the protection or restoration of this CNS transmitter system in aging and AD.

Measuring Internal Representations from Behavioral and Brain Data	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							SEEING FACES; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; FEATURES; INFORMATION; NOISE; CLASSIFICATION; REVEAL; IMAGES; CORTEX	The study of internal knowledge representations is a cornerstone of the research agenda in the interdisciplinary study of cognition. An influential proposal assumes that the brain uses its internal knowledge of the external world to constrain, in a top-down manner, high-dimensional sensory data into a lower-dimensional representation that enables perceptual decisions and other higher-level cognitive functions [1-9]. This proposal relies on a precise formulation of the observer-specific internal knowledge (i.e., the internal representations, or models) that guides reduction of the high-dimensional retinal input onto a low-dimensional code. Here, we directly revealed the content of subjective internal representations by instructing five observers to detect a face in the presence of only white noise, to force a pure top-down, knowledge-based task. We used reverse correlation methods to visualize each observer's internal representation that supports detection of an illusory face. Using reverse correlation again, this time applied to observers' electroencephalogram activity, we established where and when in the brain specific internal knowledge conceptually interprets the input white noise as a face. We show that internal representations can be reconstructed experimentally from behavioral and brain data, and that their content drives neural activity first over frontal and then over occipitotemporal cortex.

We demonstrated that OT promoted the direct engagement and activation of G(q) and all the G(i/o) subtypes at the OT receptor. Other peptidic analogues, chosen because of specific substitutions in key OT structural/functional residues, all showed biased activation of G protein subtypes. No ligand, except OT, activated G(oA) or G(oB), and, with only one exception, all of the peptides that activated Gq also activated G(i2) and G(i3) but not G(i1), G(oA), or G(oB), indicating a strong bias toward these subunits. Two peptides (DNalOVT and atosiban) activated only G(i1) or G(i3), failed to recruit beta-arrestins, and did not induce receptor internalization, providing the first clear examples of ligands differentiating individual G(i/o) family members. Both analogs inhibited cell proliferation, showing that a single G(i) subtype-mediated pathway is sufficient to prompt this physiological response. These analogs represent unique tools for examining the contribution of G(i/o) members in complex biological responses and open the way to the development of drugs with peculiar selectivity profiles. This is of particular relevance because OT has been shown to improve symptoms in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders characterized by abnormal social behaviors, such as autism. Functional selective ligands, activating a specific G protein signaling pathway, may possess a higher efficacy and specificity on OT-based therapeutics.

J	Bergstra, J; Bengio, Y				Bergstra, James; Bengio, Yoshua			Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						global optimization; model selection; neural networks; deep learning; response surface modeling		Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.

Updates have been published with refinements to create diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment indices. The purpose of this report is to present the updated diagnosis-specific GPA indices in a single, unified, user-friendly report to allow ease of access and use by treating physicians. Methods A multi-institutional retrospective (1985 to 2007) database of 3,940 patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases underwent univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors associated with outcomes by primary site and treatment. Significant prognostic factors were used to define the diagnosis-specific GPA prognostic indices. A GPA of 4.0 correlates with the best prognosis, whereas a GPA of 0.0 corresponds with the worst prognosis. Results Significant prognostic factors varied by diagnosis. For lung cancer, prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance score, age, presence of extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases, confirming the original Lung-GPA. For melanoma and renal cell cancer, prognostic factors were Karnofsky performance score and the number of brain metastases. For breast cancer, prognostic factors were tumor subtype, Karnofsky performance score, and age. For GI cancer, the only prognostic factor was the Karnofsky performance score. The median survival times by GPA score and diagnosis were determined. Conclusion Prognostic factors for patients with brain metastases vary by diagnosis, and for each diagnosis, a robust separation into different GPA scores was discerned, implying considerable heterogeneity in outcome, even within a single tumor type. In summary, these indices and related worksheet provide an accurate and facile diagnosis-specific tool to estimate survival, potentially select appropriate treatment, and stratify clinical trials for patients with brain metastases.

The dorsal vagal complex (DVC), the brainstem center mediating the satiety reflex, has recently emerged as a determinant effector of long-term feeding adaptation. To study the effects of aging and caloric restriction on satiety circuits, leptin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling systems were studied in 2- and 19-month-old ad libitum-fed (AL) and 19-month-old calorie-restricted (CR) rats. Age-induced hyperleptinemia in AL rats was correlated with elevated DVC BDNF immunoreactive concentrations and satiety threshold stability, suggesting functional desensitization of the DVC to these signals. To better understand this phenomenon, mRNA levels of receptor and post-receptor signaling effectors were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Aging selectively increased BDNF receptors and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) mRNA levels. Caloric restriction prevented age-related increases of serum leptin, DVC BDNF and SOCS-3 mRNA levels, but not those of BDNF receptors. In CR rats, prevention of leptin resistance-promoting SOCS-3 induction was also observed at the protein level. This study suggests that leptin post-receptor targets and BDNF signaling play a role in the establishment of age-related DVC dysfunction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

How the Experience of Sexual Reward Connects Sexual Desire, Preference, and Performance	ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sexual reward; Sexual preference; Conditioning; Critical periods; Opioids; Dopamine	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; INCREASES DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION; RATS RATTUS-NORVEGICUS; FEMALE SYRIAN-HAMSTERS; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; PARTNER PREFERENCE; COPULATORY-BEHAVIOR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; INSTRUMENTAL BEHAVIOR; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE	Although sexual behavior is controlled by hormonal and neurochemical actions in the brain, sexual experience induces a degree of plasticity that allows animals to form instrumental and Pavlovian associations that predict sexual outcomes, thereby directing the strength of sexual responding. This review describes how experience with sexual reward strengthens the development of sexual behavior and induces sexually-conditioned place and partner preferences in rats. In both male and female rats, early sexual experience with partners scented with a neutral or even noxious odor induces a preference for scented partners in subsequent choice tests. Those preferences can also be induced by injections of morphine or oxytocin paired with a male rat's first exposure to scented females, indicating that pharmacological activation of opioid or oxytocin receptors can "stand in" for the sexual reward-related neurochemical processes normally activated by sexual stimulation. Conversely, conditioned place or partner preferences can be blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. A somatosensory cue (a rodent jacket) paired with sexual reward comes to elicit sexual arousal in male rats, such that paired rats with the jacket off show dramatic copulatory deficits. We propose that endogenous opioid activation forms the basis of sexual reward, which also sensitizes hypothalamic and mesolimbic dopamine systems in the presence of cues that predict sexual reward. Those systems act to focus attention on, and activate goal-directed behavior toward, reward-related stimuli. Thus, a critical period exists during an individual's early sexual experience that creates a "love map" or Gestalt of features, movements, feelings, and interpersonal interactions associated with sexual reward.

Central nervous system atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours: The Canadian Paediatric Brain Tumour Consortium experience	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor; CNS; Paediatric; Population based study; High dose chemotherapy; Radiation therapy	HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY; TERATOID/RHABDOID TUMOR; RADIATION-THERAPY; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; INFANCY; RADIOTHERAPY	Background: Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours (ATRT) are aggressive brain tumours mostly occurring in early childhood. Largest published series arise from registries and institutional experiences (1-4). The aim of this report is to provide population-based data to further characterise this rare entity and to delineate prognostic factors. Patients and methods: A national retrospective study of children 618 years diagnosed with a central nervous system (CNS) ATRT between 1995 and 2007 was undertaken. All cases underwent central pathology review. Results: There were 50 patients (31 males; median age at diagnosis of 16.7 months). Twelve patients were >36 months. Infratentorial location accounted for 52% of all cases. Nineteen patients (38%) had metastatic disease. Fifteen (30%) underwent gross total resection (GTR). Ten patients (20%) underwent palliation. Among the 40 remaining patients, 22 received conventional chemotherapy and 18 received high dose chemotherapy regimens (HDC); nine received intrathecal chemotherapy and 15 received adjuvant radiation. Thirty of the 40 treated patients relapsed/progressed at a median time of 5.5 months (0-32). The median survival time of the entire cohort was 13.5 months (1-117.5 months).Age, tumour location and metastatic status were not prognostic. Patients with GTR had a better survival (2 years overall survival (OS): 60% +/- 12.6 versus 21.7% +/- 8.5, p = 0.03). HDC conferred better outcome (2 years OS 47.9% +/- 12.1 versus 27.3% +/- 9.5, p = 0.036). Upfront radiation did not provide survival benefit. Six of the 12 survivors (50%) did not receive radiation. Conclusion: The outcome of CNS ATRT remains poor. However, the use of HDC provides encouraging results. GTR is a significant prognostic factor. The role of adjuvant radiation remains unclear.

Differential patterns of whole-genome DNA methylation in institutionalized children and children raised by their biological parents	DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; EARLY EXPERIENCE; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; GENE-EXPRESSION; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; STRESS RESPONSES; CHILDHOOD ABUSE; HEALTH; BRAIN	Previous studies with nonhuman species have shown that animals exposed to early adversity show differential DNA methylation relative to comparison animals. The current study examined differential methylation among 14 children raised since birth in institutional care and 14 comparison children raised by their biological parents. Blood samples were taken from children in middle childhood. Analysis of whole-genome methylation patterns was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assay (Illumina), which contains 27,578 CpG sites, covering approximately 14,000 gene promoters. Group differences were registered, which were characterized primarily by greater methylation in the institutionalized group relative to the comparison group, with most of these differences in genes involved in the control of immune response and cellular signaling systems, including a number of crucial players important for neural communication and brain development and functioning. The findings suggest that patterns of differential methylation seen in nonhuman species with altered maternal care are also characteristic of children who experience early maternal separation.

Genotype-phenotype correlation in interstitial 6q deletions: a report of 12 new cases	NEUROGENETICS			English	Article						Microarray; Prader-Willi-like phenotype; Movement disorders; Epilepsy; Microcephaly; 6q deletion	WILLI-LIKE PHENOTYPE; MELANIN-CONCENTRATING HORMONE; HISTONE DEACETYLASES 1; LONG ARM; SIM1 GENE; VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS; FOREBRAIN DEVELOPMENT; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MEMORY FORMATION; TRANSGENIC MICE	Interstitial deletions of 6q are associated with variable phenotypes, including growth retardation, dysmorphic features, upper limb malformations, and Prader-Willi (PW)-like features. Only a minority of cases in the literature have been characterized with high resolution techniques, making genotype-phenotype correlations difficult. We report 12 individuals with overlapping, 200-kb to 16.4-Mb interstitial deletions within 6q15q22.33 characterized by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization to better correlate deletion regions with specific phenotypes. Four individuals have a PW-like phenotype, though only two have deletion of SIM1, the candidate gene for this feature. Therefore, other genes on 6q may contribute to this phenotype including multiple genes on 6q16 and our newly proposed candidate, the transcription cofactor gene VGLL2 on 6q22.2. Two individuals present with movement disorders as a major feature, and ataxia is present in a third. The 4.1-Mb 6q22.1q22.2 critical region for movement disorders includes the cerebellar-expressed candidate gene GOPC. Observed brain malformations include thick corpus callosum in two subjects, cerebellar vermal hypoplasia in two subjects, and cerebellar atrophy in one subject. Seven subjects' deletions overlap a similar to 250-kb cluster of four genes on 6q22.1 including MARCKS, HDAC2, and HS3ST5, which are involved in neural development. Two subjects have only this gene cluster deleted, and one deletion was apparently de novo, suggesting at least one of these genes plays an important role in development. Although the phenotypes associated with 6q deletions can vary, using overlapping deletions to delineate critical regions improves genotype-phenotype correlation for interstitial 6q deletions.

Mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma P19 cells exposed to sc-7 for 2 days followed by a 5-day wash-out differentiated into cholinergic neurons that expressed specific neuronal markers and displayed axonal formation. Axons continued growing up to 28 days after treatment. In vivo, infusion of sc-7 for 2 weeks into the left ventricle of the rat brain followed by a 3-week wash-out induced bromodeoxyuridine uptake by cells of the ependymal layer and subventricular zone that co-localized with doublecortin and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining, demonstrating induction of proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors. Migrating neuroblasts were also observed in the corpus callosum. Thus, under these experimental conditions, adult ependymal cells resumed proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that sc-7 is an interesting molecule for stimulating in situ neurogenesis from resident neuronal progenitors as part of neuron replacement therapy. sc-7 did not bind to nuclear steroid receptors and was not metabolized as a steroid, supporting our hypothesis that the neurogenic effect of sc-7 is not likely due to a steroid-like effect.

In epilepsy, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, >80Hz) have proven particularly important and useful. This literature review describes the morphology, clinical meaning, and pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs. To record HFOs, the intracranial EEG needs to be sampled at least at 2,000Hz. The oscillatory events can be visualized by applying a high-pass filter and increasing the time and amplitude scales, or EEG time-frequency maps can show the amount of high-frequency activity. HFOs appear excellent markers for the epileptogenic zone. In patients with focal epilepsy who can benefit from surgery, invasive EEG is often required to identify the epileptic cortex, but current information is sometimes inadequate. Removal of brain tissue generating HFOs has been related to better postsurgical outcome than removing the seizure onset zone, indicating that HFOs may mark cortex that needs to be removed to achieve seizure control. The pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs is challenging, probably involving populations of neurons firing asynchronously. They differ from physiological HFOs in not being paced by rhythmic inhibitory activity and in their possible origin from population spikes. Their link to the epileptogenic zone argues that their study will teach us much about the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. HFOs show promise for improving surgical outcome and accelerating intracranial EEG investigations. Their potential needs to be assessed by future research.

Mouse models were instrumental in defining the signaling pathways defective in NTDs, including the planar cell polarity (PCP), also called noncanonical Frizzled/Disheveled pathway. Based on the highly penetrant occurrence of NTDs in double Fzd3/Fzd6(-/-) mutant mice, we investigated the role of the human orthologues, FZD3 and FZD6, by resequencing a cohort of 473 NTDs patients and 639 ethnically matched controls. While we could not demonstrate a significant contribution of FZD3 gene, we identified five rare FZD6 variants that were absent in all controls and predicted to have a functional effect by computational analysis: one de novo frameshift mutation (c.1843_1844insA), three missense changes (p.Arg405Gln, p.Arg511Cys p.Arg511His), and one substitution (c.*20C>T) affecting the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene. The overall rate of predicted deleterious variants of FZD6 was 5.1-fold higher in cases compared to controls, resulting in a significantly increased NTDs mutation burden. This study demonstrates that rare nonsynonymous variants in FZD6 may contribute to NTDs in humans and enlarges the spectrum of mutations that link PCP pathway to NTDs. Hum Mutat 33:384-390, 2012.

Serologic diagnosis of NMO A multicenter comparison of aquaporin-4-IgG assays	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NEUROMYELITIS-OPTICA; ANTI-AQUAPORIN-4 ANTIBODIES; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; WATER CHANNEL; IGG; IMMUNOGLOBULIN; SPECTRUM; MARKER	Objectives: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) immunoglobulin G (IgG) (aquaporin-4 [AQP4] IgG) is highly specific for NMO and related disorders, and autoantibody detection has become an essential investigation in patients with demyelinating disease. However, although different techniques are now used, no multicenter comparisons have been performed. This study compares the sensitivity and specificity of different assays, including an in-house flow cytometric assay and 2 commercial assays (ELISA and transfected cell-based assay [CBA]). Methods: Six assay methods (in-house or commercial) were performed in 2 international centers using coded serum from patients with NMO (35 patients), NMO spectrum disorders (25 patients), relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (39 patients), miscellaneous autoimmune diseases (25 patients), and healthy subjects (22 subjects). Results: The highest sensitivities were yielded by assays detecting IgG binding to cells expressing recombinant AQP4 with quantitative flow cytometry (77%; 46 of 60) or visual observation (CBA, 73%; 44 of 60). The fluorescence immunoprecipitation assay and tissue-based immunofluorescence assay were least sensitive (48%-53%). The CBA and ELISA commercial assays (100% specific) yielded sensitivities of 68% (41 of 60) and 60% (36 of 60), respectively, and sensitivity of 72% (43 of 60) when used in combination. Conclusions: The greater sensitivity and excellent specificity of second-generation recombinant antigen-based assays for detection of NMO-IgG in a clinical setting should enable earlier diagnosis of NMO spectrum disorders and prompt initiation of disease-appropriate therapies.

Neurophysiological Defects and Neuronal Gene Deregulation in Drosophila mir-124 Mutants	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							NEGATIVE POSTTRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION; UTR SEQUENCE MOTIF; MICRORNA TARGETS; SYNAPTIC GROWTH; MESSENGER-RNAS; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; K-BOX; EXPRESSION	miR-124 is conserved in sequence and neuronal expression across the animal kingdom and is predicted to have hundreds of mRNA targets. Diverse defects in neural development and function were reported from miR-124 antisense studies in vertebrates, but a nematode knockout of mir-124 surprisingly lacked detectable phenotypes. To provide genetic insight from Drosophila, we deleted its single mir-124 locus and found that it is dispensable for gross aspects of neural specification and differentiation. On the other hand, we detected a variety of mutant phenotypes that were rescuable by a mir-124 genomic transgene, including short lifespan, increased dendrite variation, impaired larval locomotion, and aberrant synaptic release at the NMJ. These phenotypes reflect extensive requirements of miR-124 even under optimal culture conditions. Comparison of the transcriptomes of cells from wild-type and mir-124 mutant animals, purified on the basis of mir-124 promoter activity, revealed broad upregulation of direct miR-124 targets. However, in contrast to the proposed mutual exclusion model for miR-124 function, its functional targets were relatively highly expressed in miR-124-expressing cells and were not enriched in genes annotated with epidermal expression. A notable aspect of the direct miR-124 network was coordinate targeting of five positive components in the retrograde BMP signaling pathway, whose activation in neurons increases synaptic release at the NMJ, similar to mir-124 mutants. Derepression of the direct miR-124 target network also had many secondary effects, including over-activity of other post-transcriptional repressors and a net incomplete transition from a neuroblast to a neuronal gene expression signature. Altogether, these studies demonstrate complex consequences of miR-124 loss on neural gene expression and neurophysiology.

However, due to the complexity of interactions between Ephs and ephrins, the molecular logic of their action is still being unraveled. Considerable advances have been made by studying the innervation of the limb by spinal motor neurons, a series of events governed by Eph/ephrin signaling. Here, we discuss the contributions of different Eph/ephrin modes of interaction, downstream signaling and electrical activity, and how these systems may interact both with each other and with other guidance molecules in limb muscle innervation. This simple model system has emerged as a very powerful tool to study this set of molecules, and will continue to be so by virtue of its simplicity, accessibility and the wealth of pioneering cellular studies.

First published November 16, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00535.2011.-Our objective was to determine whether atrial fibrillation (AF) results from excessive activation of intrinsic cardiac neurons (ICNs) and, if so, whether select subpopulations of neurons therein represent therapeutic targets for suppression of this arrhythmogenic potential. Trains of five electrical stimuli (0.3-1.2 mA, 1 ms) were delivered during the atrial refractory period to mediastinal nerves (MSN) on the superior vena cava to evoke AF. Neuroanatomical studies were performed by injecting the neuronal tracer DiI into MSN sites that induced AF. Functional studies involved recording of neuronal activity in situ from the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) in response to MSN stimulation (MSNS) prior to and following neuromodulation involving either preemptive spinal cord stimulation (SCS; T-1-T-3, 50 Hz, 200-ms duration) or ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium, 5 mg/kg). The tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) neuronal tracer labeled a subset (13.2%) of RAGP neurons, which also colocalized with cholinergic or adrenergic markers. A subset of DiI-labeled RAGP neurons were noncholinergic/nonadrenergic. MSNS evoked an similar to 4-fold increase in RAGP neuronal activity from baseline, which SCS reduced by 43%. Hexamethonium blocked MSNS-evoked increases in neuronal activity. MSNS evoked AF in 78% of right-sided MSN sites, which SCS reduced to 33% and hexamethonium reduced to 7%. MSNS-induced bradycardia was maintained with SCS but was mitigated by hexamethonium. We conclude that MSNS activates subpopulations of intrinsic cardiac neurons, thereby resulting in the formation of atrial arrhythmias leading to atrial fibrillation. Stabilization of ICN local circuit neurons by SCS or the local circuit and autonomic efferent neurons with hexamethonium reduces the arrhythmogenic potential.	[Gibbons, David D.; Southerland, E.

There is a need for recommendations to assist clinicians in treating these frequently encountered patients. METHODS: The literature was reviewed with the purpose of identifying clinically relevant themes. MedLine searches were supplemented with manual review of the references in relevant papers. From the extant evidence, consensus-based recommendations for clinical practice were developed. RESULTS: Key issues were identified with regards to the overlap of PDs and mood disorders, including whether certain personality features predispose to mood disorders, whether PDs can reliably be recognized if there is an Axis I disorder present, whether personality disturbances arise as a consequence or are a forme fruste of mood disorders, and whether personality traits or disorders modify treatment responsiveness and outcome of mood disorders. CONCLUSION: This paper describes consensus-based clinical recommendations that arise from a consideration of how signals from the literature can impact clinical practice in the treatment of patients with comorbid mood and personality pathology. Additional treatment studies of patients with the comorbid conditions are required to further inform clinical practice.

On the early left-anterior negativity (ELAN) in syntax studies	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Syntax; Early left-anterior negativity (ELAN); Phrase structure violations; P600; N400; LAN; Blocking effects; Syntax-first models; Baseline problems	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; WORKING-MEMORY; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; GRAMMATICAL VIOLATIONS; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; SEMANTIC PROCESSES; PHRASE STRUCTURE	Within the framework of Friederici's (2002) neurocognitive model of sentence processing, the early left anterior negativity (ELAN) in event-related potentials (ERPs) has been claimed to be a brain marker of syntactic first-pass parsing. As ELAN components seem to be exclusively elicited by word category violations (phrase structure violations), they have been taken as strong empirical support for syntax-first models of sentence processing and have gained considerable impact on psycholinguistic theory in a variety of domains. The present article reviews relevant ELAN studies and raises a number of serious issues concerning the reliability and validity of the findings. We also discuss how baseline problems and contextual factors can contribute to early ERP effects in studies examining word category violations. We conclude that - despite the apparent wealth of ELAN data - the functional significance of these findings remains largely unclear. The present paper does not claim to have falsified the existence of ELANs or syntax-related early frontal negativities. However, by separating facts from myths, the paper attempts to make a constructive contribution to how future ERP research in the area of syntax processing may better advance our understanding of online sentence comprehension.

Methods: A workshop was held prior to the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Conference 2010. The purpose of the workshop was to highlight the unique health issues experienced by women after a TBI, to identify research, education and policy gaps and to develop strategies to promote women's health. Presentations by researchers and consumers as well as large group discussions formed the basis of the recommendations. Results: Twenty researchers, clinicians, consumers and community agency personnel attended from five countries. Significant gaps in service provision in the community were identified as were unique issues for the short-and long-term effects on maturation and ageing, reproductive and sexual health, mental health and life satisfaction. The workshop led to the development of an international task force and recommendations for future directions. Conclusion: Women and girls experience unique outcomes after a TBI. The workshop identified research, policy, education and service priorities for the promotion of health and quality-of-life within this population.

This issue is particularly relevant in view of recent evidence for expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) by a subset of mesencephalic DA neurons in mouse as well as rat. We used immuno-electron microscopy to characterize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-labeled terminals in the core and shell of nucleus accumbens and the neostriatum of two mouse lines in which the Vglut2 gene was selectively disrupted in DA neurons (cKO), their control littermates, and C57BL/6/J wild-type mice, aged P15 or adult. The three regions were also examined in cKO mice and their controls of both ages after dual THVGLUT2 immunolabeling. Irrespective of the region, age and genotype, the TH-immunoreactive varicosities appeared similar in size, vesicular content, percentage with mitochondria, and exceedingly low frequency of synaptic membrane specialization. No dually labeled axon terminals were found at either age in control or in cKO mice. Unless TH and VGLUT2 are segregated in different axon terminals of the same neurons, these results favor the view that the glutamatergic cophenotype of mesencephalic DA neurons is more important during the early development of these neurons than for the establishment of their scarce synaptic connectivity. They also suggest that, in mouse even more than rat, the mesostriatal DA system operates mainly through non-targeted release of DA, diffuse transmission and the maintenance of an ambient DA level.

Levodopa influences striatal activity but does not affect cortical hyper-activity in Parkinson's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						externally-triggered movements; functional MRI; putamen; self-initiated movements; striatum	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CORE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM; BASAL GANGLIA; DOPAMINERGIC MODULATION; NEURAL CIRCUITRY; MOTOR; MOVEMENTS; DEFICITS; TASK; INVOLVEMENT	Motor studies of Parkinsons disease (PD) have shown cortical hypo-activity in relation to nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Cognitive studies also identified increased cortical activity in PD. We have previously suggested that the hypo-activity/hyper-activity patterns observed in PD are related to the striatal contribution. Tasks that recruit the striatum in control participants are associated with cortical hypo-activity in patients with PD, whereas tasks that do not result in cortical hyper-activity. The putamen, a structure affected by the neurodegeneration observed in PD, shows increased activation for externally-triggered (ET) and self-initiated (SI) movements. The first goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of levodopa on the putamens response to ET and SI movements. Our second goal was to assess the effect of levodopa on the hypo-activity/hyper-activity patterns in cortical areas. Patients with PD on and off levodopa and healthy volunteers performed SI, ET and control finger movements during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Healthy participants displayed significant differences in putamen activity in ET and SI movements. These differences were reduced in patients off medication, with non-task-specific increases in activity after levodopa administration. Furthermore, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showed significant increases in activity during SI movements in healthy controls, whereas it was hypo-active in PD. This region showed significantly increased activity during ET movements in patients off medication. Levodopa had no effect on this discrepancy. Our results suggest that dopamine replacement therapy has a non-task-specific effect on motor corticostriatal regions, and support the hypothesis that increases and decreases in cortical activity in PD are related to the mesocortical dopamine pathway imbalance.

In this proposed approach, to set the adaptive threshold of the STEO detector, we derive the relationship between the low-order statistics of its input signal and the ones of its output signal. This relationship is determined with only the background noise component assumed to be present at the input. Robust statistics theory techniques were used to achieve an unbiased estimation of these low-order statistics of the background noise component directly from the neural input signal. In this paper, the emphasis is made on extracellular neural recordings. However, the proposed method can be used in the analysis of different biomedical signals where spikes are important for diagnostic (e.g., ECG, EEG, etc.). We validated the efficacy of the proposed method using synthetic neural signals constructed from real neural recordings signals. Four different sets of extracellular recordings from four distinct neural sources have been exploited to that purpose. The first dataset is recorded from an adult male monkey using the Utath 10 x 10 microelectrode array implemented in the prefrontal cortex, the second one was obtained from the visual cortex of a rat using a stainless-steel-tipped microelectrode, the third dataset came from recording in a human medial lobe using intracranial electrode, and finally, the fourth one was extracted from recordings in a macaque parietal cortex using a single tetrode. Simulation results show that our approach is effective and robust, and outperforms state-of-the-art adaptive detection methods in its category (i.e., efficient and simple, and do not require a priori knowledge about neural spike waveforms shapes).

Pediatric Analgesic Clinical Trial Designs, Measures, and Extrapolation: Report of an FDA Scientific Workshop	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						pain; pediatric; infant; child; neonate; analgesic; clinical trial; placebo	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CORTICAL PAIN RESPONSES; INITIAL VALIDATION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PRETERM INFANTS; MAJOR SURGERY; SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS; MORPHINE REQUIREMENTS; PROCEDURAL PAIN; PROLONGED PAIN	Analgesic trials pose unique scientific, ethical, and practical challenges in pediatrics. Participants in a scientific workshop sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration developed consensus on aspects of pediatric analgesic clinical trial design. The standard parallel-placebo analgesic trial design commonly used for adults has ethical and practical difficulties in pediatrics, due to the likelihood of subjects experiencing pain for extended periods of time. Immediate-rescue designs using opioid-sparing, rather than pain scores, as a primary outcome measure have been successfully used in pediatric analgesic efficacy trials. These designs maintain some of the scientific benefits of blinding, with some ethical and practical advantages over traditional designs. Preferred outcome measures were recommended for each age group. Acute pain trials are feasible for children undergoing surgery. Pharmacodynamic responses to opioids, local anesthetics, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs appear substantially mature by age 2 years. There is currently no clear evidence for analgesic efficacy of acetaminophen or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in neonates or infants younger than 3 months of age. Small sample designs, including cross-over trials and N of 1 trials, for particular pediatric chronic pain conditions and for studies of pain and irritability in pediatric palliative care should be considered. Pediatric analgesic trials can be improved by using innovative study designs and outcome measures specific for children. Multicenter consortia will help to facilitate adequately powered pediatric analgesic trials.

Axonal myelination increases the velocity of nerve impulse propagation. In this work, we present a novel in vitro system for coculturing primary dorsal root ganglia neurons along with myelinating cells on a highly restrictive and micropatterned substrate. In this new coculture system, neurons survive for several weeks, extending long axons On defined Matrigel tracks. On these axons, myelinating cells can achieve robust myelination, as demonstrated by the distribution of compact myelin and nodal markers. Under these conditions, neurites and associated myelinating cells, are easily accessible for studies on the mechanisms of myelin formation and on the effects of axonal damage on myelin sheath.

The primary cause of glaucoma is not known, but several risk factors have been identified, including elevated intraocular pressure and age. Loss of vision in glaucoma is caused by the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that convey visual information from the retina to the brain. Therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying or halting RGC loss, known as neuroprotection, would be valuable to save vision in glaucoma. In this review, we discuss the significant progress that has been made in the use of gene therapy to understand mechanisms underlying RGC degeneration and to promote the survival of these neurons in experimental models of optic nerve injury.

In contrast, when food is delivered under a variable restricted feeding (VRF) schedule, at a new and unpredictable mealtime each day, circadian rhythms in food-anticipatory activity fail to develop. Here, we study the effects of VRF on the daily rhythm of plasma corticosterone and of clock gene expression in the limbic forebrain and dorsal striatum, of rats provided a 2-h access to a complete meal replacement (Ensure Plus) at an unpredictable time each day. VRF schedules varied the mealtimes within the 12 h of light (daytime VRF), the 12 h of dark (nighttime VRF), or across the 24 h light-dark cycle (anytime VRF). Our results show that contrary to the synchronizing effects of predictable restricted feeding, VRF blunts the daily corticosterone rhythm and disrupts daily rhythms of PER2 expression in a region-specific and mealtime-dependent manner.

Predicting Social Functioning in Schizotypy An Investigation of the Relative Contributions of Theory of Mind and Mood	JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE			English	Article						Schizotypy; neurocognition; social cognition; social functioning; depression	CARD SORTING TEST; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COGNITION; DEFICITS; DEPRESSION; PSYCHOSIS; MEDIATOR; SYMPTOMATOLOGY; COMPREHENSION; RECOGNITION	Theory of mind (ToM) is an aspect of social cognition that refers to the ability to make inferences about the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of other people. It is believed to be related to social functioning. Previous investigations of ToM in schizotypy have yielded mixed results. Using a correlational approach, the present study explored the relationship between schizotypal traits, ToM, neurocognition, depressed mood, and social functioning in a sample of 50 undergraduate students. Schizotypy was related to poor social functioning. Contrary to predictions, schizotypal traits were not associated with impaired ToM. In fact, schizotypal traits were associated with enhanced performance on a ToM task that involved detection of ironic statements. However, strong relationships emerged among schizotypy, depressed mood, and social functioning, highlighting the need to also examine depression when assessing the relations between elevated schizotypy and poor social functioning.

This first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of GRN1005 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients in sequential cohorts (one patient per cohort until grade 2 toxicity, then 3+3 design) received intravenous GRN1005 at escalating doses between 30 and 700 mg/m(2) once in every 21 days. In the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion group, patients were required to have brain metastases. Fifty-six patients received GRN1005, including 41 with brain metastases (median number of prior therapies 4). MTD was 650 mg/m(2); the main dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. Sixteen of 20 patients dosed at the MTD had brain metastases. Pharmacokinetics was dose linear and the mean terminal-phase elimination half-life was 3.6 hours. No evidence of accumulation was observed after repeat dosing. No anti-GRN1005 antibodies were detected. Five of the 20 patients (25%) dosed at 650 mg/m(2) (MTD), three of whom had previous taxane therapy, achieved an overall partial response (breast, n = 2; non-small cell lung cancer, n 2; and ovarian cancer, n = 1); responses in all five patients were also accompanied by shrinkage of brain lesions (-17% to -50%). In addition, six patients (11%; doses 30-700 mg/m(2)) experienced stable disease that lasted 4 months or more. GRN1005 was well tolerated and showed activity in heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors, including those who had brain metastases and/or failed prior taxane therapy.

STUDY DESIGN: We developed and validated an automated method to quantify global and regional in vivo brain volumes using fetal magnetic resonance imaging. We then computed the percentage of growth for each brain structure in a cohort of 64 healthy fetuses (25.4-36.6 weeks' gestational age). RESULTS: The cerebellum demonstrated the greatest maturation rate, with a 4-fold increase (384%) in volume between 25.4 and 36.6 weeks, and a relative growth rate of 12.87% per week. Both total brain and cerebral volumes increased by 230% and brain stem volume by 134% over the same gestational age period. Conversely, lateral ventricular volume decreased by 4.18% per week. CONCLUSION: The availability and ongoing validation of normative fetal brain growth trajectories will provide important tools for early detection of impaired fetal brain growth upon which to manage high-risk pregnancies.

Yet most of our knowledge of neuronal receptive fields has come from studies using simple artificial stimuli (e.g., bars, gratings) that may fail to reveal the full nature of a neuron's actual response properties. Our goal was to compare the utility of artificial and natural stimuli for estimating receptive field (RF) models. Using extracellular recordings from simple type cells in cat A18, we acquired responses to three types of broadband stimulus ensembles: two widely used artificial patterns (white noise and short bars), and natural images. We used a primary dataset to estimate the spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) with two hold-back datasets for regularization and validation. STRFs were estimated using an iterative regression algorithm with regularization and subsequently fit with a zero-memory nonlinearity. Each RF model (STRF and zero-memory nonlinearity) was then used in simulations to predict responses to the same stimulus type used to estimate it, as well as to other broadband stimuli and sinewave gratings. White noise stimuli often elicited poor responses leading to noisy RF estimates, while short bars and natural image stimuli were more successful in driving A 18 neurons and producing clear RF estimates with strong predictive ability. Natural image-derived RF models were the most robust at predicting responses to other broadband stimulus ensembles that were not used in their estimation and also provided good predictions of tuning curves for sinewave gratings.

Methods: Twenty-two patients (mean age 37.6 y old) that had sustained a thoracolumbar burst fracture were included in this study. On admission, 20 patients (90.9%) had an incomplete neurological deficit. An anterior thoracolumbar approach was used to perform anterior corpectomy and reconstruction with a mesh cage and lateral fixation with screws and dual rods. We studied the operation date and delayed the blood loss, and we used the American Spinal Injury Association grade to evaluate the neurological status before surgery and in the follow-up period. Local kyphosis measured by the Cobb method was compared before and after the surgery using Wilcoxon signed-rank test/2-tailed test for analysis. Results: Ninety percent of patients were operated within 2 days after admission and all were followed for a minimum of 25 months. The mean follow-up period was 47.4 months (range, 25 to 71 mo). Blood loss averaged 1445 mL. Of the 20 patients with incomplete neurological lesions, there were 6 (30%) patients with an improvement of at least 1 American Spinal Injury Association grade. No neurological deterioration was observed in any case. The local kyphosis measured by the Cobb method was improved from a mean of 15 degrees preoperative to a mean of 9.6 degrees in early postoperative period (P = 0.002). The mean after 2 years was 11.5 degrees (P = 0.011). There was no instrumentation failure. Conclusions: Anterior thoracolumbar decompression and fusion secured with an anterior mesh cage and instrumentation in thoracolumbar burst fractures provided excellent immediate reduction of post-traumatic local kyphosis.

They are often disabling, and can create problems in everyday life and can mask, or reveal, an organic or psychiatric illness. Such behaviours are often chronic and more than one may be present in the same individual. This is further complicated by the fact that parents often do not seek help for the problem, perhaps believing that it is due to the child's disability and cannot be treated. The present review describes some general concepts dealing with the management of behaviour disorders commonly seen in children and youth with an intellectual disability, and gives a high level overview of behaviours commonly problematic in this patient population including sleep disturbances, agitated and aggressive behaviours, and self-injury behaviour. In general, while pharmacological treatment is possible, behavioural intervention is a more effective and better tolerated form of treatment.

Hormones and Cognitive Functioning During Late Pregnancy and Postpartum: A Longitudinal Study	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						pregnancy; postpartum; cognition; steroid hormones; prolactin	POSTNATAL DEPRESSION SCALE; WORKING-MEMORY; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; REPRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE; REPLACEMENT THERAPY; STEROID-HORMONES; EXPLICIT MEMORY; YOUNG-WOMEN; SHORT-TERM; CORTISOL	This longitudinal study investigated the possible influence of estradiol (E-2), progesterone (P), testosterone (T), cortisol (CURT), and prolactin (PRL) levels on cognitive functioning during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period. The performance of 55 pregnant women on a battery of neuropsychological tests, tested once during the third trimester of pregnancy and once during the early postpartum period, was compared with that of 21 nonpregnant controls matched for age and education. Women in the pregnancy group had significantly lower scores than the controls during both the pre- and postpartum visits on tasks of verbal recall and processing speed. CURT levels were significantly associated, in an inverted-boolean OR function, with verbal recall scores at both the pregnancy and at postpartum periods and with spatial abilities at postpartum only. During pregnancy, PRL levels were associated in both a linear and an inverted-boolean OR function with scores on tests of paragraph recall and in a linear function with scores on tests of executive function. At postpartum, E-2 and CORT were negatively associated in a linear fashion with attention scores. These findings provide new evidence that fluctuating hormone levels during late pregnancy and early postpartum may modulate selected cognitive abilities.

First, performance on tests of verbal memory fluctuates in concert with physiological changes in ovarian hormone production during the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Estrogen therapy (ET) prevents the decrease in verbal memory when administered immediately following the surgical removal of both ovaries in premenopausal women. Some, but relatively little evidence is available to support the idea that ET, initiated at the time of a natural or a surgical menopause for a few years, may protect against cognitive decline 30 years later and more research in this area is urgently needed. Finally, the evidence to date strongly suggests that the initiation of ET decades after the menopause has occurred does not protect against cognitive decline or dementia. Taken together, these findings support the so-called "window of opportunity" hypothesis which holds that ET will be neuroprotective only when administered closely in time to a natural or surgical menopause.

We report here on the dangerous consequences of interrupting PPI therapy. METHODS: We describe 2 ZES patients in whom interruption of PPI treatment for diagnostic evaluation generated severe health complications. RESULTS: Less than 48 hours after stopping PPIs, patient 1 developed multiple strictures of the esophagus caused by massive vomiting of gastric acid, and patient 2 presented with severe abdominal pain with intestinal microperforation from duodenal ulcers. Because of persistent gastrin stimulatory drive and because of the abolition of reflex protective defense mechanisms against gastric acid hypersecretion during PPI treatment, patients with ZES under PPI therapy are exposed to severe peptic complications when facing rebound acid secretion at the interruption of their antisecretory treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PPI treatment interruption has dangerous consequences, and PPI therapy always should be maintained in patients known or suspected of ZES. Diagnostic evaluations should be performed under PPI protection.

A multicenter pilot study of subcallosal cingulate area deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						deep brain stimulation; depression; mood disorder; psychiatry; cingulate gyrus; subgenual cingulate	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BLOOD-FLOW; DISORDERS; PREDICTORS; METABOLISM; SADNESS; MOOD	Object. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been recently investigated as a treatment for major depression. One of the proposed targets for this application is the subcallosal cingulate gyms (SCG). To date, promising results after SCG DBS have been reported by a single center. In the present study the authors investigated whether these findings may be replicated at different institutions. They conducted a 3-center prospective open-label trial of SCG DBS for 12 months in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Methods. Twenty-one patients underwent implantation of bilateral SCG electrodes. The authors examined the reduction in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) score from baseline (RESP50). Results. Patients treated with SCG DBS had an RESP50 of 57% at 1 month, 48% at 6 months, and 29% at 12 months. The response rate after 12 months of DBS, however, increased to 62% when defined as a reduction in the baseline HRSD-17 of 40% or more. Reductions in depressive symptomatology were associated with amelioration in disease severity in patients who responded to surgery. Conclusions. Overall, findings from this study corroborate the results of previous reports showing that outcome of SCG DBS may be replicated across centers.

This statement is also true for research laboratories working in the field of nutrition and aging. In addition to diets that can reduce the life expectancy of rodents, such as diabetogenic or high-fat diets, genetically modified rodents exhibiting different accelerated age-associated diseases also provide important biologic tools to decipher the impact of drugs, nutrients, or phytoactive compounds on their health and life span. This review covers some of the chemicals believed to decelerate the appearance of age-related diseases in different rodent models. Such chemicals include antioxidants, anti-inflammatory molecules, modulators of metabolic sensors, calorie restriction mimetics, and vegetal polyphenolic compounds that affect mitochondrial functions, cellular proliferation or differentiation as well as cell functionality.

The variability in brain morphology and the difference in intensity characteristics due to imaging sequences make the development of a general purpose brain extraction algorithm challenging. To address this issue, we propose a new robust method (BEaST) dedicated to produce consistent and accurate brain extraction. This method is based on nonlocal segmentation embedded in a multi-resolution framework. A library of 80 priors is semi-automatically constructed from the NIH-sponsored MRI study of normal brain development, the International Consortium for Brain Mapping, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative databases. In testing, a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9834 +/- 0.0053 was obtained when performing leave-one-out cross validation selecting only 20 priors from the library. Validation using the online Segmentation Validation Engine resulted in a top ranking position with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.9781 +/- 0.0047. Robustness of BEaST is demonstrated on all baseline ADNI data, resulting in a very low failure rate. The segmentation accuracy of the method is better than two widely used publicly available methods and recent state-of-the-art hybrid approaches. BEaST provides results comparable to a recent label fusion approach, while being 40 times faster and requiring a much smaller library of priors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Morphology-based hypothesis testing in discrete random fields: A non-parametric method to address the multiple-comparison problem in neuroimaging (vol 56, pg 1954, 2011)	NEUROIMAGE			English	Correction							FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; PERMUTATION; INFERENCE; INTENSITY; IMAGES; EXTENT; BRAIN; VOXEL	A new method for detecting activations in random fields, which may be useful for addressing the issue of multiple comparisons in neuroimaging, is presented. This method is based on some constructs of mathematical morphology - specifically, morphological erosions and dilations - that enable the detection of active regions in random fields possessing moderate activation levels and relatively large spatial extension, which may not be detected by the standard methods that control the family-wise error rate. The method presented here permits an appropriate control of the false positive errors, without having to adjust any threshold values, other than the significance level. The method is easily adapted to permutation-based procedures (with the usual restrictions), and therefore does not require strong assumptions about the distribution and spatio-temporal correlation structure of the data. Some examples of applications to synthetic data, including realistic fMRI simulations, as well as to real fMRI and electroencephalographic data are presented, illustrating the power of the presented technique. Comparisons with other methods that combine voxel intensity and cluster size, as well as some extensions of the method presented here based on their basic ideas are presented as well.

In the last 19 years, the psychopharmacological treatment of aggression has changed dramatically because of the introduction of atypical antipsychotics into the market and the increased use of anticonvulsants and lithium in the treatment of aggressive patients. Using a translational medicine approach, this review (part 1 of 2) examines the neurobiology of aggression, discussing the major neurotransmitter systems implicated in its pathogenesis, namely, serotonin, glutamate, norepinephrine, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, and also their respective receptors. The preclinical and clinical pharmacological studies concerning the role of these neurotransmitters have been reviewed, as well as research using transgenic animal models. The complex interaction among these neurotransmitters occurs at the level of brain areas and neural circuits such as the orbitoprefrontal cortex, anterior cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, and septal nuclei, where the receptors of these neurotransmitters are expressed. The neurobiological mechanism of aggression is important to understand the rationale for using atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and lithium in treating aggressive behavior. Further research is necessary to establish how these neurotransmitter systems interact with brain circuits to control aggressive behavior at the intracellular level.

We report here that coadministration of the P-gp and BCRP inhibitor ketoconazole with risperidone may preferentially increase D2 receptor occupancy in the striatum compared to pituitary. Four male patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had received at least 4 prior injections of the long-acting risperidone at a stable dose of 25 to 50 mg participated in this positron emission tomography study. Multiple-dose ketoconazole coadministration reduced the P-gp activity as shown by fexofenadine oral challenge. Importantly, we found a strong statistical trend in this sample of 4 subjects who consistently showed a decrease in striatal fluorine 18 ((18)F)-fallypride binding (an indication of increased D2 receptor occupancy) after ketoconazole coadministration (P = 0.057), whereas the pituitary (a region that lies outside the BBB) (18)F-fallypride binding did not change (P = 0.99). These observations warrant further research with selective drug transporter inhibitors. We suggest that in neuroimaging studies, the pituitary drug occupancy can serve as a useful new "positive control'' to evaluate whether drug occupancy is preferentially increased in brain regions that fall inside the BBB after cotreatment with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors. This is a noteworthy study design consideration regarding the future clinical testing of novel adjunct interventions aimed at modulating membrane transporter function at the BBB, with the goal of augmenting drug access into the brain compartment, particularly in treatment-resistant psychiatric illness.

Data Sources: A thorough search for English-language publications and "in-process" articles dating from 1948 to January 2011 was performed using Ovid MEDLINE. Study Selection: The principal criteria were patients with no microsurgical intervention before their treatment, a follow-up of at least 5 years, and a useful hearing level at diagnosis. Data Extraction: Fourteen studies met our criteria. Hearing preservation outcome (worse, unchanged, and better) and tumor size outcome (growth, unchanged, and regression) data were collected from the articles, as well as all other significant observations. No studies using fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy met our criteria. Stereotactic radiation was the only radiation therapy analyzed. Data Synthesis: The data were analyzed using the Pearson chi(2) test. Conclusion: Current data on conservative management and stereotactic radiation do not provide enough evidence to make a clear conclusion on the outcome of useful hearing preservation in a long-term manner. In this study, however, stereotactic radiation is shown to have better tumor control rates than conservative management. Additional studies reporting long-term follow-ups of patients are required so as to provide the medical field with a better understanding of vestibular schwannoma treatment therapies.

We tested the effect of altering glycine signaling in zebrafish embryos by overexpressing the potassium-chloride co-transporter type 2 (KCC2) to reverse the chloride gradient or by blocking glycine receptors with strychnine or by selectively knocking down the embryonic glycine receptor (GlyR KD). Using a variety of markers we observed in all three cases a reduction of all types of spinal interneuron populations examined, indicating that glycine modulates their overall differentiation rather than choice of cell fate. Other cell populations (motor, sensory, and glial cells) were unaffected. As glycine appeared to act preceding neural and synaptic development, we examined the bandoneon (beo) mutant in which glycine receptors are functional but not clustered at synapses. Neural populations in beo embryos appeared normal, suggesting a paracrine action of circulating glycine in promoting interneuron differentiation. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The adult rat offspring of mothers exhibiting increased levels of pup licking/grooming (LG; High LG mothers), compared to those reared by Low LG dams, show increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression, complex dendritic tree structure, and an enhanced capacity for synaptic potentiation. However, these data were derived from studies using the total amount of maternal care directed toward the entire litter, thus ignoring possible within-litter variation. We show that the amount of LG received by individual pups within a litter varies considerably. Therefore, we questioned if the amount of LG received by individual pups correlates with and thus putatively predicts later hippocampal structure and function. To this end, LG-scores were determined during the first postnatal week for all pups in 32 litters and correlated with neuroendocrine and hippocampal parameters in young-adulthood. Pup LG-score positively correlated with the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in the adult hippocampus. Moreover, the ability to induce synaptic potentiation in the dentate gyrus in vitro was enhanced in animals with high LG-scores. Structural plasticity correlated less reliably with LG-scores early in life and differed between sexes. Male offspring with high LG-scores displayed fewer newborn neurons, higher brain derived neurotrophic factor expression and tended to have more complex granule cell dendritic trees. We conclude that even moderate variations in early life environment have a major impact on adult hippocampal function. This principle could provide a mechanistic basis for individual differences in susceptibility to psychopathology. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, it remains unclear how long-term, chronic MJ use alters reward-based decision-making. In the present study, using [O-15] water PET imaging, we measured brain activity in chronic MJ users, who underwent monitored abstinence from MJ for approximately 24 h before imaging, and control participants, while they took part in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a monetary decision making task that strongly relies on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). During PET imaging, participants took part in the standard and a variant version of the IGT as well as a control task. Chronic MJ users performed equally well on the standard IGT, but significantly worse than controls on the variant IGT. Chronic MJ users and control subjects showed increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the vmPFC on both versions of the IGT compared to the control task. In the two-group comparison, chronic MJ users showed significantly greater rCBF than controls in the vmPFC on the standard IGT and greater activity in the cerebellum on both versions of the IGT. Furthermore, duration of use, but not age of first use, was associated with greater activity in the vmPFC. Thus, chronic MJ users tend to strongly recruit neural circuitry involved in decision-making and reward processing (vmPFC), and probabilistic learning (cerebellum) when performing the IGT.

The main objective of this study was to investigate a possible noradrenergic contribution to AMPH-induced calling. Adult male Long-Evans rats were tested with AMPH (1 mg/kg intraperitoneal) or saline combined with various systemic pretreatments: clonidine (alpha 2 adrenergic agonist), prazosin (alpha 1 antagonist), atipamezole (alpha 2 antagonist), propranolol, betaxolol, and/or ICI 118,551 (beta 1/beta 2, beta 1, and beta 2 antagonists, respectively), nadolol (beta 1/beta 2 antagonist, peripheral only), or NAD-299 (5HT(1A) antagonist). In addition, effects of cirazoline (alpha 1 adrenergic agonist) and cocaine (0.25-1.5 mg/kg intravenous) were studied alone. AMPH-induced calling was suppressed by low-dose clonidine and prazosin. Cirazoline and atipamezole did not significantly affect calling rate. Propranolol, without affecting the call rate, dose dependently promoted 'flat' calls under AMPH while suppressing 'trills,' thus reversing the effects of AMPH on the 'call subtype profile.' This effect of propranolol seemed to be mediated by simultaneous inhibition of CNS beta 1 and beta 2 rather than by 5HT(1A) receptors. Finally, cocaine elicited fewer calls than did AMPH, but produced the same shift in the call subtype profile. Taken together, these results reveal differential drug effects on flat vs trill vs other FM 50-kHz calls. These findings highlight the value of detailed call subtype analyses, and show that 50-kHz calls are associated with adrenergic alpha 1- and beta-receptor mechanisms. These preclinical findings suggest that noradrenergic contributions to psychostimulant subjective effects may warrant further investigation.

We used anatomical magnetic resonance imaging surface-based morphometry in 21 male children (FXS N = 11 and age [2.27-13.3] matched controls [C] N = 10). We found (1) increased whole hemispheric and lobar cortical volume, cortical thickness and cortical complexity bilaterally, yet insignificant changes in hemispheric surface area and gyrification index in FXS compared to C: (2) linear regression analyses revealed significant negative correlations between CM and cognition; (3) significant CM differences between FXS and FXS + Aut associated with their distinctive behavioral phenotypes. These findings are critical in understanding the neuropathophysiology of one of the most common intellectual deficiency syndromes associated with altered cognition as they provide human in vivo information about genetic control of CM and cognition.

Axonal loss is the underlying cause of permanent neurological deficits in MS and it is thought to arise from a combination of immune-mediated axonal damage and the loss of trophic support to axons from myelin sheaths after demyelination. Prevention of oligodendroglial damage or death and demyelination are therefore attractive neuroprotective treatment strategies. However, a better understanding of mechanisms leading to oligodendroglial damage and demyelination is a prerequisite for the development of such treatment options. Here, we demonstrate that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), the most potent member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family is expressed in oligodendrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Increased expression of XIAP is associated with protection against selected cell death pathways, whereas decreased expression increases oligodendroglial cell death in vitro. However, lack of XIAP does not modulate oligodendroglial cell death in toxic demyelination in vivo. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The present study tested the hypothesis that an analogous paradigm was prevalent for ventricular fibroblasts. In the neonatal rat heart, nestin protein levels were significantly higher than the adult heart and the isolation of cardiac cells revealed a selective expression in ventricular fibroblasts. In adult ventricular fibroblasts, nestin protein expression was markedly lower compared to neonatal ventricular fibroblasts. Following ischemic damage to the rat heart, nestin staining was detected in a subpopulation of scar myofibroblasts (37%) and the percentage of immunoreactive cells was greater than adult ventricular fibroblasts (7%) but significantly lower than neonatal ventricular fibroblasts (86%). Moreover, dissimilar rates of 3H-thymidine uptake were observed among the fibroblast populations and may be related in part to the disparate percentage of nestin(+) cells. To assess the role of nestin in DNA synthesis, neonatal ventricular fibroblasts were infected with a lentivirus containing a shRNAmir directed against the intermediate filament protein. The partial depletion of nestin expression in neonatal ventricular fibroblasts significantly reduced basal DNA synthesis, in the absence of an apoptotic response. Thus, postnatal development of the rat heart was associated with a selective loss of nestin expression in ventricular fibroblasts and subsequent induction in a subpopulation of myofibroblasts following ischemic injury. The re-expression of nestin in scar myofibroblasts may represent an adaptive response to enhance their proliferative rate and accelerate the healing process. J. Cell. Physiol. 227: 813820, 2012.

Cachexia and protein-energy wasting in children with chronic kidney disease	PEDIATRIC NEPHROLOGY			English	Review						Protein energy wasting; Cachexia; Pediatric; Growth failure; Renal failure	CHRONIC-RENAL-FAILURE; PLASMA GHRELIN LEVELS; SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS; PERITONEAL-DIALYSIS PATIENTS; SUBJECTIVE GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; UREMIA-ASSOCIATED CACHEXIA; BODY-MASS INDEX; HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; MUSCLE MASS; MAINTENANCE HEMODIALYSIS	Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for "cachexia" or "protein-energy wasting" (PEW). These terms describe a pathophysiologic process resulting in the loss of muscle, with or without loss of fat, and involving maladaptive responses, including anorexia and elevated metabolic rate. PEW has been defined specifically in relation to CKD. We review the diagnostic criteria for cachexia and PEW in CKD and consider the limitations and applicability of these criteria to children with CKD. In addition, we present an overview of the manifestations and mechanisms of cachexia and PEW. A host of pathogenetic factors are considered, including systemic inflammation, endocrine perturbations, and abnormal neuropeptide signaling, as well as poor nutritional intake. Mortality risk, which is 100- to 200-fold higher in patients with end-stage renal disease than in the general population, is strongly correlated with the components of cachexia/PEW. Further research into the causes and consequences of wasting and growth retardation is needed in order to improve the survival and quality of life for children with CKD.

Patients with GI involvement have impaired quality of life, and their prognosis may be one of severe impairment. Unfortunately, GI involvement is often noticed when severe complications have already occurred, is irreversible, and is difficult to manage. The past 2 to 3 years have been rich in exciting studies that we hope will help identify, prevent, treat, and monitor disease progression. Recent studies on the pathophysiology of GI tract disease could lead to advances in the treatment of GI tract involvement. The importance of treating gastroesophageal reflux (GER) has been reinforced by studies showing GER damage in almost all SSc patients, and the fact that GER damage is reversible if early treatment with proton pump inhibitors is introduced. Moreover, recent data showing a link between GER and interstitial lung disease in SSc underscore the importance of aggressive GER treatment in SSc patients. A novel lung pattern possibly related to GER also has been described. New, exciting data on gastric vascular antral ectasia have been published. Finally, malnutrition in SSc patients has been highlighted, and anorectal involvement has been emphasized.

This may be the result of several factors: the systems are developed from a technical perspective, are rarely evaluated in the field, and/or lack consideration of the end user and the constraints of the OR. We introduce the Data, Visualization processing, View (DVV) taxonomy which defines each of the major components required to implement a mixed reality IGS system. We propose that these components be considered and used as validation criteria for introducing a mixed reality IGS system into the OR. A taxonomy of IGS visualization systems is a step toward developing a common language that will help developers and end users discuss and understand the constituents of a mixed reality visualization system, facilitating a greater presence of future systems in the OR. We evaluate the DVV taxonomy based on its goodness of fit and completeness. We demonstrate the utility of the DVV taxonomy by classifying 17 state-of-the-art research papers in the domain of mixed reality visualization IGS systems. Our classification shows that few IGS visualization systems' components have been validated and even fewer are evaluated.	[Kersten-Oertel, Marta; Collins, D.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and Purkinje cell loss in autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Drp1; neurodegenerative disease; neuromuscular disease; Parkinson's disease	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; PROTEIN SACSIN; FISSION; FUSION; MORPHOLOGY; MITOPHAGY; APOPTOSIS; SYNAPSES	Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a childhood-onset neurological disease resulting frommutations in the SACS gene encoding sacsin, a 4,579-aa protein of unknown function. Originally identified as a founder disease in Quebec, ARSACS is now recognized worldwide. Prominent features include pyramidal spasticity and cerebellar ataxia, but the underlying pathology and pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown. We have generated an animal model for ARSACS, sacsin knockout mice, that display age dependent neurodegeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells. To explore the pathophysiological basis for this observation, we examined the cell biological properties of sacsin. We show that sacsin localizes to mitochondria in non-neuronal cells and primary neurons and that it interacts with dynamin-related protein 1, which participates in mitochondrial fission. Fibroblasts from ARSACS patients show a hyperfused mitochondrial network, consistent with defects in mitochondrial fission. Sacsin knockdown leads to an overly interconnected and functionally impaired mitochondrial network, and mitochondria accumulate in the soma and proximal dendrites of sacsin knockdown neurons. Disruption of mitochondrial transport into dendrites has been shown to lead to abnormal dendritic morphology, and we observe striking alterations in the organization of dendritic fields in the cerebellum of knockout mice that precedes Purkinje cell death. Our data identifies mitochondrial dysfunction/mislocalization as the likely cellular basis for ARSACS and indicates a role for sacsin in regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.

Transport of therapeutic peptides through this highly protective physiological barrier remains a challenge for peptide drug delivery into the central nervous system (CNS). Because the most common strategy to treat moderate to severe pain consists of the activation of opioid receptors in the brain, the development of active opioid peptide analogues as potential analgesics requires compounds with a high resistance to enzymatic degradation and an ability to cross the BBB. Results: Herein we report that tetrapeptide analogues of the type H-Dmt(1)-Xxx(2)-Yyy(3)-Gly(4)-NH2 are transported into the brain after intravenous and subcutaneous administration and are able to activate the mu- and delta opioid receptors more efficiently and over longer periods of time than morphine. Using the hot water tail flick test as the animal model for antinociception, a comparison in potency is presented between a side chain conformationally constrained analogue containing the benzazepine ring (BVD03, Yyy(3): Aba), and a "ring opened" analogue (BVD02, Yyy(3): Phe). The results show that in addition to the increased lipophilicity through amide bond N-methylation, the conformational constraint introduced at the level of the Phe(3) side chain causes a prolonged antinociception. Further replacement of NMe-D-Ala(2) by D-Arg(2) in the tetrapeptide sequence led to an improved potency as demonstrated by a higher and maintained antinociception for AN81 (Xxx(2): D-Arg) vs. BVD03 (Xxx(2): NMe-D-Ala). A daily injection of the studied opioid ligands over a time period of 5 days did however result in a substantial decrease in antinociception on the fifth day of the experiment. The compact opioid agonist - NK1 antagonist hybrid SBCHM01 could not circumvent opioid induced tolerance. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the introduction of a conformational constraint has an important impact on opioid receptor activation and subsequent antinociception in vivo. Further amino acid substitution allowed to identify AN81 as an opioid ligand able to access the CNS and induce antinociception at very low doses (0.1 mg/kg) over a time period up to 7 hours.

Seeing Emotion with Your Ears: Emotional Prosody Implicitly Guides Visual Attention to Faces	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AFFECT DECISION TASK; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; TIME-COURSE; ANGRY PROSODY; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; MEANINGLESS SPEECH; CROSSMODAL BINDING; FUNCTIONAL MRI	Interpersonal communication involves the processing of multimodal emotional cues, particularly facial expressions (visual modality) and emotional speech prosody (auditory modality) which can interact during information processing. Here, we investigated whether the implicit processing of emotional prosody systematically influences gaze behavior to facial expressions of emotion. We analyzed the eye movements of 31 participants as they scanned a visual array of four emotional faces portraying fear, anger, happiness, and neutrality, while listening to an emotionally-inflected pseudo-utterance (Someone migged the pazing) uttered in a congruent or incongruent tone. Participants heard the emotional utterance during the first 1250 milliseconds of a five-second visual array and then performed an immediate recall decision about the face they had just seen. The frequency and duration of first saccades and of total looks in three temporal windows ([0-1250 ms], [1250-2500 ms], [2500-5000 ms]) were analyzed according to the emotional content of faces and voices. Results showed that participants looked longer and more frequently at faces that matched the prosody in all three time windows (emotion congruency effect), although this effect was often emotion-specific (with greatest effects for fear). Effects of prosody on visual attention to faces persisted over time and could be detected long after the auditory information was no longer present. These data imply that emotional prosody is processed automatically during communication and that these cues play a critical role in how humans respond to related visual cues in the environment, such as facial expressions.

These results identified a localized difference but did not reveal which cortex (entorhinal, perirhinal, or parahippocampal), if any, was predominantly affected. So. the parahippocampal gyrus was manually segmented and grey matter volumes from the three cortices were compared between 42 non-remitted and 17 remitted patients with a first episode of schizophrenia (FES). Remission was defined as mild or less on eight key symptoms and maintained for 6 consecutive months following the 2005 consensus definition. The non-remitted patients displayed smaller volumes in the parahippocampal cortex - trend-level difference on the left [mm(3), mean (S.D.): non-remitted = 2486 (413); remitted = 2775 (593)] and significant difference on the right [mm(3), mean (S.D.): non-remitted = 2546 (463); remitted = 2926 (525)]. No notable differences were found in the entorhinal or perirhinal cortices. This result supported our VBM finding of reduced parahippocampal grey matter bilaterally in non-remitted patients and further suggested differences may be selectively limited to the parahippocampal cortex. A smaller parahippocampal cortex may represent a neural marker in FES patients who do not achieve remission after 1 year of treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Functional analysis of missense variants in the TRESK (KCNK18) K+ channel	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC MIGRAINE; CORTICAL SPREADING DEPRESSION; DOMAIN POTASSIUM CHANNELS; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MUTATIONS; EXPRESSION; HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY; NEUROBIOLOGY; MECHANISM; EPILEPSY	A loss of function mutation in the TRESK K2P potassium channel (KCNK18), has recently been linked with typical familial migraine with aura. We now report the functional characterisation of additional TRESK channel missense variants identified in unrelated patients. Several variants either had no apparent functional effect, or they caused a reduction in channel activity. However, the C110R variant was found to cause a complete loss of TRESK function, yet is present in both sporadic migraine and control cohorts, and no variation in KCNK18 copy number was found. Thus despite the previously identified association between loss of TRESK channel activity and migraine in a large multigenerational pedigree, this finding indicates that a single non-functional TRESK variant is not alone sufficient to cause typical migraine and highlights the genetic complexity of this disorder.

EXPRESSION AND LOCALIZATION OF THE CANNABINOID RECEPTOR TYPE 1 AND THE ENZYME FATTY ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE IN THE RETINA OF VERVET MONKEYS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						endocannabinoids; cannabinoid receptor CB1; fatty acid amide hydrolase; monkey retina; immunohistochemistry; confocal microscopy	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; AII-AMACRINE CELLS; GANGLION-CELLS; CB1 RECEPTORS; RAT RETINA; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; TIME-COURSE; NEURONS; BRAIN	The presence of a widespread endocannabinoid (eCB) system within the nervous system, including the retina, has been demonstrated in recent years. Expression patterns of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) and enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) are available for rodents, but data for humans and monkeys are scarce. We, therefore, thoroughly examined the distribution pattern of CB1R and FAAH throughout the retina of the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus sabeus) using confocal microscopy. Our results demonstrate that CB1R and FAAH are expressed throughout the retina, from the foveal pit to the far periphery. CB1R and FAAH are present in the photoreceptor, outer plexiform, inner nuclear, inner plexiform, and retinal ganglion cell layers (PRL, OPL, INL, IPL, and RGCL, respectively). More specifically, in PRL, CB1R and FAAH are preferentially expressed in cones of the central retina. In OPL, these two components of the eCB system are concentrated not only in the cone pedicles but also in rod spherules with, however, a less intense staining pattern. Triple-labeling immunofluorescence revealed that both cone and rod bipolar cells express CB1R and FAAH. Heavy staining is detected in RGC somas and axons. Neither CB1R nor FAAH are found in the retinal glia, the Muller cells. These data indicate that the eCB system is present throughout the primate retina and is ideally positioned to modulate central and peripheral retinal functions. (C) 2011 IBRO.

ROLE OF SEX IN THE NEUROCHEMICAL AND NEUROENDOCRINE CORRELATES OF PAW PREFERENCE IN THE RAT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						handedness; sex differences; monoamines; bilateral effects; corticolimbic; ACTH	LEFT-HANDEDNESS; SALIVARY TESTOSTERONE; LATERALIZED BEHAVIOR; DOPAMINE ASYMMETRIES; MACACA-MULATTA; MICE; BRAIN; HAND; DOGS; DEMENTIA	Handedness in humans and paw preference (PP) in rodents have been associated with neural and physiological correlates, which frequently appear to be sex-specific. The present study examines sex differences in the effects of differential PP on post mortem measures of regional monoamine activity in adult Long-Evans rats. The effects of PP on neuroendocrine function were also assessed by measuring plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in response to a 30-min restraint stress. Most rats showed strong individual PP. Males (n=27) and females (n=26) did not differ in the direction or strength of their PP with nearly equal numbers of left and right-pawed rats. However, many Sex x PP interactions were noted in regional neurochemical measures, and most effects of PP were bilateral in nature and sex-specific. In males, Left PP (relative to Right PP) was associated with reduced striatal dopamine (DA) levels and amygdala DA metabolism bilaterally. In females, Left PP was associated with a bilateral upregulation of DAergic metabolism in both prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, increased amygdala serotonin metabolism, and a (right) unilateral increase in amygdala DA. As in previous studies, some correlations were also noted between PP and asymmetrical or unilateral monoamine measures. As well, rats with strong PP, independent of direction or sex, had lower basal ACTH and more robust stress responses than rats with weak PP, suggesting a possible adaptive advantage to strong lateralization. Overall, sex differences were found only regarding effects of the direction of PP, not its magnitude. The findings suggest that the direction of PP affects distinct bilateral networks of structures sex-dependently. Such fundamental influences of PP on functional brain organization have implications for a wide array of processes under monoaminergic modulation in these brain regions, and may further our understanding of the numerous human examples of gender and handedness interactions across several modalities.

These shifts of the peaks of tuning curves may be in the attractive or repulsive direction in relation to the adapter orientation. In anesthetized cats, we recorded evoked electrical responses from the visual cortex in a conventional manner. The recorded spikes in cortex may present two typical waveforms: regular spikes or fast spikes. However, there is no evidence whether the shapes of spikes are related to the attractive or repulsive shifts of orientation tuning curves of cells. Our results show that after adaptation the recorded cells with both attractive and repulsive shifts display one or the other shape of spike. However, the magnitude of shifts is systematically higher for regular spikes, which is attributed to putative pyramidal cells, whereas tuning curves for fast spikes have smaller magnitudes and are evoked by putative interneurons.

Genome Sequencing of Pediatric Medulloblastoma Links Catastrophic DNA Rearrangements with TP53 Mutations	CELL			English	Article							LI-FRAUMENI-SYNDROME; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; COPY-NUMBER; FAMILIAL SYNDROME; TELOMERE LENGTH; SONIC HEDGEHOG; BREAST-CANCER; GENE; DISTINCT; GERMLINE	Genomic rearrangements are thought to occur progressively during tumor development. Recent findings, however, suggest an alternative mechanism, involving massive chromosome rearrangements in a one-step catastrophic event termed chromothripsis. We report the whole-genome sequencing-based analysis of a Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), uncovering massive, complex chromosome rearrangements. Integrating TP53 status with microarray and deep sequencing-based DNA rearrangement data in additional patients reveals a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH-MBs. Analysis of additional tumor entities substantiates a link between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis, and indicates a context-specific role for p53 in catastrophic DNA rearrangements. Among these, we observed a strong association between somatic TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acutemyeloid leukemia. These findings connect p53 status and chromothripsis in specific tumor types, providing a genetic basis for understanding particularly aggressive subtypes of cancer.	[Jones, David T.

The magnetic counterpart of the mismatch negativity (MMNm) was recorded and compared between musicians and non-musicians in order to assess the effect of musical training on the detection of deviants to tone patterns. The results indicated a clear MMNm in the perceptual condition as well as in a simple pitch oddball (control) condition in both groups. However, there was no significant mismatch response in either group in the imagery condition despite above chance behavioral performance in the task of detecting deviant tones. The latency and the laterality of the MMNm in the perceptual condition differed significantly between groups, with an earlier MMNm in musicians, especially in the left hemisphere. In contrast the MMNm amplitudes did not differ significantly between groups. The behavioral results revealed a clear effect of long-term musical training in both experimental conditions. The obtained results represent new evidence that the processing of tone patterns is faster and more strongly lateralized in musically trained subjects, which is consistent with other findings in different paradigms of enhanced auditory neural system functioning due to long-term musical training.

J	Baho, E; Di Cristo, G				Baho, Elie; Di Cristo, Graziella			Neural Activity and Neurotransmission Regulate the Maturation of the Innervation Field of Cortical GABAergic Interneurons in an Age-Dependent Manner	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							IN-VIVO; SYNAPTIC COMPETITION; CRITICAL PERIOD; VISUAL-CORTEX; PLASTICITY; NEURONS; FAMILY; MEMORY	Neural activity guides the patterning of neuron synaptic territory in the developing nervous system. Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from numerous studies on projection neurons in neuromuscular and visual systems. It is unknown whether the innervation field of GABAergic interneurons, which forms local dense innervations, follows similar rules. Cortical basket cells innervate hundreds of pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites. Thanks to this connectivity pattern, they can tightly control neural excitability and synchronization. Here we show that reducing excitation, and thus neurotransmitter release, in mouse cortical single basket cells in slice cultures decreases the number of innervated cells without changing the pattern of perisomatic innervation, both at the peak and after the proliferation phase of perisomatic synapse formation. Conversely, suppressing neurotransmitter release in single basket cells can have completely opposite effects depending on the developmental stage. Our results reveal a remarkably specific and age-dependent role of neural activity and neurotransmission levels in the establishment of the synaptic territory of cortical GABAergic cells.

Retinal Expression of Wnt-Pathway Mediated Genes in Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 5 (Lrp5) Knockout Mice	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FAMILIAL EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; NORRIE-DISEASE; ANGIOGENESIS; MUTATIONS; RETINOPATHY; VASCULATURE; CELLS; GROWTH; MODEL	Mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5) impair retinal angiogenesis in patients with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), a rare type of blinding vascular eye disease. The defective retinal vasculature phenotype in human FEVR patients is recapitulated in Lrp5 knockout (Lrp5(-/-)) mouse with delayed and incomplete development of retinal vessels. In this study we examined gene expression changes in the developing Lrp5(-/-) mouse retina to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathology of FEVR in humans. Gene expression levels were assessed with an Illumina microarray on total RNA from Lrp5(-/-) and WT retinas isolated on postnatal day (P) 8. Regulated genes were confirmed using RT-qPCR analysis. Consistent with a role in vascular development, we identified expression changes in genes involved in cell-cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and membrane transport in Lrp5(-/-) retina compared to WT retina. In particular, tight junction protein claudin5 and amino acid transporter slc38a5 are both highly down-regulated in Lrp5(-/-) retina. Similarly, several Wnt ligands including Wnt7b show decreased expression levels. Plasmalemma vesicle associated protein (plvap), an endothelial permeability marker, in contrast, is up-regulated consistent with increased permeability in Lrp5(-/-) retinas. Together these data suggest that Lrp5 regulates multiple groups of genes that influence retinal angiogenesis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of FEVR.

Birth weight and gestation influence striatal morphology and motor response in normal six-year-old boys	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Stop-signal task; Striatal shape; Diffeomorphic mapping	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; BASAL GANGLIA; LATENT CLASS; NORMAL RANGE; DSM-IV; CHILDREN	The relation between fetal growth and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) cuts across the normal range of birth weights suggesting that subtle variations in fetal development may influence brain and cognitive function. We investigated the relation of ADHD-related endophenotypes, such as the striatum morphology, motor response and inhibition, with birth weight and gestational age in healthy children. 157 Six-year-old boys born at term (37 to 41 weeks) within the normal range for birth weight (2500 to 4630 g) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and performed the stop signal task. Linear regression was used to examine effects of birth weight, gestational age, and their interaction on striatal volumes and shapes as well as motor response and inhibition. Interactive effects of birth weight and gestational age, even within the normal range, predicted caudate volumes and shapes. Boys with relatively low birth weight and shorter gestation had smaller caudate volumes, reflected by shape contraction in the middle body, and in addition performed worst in motor response, reflected by mean reaction time and its variability. Our results supported the idea that prenatal influences on neurocognitive and brain development are not limited to the extreme range, but occur across the entire population. Variations in brain structure and cognitive endophenotypes associated with childhood ADHD psychopathology are sensitive to subtle prenatal influences, which provides guidance for intervention research to improve mental health of children.

So far, it remains unclear to what extent such a correlation in thickness is a reflection of underlying fiber connection. Here we explicitly compared the patterns of cortical thickness correlation and diffusion-based fiber connection across the entire cerebral cortex, in 95 normal adults. Interregional thickness correlations were extracted by using computational neuroanatomy algorithms based on structural MRI, and diffusion connections were detected by using diffusion probabilistic tractography. Approximately 35-40% of thickness correlations showed convergent diffusion connections across the cerebral cortex. Intriguingly, the observed convergences between thickness correlation and diffusion connection are mostly focused on the positive thickness correlations, while almost all of the negative correlations (>90%) did not have a matched diffusion connection, suggesting different mechanisms behind the positive and negative thickness correlations, the latter not being mediated by a direct fiber pathway. Furthermore, graph theoretic analysis reveals that the thickness correlation network has a more randomized overall topology, whereas the nodal characteristics of cortical regions in these two networks are statistically correlated. These findings indicate that thickness correlations partly reflect underlying fiber connections but they contains exclusive information, and therefore should not be simply taken as a proxy measure for fiber connections.

The role of cortical thickness in these patients remains largely unknown. We aimed to assess the regions of cortical thickness associated with distinct gait parameters in patients with SVD, and whether these associations were dependent on WMLs and lacunar infarcts. MRI data were obtained from 415 subjects with SVD, aged between 50 and 85 years. We assessed cortical thickness using surface-based cortical thickness analysis, and gait performance using the GAITRite system. Cortical thickness of predominantly the orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal lobe, cingulate areas and visual association cortices was positively related to stride length. Thickness of the primary and supplementary motor cortices and the cingulate cortex was positively related to cadence, while thickness of the orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and especially the inferior parietal lobe and superior temporal gyrus was negatively related to stride width. The associations with stride length and width were partially explained by the subcortical WMLs and lacunar infarcts. Cortical thickness may therefore be important in gait disturbances in individuals with SVD, with different cortical patterns for specific gait parameters. We suggest that cortical atrophy is part of the disease processes in patients with SVD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[de Laat, Karlijn F.; Grim, David C.; van Norden, Anouk G.

Hemispheric lateralization is sometimes accentuated in sex differences; e.g., women demonstrating greater activation of the left hemisphere than men during verbal tasks. We were interested in whether this phenomenon applies to memory for words and designs (i.e., material specific memory). Using analogous verbal (pseudowords) and nonverbal (abstract designs) encoding and recognition tasks completed back-to-back in a 3 T scanner, we found that women tend to show exaggerated left hippocampal activation during certain stages of encoding and recognition of verbal information, compared with men. Likewise (although to a lesser extent), men showed more right hippocampal activation than women did during the abstract design learning task. These results have important implications for the generalization of fMRI memory study results, for example to clinical populations such as patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Parallel contributions of cerebellar, striatal and M1 mechanisms to motor sequence learning	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Motor learning; Motor control; Internal model; Motor representation; Motor memory; Chunking	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; BASAL GANGLIA; INTERNAL-MODELS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TIME-COURSE; MOVEMENT REPRESENTATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; VISUAL SKILL	When learning a new motor sequence, we must execute the correct order of movements while simultaneously optimizing sensorimotor parameters such as trajectory, timing, velocity and force. Neurophysiological studies in animals and humans have identified the major brain regions involved in sequence learning, including the motor cortex (M1), basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum. Current models link these regions to different stages of learning (early vs. late) or different components of performance (spatial vs. sensorimotor). At the same time, research in motor control has given rise to the concept that internal models at different levels of the motor system may contribute to learning. The goal of this review is to develop a new framework for motor sequence learning that combines stage and component models within the context of internal models. To do this, we review behavioral and neuroimaging studies in humans and neurophysiological studies in animals. Based on this evidence, we present a model proposing that sequence learning is underwritten by parallel, interacting processes, including internal model formation and sequence representation, that are instantiated in specific cerebellar, BC or M1 mechanisms depending on task demands and the stage of learning. The striatal system learns predictive stimulus-response associations and is critical for motor chunking. The role of the cerebellum is to acquire the optimal internal model for sequence performance in a particular context, and to contribute to error correction and control of on-going movement. M1 acts to store the representation of a learned sequence, likely as part of a distributed network including the parietal lobe and premotor cortex. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These neurons establish constant communication with their targets which insures correct maturation and functioning of the somato-sensory nervous system. Interfering with this two-way communication leads to cellular, electrophysiological and molecular modifications that can eventually cause neuropathic conditions. In this study we reveal that FXYD2, which encodes the gamma-subunit of the Na, K-ATPase reported so far to be mainly expressed in the kidney, is induced in the mouse DRGs at postnatal stages where it is restricted specifically to the TrkB-expressing mechanoceptive and Ret-positive/IB4-binding non-peptidergic nociceptive neurons. In non-peptidergic nociceptors, we show that the transcription factor Runx1 controls FXYD2 expression during the maturation of the somato-sensory system, partly through regulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret. Moreover, Ret signaling maintains FXYD2 expression in adults as demonstrated by the axotomy-induced down-regulation of the gene that can be reverted by in vivo delivery of GDNF family ligands. Altogether, these results establish FXYD2 as a specific marker of defined sensory neuron subtypes and a new target of the Ret signaling pathway during normal maturation of the non-peptidergic nociceptive neurons and after sciatic nerve injury.

Rare Deletions at the Neurexin 3 Locus in Autism Spectrum Disorder	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							COPY-NUMBER VARIATION; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MENTAL-RETARDATION; STRUCTURAL VARIANTS; INCREASE RISK; DE-NOVO; SCHIZOPHRENIA; GENES; MUTATIONS; COMMON	The three members of the human neurexin gene family, neurexin 1 (NRXN1), neurexin 2 (NRXN2), and neurexin 3 (NRXN3), encode neuronal adhesion proteins that have important roles in synapse development and function. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as in other neurodevelopmental conditions, rare exonic copy-number variants and/or point mutations have been identified in the NRXN1 and NRXN2 loci. We present clinical characterization of four index cases who have been diagnosed with ASD and who possess rare inherited or de novo microdeletions at 14q24.3-31.1, a region that overlaps exons of the alpha and/or beta isoforms of NRXN3. NRXN3 deletions were found in one father with subclinical autism and in a carrier mother and father without formal ASD diagnoses, indicating issues of penetrance and expressivity at this locus. Notwithstanding these clinical complexities, this report on ASD-affected individuals who harbor NRXN3 exonic deletions advances the understanding of the genetic etiology of autism, further enabling molecular diagnoses.

Otic Mesenchyme Cells Regulate Spiral Ganglion Axon Fasciculation through a Pou3f4/EphA4 Signaling Pathway	NEURON			English	Article							INNER-EAR; MAMMALIAN COCHLEA; AUDITORY NEURONS; EPH RECEPTORS; MOUSE; GUIDANCE; MOTOR; BRAIN; DROSOPHILA; MIGRATION	Peripheral axons from auditory spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) form an elaborate series of radially and spirally oriented projections that interpret complex aspects of the auditory environment. However, the developmental processes that shape these axon tracts are largely unknown. Radial bundles are comprised of dense SGN fascicles that project through otic mesenchyme to form synapses within the cochlea. Here, we show that radial bundle fasciculation and synapse formation are disrupted when Pou3f4 (DFNX2) is deleted from otic mesenchyme. Further, we demonstrate that Pou3f4 binds to and directly regulates expression of Epha4, Epha4(-/-) mice present similar SGN defects, and exogenous EphA4 promotes SGN fasciculation in the absence of Pou3f4. Finally, Efnb2 deletion in SGNs leads to similar fasciculation defects, suggesting that ephrin-B2/EphA4 interactions are critical during this process. These results indicate a model whereby Pou3f4 in the otic mesenchyme establishes an Eph/ephrin-mediated fasciculation signal that promotes inner radial bundle formation.

The present study aimed to further investigate retinotopic mapping as well as specific vertical and horizontal functional asymmetries within the human visual cortex using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Black and white wedge checkerboard stimuli were randomly presented to the four visual field (VF) quadrants of eight healthy adults in order to quantify and compare the localization and the amplitude of hemodynamic cortical responses to each VF quadrant. Results showed the expected activation in the contralateral hemisphere, with respect to the side of the stimulated quadrant. We also measured significantly stronger activations in the upper visual cortex when low hemifield stimuli were presented compared to activations in the lower visual cortex when upper hemifield stimuli were shown, especially when the stimulation was presented in the right visual field. These findings confirm the vertical asymmetry of the visual cortex previously reported by neuroimaging and behavioral studies. More importantly, the present work confirms the reliability of the fNIRS technique for functional mapping of the human brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, it has been shown that DSCAM can bind to Netrin-1 and that downregulation of DSCAM expression by siRNAs in chick and rodent spinal cords leads to impaired growth and turning response of commissural axons to Netrin-1. To investigate the effect of complete genetic ablation of DSCAM on Netrin-1-induced axon guidance, we analyzed spinal commissural neurons in DSCAM-null mice and found that they extend axons that reach and cross the floor plate and express apparently normal levels of the Netrin receptors DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) and Neogenin. In vitro, commissural neurons in dorsal spinal cord explants of DSCAM-null embryos show normal outgrowth in response to Netrin-1. We therefore conclude that DSCAM is not required for Netrin-induced commissural axon outgrowth and guidance in mice.

These changes are mediated in part by the increase in local expression of trophic factors. Increase in target tissue nerve growth factor has been implicated in the promotion of peptidergic afferent and sympathetic efferent sprouting following nerve injury. The primary source of nerve growth factor is cells found in the target tissue, namely the skin. Recent evidence regarding the release and extracellular maturation of nerve growth factor indicate that it is produced in its precursor form and matured in the extracellular space. It is our hypothesis that the precursor form of nerve growth factor should be detectable in those cell types producing it. To date, limitations in available immunohistochemical tools have restricted efforts in obtaining an accurate distribution of nerve growth factor in the skin of navie animals and those with neuropathic pain lesions. It is the objective of this study to delineate the distribution of the precursor form of nerve growth factor to those cell types expressing it, as well as to describe its distribution with respect to those nerve fibers responsive to it. Results: We observed a decrease in peptidergic fiber innervation at 1 week after the application of a chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the sciatic nerve, followed by a recovery, correlating with TrkA protein levels. ProNGF expression in CCI animals was significantly higher than in sham-operated controls from 1-4 weeks post-CCI. ProNGF immunoreactivity was increased in mast cells at 1 week post-CCI and, at later time points, in keratinocytes. P75 expression within the dermis and epidermis was significantly higher in CCI-operated animals than in controls and these changes were localized to neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations using specific markers for each. Conclusions: We describe proNGF expression by non-neuronal cells over time after nerve injury as well as the association of NGF-responsive fibers to proNGF-expressing target tissues. ProNGF expression increases following nerve injury in those cell types previously suggested to express it.

CHOLINERGIC SUPPRESSION OF EXCITATORY SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION IN LAYERS II/III OF THE PARASUBICULUM	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						entorhinal cortex; acetylcholine theta; spatial navigation; medial septum; EPSP; atropine	ENTORHINAL CORTEX; RETROHIPPOCAMPAL REGION; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; SUBICULAR COMPLEX; GUINEA-PIG; II NEURONS; IN-VITRO; THETA; INVITRO	Layer II of the parasubiculum (PaS) receives excitatory synaptic input from the CA1 region of the hippocampus and sends a major output to layer II of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex. The PaS also receives heavy cholinergic innervation from the medial septum, which contributes to the generation of theta-frequency (4-12 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Cholinergic receptor activation exerts a wide range of effects in other areas of the hippocampal formation, including membrane depolarization, changes in neuronal excitability, and suppression of excitatory synaptic responses. The present study was aimed at determining how cholinergic receptor activation modulates excitatory synaptic input to the layer II/III neurons of the PaS in acute brain slices. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in layer II/III of the PaS were evoked by stimulation of either layer I afferents, or ascending inputs from layer V. Bath-application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (0.5-10 mu M) suppressed the amplitude of fEPSPs evoked by both superficial- and deep layer stimulation, and also enhanced paired-pulse facilitation. Constant bath-application of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10 mu M) failed to eliminate the suppression, indicating that the cholinergic suppression of fEPSPs is not due to increased inhibitory tone. The muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 mu M) blocked the suppression of fEPSPs, and the selective M(1)-preferring receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 p.M), but not the M(2)-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1-5 j.LM), also significantly attenuated the suppression. Therefore, cholinergic receptor activation suppresses excitatory synaptic input to layer II/III neurons of the PaS, and this suppression is mediated in part by M1 receptor activation. (C) 2011 IBRO.

We investigated the neural substrates underlying the respiratory changes in relation to movement in lampreys. We showed that respiration increases following stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) in an in vitro isolated preparation, an effect that persists in the absence of the spinal cord and caudal brainstem. By using electrophysiological and anatomical techniques, including whole-cell patch recordings, we identified a subset of neurons located in the dorsal MLR that send direct inputs to neurons in the respiratory generator. In semi-intact preparations, blockade of this region with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid greatly reduced the respiratory increases without affecting the locomotor movements. These results show that neurons in the respiratory generator receive direct glutamatergic connections from the MLR and that a subpopulation of MLR neurons plays a key role in the respiratory changes linked to movement.

However, it remains unclear if these changes occur early during development and how they impact overall network activity. To investigate this, we used a mouse model of prenatal infection with the viral mimic, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly I: C), a model based on epidemiological evidence that an immune challenge during pregnancy increases the prevalence of schizophrenia in the offspring. We found that prenatal infection reduced the density of parvalbumin-but not somatostatin-positive interneurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and strongly reduced the strength of inhibition early during postnatal development. Furthermore, using an intact hippocampal preparation in vitro, we found reduced theta oscillation generated in the CA1 area. Taken together, these results suggest that redistribution in excitatory and inhibitory transmission locally in the CA1 is associated with a significant alteration in network function. Furthermore, given the role of theta rhythm in memory, our results demonstrate how a risk factor for schizophrenia can affect network function early in development that could contribute to cognitive deficits observed later in the disease.

Here, we examine possible sex differences in the long-term consequences of perinatal anoxia in the rat, on central DA systems and DA-mediated behaviour. As adults, sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition, PPI) was differentially affected by anoxia in males and females, tending to be impaired only in males. Apomorphine-induced suppression of PPI was especially pronounced in males. Anoxia caused increases in amygdala DA levels in both sexes. However, sex-specific changes in DA and metabolite levels in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens were found, suggesting a possible basis for some of the observed gender biases in certain neurodevelopmental disorders, sensitive to birth hypoxia.

Connexin 39.9 Protein Is Necessary for Coordinated Activation of Slow-twitch Muscle and Normal Behavior in Zebrafish	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LARVAL ZEBRAFISH; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; LENS DEVELOPMENT; RELAXED MUTANTS; TOUCH RESPONSE; SPINAL-CORD; GENE; EXPRESSION; GAP; EMBRYOS	In many tissues and organs, connexin proteins assemble between neighboring cells to form gap junctions. These gap junctions facilitate direct intercellular communication between adjoining cells, allowing for the transmission of both chemical and electrical signals. In rodents, gap junctions are found in differentiating myoblasts and are important for myogenesis. Although gap junctions were once believed to be absent from differentiated skeletal muscle in mammals, recent studies in teleosts revealed that differentiated muscle does express connexins and is electrically coupled, at least at the larval stage. These findings raised questions regarding the functional significance of gap junctions in differentiated muscle. Our analysis of gap junctions in muscle began with the isolation of a zebrafish motor mutant that displayed weak coiling at day 1 of development, a behavior known to be driven by slow-twitch muscle (slow muscle). We identified a missense mutation in the gene encoding Connexin 39.9. In situ hybridization found connexin 39.9 to be expressed by slow muscle. Paired muscle recordings uncovered that wild-type slow muscles are electrically coupled, whereas mutant slow muscles are not. The further examination of cellular activity revealed aberrant, arrhythmic touch-evoked Ca(2+) transients in mutant slow muscle and a reduction in the number of muscle fibers contracting in response to touch in mutants. These results indicate that Connexin 39.9 facilitates the spreading of neuronal inputs, which is irregular during motor development, beyond the muscle cells and that gap junctions play an essential role in the efficient recruitment of slow muscle fibers.

The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been shown to play a critical role in the formation of sensory circuits in this preparation, however a comprehensive neuroanatomical study of GABAergic cell distribution in the developing tadpole has not been conducted. We report a detailed description of the spatial expression of GABA immunoreactivity in the Xenopus laevis tadpole brain at two key developmental stages: stage 40/42 around the onset of retinotectal innervation and stage 47 when the retinotectal circuit supports visually-guided behavior. During this period, GABAergic neurons within specific brain structures appeared to redistribute from clusters of neuronal somata to a sparser, more uniform distribution. Furthermore, we found that GABA levels were regulated by recent sensory experience. Both ELISA measurements of GABA concentration and quantitative analysis of GABA immunoreactivity in tissue sections from the optic tectum show that GABA increased in response to a 4 hr period of enhanced visual stimulation in stage 47 tadpoles. These observations reveal a remarkable degree of adaptability of GABAergic neurons in the developing brain, consistent with their key contributions to circuit development and function.

The best cited interpretation of this effect proposes that dopamine mediates the pleasure that commonly accompanies reward. This hypothesis has received support in some animal models and a few studies in humans. However, direct assessments of the effect of transiently increasing dopamine neurotransmission have been largely limited to the use of psychostimulant drugs, which elevate brain levels of multiple neurotransmitters in addition to dopamine. In the present study we tested the effect of more selectively elevating dopamine neurotransmission, as produced by administration of the immediate dopamine precursor, L-DOPA (0, 100/25, 200/50 mg, Sinemet), in healthy human volunteers. Neither dose altered positive mood. The results suggest that dopamine neurotransmission does not directly influence positive mood in humans.

In the treatment study, M100907 (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before the alpha-MTrp injection (30 mu Ci over 2 min). A single dose of M100907 caused a significant decrease in the synthesis in the anterior olfactory nucleus, accumbens nucleus, frontal cortex, sensory-motor cortex, cingulate cortex, medial caudate-putamen, dorsal thalamus, substantia nigra, inferior collicus, raphe magnus nucleus, superior olive, and raphe pallidus nucleus. These data suggest that the terminal 5-HT2A receptors are involved in the regulation of 5-HT synthesis in the entire brain. Further, 5-HT synthesis is likely regulated by the 5-HT2A antagonistic property of M100907 in the cortices, anterior olfactory nucleus, caudate putamen, and nucleus accumbens. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Denervation Causes Fiber Atrophy and Myosin Heavy Chain Co-Expression in Senescent Skeletal Muscle	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; WHOLE VASTUS LATERALIS; MOTOR UNIT; SOLEUS MUSCLE; BROWN-NORWAY; FAST-TWITCH; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; TIBIALIS ANTERIOR; GENE-EXPRESSION	Although denervation has long been implicated in aging muscle, the degree to which it is causes the fiber atrophy seen in aging muscle is unknown. To address this question, we quantified motoneuron soma counts in the lumbar spinal cord using choline acetyl transferase immunhistochemistry and quantified the size of denervated versus innervated muscle fibers in the gastrocnemius muscle using the in situ expression of the denervation-specific sodium channel, Nav(1.5), in young adult (YA) and senescent (SEN) rats. To gain insights into the mechanisms driving myofiber atrophy, we also examined the myofiber expression of the two primary ubiquitin ligases necessary for muscle atrophy (MAFbx, MuRF1). MN soma number in lumbar spinal cord declined 27% between YA (638+/-34 MNsxmm(-1)) and SEN (46+/-13 MNsxmm(-1)). Nav(1.5) positive fibers (1548+/-70 mu m(2)) were 35% smaller than Nav(1.5) negative fibers (2367+/-78 mu m(2); P<0.05) in SEN muscle, whereas Nav(1.5) negative fibers in SEN were only 7% smaller than fibers in YA (2553+/-33 mu m(2); P<0.05) where no Nav(1.5) labeling was seen, suggesting denervation is the primary cause of aging myofiber atrophy. Nav(1.5) positive fibers had higher levels of MAFbx and MuRF1 (P<0.05), consistent with involvement of the proteasome proteolytic pathway in the atrophy of denervated muscle fibers in aging muscle. In summary, our study provides the first quantitative assessment of the contribution of denervation to myofiber atrophy in aging muscle, suggesting it explains the majority of the atrophy we observed. This striking result suggests a renewed focus should be placed on denervation in seeking understanding of the causes of and treatments for aging muscle atrophy.

Ataxin-3 Deubiquitination Is Coupled to Parkin Ubiquitination via E2 Ubiquitin-conjugating Enzyme	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MACHADO-JOSEPH DISEASE; POLYUBIQUITIN CHAINS; PROTEIN LIGASE; DEGRADATION; MECHANISMS; MITOPHAGY; ACTIVATION; PROTEASOME; STABILITY; PROMOTES	We reported previously that parkin, a Parkinson disease-associated E3 ubiquitin-ligase interacts with ataxin-3, a deubiquitinating enzyme associated with Machado-Joseph disease. Ataxin-3 was found to counteract parkin self-ubiquitination both in vitro and in cells. Moreover, ataxin-3-dependent deubiquitination of parkin required the catalytic cysteine 14 in ataxin-3, although the precise mechanism remained unclear. We report here that ataxin-3 interferes with the attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) onto parkin in real-time during conjugation but is unable to hydrolyze previously assembled parkin-Ub conjugates. The mechanism involves an ataxin-3-dependent stabilization of the complex between parkin and the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, which impedes the efficient charging of the E2 with Ub. Moreover, within this complex, the transfer of Ub from the E2 is diverted away from parkin and onto ataxin-3, further explaining how ataxin-3 deubiquitination is coupled to parkin ubiquitination. Taken together, our findings reveal an unexpected convergence upon the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme in the regulation of an E3/deubiquitinating enzyme pair, with important implications for the function of parkin and ataxin-3, two proteins responsible for closely related neurodegenerative diseases.

However, due to the short half-life of the clinically used isotopes, other long-lived isotopes not used in clinical practice are chosen to perform the PSF measurements, consequently leading to over or under estimation of the true PSF width during reconstruction, due to the difference in positron range. In high resolution brain and preclinical imaging, this effect is of particular importance since the resolution becomes more positron range limited and isotope-specific PSFs can help maximizing the performance benefit from using resolution recovery image reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we use a printing technique to simultaneously measure multiple point sources and demonstrate the feasibility of deriving isotope-dependent system matrices on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) by measuring spatially-variant and isotope-specific PSFs using Fluorine-18 and Carbon-H. Initial results based on these 2 isotopes illustrate that even small differences in positron range can result in different PSF maps. The difference is more distinct in the centre of the field of view (FOV) where the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the positron range has a larger contribution in the overall FWHM compared to the edge of the FOV, where the parallax error dominates the overall FWHM. Further PSF measurements are underway to evaluate clinically used isotopes with larger positron ranges and significantly shorter half-lives. These measurements could be used to create a database of isotope-dependent system matrices to be used within image reconstruction.

The designed metric allows automatic selection between motion correction methods without visual inspection and has been tested on simulated and real data. The metric relies on the sum of absolute voxel-by-voxel differences for consecutive frames. Noise in the reconstructed images can make it difficult to correctly distinguish between different motion correction methods and can significantly affect the numerical result of voxel-by-voxel differences for consecutive frames. To reduce the noise component, a low pass filter was applied by using an optimised Gaussian kernel (the optimisation was based on simulated data using a numerical brain phantom). Results from 26 real scans are reported. A newly improved motion correction is shown to perform better than the formerly used method. From the 26 cases considered, the proposed metric favoured use of the new motion correction for 23 cases, and only 3 cases were better under the old motion correction. The method presents a fast and effective way of comparing the relative efficacy of motion correction methods, without any need of a gold standard or reference image.

Performance Assessment of Motion Correction for Different Distributions and Count Levels	2012 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium / Medical Imaging Conference Record (NSS/MIC) / 19th Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detector Workshop	OCT 29-NOV 03, 2012	Anaheim, CA	IEEE, IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc			PET	Motion correction methods are used to compensate for subject motion during a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, reducing the degradation in image quality and quantification and consequently improving the accuracy of data analysis. In this work a frame-by-frame realignment method applied to a [C-11]raclopride dynamic brain scan has been assessed, where the scan has 26 frames of different count levels and a varying spatiotemporal distribution. The performance of the motion correction in its two modes (normal and enhanced) is assessed using list-mode bootstrapping giving insights into the precision (and not accuracy) of the motion correction with respect to both the count level and distribution of the radioligand. It is found that the precision of motion correction deteriorates with decreasing count level (as expected in short low-count frames) and varies according to the radial and axial position in the field of view (FOV). Also the precision is affected by the varying distribution of the radioligand in frames with similar count levels, i.e., the greater concentration of the radioactivity in the striatal regions (and lower radioactivity concentration in the cortical areas) decreases the precision. Of particular note is the observation that the precision is also considerably degraded when the enhanced mode is used-indicating that the improved motion correction accuracy comes at the expense of increased variability (hence the enhanced mode simply offers a different bias-variance trade-off). It becomes clear that although such frame-by-frame motion correction method does not require an external motion tracking device it is consequently affected by the count level in each frame, radioligand distribution, voxel position in the FOV and the mode of coregistration. Such assessment can be applied to any coregistration of either PET or SPECT images especially with low counts.	[Markiewicz, P. J.; Reader, A.

Direct 4D PET Reconstruction of Parametric Images into a Stereotaxic Brain Atlas for [C-11]Raclopride	2012 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium / Medical Imaging Conference Record (NSS/MIC) / 19th Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detector Workshop	OCT 29-NOV 03, 2012	Anaheim, CA	IEEE, IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc			TOMOGRAPHY; ALGORITHMS; EMISSION	A method which incorporates three key processing stages (kinetic parameter estimation, motion correction and image registration from PET image space to stereotaxic image space) into the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction algorithm is presented. This approach can be of particular significance in the fields of neuroscience and psychiatry, whereby PET is often used to investigate differences in voxel-wise kinetic parameters (e. g. binding potential (BP) and influx rate constant) between groups of participants which require all images of the kinetic parameters of interest to be registered in a common spatial atlas. In current practice, both kinetic parameter estimation and image registration (in addition to motion-correction) are usually performed post-reconstruction. However, estimation of the kinetic parameters after reconstruction can result in sub-optimal estimates due to inaccurate modeling of the noise. Furthermore, performing motion correction and registration after reconstruction can introduce interpolation effects in the final image and cause image resolution degradation. To include the kinetic parameter estimation and spatial transformation parameters (both for motion correction and registration to stereotaxic space) within the iterative PET reconstruction framework should both reduce the error in kinetic parameter estimates and possibly improve image resolution. The performance of reconstruction was assessed using bias-variance and root mean squared error analyses to quantify differences with conventional indirect reconstruction methods. The proposed method not only delivers better image quality, i.e. sharper images, but also a reduction in bias and in root mean squared error in ROI BP estimates.

A popular approach is the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), as this avoids the need for arterial blood sampling. For now, in many PET centers, BP computation is neither automated nor standardized, and this can lead to method discrepancies between different research groups. The following work provides some benchmarks for the choices to make when computing the BP. Our results are based on simulated data. We examine the impact of different levels of pre-estimation smoothing on bias and variance, showing that the size of the reference region has little impact on BP estimates and that pre-estimation smoothing of the dynamic images has a better bias-variance trade-off than post-estimation smoothing of the BP images. Moreover, our results demonstrate that there is scope for leniency in the choice of reference region location, and that this should be further examined with real data. These results can be used to design a fully automated, MR independent kinetic analysis method method which is not only useful in its own right, but which also constitutes a very necessary step towards achieving fully automated direct (4D) BP parametric map estimation.

Approximation of Voxel-Level Variances From Spatial-Variances For Single Scan PET Data	2012 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium / Medical Imaging Conference Record (NSS/MIC) / 19th Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detector Workshop	OCT 29-NOV 03, 2012	Anaheim, CA	IEEE, IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc			NOISE PROPERTIES	Variance is one of the important metrics which is very useful in characterizing PET images, in particular when used in parameter estimation of dynamic PET data and in comparing different reconstruction algorithms or correction methods. Due to the nonlinear nature of some iterative reconstruction algorithms, (e. g., the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM)), voxel-level variance estimation can be challenging. However, although such estimation can be achieved via techniques such as Monte Carlo and the bootstrap, these techniques require a lot of computational time and are often impractical. In this work it was investigated whether the voxel-level variance/standard deviation can be estimated based on a single PET scan for any given region of interest (ROI) as long as the region is homogeneous and of large enough size to offer acceptable accuracy. Such variance estimation was here applied to two brain phantom scans with varying count level and a single human brain scan of [C-11]raclopride by considering a homogeneous neighbourhood of a given size for any individual voxel. The results were then compared to the variance estimation based on the bootstrap method applied to the same PET scans. It is shown that the single scan method can approximate the voxel-level standard deviation (SD) with a reasonable accuracy (15%) for noisy and low count datasets but it breaks down for higher count levels. For large and homogeneous regions larger voxel neighbourhoods achieve better agreement with the bootstrap estimation of SD. However, in the striatum the size of the voxel neighbourhood has to be smaller due to the size of the region, otherwise the homogeneity condition will not be met. The advantage of this approximate method is that it is very simple to apply without any extra theoretical assumptions.	[Markiewicz, P. J.; Reader, A.

Biomechanical Analysis of Forces Sustained by Iliac Screws in Spinal Instrumentation for Deformity Treatment: Preliminary Results	RESEARCH INTO SPINAL DEFORMITIES 8	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	9th Biennial Meeting of the International-Research-Society-of-Spinal-Deformities (IRSSD)	JUL, 2012	Poznan, POLAND	Int Res Soc Spinal Deformities, Ortopedia Polska, Rynek Zdrowia, Medycyna Praktyczna		Biomechanical modeling; scoliosis; spine instrumentation; iliac screw	FIXATION	Iliac screws used in long instrumentation for deformity treatment are subject to large forces, which may sometimes lead to fixation failures (intra-and postoperatively). The objective of this study was to analyze the biomechanics of iliac screw fixations. The study was based on a patient-specific simulation of a neuromuscular scoliosis case with a long instrumentation to the pelvis. A multi body flexible model was created using a preoperative 3D reconstructed spine and pelvis. The side bending radiographs were used to personalize the mechanical properties. The instrumentation construct was modeled as rigid bodies and flexible beams connected by kinematic joints. Three instrumentation parameters were studied: the connector length, the inter rod connectors and the use of sacral screws. The simulations showed that the forces and torques at the iliac screws were lowered by 9% and 25% respectively by reducing the lateral connector length (from 20 to 10 mm). An inter rod connector did not significantly reduce the iliac screw loads. Sacral screws reduced the functional loads on the iliac screws, but hardware related problems may be shifted onto the sacral screws. Sacral screws in conjunction with inter rod connectors reduced the loads at iliac screws without overloading the sacral screws. The preliminary results showed that the forces at the iliac screws could be lowered through different instrumentation parameters. In the next step of the study, the model validation will be further completed and used to evaluate other instrumentation factors by means of an experimental design framework. The knowledge of loading biomechanics at the iliac screw fixation is important for finding solutions to reduce the risk of failure, such as improving preoperative planning, instrumentation techniques and iliac screw construct design.

In this process, a wear resistant rotating tool is used to join sheet and plate with different materials such as aluminum, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, and titanium. This work studies the thermal characteristics of this process and provides a modeling technique based on Neural Network that can be used for real-time control. A thermal feed-back control method is presented to control the process. Using some thermal modeling for the heat distribution during friction stir welding process, this paper displays the complexity of obtaining an accurate design for the thermal feed back control. A three-dimensional transient heat transfer model is developed here for a sequential joining process (Friction Stir Welding-FSW) applied on aluminum parts. A neural network is created based on a set of experiments to predict the spatial and temporal variations in the temperature over the weld seam for different set of input variables. The model includes the dynamic and friction behavior of the rotating spindle and the thermal behaviors of the weld components involved. The significance of this modeling approach is that it captures the movement of the spindle, simulating a sequential joining process, along a continuous weld seam. The modeling results are compared with experimental data obtained by thermocouples and infrared camera, and accurately predict the trend of variations in weld temperature. A fuzzy-logic based controller is proposed to regulate the FSW process parameters to maintain the weld temperature within the margin required to ensure the weld quality. This modeling and control system can have applications in manufacturing aluminum parts in automotive and aerospace industry.

Its activity has been linked to the differentiation of neural progenitor cells, although little is known about its function during retinal development. The study described herein was undertaken to evaluate the expression of SIRT1 and its innate inhibitor, DBC1, in retinal tissues and progenitor cells. We found both SIRT1 and DBC1 to be widely expressed in mouse and human retinas, with subtle differences in subcellular distribution of each protein. We further demonstrate that nuclear-localized SIRT1 is only seen in human-derived retinal progenitor cells and not in adult retinas, suggesting that this nuclear localization may be important in retinal development. Moreover, we observed cytoplasmic DBC1 in a subset of progenitor cells as well as in mature ganglion cells, indicating that the progenitor cell subset, which was comprised predominantly of small cells, may represent a population of ganglion cell precursors. Collectively, the data presented in this study provide support for SIRT1 and DBC1 as regulators of retinal development and normal retinal physiology.

In the case of a problem in the rotating machine, the corresponding fault information will often be evident in the vibration signals. While fault diagnosis is widely used today, the level and types of data analyses employed ( e. g. standard statistical and spectral measures) remain fairly simple and often do not capture the subtle changes in machine dynamics which could lead to much improved machine condition prediction or diagnosis. Ongoing research has shown that higher order measures, e. g. multidimensional time-frequency presentations, can lead to a much more precise representation of machine condition and more importantly can uncover unique dynamical features often unattainable via basic 2D analysis. Time-frequency analysis, is effective in the detection of faults in machinery and, in certain instances, is the most efficient method available for fault diagnosis. In the case of time-frequency analysis, the machine state information can be expressed either in the form of contour images or grey images. The key challenge to successful implementation of TF-analysis in machine diagnosis is the development of an accurate and consistent method to interpret these images in a manner reflecting the machine condition. Once the images are classified correctly; the faults represented by vibration signals can be also recognized correctly. In most cases the general method is to classify the images directly with technician's eyes. This is clearly dependent on human experience and introduces many subjective factors and errors in fault diagnosis. Unsurprisingly, the recognition results are usually not very good. In this paper, Time-frequency domain is used to analyze industrial bearings vibration signals. The analysis results are expressed in time-frequency images. A back-propagation Neural Network Classifier is developed and used to classify the Fourier Descriptors of the time-frequency images in order to identify automatically the fault. The analysis and experimental results show that the faults of bearing can be classified accurately by the proposed methods.	[Oulmane, A.; Lakis, A.

This approach is applied to redesign the rotor of a low speed subsonic single-stage turbine that was designed and tested in DLR, Germany. The optimization is performed at the design point and the objective is to minimize the rotor pressure loss coefficient as well as the maximum von Mises stress while keeping the same design point mass flow rate, and keeping or increasing the rotor blade first natural frequency. A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is coupled with a Response Surface Approximation (RSA) of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) type. A relatively small set of high fidelity 3D flow simulations and structure analysis are obtained using ANSYS Workbench Mechanical. That set is used to train and to test the ANN models. The stacking line is parametrically represented using a quadratic rational Bezier curve (QRBC). The QRBC parameters are directly related to the design variables, namely the rotor lean and sweep angles and the bowing parameters. Moreover, it results in eliminating infeasible shapes and in reducing the number of design variables to a minimum while providing a wide design space for the blade shape. The aero-structural optimization of the E/TU-3 turbine proved successful, the rotor pressure loss coefficient was reduced by 9.8% and the maximum von Mises stress was reduced by 36.7%. This improvement was accomplished with as low as four design variables, and is attributed to the reduction of 3D-related aerodynamic losses and the redistribution of stresses from the hub trailing edge region to the suction side maximum thickness area. The proposed parametrization is a promising one for 3D blade shape optimization involving several disciplines with a relatively small number of design variables.

However, only a limited number of studies have investigated whether macrocephaly persists in adults in these conditions, due to an absence of up-to-date reference charts constructed for typically developing adults. Available adult head circumference reference charts either don't measure individuals beyond 21 years of age, are outdated, mostly use homogeneous samples and most importantly do not account for the individual's height and weight at the same time. Two hundred twenty-one male adults were recruited in a large urban community. For each participant, height, weight and head circumference were measured. A significant positive relationship was found between head circumference and height (r=0.379) as well as between head circumference and weight (r=0.391) and a weaker positive correlation with bodymass index (r=0.213). Charts to determine the level of head circumference abnormalities in adulthood are provided, along with a calculation formula for head circumference based on height and weight. The findings indicate the necessity of taking height and weight into account when measuring head circumference in adults.	[Nguyen, A. K. D.; Simard-Meilleur, A.

When these systems employ real vibration data obtained from bearings artificially damaged, they have to cope with a very limited number of training samples. Moreover, an important issue that has been little investigated in the literature is the presence of noise, which disturbs the vibration signals, and how this affects the identification of bearing defects. In this paper, a new strategy based on the fusion of different Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed in order to reduce noise effect in bearing fault diagnosis systems. Each SVM classifier is designed to deal with a specific noise configuration and, when combined together - by means of the Iterative Boolean Combination (IBC) technique - they provide high robustness to different noise-to-signal ratio. In order to produce a high amount of vibration signals, considering different defect dimensions and noise levels, the BEAring Toolbox (BEAT) is employed in this work.

The proposed system eliminates the unnecessary clock gating during normal neural activity monitoring mode and reduces the total power consumption. The proposed detector includes analog and digital building blocks with a variable time frame and four concurrent variable voltage window detectors to extract seizure onset information. The algorithm is validated in Matlab and the system is implemented in standard 0.13 mu m CMOS process. Based on post-layout simulation results, the input referred noise of bioamplifier and the total power consumption of system are 4.4 mu Vrms and 7.1 mu W, respectively. An accurate detection is achieved and no false alarms are recorded during analyzing the iEEG signals of two patients. The average detection delay of 9.5 sec is obtained after seizure onset.

The methodology aims to find the relevant design parameters faster than current analytical models and optimization procedures. To reach this goal, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to learn the design task by being exposed to successful design examples. Our preliminary results, using a training set of two hundred design examples, show that a radial basis functions ANN can learn the provided designs perfectly, but a larger training set is required for definite conclusions regarding the prediction of component values for new designs.

The classical neural network based methodology is impractical to implement since in order to increase the size of the memory, the number of information bits stored per memory bit (efficiency) approaches zero. In addition, the length of a message to be stored and retrieved needs to be the same size as the number of nodes in the network causing the total number of messages the network is capable of storing (diversity) to be limited. Recently, a novel algorithm based on sparse clustered neural networks has been proposed that achieves nearly optimal efficiency and large diversity. In this paper, a proof-of-concept hardware implementation of these networks is presented. The limitations and possible future research areas are discussed.

Data from the past 15 years have shown that pre-injury administration of volatile anesthetic can decrease the impact of ischemia-reperfusion injury on the heart, brain, and kidney. Recent data demonstrated that volatile agents administered shortly after injury can decrease the ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Rare Variants in Complex Traits: Novel Identification Strategies and the Role of de novo Mutations	HUMAN HEREDITY			English	Article						De novo; Autism; Schizophrenia; Rare variants	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; COPY-NUMBER VARIATION; SCAFFOLDING PROTEIN SHANK3; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MENTAL-RETARDATION; MISSING HERITABILITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; COMMON DISEASE; SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY; FUNCTIONAL IMPACT	Following the limited success of linkage and association studies aimed at identifying the genetic causes of common neurodevelopmental syndromes like autism and schizophrenia, complex traits such as these have recently been considered under the 'common disease-rare variant' hypothesis. Prior to this hypothesis, the study of candidate genes has enabled the discovery of rare variants in complex disorders, and in turn some of these variants have highlighted the genetic contribution of de novo variants. De novo variants belong to a subcategory of spontaneous rare variants that are largely associated with sporadic diseases, which include some complex psychiatric disorders where the affected individuals do not transmit the genetic defects they carry because of their reduced reproductive fitness. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated the rate of germline de novo mutations to be higher in individuals with complex psychiatric disorders by comparison to what is seen in unaffected control individuals; moreover, de novo mutations carried by affected individuals have generally been more deleterious than those observed in control individuals. Advanced sequencing technologies have recently enabled the undertaking of massive parallel sequencing projects that can cover the entire coding sequences (exome) or genome of several individuals at once. Such advances have thus fostered the emergence of novel genetic hypotheses and ideas to investigate disease-causative genetic variations. The genetic underpinnings of a number of sporadic complex diseases is now becoming partly explained and more major breakthroughs for complex traits genomics should be expected in the near future.

A scoping review of malaria forecasting: past work and future directions	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; PREDICTION; EPIDEMIC; TRANSMISSION; REGRESSION; ETHIOPIA; MODELS	Objectives: There is a growing body of literature on malaria forecasting methods and the objective of our review is to identify and assess methods, including predictors, used to forecast malaria. Design: Scoping review. Two independent reviewers searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data from each study. Information sources: Search strategies were developed and the following databases were searched: CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses and Web of Science. Key journals and websites were also manually searched. Eligibility criteria for included studies: We included studies that forecasted incidence, prevalence or epidemics of malaria over time. A description of the forecasting model and an assessment of the forecast accuracy of the model were requirements for inclusion. Studies were restricted to human populations and to autochthonous transmission settings. Results: We identified 29 different studies that met our inclusion criteria for this review. The forecasting approaches included statistical modelling, mathematical modelling and machine learning methods. Climate-related predictors were used consistently in forecasting models, with the most common predictors being rainfall, relative humidity, temperature and the normalised difference vegetation index. Model evaluation was typically based on a reserved portion of data and accuracy was measured in a variety of ways including mean-squared error and correlation coefficients. We could not compare the forecast accuracy of models from the different studies as the evaluation measures differed across the studies. Conclusions: Applying different forecasting methods to the same data, exploring the predictive ability of non-environmental variables, including transmission reducing interventions and using common forecast accuracy measures will allow malaria researchers to compare and improve models and methods, which should improve the quality of malaria forecasting.

Vangl1 and Vangl2 variants have also been detected in familial and sporadic cases of spina bifida. Vangl proteins are highly conserved in evolution with relatives in flies, and distant invertebrates and vertebrates. In these organisms, they play a central role in planar cell polarity (PCP) and convergent extension (CE) movements. Over the past decade, these functional characteristics have also been established for mammalian Vangl genes. The careful analysis of mouse Vangl genes mutants has showed that these genes and the associated PCP pathway and CE movements are involved in many unexpected developmental processes, from morphogenesis of different tissues, left-right asymmetry, asymmetric cell division, and organization of many epithelial structures, as well as positioning and function of cellular appendages. Genetic studies in double mutants and biochemical studies of interacting proteins have started to elucidate the molecular pathways in which Vangl proteins participate and that regulate these complex events.

Obtaining quantitative measures which assesses the degree or probability of WML in patients is important for evaluating disease burden, and for evaluating its progression and response to interventions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for detecting the presence of WMLs in periventricular areas of the brain using manifold-constrained embeddings. The proposed method uses locally linear embedding (LLE) to create "normality" distributions in 12 locations of the brain where deviations from the manifolds are estimated by calculating geodesic distances along locally linear planes in the embedding. A smooth mapping function approximating the relationship between ambient and manifold spaces as a joint distribution maps unseen test images in the intrinsic space. We create a set of low-dimensional embeddings from 876 patches of healthy tissue in 73 subjects and test it on 396 patches imaging both WML and healthy areas in 33 subjects with diabetes. Experiments highlight the need of nonlinear techniques to learn the studied data with detection rates over 85% in true-positives, and the relevance of the computed distance for comparing individuals to a specific pathological pattern.

Although the most common optic neuropathy is glaucoma, there are also many other optic neuropathies, for example, those associated with multiple sclerosis, giant cell arteritis, ischemia, and many other diseases. In almost all cases, the pathogenesis involves injury to the retinal ganglion cell axon, with consequent somal and axonal degeneration. This chapter reviews the clinical and pathophysiological properties associated with three of the most common optic neuropathies, as well as recent findings in understanding axonal degeneration. It concludes with a status report on therapies for optic nerve disease, including axoprotection, an approach being studied that has the goal of maintaining axonal integrity and function after injury.

In this review, we focus on Rho, an intracellular small GTPase that is part of a family of highly related proteins that are present in all cells as important signaling switches. Multiple lines of evidence have validated the Rho pathway as important in controlling axon growth and regeneration after neurotrauma in the CNS. The first part of this review will provide the evidence that Rho is a convergent point of signaling important for axon regeneration in the growth inhibitory environment of the adult CNS. The second part of the review will focus on efforts to target Rho to promote regeneration in vivo. The final section of the review will summarize clinical results with Cethrin, a Rho inhibitor that has completed phase I/IIa clinical testing.

In addition, the injury also triggers an inflammatory response that contributes to secondary tissue damage that leads to further functional loss. Reducing inflammation after spinal cord injury (SO) is therefore a worthy therapeutic goal. Inflammation in the injured spinal cord is a complex response that involves resident cells of the central nervous system as well as infiltrating immune cells, and is mediated by a variety of molecular pathways and signaling molecules. Here, we discuss approaches we have used to identify novel therapeutic targets to modulate the inflammatory response after SCI to reduce tissue damage and promote recovery. Effective treatments for SCI will likely require a combination of approaches to reduce inflammation and secondary damage with those that promote axon regeneration.

In this paper, we present a new electroencephalogram (EEG) based metric to quantitatively characterize neuromodulatory activity. More specifically, the short-term EEG amplitude modulation rate-of-change (i.e., modulation frequency) is computed for five EEG subband signals. To test the performance of the proposed metric, a classification task was performed on a database of 32 participants partitioned into three groups of approximately equal size: healthy controls, patients diagnosed with mild AD, and those with moderate-to-severe AD. To gauge the benefits of the proposed metric, performance results were compared with those obtained using EEG spectral peak parameters which were recently shown to outperform other conventional EEG measures. Using a simple feature selection algorithm based on area-under-the-curve maximization and a support vector machine classifier, the proposed parameters resulted in accuracy gains, relative to spectral peak parameters, of 21.3% when discriminating between the three groups and by 50% when mild and moderate-to-severe groups were merged into one. The preliminary findings reported herein provide promising insights that automated tools may be developed to assist physicians in very early diagnosis of AD as well as provide researchers with a tool to automatically characterize cross-frequency interactions and their changes with disease.

Method: The sample was made up of 112 right-brain-damaged individuals from three nationalities (Canadians, Brazilians and Argentineans). They were assessed using 13 language tasks from the Protocol MEC in Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese and French. Results: A hierarchical cluster analysis led to four distinct clinical profiles of communication. Since only a few distinctions between nationalities were observed, the results suggest that there probably is a partial universality of clinical profiles of communication impairments after a right brain damage. Conclusions: This study proposes a preliminary taxonomy of communication disorders among right-brain-damaged individuals with cross-cultural implications. The exploration of associated stroke sites and neuropsychological concomitant deficits would contribute to the eventual development of a more accurate clinical intervention. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

Relaxofon: A Neuromuscular Blockade Monitor for Patients Under General Anesthesia	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			MUSCLE; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; PHONOMYOGRAPHY	Anesthesia consists of three components: unconsciousness, analgesia and neuromuscular blockade (NMB). A specific drug is administered by the anesthesiologist to control these different components. In this paper we propose a new system for monitoring the neuromuscular blockade in anesthesized patients during surgery. Neuromuscular blockade drugs are used routinely by clinicians to induce muscle relaxation in patients. However, the use of these drugs has some risks, so an adequate monitoring of the effects of these drugs is essential. This paper describes the Relaxofon, a NMB monitoring device based on phonomyography. The Relaxofon is composed of a hardware subsystem that records muscle sounds using microphones and a special circuit to filter out the noise and amplify the signal, and a software subsystem that analyses the acquired signal. We tested the ability of the system to record phonomyographic signals from the adductor pollicis and the corrugator supercilii muscles. We then performed the Bland-Altman test to compare the manual Train-of-Four ratio (a measure of the depth of muscle relaxation) calculation against the one performed by the Relaxofon. Finally, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear dependence between the two methods. Automatic Train-of-Four ratio calculations using this system showed very good agreement with manual calculations. Results from this work may ultimately lead to integration of NMB monitoring to an automated closed-loop anesthesia system.

In vitro experiments were achieved using artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) from Tocris Bioscience where microspheres were immersed to test the behaviour of the designed LoC. One of main features of the proposed LoC platform is its thin thickness, including micro-channels and silicon CMOS chip. The latter is integrated into the glass top-layer of the LoC measuring 0.5 mm. The size of the device is 9 mm x 5 mm. the electrode architecture is composed of 8 x 2 x 2 L-shaped electrodes in a 650 mu m channel width and 4 sites for interdigitited electrodes . 32 L-shaped electrodes were connected to a electronics circuit for cells manipulation using dielectrophoresis (DEP). The described LoC achieved an efficient separation within a concentration of 50 mu l of a solution of microspheres, distilled water (DW) and 500 mu l of ACSF. Beyond this concentration, electrode destruction was observed.

To move the gaze in space, the eyes, head, and body cooperate to place the image of the target on the fovea. Understanding the underlying neural circuitry innervating this collaboration could also be a cue to understanding other movement related CNS tasks involving multiple platforms, i.e., posture and locomotion. Basically two major network topologies for modeling the gaze orientation system have been proposed: the independent controller model and the shared gaze feedback controller model. In the independent controller model, each platform (i.e., eyes, head or trunk) receives its own share of the retinal error (distance of the target from the current gaze position) independent from other platform(s) and its goal is to null its individual error, whereas, in the shared gaze feedback controller all platforms collaborate to null the shared global error, which is calculated on the fly using feedback from all platforms or reflexes. Each of the mentioned general topologies has its own supporters and the question is which does the CNS actually use. In this article, based on evidence from neurophysiology and behavior, complemented by simulation data, it will be shown why a shared feedback controller is the better candidate for this task. More specifically, simulations of an updated Prsa-Galiana model (the Shared Sensory-Motor Integration (SMI) model) will be discussed in more detail and, where applicable, compared with other popular models, including independent and shared controller models. It provides plausible explanations for observations on gaze shifts with various interventions.	[Haji-Abolhassani, I.; Galiana, H.

In particular, if a person is affected by a disease or an injury, the gait may be modified. The left-right asymmetry of this movement can be related to neurological diseases, segment length differences or joint deficiencies. This paper proposes a novel method to analyze the asymmetry of lower limb movement which aims to be usable in daily clinical practice. This is done by recording the subject walking on a treadmill with a depth camera and then assessing left-right depth differences for the lower limbs during the gait cycle using horizontal flipping and registration of the depth images half a gait cycle apart. Validation on 20 subjects for normal gait and simulated pathologies (with a 5 cm sole), showed that this system is able to distinguish the asymmetry introduced. The major interest of this method is the low cost of the material needed and its easy setup in a clinical environment.

It is hypothesized to arise at multiple levels of the visual pathway due to competition between neuronal populations representing the displayed images. We tested whether an enhanced neural representation of expanding motion yields a bias over other spiral motion (i.e., contraction and rotation) and linear motion stimuli during binocular rivalry. We presented random dot patterns of different motion types (i.e., linear and spiral), matched in contrast and speed, to human subjects through a mirror stereoscope. During spiral rivalry, expansion rivalry periods dominated over those of contraction and rotation, and contraction dominated over rotation. During linear motion rivalry, up, down, left, and right directions had similar rivalry periods. All spiral motions dominated over linear motions. Interestingly, when these motion types rivaled against each other, the rivalry periods of spiral motion slightly decreased while those of linear motion significantly increased. This rivalry also caused the bias for expansion relative to other spirals to disappear. Our results suggest a correlation between neuronal representations of different moving patterns and their perception during binocular motion rivalry and provide further evidence that rivalry periods are constrained by the ecologic relevance of stimuli.

For each specific channel, the average of all trials is considered as the input to the adaptive filter whose coefficients are calculated by minimizing the mean square error between the voltage trace of that trial and the filter output. The residues of all trials serve as an initial estimate of the neural response. Once this estimate is calculated, the input of the adaptive filter is modified by subtracting the mean residue. It is shown that the modified input provides a better estimate of the mean TMS artifact, which serves the input of the adaptive filer, in the next iteration. Therefore, new filter coefficients are estimated in the next iteration, for each single trial, and the procedure continues till no considerable changes in the residues occur. We report a quantitative verification of the accuracy of our method by generating a controlled simulation. Furthermore, applying the algorithm to experimental data confirms the accuracy of our approach and its usefulness for extracting neurophysiological responses occurring in temporal proximity to TMS pulses.

The approach facilitates open vocabulary STD and focuses specifically on reducing the difference between detection performance obtained for within-vocabulary (IV) and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) search terms. Improved OOV detection performance is obtained by using a two-pass search procedure. Candidate audio segments are retrieved from an index of word lattice paths in the first pass. Locations of OOV search terms are detected in the second pass from a constrained alignment of phonemic expansions of the query terms with phoneme sequences obtained from acoustic segments using an unconstrained neural network based phone decoder. It is found that the combination of first pass segment retrieval and second pass term verification significantly increases STD performance for OOV query terms with no increase in search time for utterances taken from a lecture speech domain.

We searched MEDLINE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. Studies focusing on any neurocritical care conditions were included. Data are presented by using odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Results: Among 4,310 retrieved records, six studies met inclusion criteria (n = 537). Four studies were conducted in traumatic brain injury (TBI), one in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and one in a mixed population of neurocritically ill patients. The minimal hemoglobin levels or transfusion thresholds ranged from 7 to 10 g/dl in the lower-Hb groups and from 9.3 to 11.5 g/dl in the higher-Hb groups. Three studies had a low risk of bias, and three had a high risk of bias. No effect was observed on mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or multiple organ failure. In studies reporting on length of stay (n = 4), one reported a significant shorter ICU stay (mean, -11.4 days (95% confidence interval, -16.1 to -6.7)), and one, a shorter hospital stay (mean, -5.7 days (-10.3 to -1.1)) in the lower-Hb groups, whereas the other two found no significant association. Conclusions: We found insufficient evidence to confirm or refute a difference in effect between lower-and higher-Hb groups in neurocritically ill patients. Considering the lack of evidence regarding long-term neurologic functional outcomes and the high risk of bias of half the studies, no recommendation can be made regarding which hemoglobin level to target and which associated transfusion strategy (restrictive or liberal) to favor in neurocritically ill patients.

New modes of mechanical ventilation have been developed to better match the assistance delivered by the ventilator to the patient's needs. Among these modes, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) delivers a pressure that is directly proportional to the integral of the electrical activity of the diaphragm recorded continuously through an esophageal probe. In clinical settings, NAVA has been chiefly compared with pressure-support ventilation, one of the most popular modes used during the weaning phase, which delivers a constant pressure from breath to breath. Comparisons with proportional-assist ventilation, which has numerous similarities, are lacking. Because of the constant level of assistance, pressure-support ventilation reduces the natural variability of the breathing pattern and can be associated with asynchrony and/or overinflation. The ability of NAVA to circumvent these limitations has been addressed in clinical studies and is discussed in this report. Although the underlying concept is fascinating, several important questions regarding the clinical applications of NAVA remain unanswered. Among these questions, determining the optimal NAVA settings according to the patient's ventilatory needs and/or acceptable level of work of breathing is a key issue. In this report, based on an investigator-initiated round table, we review the most recent literature on this topic and discuss the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of NAVA compared with other modes, as well as the risks and limitations of NAVA.

Due to the fast adaptation and superb learning capability, Dynamic Neural Networks with two-time scales using sliding mode learning are used to identify the induction motor including the aspects of fast and slow phenomenon. The sliding mode technique and singularly perturbed theories are used to develop the on-line update laws for dynamic neural networks weights. The global convergence of the identification error to zero is analyzed by means of the Lyapunov function. Simulation results are presented confirming the validity of the above approach.

Notable variability in action potential timing invoked by similar stimuli suggests stochastic modeling is appropriate. This work presents a Maximum Likelihood estimator for a parametrized rate function under the assumption that spiking follows a inhomogeneous Poisson process. We present a flexible and scalable model, as well as the Cramer-Rao lower bound for a broad class of rate functions. Simulation results are generated and compared to this bound. The proposed estimator yields results close to the lower bounds when the order of the model can be well approximated. Our work shows that such statistical estimation techniques for neural rate functions provide highly accurate results and relatively low computation complexity.

FAULT DETECTION OF GAS TURBINE ENGINES USING DYNAMIC NEURAL NETWORKS	2012 25TH IEEE CANADIAN CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL & COMPUTER ENGINEERING (CCECE)			English	Proceedings Paper	25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	APR 29-MAY 02, 2012	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Canada				The main objective of this paper is to develop a neural network-based scheme for fault detection of an aircraft engine. Towards this end, a set of dynamic neural networks (DNN) are developed to learn the dynamics of the jet engine. The DNN is constructed based on a dynamic multilayer perceptron network which uses IRR filters to generate dynamics between the input and the output of the system. Our proposed DNN does not require a delayed sample of the output and is developed based on a single-input single-output (SISO) network. Consequently, the structure of the network would be the same in the training and the recall phases. The dynamic neural network that is described in this paper is developed to detect component faults that may occur in a dual spool turbo fan engine. Various simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of our proposed fault detection scheme.	[Tayarani-Bathaie, S. S.; Vanini, Z. N.

This network enables healthy adults to perform complex unimanual motor tasks without the activation of contralateral muscles. However, mirror movements (involuntary movements in ipsilateral muscles that can accompany intended movement) can be seen in healthy individuals if a task is complex or fatiguing, in childhood, and with increasing age. Lateralization of movement depends on complex interhemispheric communication between cortical (i.e., dorsal premotor cortex, supplementary motor area) and subcortical (i.e., basal ganglia) areas, probably coursing through the corpus callosum (CC). Here, we will focus on transcallosal interhemispheric inhibition (IHI), which facilitates complex unilateral movements and appears to play an important role in handedness, pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, and stroke recovery.

Although studies have shown that those patients perform normally on neuropsychological tests, cognitive symptoms remain present, and there is a need for more precise diagnostic tools. The aim of this study was to develop precise and sensitive markers for the diagnosis of post brain injury deficits in visual and attentional functions which could be easily translated in a clinical setting. Using electrophysiology, we have developed a task that allows the tracking of the processes involved in the deployment of visual spatial attention from early stages of visual treatment (N1, P1, N2, and P2) to higher levels of cognitive processing (no-go N2, P3a, P3b, N2pc, SPCN). This study presents a description of this protocol and its validation in 19 normal participants. Results indicated the statistically significant presence of all ERPs aimed to be elicited by this novel task. This task could allow clinicians to track the recovery of the mechanisms involved in the deployment of visual-attentional processing, contributing to better diagnosis and treatment management for persons who suffer a brain injury.

Results: Rate of RDSH stood at 18% after 6 months. The sociodemographic variables associated with repeated deliberate self-harm were to have no principal activity, consultation with a medical professional during the 6 months preceding the self-poisoning, and referral to psychiatric services upon release from the ER. The clinical variable associated with RDSH was alcohol addiction (OR = 2.7; IC 95% = 1.2-6.1, p < .05) as assessed at the time of the initial ER admission. Conclusions: When patients are initially admitted to the ER as a result of self-poisoning, it is important to evaluate specific factors, particularly alcohol use, that could subsequently lead to repeated deliberate self-harm. The goal is to improve the targeting and referral of patients toward structures that can best respond to their needs.

Here, I review 26 large-scale comparative studies that provide robust evidence for five lifestyle correlates of encephalization (group living, a large home range, a high-quality diet, a strong reliance on vision, arboreal and forest dwelling), six cognitive correlates (better performance in captive tests, more tactical deception, innovation, tool use, social learning, all subsumed in part by general intelligence), one life history correlate (a longer lifespan), two evolutionary correlates (a high rate of change in microcephaly genes, an increase in brain size over macroevolutionary time), as well as three trade-offs (a slower juvenile development, a higher metabolic rate, sexually selected dimorphism). Of the 26 different encephalization measures used in these studies, corrected neocortex size, either with a ratio or a residual, is the most popular structural correlate of the functional variables, while residual brain size is the measure associated with the greatest number of them. Controversies remain on corrected or absolute measures of neural structure size, concerted versus mosaic evolution of brain parts and specialized versus domain-general brain structures and cognitive processes.

CPEM is mainly characterized by motor deficits (typically quadraparesis or extrapyramidal features) but neurobehavioral symptoms were also reported in the literature. However, very few studies on the neuropsychological and functional performance in daily activities have been performed in this population. In this case study, a 55-year-old woman had neuropsychology and functional evaluations prior and after the first manifestations of CPEM. The patient presented motor impairments characterized by parkinsonism symptoms and decreased dexterity. Several neurobehavioral deficits were observed including emotional lability, impulsivity, altered judgment, and disinhibition. Executive dysfunctions and impulsivity were observed during neuropsychological and functional evaluations, limiting the patient's autonomy in complex activities of daily living. The patient recovered progressively from most motor, neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits.

We have also outlined recent neuroscientific findings concerning imitation processes, which tend to point to a biological basis for interactions based on movement observation. A theoretical framework drawing on concepts from the fields of Activity Analysis and Communication allowed us to develop an original methodology in order to observe, describe and analyse human interaction in the dance class. We have identified some of the constructive aspects, as well as the weaknesses, inherent to the conventional pedagogical configuration. The present research develops a number of analytical tools which may be applied to research in dance pedagogy and stimulates further reflection on teaching-learning activities in the dance context.

Spider-phobic and comparably low spider-fearful control participants imagined encountering different animals and rated their subjective fear while their central and peripheral nervous system activity was measured. All measures included in our study were sensitive to variations in subjective fear, but were related to different ranges and positions on the subjective fear level continuum. Left amygdala activation, heart rate, and facial muscle activity over the cheek region captured fear intensity variations even within narrowly described regions on the fear level continuum (here within extremely low levels of fear and within considerable phobic fear). Skin conductance and facial muscle activity over the brow region did not capture fear intensity variations within low levels of fear: skin conductance mirrored only extreme levels of fear, and activity over the brow region distinguished phobic from nonphobic fear but also low-to-moderate and high phobic fear. Finally, respiratory measures distinguished phobic from nonphobic fear with no further differentiation within phobic and nonphobic fear. We conclude that a careful consideration of the measures to be used in an investigation and the population to be examined can be critical in order to obtain significant results.

It is based on edge extraction in the Hilbert domain and subsequent analysis by means of fractal dimension and spectral energy distribution high order statistics. The technique is particularly suitable for pathologies characterized by bright structures in the MR images as do Glioma and Metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma. When classifying normal versus abnormal images dues to these two pathologies, ANOVA statistics show that the suggested features have strong between-classes differences, and the obtained classification accuracy by support vector machines is 99.9%+/- 0.006. In comparison, applying a standard feature extraction technique based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA) yielded 85.2%+/- 0.05 accuracy.

This device combines the spectro-reflectrometry with a CMOS image sensor to evaluate the oxygen saturation in living organs. This combination is realized by merging an image sensor to an optical fibre linked to a spectrograph. While the image sensor helps targeting precisely the blood vessel to be evaluated, the spectrograph gathers the reflected light spectrum from the vessel. The optical fibre is 50 microns diameter and has one end inserted in the back side of the image sensor. This end reaches the first silicon oxide layer on the component side, which is transparent. The other end is connected to the spectrograph; it transmits the intensity of the reflected light. In order to insert the optical fibre in the image sensor, we propose a process to achieve a highly directional etching technique with high aspect ratio. Also, we present a new image sensor structure allowing the presence of a hole in the center of the pixel array. The presence of the hole adds some design constraints leading to divide a conventional pixel array into four independent sub-arrays, where every pixel is addressed and read out separately.

Detector Ensembles for Face Recognition in Video Surveillance	2012 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA				NEURAL-NETWORK	Biometric systems for recognizing faces in video streams have become relevant in a growing number of private and public sector applications, among them screening for individuals of interest in dense and moving crowds. In practice, the performance of these systems typically declines because they encounter a variety of uncontrolled conditions that change during operations, and they are designed a priori using limited data and knowledge of underlying data distributions. This paper presents multi-classifier system that can achieve a high level of performance in real-world video surveillance applications. This system assigns an ensemble of detectors (2-class classifiers) per individual, where base detectors are co-jointly trained using population-based evolutionary optimization. During enrolment of an individual, an aggregative Dynamic Niching Particle Swarm Optimization (DNPSO)-based training strategy generates a diversified homogenous pool of ARTMAP neural network classifiers using reference data samples. Classifiers associated with local optima of the aggregative DNPSO are directly selected and efficiently combined in the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space. Performance is assessed in terms of both accuracy and resource requirements on facial regions extracted from video streams of the Face in Action database. A comparison between a standard global and modular classification architectures is provided in this paper. Simulation results indicate that recognizing an individual using the aforementioned ensemble of detectors provides a scalable architecture that maintains a significantly higher level of accuracy and robustness as the number of individuals grows.

Despite the abundance of literature data, the large number of the controlling parameters has made it difficult to predict and model the mechanical properties by the conventional techniques. Another obstacle encountered when making such a prediction is the complex kinetics and interactions that exist among the many variables. The goal of this study was to develop Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Regression models to predict the mechanical properties of A356 alloy from the processing variables. Several standard nonlinear regression and multi-layer ANN models were developed and trained using data from the literature and experimental results. Due to the complexity of A356's solidification behaviour, the nonlinear regression produced results that were not as accurate as those produced by the ANN model. The results indicate that ANN is a suitable technique for predicting mechanical properties from alloy chemistry and processing variables.

Contextual influences of parenting behaviors for children with neurodevelopmental disorders: results from a Canadian national survey	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Neurodevelopmental disorders; behavior problems; child disabilities; social support; parents; Canada	AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES; SOCIAL SUPPORT; HANDICAPPED-CHILDREN; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; CEREBRAL-PALSY; HEALTH; ADOLESCENTS; STRESS; CAREGIVERS	Purpose: This population-based study examined correlates of three parenting behaviors (positive interactions, consistency, and ineffective parenting) that have been shown to differ in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), with and without externalizing behavior problems (EBPs), as compared to children with neither condition. Method: The sample of children aged 4-11 (N = 14,226) was drawn from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). Analyses examined the associations of child, parental, and social context factors with parenting behaviors, and whether they differed by child health group. Results: Child age, family functioning, and social support variables were significant predictors of all three parenting behaviors. Significant interaction effects highlight the importance of the child's sex, birth order, and support received from community or social service professionals, and that these factors have differential impacts on parenting behaviors depending on the child's health group. Conclusions: Other Child, parent, and social context factors are associated with parenting behaviors but these associations vary by the child's health group. Parenting behaviors differ for children with NDDs with and without EBPs. These findings offer important implications for practice and research and point to the importance of considering multiple contexts of influence, as well as their interactions, in understanding differences in parenting behaviors.

These magnetic gradients are superposed on a sufficiently high homogeneous magnetic field (e. g. the Bo field of a MR scanner) to achieve maximum propelling force through magnetization saturation of the MNPs. As previously demonstrated by our group, such technique was successful at maintaining microcarriers along a planned trajectory in the blood vessels based on tracking information gathered using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences from artifacts caused by the same MNPs. Besides propulsion and tracking, the same MNPs can be synthesized with characteristics that can allow for the diffusion of therapeutic cargo carried by these MR-navigable carriers through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) using localized hyperthermia without compromising the MRN capabilities. In the present study, localized hyperthermia induced by an alternating magnetic field (AC field) is investigated for the purpose of transient controlled disruption of the BBB and hence local delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain. Here, an external heating apparatus was used to impose a regional heat shock on the skull of a living mouse model. The effect of heat on the permeability of the BBB was assessed using histological observation and tissue staining by Evans blue dye. Results show direct correlation between hyperthermia and BBB leakage as well as its recovery from thermal damage. Therefore, in addition to on-command propulsion and remote tracking, the proposed navigable agents could be suitable for controlled opening of the BBB by hyperthermia and selective brain drug delivery.

Neural Network-Based Image Moments for Visual Servoing of Planar Objects	2012 IEEE/ASME INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED INTELLIGENT MECHATRONICS (AIM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	JUL 11-14, 2012	Kaohsiung, TAIWAN	I-Rice - NSC, IEEE, IES, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, Bur Foreign Trade, RDMA TW, ASME, DSC				In this paper, Neural Network (NN)-based image moments are proposed to address the challenges of choosing proper image features for Image-based Visual Servoing (IBVS). The proposed two NN-based image features can estimate the rotational angles around x and y axes of camera frame for planar objects. Based on the proposed image features and other 4 commonly used image moments, the interaction matrix relating the chosen image features to camera motion is derived to have maximal decoupled structure. In addition, the analytical form of depth computation is given by using classical geometrical primitives and image moment invariant. A proportional IBVS controller is designed based on the derived interaction matrix and the tracking performance is thus enhanced for the 6 degree-of-freedom robotic system. Simulation results on a 6-DOF robot system are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	[Zhao, Y. M.; Xie, W.

J	Yacout, S			IEEE	Yacout, Soumaya			Logical Analysis of Maintenance and Performance Data of Physical Assets, ID34	2012 PROCEEDINGS - ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM (RAMS)			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)	JAN 23-26, 2012	Reno, NV	IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEST, IIE, SAE, Soc Reliabil Engineers (SRE), SSS, AIAA, ASQ, Elect & Communicat Div, ASQ, Reliabil Div		Artificial intelligence; Condition based maintenance; Logical analysis of data	PROGNOSTICS	We present a novel approach to fault detection and Physical Asset Health Management (PAHM) called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a supervised learning, artificial intelligence, data mining technique that possesses distinctive advantages which proved to be of use in PAHM. This approach has been introduced by a group of researchers at Rutgers University in the USA, in the medical field, and it was adapted and used in the field of PAHM for the first time by our group of researchers. Unlike the traditional approaches that are either based on mathematical and statistical models or neural network modelling, this approach is based only on the advancement in the field of computer science, namely the speed of computation and the volume of data that can be processed, and proceeds in a logical manner like the human brain. That is why its potential for future applications seems promising. LAD does not assume that the data belong to a specific statistical distribution and therefore does not require statistical analysis of data prior to or after its use. Unlike the statistically based techniques, correlations and dependence between features or variables do not have any effect on LAD's performance. LAD can handle this phenomenon, and moreover, it gives physical explanation to it. Unlike other data analysis techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines, LAD is a transparent method; the output of LAD can be traced back to the specific root causes that resulted in the categorization of a specific observation into a certain class. The interpretability of all the results and of all the steps of calculation is a clear advantage that maintenance experts can use in order to find answers to their questions. LAD detects and diagnoses complex phenomena such as equipment fault due to the interaction of multiple factors. Moreover, LAD is not based and does not need data on failure events. Thus, for physical assets that have a lifetime of 25 or 30 years, degradation can still be analyzed and maintenance decision can still be taken. During the learning process, LAD analyzes the collected data that represents readings of some physical asset's features such as vibration signals, oil analysis, temperature, etc..., which are taken while the asset is in different states, for example new, failing, deteriorating,, etc. It then generates patterns that can be easily interpreted and translated into meaningful physical rules. LAD automatically extracts features and generates patterns from the readings and, accordingly, classifies the asset into a certain state based on the patterns generated. The learning function of cbmLAD results in an accumulation and preservation of expert knowledge that can be used at any time by the user, even if the human expertise is lost due to retirement or resignation. It thus becomes a powerful knowledge management tool that automates and conserves knowledge. In the testing process LAD can detect and diagnose the asset's state based on the generated knowledge during the learning process. This process of learning and pattern generation serve to reinforce the theoretical knowledge and uncover new knowledge about a certain diagnostic problem in PAHM. LAD has been applied successful in different situations that will be presented in the following sections.

This longitudinal feasibility study examined the relationship between physical fitness, cognitive health, and quality of life among two groups of older adults: those on chemotherapy, and those who have completed chemotherapy. To assess cognitive health, we used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and demographic information from the Healthy Brain Questionnaire. For quality of life, we used the McGill Quality of Life assessment. Physical activity was assessed using Metabolic Equivalency Tasks from the Compendium of Physical Activities classification system. t-Tests and regression analyses indicated that at Time 1 those on chemotherapy had lower cognitive health scores than those off chemotherapy. Yet at Time 2, as physical activities increased, cognitive health and quality of life improved for those on chemotherapy. However, those who had completed chemotherapy also benefited from an increase in physical activities over time. The results have implications for health care practitioners in oncology settings to better inform patients of cognitive challenges resulting from chemotherapy and the importance of participation in physical activities. Future research should compare different age groups among a larger sample.

J	Zokagoa, JM; Soulaimani, A				Zokagoa, Jean-Marie; Soulaimani, Azzeddine			Low-order modelling of shallow water equations for sensitivity analysis using proper orthogonal decomposition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS			English	Article						reduced-order modelling; proper orthogonal decomposition; shallow water equations (SWEs); flood flows; sensitivity analysis	SCALE DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; RESPONSE-SURFACE; NEURAL-NETWORK; FLOWS; POD	This article presents a reduced-order model (ROM) of the shallow water equations (SWEs) for use in sensitivity analyses and Monte-Carlo type applications. Since, in the real world, some of the physical parameters and initial conditions embedded in free-surface flow problems are difficult to calibrate accurately in practice, the results from numerical hydraulic models are almost always corrupted with uncertainties. The main objective of this work is to derive a ROM that ensures appreciable accuracy and a considerable acceleration in the calculations so that it can be used as a surrogate model for stochastic and sensitivity analyses in real free-surface flow problems. The ROM is derived using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method coupled with Galerkin projections of the SWEs, which are discretised through a finite-volume method. The main difficulty of deriving an efficient ROM is the treatment of the nonlinearities involved in SWEs. Suitable approximations that provide rapid online computations of the nonlinear terms are proposed. The proposed ROM is applied to the simulation of hypothetical flood flows in the Bordeaux breakwater, a portion of the 'Riviere des Prairies' located near Laval (a suburb of Montreal, Quebec). A series of sensitivity analyses are performed by varying the Manning roughness coefficient and the inflow discharge. The results are satisfactorily compared to those obtained by the full-order finite volume model.

We here analyze T. darti in the context of therocephalian relationships and biology, using computed tomographic (CT) scanning to reveal details of the skull. Histological sections, as well as the degree of ossification of individual elements, both suggest that the available specimens are subadults (rather than rapidly growing neonates), and probably yearlings. A maxillary shelf bearing a long suture with the vomer similar to that of Lycideops is present, and T. darti also shares a nasal-lacrimal contact with that taxon. There is no evidence for the presence of maxilloturbinal bones. The postcranial skeleton is slender and similar to that of regisaurids and other small baurioids. The skull bones show clear indentations demarcating the major divisions of the brain, allowing one of the most detailed reconstructions of a non-mammalian therapsid brain published to date. The brain is strikingly plesiomorphic in many features, particularly in the retention of large dorsally positioned optic lobes of the tectum, but generally shows features that are intermediate between gorgonopsians and cynodonts, thus clarifying this stage of the evolution of the synapsid brain. A cladistic analysis of 33 therapsid taxa and 131 morphological characters supports the monophyly of Therocephalia, and there is evidence for a monophyletic Lycideopidae within Baurioidea. Lycideopidae contains species with long snouts, nasal-lacrimal contacts, and incipient secondary palates, including Lycideops, Choerosaurus, T. tenuis, and T. darti.

In the current paper, we focus on spatial abilities that are typically related to the dorsal visual pathway (i.e., spatial/motion processing). Bringing together evidence from cataract-reversal individuals, early- and late-blind individuals and sight-recovery cases of long-standing blindness, we suggest that the dorsal "spatial" pathway is mostly plastic early in life and is then more resistant to subsequent experience once it is set, highlighting some limits of neuroplasticity.

The effect of commonly used medication on subtle impairments in cognitive function may be under-recognized. Objective: The aim of the review was to examine the evidence attributing amnestic or non-amnestic cognitive impairment to the use of medication with anticholinergic, antihistamine, GABAergic or opioid effects. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of adults without underlying central nervous system disorders who underwent detailed neuropsychological testing prior to and after oral administration of drugs affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, GABAergic or opioid receptor pathways. Seventy-eight studies were identified, reporting 162 trials testing medication from the four targeted drug classes. Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data on the occurrence of amnestic, non-amnestic or combined cognitive deficits induced by each drug class. Only trials using validated neuropsychological tests were included. Quality of the evidence for each drug class was assessed based on consistency of results across trials and the presence of a dose-response gradient. Results: In studies of short-, intermediate- and long-acting benzodiazepine drugs (n = 68 trials), these drugs consistently induced both amnestic and non-amnestic cognitive impairments, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. H-1-antihistamine agents (n = 12) and tricyclic antidepressants (n = 15) induced non-amnestic deficits in attention and information processing. Non-benzodiazepine derivatives (n = 29) also produced combined deficits, but less consistently than benzodiazepine drugs. The evidence was inconclusive for the type of cognitive impairment induced by different bladder relaxant anti-muscarinics (n = 9) as well as for narcotic agents (n = 5) and antipsychotics (n = 5). Among healthy volunteers >60 years of age, low doses of commonly used medications such as lorazepam 0.5 mg, oxybutynin immediate release 5 mg and oxycodone 10 mg produced combined deficits. Conclusion: Non-amnestic mild cognitive deficits are consistently induced by first-generation antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants, while benzodiazepines provoke combined amnestic and non-amnestic impairments. Risk-benefit considerations should be discussed with patients in order to enable an informed choice about drug discontinuation or substitution to potentially reverse cognitive adverse effects.

Case study data suggest that lesions sustained early in childhood lead to better recovery compared to those that occur later in life. In these children, it is possible that neural reorganization had begun prior to surgery but was masked by the dysfunctional hemisphere. The degree of neural reorganization has been difficult to study systematically in human infants. Here we present a 20-year culmination of data on our nonhuman primate model (Chlorocebus sabeus) of early-life hemispherectomy in which behavioral recovery is interpreted in light of plastic processes that lead to the anatomical reorganization of the early-damaged brain. The model presented here suggests that significant functional recovery occurs after the removal of one hemisphere in monkeys with no preexisting neurological dysfunctions. Human and primate studies suggest a critical role for subcortical and brainstem structures as well as corticospinal tracts in the neuroanatomical reorganization which result in the remarkable behavioral recovery following hemispherectomy. The nonhuman primate model presented here offers a unique opportunity for studying the behavioral and functional neuroanatomical reorganization that underlies developmental plasticity.

We assessed cognition in Caucasian SLE women with elevated autoantibodies without overt neuropsychiatric syndromes, in conjunction with single photon emission computerized tomography ( SPECT). Methods: 31 women meeting SLE criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) were included. Patients who met the ACR neuropsychiatric definition were excluded. Matched controls were 23 healthy women from the Champagne-Ardenne region, France. Participants completed neuropsychological and autoantibodies measurements, and 19 completed SPECT. Results: 61% (19/31) of women with SLE and 53% (9/17) of those with normal SPECT had significant global cognitive impairment defined as 4 T-scores <40 in cognitive tests, compared to 0% ( 0/23) of controls. SLE women also had significantly greater cognitive dysfunction ( mean T-score) on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) visual backspan, Trail Making Test A and B, WAIS Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Stroop Interference, compared to controls. Elevated antinuclear antibody correlated with impairment in the WAIS visual span, WAIS visual backspan, and cancellation task; elevated anti-double-stranded DNA antibody and anticardiolipin correlated respectively with impairment in the Trail Making Test A and WAIS auditive backspan. Two SLE women had abnormal SPECT. Conclusions: A high prevalence of cognitive deficits was found in Caucasian SLE women compared to normal women, which included impairment in cognitive domains important for daily activities. Elevated autoantibodies tended to correlate with cognitive dysfunction. Copyright (c) 2012 S.

As a neuroimaging database represents a large volume of datasets and as neuroimaging processing pipelines are composed of heterogeneous, computationally intensive tools, such open sharing raises specific computational challenges. This motivates the design of novel dedicated computing infrastructures. This paper describes an interface between PSOM, a code-oriented pipeline development framework, and CBRAIN, a web-oriented platform for grid computing. This interface was used to integrate a PSOM-compliant pipeline for preprocessing of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging into CBRAIN. We further tested the capacity of our infrastructure to handle a real large-scale project. A neuroimaging database including close to 1000 subjects was preprocessed using our interface and publicly released to help the participants of the ADHD-200 international competition. This successful experiment demonstrated that our integrated grid-computing platform is a powerful solution for high-throughput pipeline analysis in the field of neuroimaging.

Using the Mouse Grimace Scale to Reevaluate the Efficacy of Postoperative Analgesics in Laboratory Mice	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article							RAT MODEL; INCISIONAL PAIN; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; WEIGHT-BEARING; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PLANTAR INCISION; 2 STRAINS; BUPRENORPHINE; BEHAVIOR	Postoperative pain management in animals is complicated greatly by the inability to recognize pain. As a result, the choice of analgesics and their doses has been based on extrapolation from greatly differing pain models or the use of measures with unclear relevance to pain. We recently developed the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS), a facial-expression-based pain coding system adapted directly from scales used in nonverbal human populations. The MGS has shown to be a reliable, highly accurate measure of spontaneous pain of moderate duration, and therefore is particularly useful in the quantification of postoperative pain. In the present study, we quantified the relative intensity and duration of postoperative pain after a sham ventral ovariectomy (laparotomy) in outbred mice. In addition, we compiled dose-response data for 4 commonly used analgesics: buprenorphine, carprofen, ketoprofen, and acetaminophen. We found that postoperative pain in mice, as defined by facial grimacing, lasts for 36 to 48 h, and appears to show relative exacerbation during the early dark (active) photophase. We find that buprenorphine was highly effective in inhibiting postoperative pain-induced facial grimacing in mice at doses equal to or lower than current recommendations, that carprofen and ketoprofen are effective only at doses markedly higher than those currently recommended, and that acetaminophen was ineffective at any dose used. We suggest the revision of practices for postoperative pain management in mice in light of these findings.

Local and global components of texture-surround suppression of contour-shape coding	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						texture; contour; shape; surround-suppression; adaptation; aftereffect; crowding	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD INHIBITION; AREA V4; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; RESPONSES; SELECTIVITY; INTEGRATION; SIGNALS; MONKEY	Evidence that contour-shapes and texture-shapes are processed by different mechanisms included the finding that contour-shape aftereffects are reduced when the adaptation stimulus is a texture made of contours rather than a single contour. This phenomenon has been termed texture-surround suppression of contour-shape, or TSSCS. How does TSSCS operate and over what spatial extent? We measured the postadaptation shift in the apparent shape frequency of a single sinusoidal-shaped contour as a function of the number of contours in the adaptor stimulus. Contours were Gabor strings in which the Gabor orientations were either tangential (snakes) or orthogonal (ladders) to the path of the contour. We found that for extended surrounds, the aftereffect was strongly reduced when the surround contours were the same as the central adaptor contour, but not when the Gabors making up the surround contours were opposite-in-orientation to those of the central adaptor. For near surrounds, the aftereffect in a snake contour was unaffected by same-orientation but strongly suppressed by opposite-orientation surrounds, whereas the aftereffect for a ladder-contour was suppressed equally by both same- and opposite-orientation near surrounds. Finally, the strength of surround suppression decreased gradually with increasing spatial separation between center and surround. These results indicate that there are two components to texture-surround suppression in our shape aftereffect: one that is sensitive to opposite-orientation texture surrounds, operates locally, and disrupts contour-processing; the other that is sensitive to same- orientation texture surrounds, is spatially extended, and prevents the shape of the contour from being processed as a contour. We also demonstrate that the observed shape aftereffects are not due to changes in the apparent shape-frequency of the adaptors or the precision with which their shape-frequency is encoded, indicating that TSSCS is not an instance of crowding.

These two findings raise two questions: (1) is texture-surround suppression of contour shape color selective, and (2) is texture-shape processing color selective? To answer these questions, we measured the shape-frequency aftereffect using contours constructed from strings of Gabors defined along the red-green, blue-yellow, and luminance axes of cardinal color space. The stimuli were either single sinusoidal-shaped contours or textures made of sinusoidal-shaped contours arranged in parallel. We measured aftereffects for (a) single-contour adaptors and single-contour tests defined along the same versus different cardinal directions, (b) texture adaptors and single-contour tests in which the central-adaptor contour/single-contour test and surround adaptor contours were defined along the same versus different cardinal directions, and (c) texture adaptors and texture tests defined along same versus different cardinal directions. We found that color selectivity was most prominent for contour-shape processing, weaker for texture-surround suppression of contour-shape processing, and absent for texture-shape processing.

The neurophysiologic substrate for such lasting deficits remains unclear. There is a lack of objective measures of early brain abnormalities following mild TBI, which could shed light on the genesis of these lasting impairments. Methods: Here we report findings in a previously healthy man tested 2 and 6 weeks after a well-documented concussion. Findings were compared with 12 control subjects. All subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). Testing included neuropsychological evaluation and physiological assessment with TMS and EEG, excitatory/inhibitory balance and brain plasticity. Results: While the MRI, DTI and neuropsychological evaluations showed no abnormalities, neurophysiologic tests revealed subclinical abnormalities in our patient: (1) Significantly higher intracortical facilitation than the control group at both time points; (2) Intracortical inhibition presumably mediated by GABA(B) receptors was absent at week 2, but returned to normal value at week 6; (3) Abnormal mechanisms of plasticity at week 2, that normalize at week 6. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate a transient alteration of brain cortical physiology following concussion independent of anatomical findings and neuropsychological function. This case study suggests that TMS measures may serve as sensitive biomarkers of physiologic brain abnormalities after concussion.

In the past four decades, several animal models have illuminated our understanding of the biological substrates involved in cross-modal plasticity. Progressively, studies are now starting to emphasise on cell-specific mechanisms that may be responsible for this intermodal sensory plasticity. Inhibitory interneurons expressing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) play an important role in maintaining the appropriate dynamic range of cortical excitation, in critical periods of developmental plasticity, in receptive field refinement, and in treatment of sensory information reaching the cerebral cortex. The diverse interneuron population is very sensitive to sensory experience during development. GABAergic neurons are therefore well suited to act as a gate for mediating cross-modal plasticity. This paper attempts to highlight the links between early sensory deprivation, cortical GABAergic interneuron alterations, and cross-modal plasticity, discuss its implications, and further provide insights for future research in the field.

However, it is not certain whether such crossmodal recruitment can occur in the absence of explicit conditioning, semantic factors, or long-term associations. A recent study demonstrated that crossmodal cortical recruitment can occur even after a brief exposure to bimodal stimuli without semantic association. In addition, the authors showed that the primary visual cortex is under such crossmodal influence. In the present study, we used molecular activity mapping of the immediate early gene zif268. We found that animals, which had previously been exposed to a combination of auditory and visual stimuli, showed increased number of active neurons in the primary visual cortex when presented with sounds alone. As previously implied, this crossmodal activation appears to be the result of implicit associations of the two stimuli, likely driven by their spatiotemporal characteristics; it was observed after a relatively short period of exposure (similar to 45 min) and lasted for a relatively long period after the initial exposure (similar to 1day). These results suggest that the previously reported findings may be directly rooted in the increased activity of the neurons occupying the primary visual cortex.

Congenitally blind and blindfolded sighted control subjects were scanned after they had been trained during four consecutive days to perform a tactile-form recognition task with the tongue display unit (TDU). Both groups learned the task at the same rate. In line with our hypothesis, the fMRI data showed that during nonhaptic shape recognition, blind subjects activated large portions of the ventral visual stream, including the cuneus, precuneus, inferotemporal (IT), cortex, lateral occipital tactile vision area (LOtv), and fusiform gyrus. Control subjects activated area LOtv and precuneus but not cuneus, IT and fusiform gyrus. These results indicate that congenitally blind subjects recruit key regions in the ventral visual pathway during nonhaptic tactile shape discrimination. The activation of LOtv by nonhaptic tactile shape processing in blind and sighted subjects adds further support to the notion that this area subserves an abstract or supramodal representation of shape. Together with our previous findings, our data suggest that the segregation of the efferent projections of the primary visual cortex into a dorsal and ventral visual stream is preserved in individuals blind from birth.

The total sample was made up of 1,497 subjects from Belgium, Canada, France, and Switzerland. The internal consistencies for all countries were generally similar to those found for the normative U.S. and Spanish samples. A factor analysis confirmed that the normative structure replicated well and was stable within this French-speaking context. Moreover, multigroup confirmatory factor analyses have shown that the ZKA-PQ reaches scalar invariance across these 4 countries. Mean scores were slightly different for women and men, with women scoring higher on Neuroticism but lower on Sensation Seeking. Globally, mean score differences across countries were small. Overall, the ZKA-PQ seems an interesting alternative to assess both lower and higher order personality traits for applied or research purposes.

The sudden transition from the womb to the overly noisy world of the NICU increases the vulnerability of these high-risk newborns. There is a growing concern that the excess noise typically experienced by NICU infants disrupts their growth and development, putting them at risk for hearing, language, and cognitive disabilities. Preterm neonates are especially sensitive to noise because their auditory system is at a critical period of neurodevelopment, and they are no longer shielded by maternal tissue. This paper discusses the developmental milestones of the auditory system and suggests ways to enhance the quality control and type of sounds delivered to NICU infants. We argue that positive auditory experience is essential for early brain maturation and may be a contributing factor for healthy neurodevelopment. Further research is needed to optimize the hospital environment for preterm newborns and to increase their potential to develop into healthy children.

The advantages of conditioning procedures are offset by high attrition rates and restrictions on the stimuli that can be used. The head-turn preference procedure is more user-friendly but poses greater interpretive challenges. In view of the multidimensional nature of infant attention, no single response measure, whether behavioral, physiological, or neural, can provide unambiguous information about music processing in infancy. Greater use of ecologically valid stimuli is likely to generate increased cooperation from infants and greater generality of the findings.

The idea of a sensitive period-a window during maturation when our brains are most influenced by behavior-has been proposed. Work from our laboratory has shown that early-trained musicians (ET) performed better on visual-motor and auditory-motor synchronization tasks than late-trained musicians (LT), even when matched for total musical experience. Although the groups of musicians showed no cognitive differences, working memory scores correlated with task performance. In this study, we have replicated these findings in a larger sample of musicians and included a group of highly educated nonmusicians (NM). Participants performed six woodblock rhythms of varying levels of metrical complexity and completed cognitive subtests measuring verbal abilities, working memory, and pattern recognition. Working memory scores correlated with task performance across all three groups. Interestingly, verbal abilities were stronger among the NM, while nonverbal abilities were stronger among musicians. These findings are discussed in context of the sensitive period hypothesis as well as the debate surrounding cognitive differences between musicians and NM.

This paper describes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies requiring manipulation of musical information. In one set of experiments, listeners were asked to mentally reverse a familiar tune when presented backwards. This manipulation consistently elicits neural activity in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Separate experiments requiring judgments about melodies that have been transposed from one musical key to another also elicit IPS activation. Conjunction analyses indicate that the same portions of the IPS are recruited in both tasks. The findings suggest that the dorsal pathway of auditory processing is involved in the manipulation and transformation of auditory information, as has also been shown for visuomotor and visuospatial tasks. As such, it provides a substrate for the creation of new mental representations that are based on manipulation of previously experienced sensory events.

Studies in vision have reported enhanced detailed ("local") processing but diminished holistic ("global") processing of visual features in ASD. Individuals with ASD also show enhanced processing of simple visual stimuli but diminished processing of complex visual stimuli. Relative to the visual domain, auditory global-local distinctions, and the effects of stimulus complexity on auditory processing in ASD, are less clear. However, one remarkable finding is that many individuals with ASD have enhanced musical abilities, such as superior pitch processing. This review provides a critical evaluation of behavioral and brain imaging studies of auditory processing with respect to current theories in ASD. We have focused on auditory-musical processing in terms of global versus local processing and simple versus complex sound processing. This review contributes to a better understanding of auditory processing differences in ASD.

The VSL involves various components, including perceptual mechanisms, auditory-motor mapping, motor control, and memory. The malfunction of one of these components can bring about poor-pitch singing. So far, disturbed perception and deficient sensorimotor mapping have been treated as important causes of poor singing. Yet, memory has been paid relatively little attention. Here, we review results obtained from both occasional singers and individuals suffering from congenital amusia, who were asked to produce from memory or imitate a well-known melody under conditions with different memory loads. The findings point to memory as a relevant source of impairment in poor-pitch singing and to imitation as a useful aid for poor singers.

It provides a schedule manager as well as the possibility to report occurrences of symptomatic experiences. Receiving this information by Internet, caregivers can assist the patient rehabilitation process. Our aim was to explore the use and satisfaction of Mobus by people with schizophrenia. Nine outpatients tested Mobus for 6 weeks. Indicators of cognitive functioning and autonomy were measured with the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB) and the Independant Living Skills Scale (ILSS). On average, 42.6% of the planned ADL were validated and more than 1 symptom per week were reported. Mainly because of technical breakdown, more than 50% of the outpatients evaluated the Mobus satisfaction below 1.7/5, nevertheless 3 participants appreciated it greatly. Some enhancements were found on subscales of CANTAB and ILSS and some participants reported that they acquired planning skills by using Mobus. To ensure ease of use, refinements are needed from rehabilitation and technical approaches, especially to personalize the device. Discussions on ethical and methodological issues lead to an improved version of Mobus that will be tested with a larger sample size.

Using a two-hit rat model, with a neonatal freeze lesion mimicking a focal cortical malformation combined with hyperthermia-induced seizures mimicking febrile seizures, we have previously reported an increase of inhibition in CA1 pyramidal cells at P20. Here, we investigated the changes affecting excitatory and inhibitory drive onto CA1 interneurons to better define the changes in CA1 inhibitory networks and their paradoxical role in epileptogenesis, using electrophysiological recordings in CA1 hippocampus from rat pups (16-20 d old). We investigated interneurons in CA1 hippocampal area located in stratum oriens (Or) and at the border of strata lacunosum and moleculare (L-M). Our results revealed an increase of the excitatory drive to both types of interneurons with no change in the inhibitory drive. The mechanisms underlying the increase of excitatory synaptic currents (EPSCs) in both types of interneurons are different. In Or interneurons, the amplitude of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs increased, while their frequency was not affected suggesting changes at the post-synaptic level. In L-M interneurons, the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs increases, but the amplitude is not affected. Analyses of miniature EPSCs showed no changes in both their frequency and amplitude. We concluded that L-M interneurons increase in excitatory drive is due to a change in Shaffer collateral axon excitability. The changes described here in CA1 inhibitory network may actually contribute to the epileptogenicity observed in this dual pathology model by increasing pyramidal cell synchronization.

This method shares similarities with the Mean-shift algorithm, as it finds the modes of the intensity histogram of images. However, unlike Mean-shift, our proposed method is stochastic and also provides class membership probabilities. Also, unlike other random-walk based methods, our approach does not require any form of user interaction, and can scale to very large images. To illustrate the usefulness, efficiency and scalability of our method, we test it on the task of segmenting anatomical structures present in cardiac CT and brain MRI images.

The aim of this article is to discuss the use of machine learning and discrimination methods and their possible application to the analysis of infant event-related potential (ERP) data. The usefulness of two methods, regularized discriminant function analyses and support vector machines, will be demonstrated by reanalyzing an ERP dataset from infants (Elsabbagh et al., 2009). Using cross-validation, both methods successfully discriminated above chance between groups of infants at high and low risk of a later diagnosis of autism. The suitability of machine learning methods for the use of single trial or averaged ERP data is discussed.

Cyclin D1 Induction Preceding Neuronal Death via the Excitotoxic NMDA Pathway Involves Selective Stimulation of Extrasynaptic NMDA Receptors and JNK Pathway	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Alzheimers and Parkinsons Diseases (AD/PD)	MAR 09-13, 2011	Barcelona, SPAIN			Neuronal death; Extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors; c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase pathway; Cyclin D1; Cell cycle re-entry; Excitotoxicity	PROGRAMMED CELL-DEATH; D-ASPARTATE RECEPTORS; N-TERMINAL KINASE; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; DEPENDENT KINASES; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IN-VIVO	The N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDARs) signals both prosurvival and death-inducing (excitotoxic) neuronal responses via synaptically (synaptic NMDAR) and extrasynaptically (extrasynaptic NMDAR) located receptor pools, respectively. Both receptor pools share similar, though not identical, postreceptor signaling molecules. The activation of the extrasynaptic NMDAR pathway is predominant. Therefore, in order to inhibit the extrasynaptic death pathway while sparing synaptic responses, it is critical to identify selective postreceptor effectors of extrasynaptic NMDARs. The present study addressed these issues by using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and a pharmacological protocol of selective NMDAR stimulation for Western blot and immunocytochemistry analyses. We found that the activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs, either alone or together with synaptic NMDARs, triggers cyclin-D1-associated re-entry into the cell cycle, which does not proceed beyond the S-phase. This aberrant cell cycle re-entry is particularly associated with neuronal death triggered specifically via extrasynaptic NMDAR-induced c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). In addition, NMDA-elicited neuronal death was significantly inhibited by pharmacological blockade of JNK-mediated cyclin D1 expression or by silencing cyclin D1 RNA. Taken together, these data suggest a causal relationship between cyclin D1 induction and extrasynaptic NMDAR-triggered neuronal death along the excitotoxic NMDA pathway. Therefore, cyclin D1 may be a putative target for the development of neuroprotective strategies sparing physiological synaptic NMDAR signaling. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

Investigations on the early stages of the amyloid pathology are crucial for the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers or new therapeutic targets. Our transgenic (tg) animal models are most suitable to study early AD pathological events, as the pathology evolves in a well-staged manner, starting with intracellular A beta accumulation and ending with plaque deposition. Objective: To determine the occurrence of key inflammatory markers and to look for signs of nerve growth factor (NGF) dysmetabolism at preplaque and postplaque stages in tg models of AD-like amyloid pathology and in human AD brains. Methods: We used our own tg lines (mice and rat), high-quality human brain material and applied neurochemical and immunohistochemical experimental approaches. Results: In both tg models, we observed an intracellular accumulation of oligomeric A beta in cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. This coincided with an upregulation of key inflammatory markers (iNOS, MHCII, COX-2) and a recruitment of microglia towards A beta-burdened neurons. Using human AD brains, we showed alterations in the NGF metabolic pathway, which were mirrored in our tg rat model at early and late stages of amyloid plaque generation. Conclusion: A proinflammatory process and, consequently, the deregulation of the NGF metabolic pathway could be amongst the earliest pathological events in the progression of AD.

At approximately 3 months postpartum, 22 mothers completed an affect-rating task (ART) during fMRI, where their affective response to infant stimuli was explicitly probed. Mothers viewed/rated four infant face conditions: own positive (OP), own negative (ON), unfamiliar positive (UP), and unfamiliar negative (UN). Mood and anxiety were measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EDPS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Version (STAI-T); maternal factors related to parental stress and attachment were also assessed. Brain-imaging data underwent a random-effects analysis, and cluster-based statistical thresholding was applied to the following contrasts: OP-UP, ON-UN, OP-ON, and UP-UN. Our main finding was that poorer quality of maternal experience was significantly related to reduced amygdala response to OP compared to UP infant faces. Our results suggest that, in human mothers, infant-related amygdala function may be an important factor in maternal anxiety/mood, in quality of mothering, and in individual differences in the motivation to mother.

Although several studies have described the evolution of cerebral cortical development ex vivo or ex utero, to date, very few studies have characterized and quantified the gyrification process for the in vivo fetal brain. Recent advances in fetal magnetic resonance imaging and post-processing computational methods are providing new insights into fetal brain maturation in vivo. In this study, we investigate the in vivo fetal cortical folding pattern in healthy fetuses between 25 and 35 weeks gestational age using 3-D reconstructed fetal cortical surfaces. We describe the in vivo fetal gyrification process using a robust feature extraction algorithm applied directly on the cortical surface, providing an explicit delineation of the sulcal pattern during fetal brain development. We also delineate cortical surface measures, including surface area and gyrification index.

The authors propose that emotional arousal decreases over the brand relationship span, while inclusion of the brand into the self increases over time. Results of experiment 1 indicate greater self-reported emotional arousal for recently formed brand relationships, as well as decreased emotional arousal and increased inclusion of close brands over time. Additionally, the moderating role of usage frequency of the brand brings out an interesting nuance of the way these effects operate. Experiment 2 measures skin conductance responses and reveals increased emotional arousal for recently formed close relationships but not for established close brand relationships, corroborating the results based on self-reported data. In experiment 3, a functional magnetic resonance imaging study reveals an association between established close relationships and activation of the insula, a brain area previously found to be a crucial mechanism in diverse but related psychological phenomena such as urging, addiction, loss aversion, and interpersonal love.

Training distributed over time (spaced training) is superior at generating long-term memories than training presented with little or no rest interval (massed training). This spacing effect was observed in a range of organisms from invertebrates to humans. In the present paper, we discuss the evidence supporting cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein 2 (CREB), a transcription factor, as being an important molecule mediating long-term memory formation after spaced training. We also review the main upstream proteins that regulate CREB in different model organisms. Those include the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF2 alpha), protein phosphatase I (PP1), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the protein tyrosine phosphatase corkscrew. Finally, we discuss PKC activation and protein synthesis and degradation as mechanisms by which neurons decode the spacing intervals.

A second objective was to study the impact of three types of problem selected according to the presence or absence of a "trigger." A trigger (T) is an incitation to the participant, at the first move, to move a ball to its final position according to the model. A positive trigger (T+) is helpful, while a negative trigger (T-) creates an obstruction. Some problems have no trigger (N). This study includes 81 participants with MCI. After follow-up, one year later, two subgroups were distinguished: (a) 51 (63%) participants did not convert or decline (stable MCI); (b) 30 (37%) participants showed significant decline or progressed to dementia (decliner MCI). Persons with MCI were compared to an older adult group matched with respect to sex, age, and education. For the successes, there was a significant group difference between the three types of problem. The post hoc analysis showed that T+ took significantly less time than N or T-. There were significantly more successes for T+ than N, and these two types of problem had more success than T-. For "total number of moves," there was no significant difference between the groups. In post hoc analysis, T-involved more moves than N or T+. In qualitative analysis, T-MCI decliners produced significantly more rule breakings than the stable MCI and controls. A dysfunction in self-monitoring is a characteristic feature of persons with MCI.

J	Potvin, S; Stavro, K; Pelletier, J				Potvin, Stephane; Stavro, Katherine; Pelletier, Julie			Paradoxical Cognitive Capacities in Dual Diagnosis Schizophrenia: The Quest for Explanatory Factors	JOURNAL OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS			English	Review						schizophrenia; substance use disorder; cognition	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER; CANNABIS USE DISORDERS; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION; DRUG-ABUSE; FOLLOW-UP; PSYCHIATRIC OUTPATIENTS; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS	Objective: Individuals with either schizophrenia or a substance use disorder have been shown to independently display cognitive deficits. Patients with schizophrenia who abuse psychoactive substances should then arguably display an aggravation in cognitive impairment. However, cognitive integrity among individuals with dual diagnosis remains paradoxical, with some studies reporting dysfunction and others reporting preservation. Methods: A literature search of PubMed and PsycInfo was conducted using the following major inclusion criteria: (a) schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, (b) presence or absence of a substance use disorder, and (c) measures of cognitive function. Results: Young patients with schizophrenia and comorbid substance abuse typically display better cognitive abilities than older individuals with dual diagnosis. Also, depending on the type of task assessed, cognition either remains relatively intact (e.g., psychomotor speed), dysfunctional (e.g., verbal memory), or ambiguous (e.g., impulsivity). Performance on tasks of impulsivity, however, remains particularly difficult to interpret, most probably due to the complexity of the multidimensional construct of this cognitive domain. Finally, depending on the preference of psychoactive substance used, some individuals with dual diagnosis exhibit better cognitive function (e.g., cannabis), while others display marked decreases on task performance (e.g., alcohol), relative to those with schizophrenia only. Conclusions: Age, type of cognitive function measured, and type of psychoactive substance abused appear to be three factors that interact to contribute to the array of current findings among patients with dual diagnoses of schizophrenia and substance use disorder.

However, this classic dichotomy has struggled to explain a wealth of new data demonstrating that behaviourally and biologically relevant visual stimuli, like arrow and eye direction, elicit shifts of spatial attention that on the one hand, appear exogenous, and on the other hand, endogenous. To address this issue, we used a double-cueing task that combined arrows with classic cues known to invoke either exogenous or endogenous orienting. Our data suggest that behaviourally relevant directional cues, like arrows, engage a new form of cortically mediated orienting-automated symbolic orienting-that operates independent of, and in parallel with, the two classic forms of exogenous and endogenous spatial attention.

In the present study, we characterized the toxicity of amyloid-beta (A beta) on hippocampal GABAergic neurons both in vivo and in vitro. In the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD, we found a significant decrease in the number of hippocampal neurons immunoreactive for glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), the enzyme synthesizing GABA. This decrease, which was specific for hippocampal CA1-3 fields, was observed at 6 months of age, long after the overproduction of soluble A beta(42) (between 2 and 4 months) and accumulation of insoluble A beta into amyloid plaques (between 4 and 6 months). In vitro, neurotoxicity was observed in primary hippocampal cultures 72 h following the addition of A beta(42) solutions containing a mixture of soluble oligomers. Taken together, our results suggest that when cultured and exposed to A beta in vitro, GABAergic neurons are susceptible to A beta(42) neurotoxicity. However, in TgCRND8 mice, the number of GABAergic neurons is not altered up to 6 months, in spite of the massive A beta load. Combined with the previously reported increased sensitivity to seizures observed in younger (1.5-2 month-old) TgCRND8 mice, it is likely that A beta toxicity leads to GABAergic neuron dysfunction prior to their losses at a later stage.

We reviewed mainstream national and international human research ethics guidelines and policies on issues of public communication of research. Our analysis relied on five thematic nets to capture the interactions between research and the public: public understanding, knowledge translation, public participation, social outcomes, and dual use. Coverage of these topics is sparse and inconsistent in mainstream policies and guidelines. We identify three options to address these gaps and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.

It involves generating a pseudo-ultrasound (pseudo-US) from a segmented MR image and uses cross-correlation as the cost function to register the pseudo-US to the real ultrasound data. The algorithm's performance is compared with that of a state-of-the-art technique that uses a median-filtered MR image to register to a Gaussian-blurred ultrasound using a normalized mutual information (NMI) objective function. Methods The two methods were tested on data from 15 patients with brain tumor, including low-and high-grade gliomas, in both first operations and reoperations. Two metrics were used to evaluate registration accuracy: (1) the mean distance between corresponding points, identified on both MR and ultrasound images by two experts, and (2) ratings based on visual comparison by one neurosurgeon. Results The mean residual distance of the pseudo-US technique, 2.97mm, is significantly more accurate (p =. 0011) than that of the NMI approach, 4.86mm. The visual assessment shows that only 4 of the 15 cases had a satisfactory initial alignment based on homologous skin-point registration. There is a significant correlation between the quantitative distance measures and the qualitative ratings (rho=0.785). Conclusion The results show that the pseudo-US rigid registration technique robustly improves the MRI-ultrasound alignment when compared with the initial alignment, even when applied to highly distorted brains and a large range of tumor sizes and appearances.

J	Clement, F; Belleville, S				Clement, Francis; Belleville, Sylvie			Effect of Disease Severity on Neural Compensation of Item and Associative Recognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; cognition; episodic memory; functional magnetic resonance imaging	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EPISODIC MEMORY; OLDER-ADULTS; FAMILIARITY; RECOLLECTION; ACTIVATION; RETRIEVAL; FMRI; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE	It is proposed that the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease is associated with additional brain activation in key regions involved in memory, reflecting compensatory brain plasticity. Very little is known, however, about the evolution of these compensatory mechanisms as the brain acquires more damage. We conducted an fMRI memory study measuring brain activation related to old/new (item recognition) and intact/rearranged (associative recognition) word-pair recognition paradigms in 26 persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 14 healthy older adults. The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale was used to divide persons with MCI into those with higher and lower cognitive performances. Results indicated more brain activation in MCIs than in controls but disease severity determined which cognitive process was associated with larger activation: Persons with less severe MCI showed hyperactivation during associative recognition only, whereas persons with more severe MCI showed hyperactivation during item recognition only. These hyperactivations were found mainly in brain areas that are typically associated with retrieval mode (e. g., bilateral prefrontal cortex). These findings indicate that neural plasticity occurs during the entire MCI phase but that it is associated with different cognitive components. As they progress in the disease, individuals with MCI will experience a breakdown in the compensatory mechanisms for associative recognition accompanied by emergence of compensatory mechanisms for item recognition.

Concurrent with the ongoing enhancement of ultrafast imaging has been the development of innovative image-processing techniques that are enabling us to capture and quantify the exuberant growth, and organizational and remodeling processes that occur during fetal brain development. This paper provides an overview of the role of advanced neuroimaging techniques to study in vivo brain maturation and explores the application of a range of new quantitative imaging biomarkers that can be used clinically to monitor high-risk pregnancies.

J	Timmermann, L; Florin, E				Timmermann, Lars; Florin, Esther			Parkinson's disease and pathological oscillatory activity: Is the beta band the bad guy? - New lessons learned from low-frequency deep brain stimulation	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Neuromodulation; Bradykinesia; Deep brain stimulation; L-DOPA	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; RESTING TREMOR; IMPROVEMENT; MOVEMENT	A number of studies have identified pathological neural oscillations in Parkinson's disease and it is widely agreed that these excessive synchronizations are linked to the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is still under debate if there exists a single frequency having a critical negative influence on PD symptoms and what this frequency might be. To provide experimental evidence for a causal link between beta oscillations and bradykinesia, C. C. Chen and coauthors stimulated patients with Parkinson's disease with different low frequencies while the patients were performing a grip force task [C. C. Chen, W. Y. Lin, H.L. Chan, Y.T. Hsu, P.H. Tu, S.T. Lee, S.M. Chiou, C.H. Tsai, CS. Lu, P. Brown: Stimulation of the subthalamic region at 20 Hz slows the development of grip force in Parkinson's disease, Exp. Neurology, 2011]. In their study the authors could demonstrate a 15% slowing in the grip force task during 20 Hz stimulation, but not during stimulation with other frequencies. The finding of 20 Hz being the driving pathological frequency contrasts with previous studies using e.g. finger tapping, where 5 and 10 Hz had the largest influence. Thus, this study provides evidence that there is no single pathological oscillation frequency that is responsible for all Parkinsonian symptoms. Instead, the results indicate that the modulation of very specific frequencies leads to changes in specific performance parameters evaluated in particular tasks. In this respect, this study also provides more physiological evidence on the involvement of the STN in dynamic force production. Taken together, the study adds a further piece to the puzzle of understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation.

However, the extent and the neural basis of this impairment remain unknown. The aim of the present study was: 1) to evaluate whether all or only a subset of semantic domains are impaired in MCI patients; and 2) to assess the neural substrate of the semantic impairment in MCI patients using voxel-based analysis of MR grey matter density and SPECT perfusion. 29 predominantly amnestic MCI patients and 29 matched control subjects participated in this study. All subjects underwent a full neuropsychological assessment, along with a battery of five tests evaluating different domains of semantic memory. A semantic memory composite Z-score was established on the basis of this battery and was correlated with MRI grey matter density and SPECT perfusion measures. MCI patients were found to have significantly impaired performance across all semantic tasks, in addition to their anterograde memory deficit. Moreover, no temporal gradient was found for famous faces or famous public events and knowledge for the most remote decades was also impaired. Neuroimaging analyses revealed correlations between semantic knowledge and perirhinal/entorhinal areas as well as the anterior hippocampus. Therefore, the deficits in the realm of semantic memory in patients with MCI is more widespread than previously thought and related to dysfunction of brain areas beyond the limbic-diencephalic system involved in episodic memory. The severity of the semantic impairment may indicate a decline of semantic memory that began many years before the patients first consulted.

We sought to describe the polysomnographic respiratory characteristics in patients with UDP without obstructive sleep apnea. Methods: We prospectively collected 5 cases with clinical investigation regarding symptoms, lung function, and nocturnal polysomnography. The respiratory sleep characteristics were analyzed with standardized scoring of respiratory events in 30-sec epochs and comparison according to sleep-wake stages and body position with respect to oximetry. The cases were compared to 5 controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index. Results: Three of 5 patients had significant awake lung restriction with a mean (range) forced vital capacity of 1.89 (1.48-2.24) liters, 72% (45% to 102%) predicted. All had REM sleep with few apneas and episodes of prolonged hypopneas characterized by important desaturation noted on oximetry. These desaturations were greatest during REM sleep when the patients slept supine with a mean (SD) saturation of 90.8% (4.5%) and minimum of 64% or on the side unaffected by UDP with a mean saturation of 87.8% (5.3%) and minimum of 67% (p < 0.0001 compared to same positions awake). Other sleep stages had few, if any significant desaturations and these events rarely occurred when the patient slept in the supine position. Saturation was lower in all sleep-wake stages and sleep positions compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Patients with UDP demonstrate position-dependent hypopneas in REM sleep with frequent desaturations.

Surface-attached amphipathic peptides reduce hemorrhage in vivo	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY			English	Article						Amphipathic peptide; coagulation; hemorrhage	2 ADVANCED DRESSINGS; HEMOSTATIC EFFICACY; GROIN INJURY; MODEL; SWINE; AGENT; MORPHOLOGY; HYDROGELS; ADHESION; GLUE	BACKGROUND: The leading causes of death for trauma patients in civilian and combat settings are traumatic brain injury and uncontrolled hemorrhage, respectively. This study examines the hemostatic activity of an ideal amphipathic peptide (IAP) attached to a biocompatible surface. METHODS: Procoagulant properties of IAP attached to a surface were first tested, in vitro, using factor Xa and thrombin generation assays and thromboelastography. Rabbits and swine were used for in vivo studies. Injuries were performed using scalpel blade 11, and free bleeding was allowed for five seconds. While bleeding, IAP coupled to a hydrogel or QuikClot were applied to the wound and the time was recorded until bleeding stopped. RESULTS: Results show that when IAP is attached to a surface, both factor IXa and factor Xa activities are promoted. Thromboelastography shows that surface-attached IAP results in earlier onset and stronger clot formation. In rabbits, the incorporation of IAP onto a biocompatible hydrogel reduces bleeding times by 40% (p < 0.03). In pigs, bleeding times are reduced 30% to 50% (p < 0.02) by surface-coupled IAP. Finally, using a rabbit liver laceration model, the properties of surface-coupled IAP are less damaging when compared with QuikClot, a currently used material in external hemorrhagic injuries. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a relevant proof of concept for the development of IAP coupled to a biocompatible surface as a hemostatic agent, that is potentially safer than the commercially available QuikClot.

Specifically, MEG recordings were used to investigate the neural and functional correlates of the pre-attentive ability for detection of deviance, from a statistically learned tone sequence. The effect of long-term musical training in this ability is investigated by means of comparison of MMN in musicians to non-musicians. Both groups (musicians and non-musicians) showed a mismatch negativity (MMN) response to the deviants and this response did not differ amongst them neither in amplitude nor in latency. Another interesting finding of this study is that both groups revealed a significant difference between the standards and the deviants in the response of P50 and this difference was significantly larger in the group of musicians. The increase of this difference in the group of musicians underlies that intensive, specialized and long term exercise can enhance the ability of the auditory cortex to discriminate new auditory events from previously learned ones according to transitional probabilities. A behavioral discrimination task between the standard and the deviant sequences followed the MEG measurement. The behavioral results indicated that the detection of deviance was not explicitly learned by either group, probably due to the lack of attentional resources. These findings provide valuable insights on the functional architecture of statistical learning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effective Tactile Noise Facilitates Visual Perception	SEEING AND PERCEIVING			English	Article						Multisensory integration; fulcrum principle; stochastic resonance	STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; SYSTEM	The fulcrum principle establishes that a subthreshold excitatory signal (entering in one sense) that is synchronous with a facilitation signal (entering in a different sense) can be increased (up to a resonant-like level) and then decreased by the energy and frequency content of the facilitating signal. As a result, the sensation of the signal changes according to the excitatory signal strength. In this context, the sensitivity transitions represent the change from subthreshold activity to a firing activity in multisensory neurons. Initially the energy of their activity (supplied by the weak signals) is not enough to be detected but when the facilitating signal enters the brain, it generates a general activation among multisensory neurons, modifying their original activity. In our opinion, the result is an integrated activation that promotes sensitivity transitions and the signals are then perceived. In other words, the activity created by the interaction of the excitatory signal (e.g., visual) and the facilitating signal (tactile noise) at some specific energy, produces the capability for a central detection of an otherwise weak signal. In this work we investigate the effect of an effective tactile noise on visual perception. Specifically we show that tactile noise is capable of decreasing luminance modulated thresholds.

Correlation of Amyloid PET Ligand Florbetapir F 18 Binding With A beta Aggregation and Neuritic Plaque Deposition in Postmortem Brain Tissue	ALZHEIMER DISEASE & ASSOCIATED DISORDERS			English	Article						PET imaging; Alzheimer disease; A beta plaque; autoradiography; A beta; amyloid PET imaging; florbetapir F 18; F-18-AV-45; postmortem	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; PROTEIN; TRACER; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; REFLECTS	Background: Florbetapir F 18 (F-18-AV-45) is a positron emission tomography imaging ligand for the detection of amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer disease. Earlier data showed that florbetapir F 18 binds with high affinity to beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques in human brain homogenates (Kd = 3.7 nM) and has favorable imaging pharmacokinetic properties, including rapid brain penetration and washout. This study used human autopsy brain tissue to evaluate the correlation between in vitro florbetapir F 18 binding and A beta density measured by established neuropathologic methods. Methods: The localization and density of florbetapir F 18 binding in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of postmortem brain tissue from 40 patients with a varying degree of neurodegenerative pathology was assessed by standard florbetapir F 18 autoradiography and correlated with the localization and density of A beta identified by silver staining, thioflavin S staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results: There were strong quantitative correlations between florbetapir F 18 tissue binding and both A beta plaques identified by light microscopy (Silver staining and thioflavin S fluorescence) and by immunohistochemical measurements of A beta using 3 antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the A beta peptide. Florbetapir F 18 did not bind to neurofibrillary tangles. Conclusions: Florbetapir F 18 selectively binds A beta in human brain tissue. The binding intensity was quantitatively correlated with the density of A beta plaques identified by standard neuropathologic techniques and correlated with the density of A beta measured by immunohistochemistry. As A beta plaques are a defining neuropathologic feature for Alzheimer disease, these results support the use of florbetapir F 18 as an amyloid positron emission tomography ligand to identify the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology in patients with signs and symptoms of progressive late-life cognitive impairment.

Pain catastrophizing predicts poor response to topical analgesics in patients with neuropathic pain	PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Catastrophizing; Neuropathic pain; Topical analgesics; Treatment efficacy	LOW-BACK-PAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; CLINICAL IMPORTANCE; GENERAL-POPULATION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DISABILITY; AMITRIPTYLINE; DISCLOSURE; EXPERIENCE	T Mankovsky, ME Lynch, AJ Clark, J Sawynok, MJL Sullivan. Pain catastrophizing predicts poor response to topical analgesics in patients with neuropathic pain. Pain Res Manage 2012;17(1):10-14. BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that high levels of pain catastrophizing might predict poorer response to pharmacological interventions for neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to examine the clinical relevance of the relation between catastrophizing and analgesic response in individuals with neuropathic pain. Clinically meaningful reductions were defined in terms of the magnitude of reductions in pain through the course of treatment, and in terms of the number of patients whose end-of-treatment pain ratings were below 4/10. METHODS: Patients (n=82) with neuropathic pain conditions completed a measure of pain catastrophizing at the beginning of a three-week trial examining the efficacy of topical analgesics for neuropathic pain. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, high scores on the measure of pain catastrophizing prospectively predicted poorer response to treatment. Fewer catastrophizers than noncatastrophizers showed moderate (>= 2 points) or substantial reductions in pain ratings through the course of treatment. Fewer catastrophizers than noncatastrophizers achieved end-of-treatment pain ratings below 4/10. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that the development of brief interventions specifically targeting catastrophic thinking might be useful for enhancing the effects of pharmacological interventions for neuropathic pain. Furthermore, failure to account for the level of catastrophizing might contribute to null findings in clinical trials of analgesic medication.	[Mankovsky, Tsipora; Sullivan, Michael J.

Validation of the non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMS-Quest)	PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Non-motor symptoms; Questionnaire; Sensitivity; Specificity	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOVEMENT-DISORDER; MULTICENTER; OLFACTION; NMSQUEST	Background: Although non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease are common and can cause severe disability, they are often under-recognized, leading to missed treatment opportunities. Screening tools for non-motor symptoms are urgently needed. Recently a 30 item screening Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire was developed. Although some psychometric properties have been evaluated, sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire have not been systematically assessed. Methods: Parkinson patients completed Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire, then underwent a gold-standard clinical evaluation of non-motor symptoms and signs that included extensive standardized questionnaires, cognitive/behavioural assessment, and neurological examination to determine whether each manifestation was present or absent. The sensitivity and specificity of each non-motor symptom, in relation to the gold-standard were estimated. Results: For the 70 participants, the mean age was 66.7+/-9.3, 64% were men, and disease duration was 3.8+/-2.8 years. From the gold-standard evaluation, the prevalence of non-motor manifestations ranged from 8.7% (hallucinations) to 78.3% (nocturia). The mean sensitivity of all Non Motor Symptoms was 63.4%. This varied considerably among different manifestations, ranging from 24% (sleepiness, hyposmia) to 100% (diplopia). By restricting analysis to clinically significant non-motor problems (i.e. those serious enough to warrant treatment), the mean sensitivity increased to 71.8%. The specificity for most items was high, with an overall mean specificity of 88.5%. Conclusions: For many non-motor manifestations Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire is an effective screen; however, for manifestations such as somnolence, olfactory loss and apathy, sensitivity is suboptimal. Overall, this questionnaire can be a useful clinical tool for screening non-motor problems in an office setting. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Romenets, S.

Successful adaptation of gait in healthy older adults during dual-task treadmill walking	AGING NEUROPSYCHOLOGY AND COGNITION			English	Article						Dual-task; Gait; EMG; Cognition; Healthy aging	ATTENTIONAL REQUIREMENTS; MUSCLE ACTIVATION; WORKING-MEMORY; AGE; PERFORMANCE; PRIORITIZATION; SPEED; YOUNG; VARIABILITY; DIFFICULTY	Dual-task methods have been used to demonstrate increased prioritization of walking performance over cognition in healthy aging. This is expressed as greater dual-task costs in cognitive performance than in walking. However, other research shows that older adults can prioritize cognitive performance over walking when instructed to do so. We asked whether age-related cognitive prioritization would emerge by experimentally manipulating cognitive difficulty. Young and older adults performed mental arithmetic at two levels of difficulty, alone or while walking. Electromyography and footswitches were used to measure muscle activity and stride parameters. Under high cognitive load, older adults increased their stride time, stride length, and hamstring activity, while maintaining their cognitive performance. Young adults showed negligible dual-task costs in each domain. The older adults appeared to successfully adapt their stride in response to high cognitive demands. The results have implications for neural models of gait regulation, and age differences in task emphasis.	[Li, Karen Z.

The objectives of this study were to compare the concentrations and correlation of biomarkers of inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and neurohormonal activation between these populations. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 29 subjects with symptomatic HF-REF (LVEF = 25.6 +/- 5.1%) and 29 subjects with symptomatic HF-PEF (LVEF = 63.3 +/- 5.3%). Concentrations of N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), procollagen type III amino-terminal peptide (PIIINP), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 were measured. Results: Although NT-proBNP and PIIINP concentrations were higher in patients with HF-REF compared with patients with HF-PEF (both P < 0.05), the only significant difference between the groups remaining after adjusting for possible confounding variables was NT-proBNP (P = 0.02). In patients with HF-REF, NT-proBNP correlated with PIIINP (P < 0.05), TIMP-1 (P < 0.05), and MMP-2 (P = 0.002), while PIIINP correlated with TIMP-1 (P < 0.05) and MMP-2 (P < 0.0001). In patients with a HF-PEF, only high sensitivity C-reactive protein correlated significantly with MMP-2 (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Patients with HF-REF or HF-PEF presenting similar symptoms and functional limitations exhibit similar concentrations of biomarkers of ECM and inflammation. However, patients with HF-REF exhibit significantly higher NT-proBNP concentrations than patients with HF-PEF. The differences in the correlations observed between the biomarkers between these 2 populations suggest some heterogeneity and differences in the mechanisms related to the release or clearance of biomarkers in HF-REF vs HF-PEF.

The prefrontal cortex: Comparative architectonic organization in the human and the macaque monkey brains	CORTEX			English	Review						Prefrontal cortex; Cytoarchitecture; Fiber pathways	COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTION PATTERNS; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; FRONTAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; DIFFUSION TRACTOGRAPHY; CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE; RHESUS-MONKEY; DT-MRI; REGION	Detailed cytoarchitectonic studies of the human cerebral cortex appeared during the first quarter of the 20th century. The incorporation of the cytoarchitectonic map by Brodmann (1909) in the Talairach proportional stereotaxic space (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) has established the Brodmann numerical nomenclature as the basis for describing the cortical location of structural and functional findings obtained with modern neuroimaging. In experimental anatomical and physiological investigations of the macaque monkey performed during the last 50 years, the numerical architectonic nomenclature used to describe findings in the prefrontal cortex has been largely based on the map by Walker (1940). Unfortunately, the map by Walker was not based on a comparative investigation of the cytoarchitecture of the human and macaque monkey prefrontal cortex and, as a result, the nomenclature and the criteria for demarcating areas in the two primate species are not always consistent. These discrepancies are a major obstacle in the ability to compare experimental findings from nonhuman primates with results obtained in functional and structural neuroimaging of the human brain. The present article outlines these discrepancies in the classical maps and describes comparative investigations of the cytoarchitecture of the prefrontal cortex of the macaque monkey and human (Petrides and Pandya, 1994, 1999, 2002a) in order to resolve these discrepancies and enable easy translation of experimental research in the monkey to findings in the human brain obtained with modern neuroimaging.

We have surveyed three aspects of prefrontal cortical connections: local projections (within the frontal lobe), the termination patterns of long association (post-Rolandic) projections, and the trajectories of major fiber pathways. The local connections appear to be organized in relation to dorsal (hippocampal origin) and ventral (paleocortical origin) architectonic trends. According to the proposal of a dual origin of the cerebral cortex, cortical areas can be traced as originating from archicortex (hippocampus) on the one hand, and paleocortex, on the other hand, in a stepwise manner (e.g., Sanides, 1969; Pandya and Yeterian, 1985). Prefrontal areas within each trend are connected with less architectonically differentiated areas, and also with more differentiated areas. Such organization may allow for the systematic exchange of information within each architectonic trend. The long connections of the prefrontal cortex with post-Rolandic regions seem to be organized preferentially in relation to dorsal and ventral prefrontal architectonic trends. Prefrontal areas are connected with post-Rolandic auditory, visual and somatosensory association areas, and with multimodal and paralimbic regions. This long connectivity likely works in conjunction with local connections to serve prefrontal cortical functions. The afferent and efferent connections of the prefrontal cortex with post-Rolandic regions are conveyed by specific long association pathways. These pathways as well appear to be organized in relation to dorsal and ventral prefrontal architectonic trends. Finally, although prefrontal areas have preferential connections in relation to dual architectonic trends, it is clear that there are interconnections between and among areas in each trend, which may provide a substrate for the overall integrative function of the prefrontal cortex. Prefrontal corticocortical connectivity may help to elucidate both region-specific and integrative perspectives on the functions of the prefrontal cortex. (C) 2011 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved.

The brain could identify stimuli via a hierarchical stream of activity leading to a cardinal neuron responsive to one particular object. The opportunity to record from numerous neurons offered investigators the capability of examining simultaneously the functioning of many cells. These approaches suggested encoding processes that are parallel rather than serial. Binding the many features of a stimulus may be accomplished through an induced synchronization of cell's action potentials. These interpretations are supported by experimental data and offer many advantages but also several shortcomings. We argue for a coding mechanism based on a sparse synchronization paradigm. We show that synchronization of spikes is a fast and efficient mode to encode the representation of objects based on feature bindings. We introduce the view that sparse synchronization coding presents an interesting venue in probing brain encoding mechanisms as it allows the functional establishment of multilayered and time-conditioned neuronal networks or multislice networks. We propose a model based on integrate-and-fire spiking neurons.

A functional link between variation in personality traits and the stress response has been suggested by studies in artificial selection lines in fish, birds and mammals. The aim of this study was to test whether the expression of genes involved in the stress response co-varies with personality traits in a natural population. Four personality traits, excreted cortisol level and brain expression of six candidate genes (CRF, CRF-R2, POMC1, GR1, GR2, MR) were measured in non-stressed wild-caught threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We found correlations between variation in personality traits and variation in the expression of genes involved in the stress response. Aggressiveness was negatively correlated with cortisol levels. Boldness and aggressiveness formed a behavioural syndrome and were both positively correlated with brain expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR1 and GR2). Boldness and exploration were positively correlated with expression of POMC1 but not with each other. Our results are compatible with a model that suggests that the aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome could be the consequence of a physiological pleiotropic effect of glucocorticoid receptors, which are involved in the stress response and behaviour variation.

MRI measures included intracranial volume, normalized brain volume, normalized white and gray matter volume, and volumes of the thalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, and caudate. Because these volumes vary across age and sex in children, we normalized the volume measurements for MS and control groups by computing z scores using normative values obtained from healthy children enrolled in the MRI Study of Normal Brain Development. Results: The intracranial volume z score was significantly lower in the patients with MS (-0.45 +/- 1.16; mean +/- SD) compared with the HC participants (+/- 0.25 +/- 0.98; p = 0.01). Patients with MS also demonstrated significant decreases in normalized brain volume z scores (-1.09 +/- 1.49 vs -0.05 +/- 1.22; p = 0.002). After correction for global brain volume, thalamic volumes in the MS population remained lower than those of HCs (-0.68 +/- 1.72 vs 0.15 +/- 1.35; p = 0.02), indicating an even greater loss of thalamic tissue relative to more global brain measures. Moderate correlations were found between T2-weighted lesion load and normalized thalamic volumes (r = -0.44, p < 0.01) and normalized brain volume (r = -0.47, p < 0.01) and between disease duration and normalized thalamic volume (r = -0.58, p < 0.001) and normalized brain volume (r = -0.46, p < 0.01). Conclusions: When compared with age-and sex-matched control subjects, the onset of MS during childhood is associated with a smaller overall head size, brain volume, and an even smaller thalamic volume.

We report here a mitochondria targeted nanodelivery system for coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) that can reach mitochondria and deliver CoQ10 in adequate quantities. Multifunctional nanocarriers based on ABC miktoarm polymers (A = poly(ethylene glycol (PEG), B = polycaprolactone (PCL), and C = triphenylphosphonium bromide (TPPBr)) were synthesized using a combination of click chemistry with ring opening polymerization, self assembled into nanosized micelles, and were employed for CoQ10 loading. Drug loading capacity (60 wt %), micelle size (25-60 nm), and stability were determined using a variety of techniques. The micelles had a small critical association concentration and were colloidally stable in solution for more than 3 months. The extraordinarily high CoQ10 loading capacity in the micelles is attributed to,good compatibility between CoQ10 and PCL, as indicated by the low Flory Huggins interaction parameter. Confocal microscopy studies of the fluorescently labeled polymer analog together with the mitochondria specific vital dye label indicated that the carrier did indeed reach mitochondria. The high CoQ10 loading efficiency allowed testing of micelles within a broad concentration range and provided evidence for CoQ10 effectiveness in two different experimental paradigms: oxidative stress and inflammation. Combined results from chemical, analytical, and biological experiments suggest that the new miktoarm-based carrier provides a suitable means of CoQ10 delivery to mitochondria without loss of drug effectiveness. The versatility of the click chemistry used to prepare this new mitochondria-targeting nanocarrier offers a widely applicable, simple, and easily reproducible procedure to deliver drugs to mitochondria or other intracellular organelles.

J	Geach, JE				Geach, James E.			Unsupervised self-organized mapping: a versatile empirical tool for object selection, classification and redshift estimation in large surveys	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: observational; methods: statistical	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; ULTRA-DEEP-FIELD; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; ACTIVE GALAXIES; LEGACY SURVEY; COSMOS FIELD; COLORS; POPULATION	We present an application of unsupervised machine learning the self-organized map (SOM) as a tool for visualizing, exploring and mining the catalogues of large astronomical surveys. Self-organization culminates in a low-resolution representation of the topology of a parameter volume, and this can be exploited in various ways pertinent to astronomy. Using data from the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS), we demonstrate two key astronomical applications of the SOM: (i) object classification and selection, using galaxies with active galactic nuclei as an example, and (ii) photometric redshift estimation, illustrating how SOMs can be used as totally empirical predictive tools. With a training set of similar to 3800 galaxies with zspec= 1, we achieve photometric redshift accuracies competitive with other (mainly template fitting) techniques that use a similar number of photometric bands [s(?z) = 0.03 with a similar to 2 per cent outlier rate when using u* band to 8 m photometry]. We also test the SOM as a photo-z tool using the PHoto-z Accuracy Testing (PHAT) synthetic catalogue of Hildebrandt et al., which compares several different photo-z codes using a common input/training set. We find that the SOM can deliver accuracies that are competitive with many of the established template fitting and empirical methods. This technique is not without clear limitations, which are discussed, but we suggest it could be a powerful tool in the era of extremely large petabyte data bases where efficient data mining is a paramount concern.

Although most individuals who display suicidal behavior do not have a history of early-life adversity, a significant minority does. Recent animal and human data have suggested that early-life adversity leads to epigenetic regulation of genes involved in stress-response systems. Here, we review this evidence and suggest that early-life adversity increases risk of suicide in susceptible individuals by influencing the development of stable emotional, behavioral and cognitive phenotypes that are likely to result from the epigenetic regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and other systems involved in responses to stress.

In addition, exome sequencing is increasingly being employed as a diagnostic tool for specific genetic diseases, particularly in the context of those disorders characterized by significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, for example, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and congenital disorders of glycosylation. Such disorders are challenging to interrogate with conventional polymerase chain reactionSanger sequencing methods, because of the inherent difficulty in prioritizing candidate genes for diagnostic testing. Here, we explore the value of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool and discuss whether exome sequencing can come to serve a dual role in diagnosis and discovery. We summarize the current status of exome sequencing, the technical challenges facing it, and its adaptation to diagnostics, and make recommendations for the use of exome sequencing as a routine diagnostic tool. Finally, we discuss pertinent ethical concerns, such as the use of exome sequencing data, originally generated in a diagnostic context, in research investigations.

Methods: A prospective, controlled, non-blinded study conducted at McGill University (class size = 180 students). Expanded teaching of muscle stretch reflexes was provided to first year medical students. A structured examination of muscle stretch reflexes (max score = 100) was administered in second year medical school after a required two week rotation in Neurology. Results for class A (received the intervention in first year) were compared to the results for the preceding class B (had not received the intervention). Results: 77 of 177 (44%) eligible students in class A and 69 of 166 (42%) eligible students in class B participated. Results were analyzed separately for each of two examiners. Mean (SD) scores were 95.2 (5.6) for class A (intervention) and 81.7 (11.1) for class B (control) for the first examiner and 90.4 (8.2) for class A and 83.8 (11.7) for class B for the second examiner. Results were statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test z = 5.27, p < 0.0001 first examiner and z = 2.67, p < 0.0038 second examiner). Conclusions: Distributed practice of muscle stretch reflexes during first year medical school results in improved performance by second year medical students after their mandatory clinical rotation in neurology, even when examined up to 14 months after the intervention. This finding has implications for the teaching of the NE.	[Moore, Fraser G.

Spinal muscular atrophy: Clinical validation of a single-tube multiplex real time PCR assay for determination of SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers	CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Spinal muscular atrophy; SMN1; SMN2; Multiplex PCR; Real time PCR; Gene copy number; Quantitative assay; Clinical diagnostics	GENE SMN1; IDENTIFICATION; SMA; QUANTIFICATION; NUCLEOTIDE; MUTATIONS; PHENOTYPE	Objectives: To describe and validate a new protocol for molecular diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a frequent neuromuscular disease of childhood. Design and methods: SMA is caused in most cases by homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. We describe a triplex quantitative real-time PCR method in which fragments of SMN1, SMN2 (a nearly-identical neighboring gene with markedly reduced function) and of a control gene, CFTR, are amplified in the same tube. Results: We validated this method in three ways. First, testing the same samples ten times yielded CV values < 4.6%. Second, in 104 previously-genotyped individuals, SMN copy numbers identical to those of the previously-determined genotype was unambiguously obtained in all cases. Finally, results using the technique in practice are described and analyzed for reproducibility of amplification efficiency and for inter-run variability. Conclusions: In over 1200 samples, this technique has proven accurate, fast, economical and reproducible. (C) 2011 Published by The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This duality was recently highlighted in a study showing that highly empathic individuals display increased vicarious facilitation of low-level pain processing (nociceptive flexion reflex, NFR) combined with an unexpected reduced facilitation of self-pain perception (pain ratings) while viewing static pictures evoking pain in others. The present study sought to test further the moderating effects of dispositional empathy on vicarious responses induced by viewing dynamic pain expressions. Twenty-four healthy volunteers viewed 1-s videos showing different levels of pain expression before noxious electric shocks were delivered to the sural nerve. Viewing stronger pain expressions generally increased shockpain unpleasantness ratings, the amplitude of the NFR, and facial responses (corrugator muscle) to the noxious stimulation. However, self-pain ratings (intensity and unpleasantness) increased less or were reduced following clips of pain expression in individuals scoring higher on the Empathy Quotient. These results suggest that vicarious processes facilitate low-level defensive responses, while the experience of self-pain and the associated negative affect may be partly tuned-down by higher-order empathic processes.

The present study aimed to dissociate the role of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) from the other PPC regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional connectivity. First, parametric event-related fMRI permitted the categorical comparison of experimental writing conditions with control conditions that were carefully chosen to match the experimental conditions in terms of variables extraneous to the motor act of writing, such as visual stimulus characteristics, and generating and retrieving verbal information. A selective focus of increased activation in the PPC restricted to the rostral part of the SPL (area PE) in the left hemisphere was demonstrated. Subsequently, functional connectivity analysis showed that area PE flexibly interacts with different language areas depending on the linguistic demands of the writing task. Activity in area PE correlates with the left angular gyrus, a region implicated in reading, when the writing is in response to words that are read; in sharp contrast, when the writing is in response to pictured objects, then area PE correlates with the supramarginal gyrus, a region involved in the articulatory and phonological loop, as well as with prefrontal regions that are involved in the retrieval and selection of semantic information. The results suggest that area PE serves as a critical interface between posterior cortical regions in the left hemisphere involved in language processing and the central motor and sensory regions that are directly involved in the control of movement.

Aim: To describe and characterize behavioural problems in children with CP and to determine the nature of any relationships with child and family characteristics. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, children with CP between 6 and 12 years of age were recruited. Children were assessed using the Leiter Intelligence Test, the Gross Motor Function Measure, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and questionnaires on demographic factors. Parents' level of stress was measured with the Parenting Stress Index. Results: Seventy-six parents completed the SDQ. Using the Total Difficulties Scores, 39.4% of the sample scored in the borderline to clinically abnormal range. Peer problems were the most common (55.3%). High parental stress was consistently associated with behavioural difficulties across all domains of the SDQ. Not surprisingly, better socialization skills and a lower parental stress were correlated with more positive behaviours. Conclusion: Behavioural difficulties are common in children with CP and appear not to be associated with socio-demographic variables and physical and cognitive characteristics. These difficulties are an important correlate of parental distress. This study emphasizes the need to recognize and address behavioural difficulties that may arise so as to optimize the health and well-being of children with CP and their families.

This structural remodeling is thought to underlie neurobehavioral adaptive responses. Administration to adolescent rats of methylphenidate (MPH), commonly used in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), triggers alterations of reward-based behavior paralleled by persistent and plastic synaptic changes of neuronal and glial markers within key areas of the reward circuits. By immunohistochemistry, we observe a marked increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression and a down-regulation of glial glutamate transporter GLAST in dorso-lateral and ventro-medial striatum. Using electron microscopy, we find in the prefrontal cortex a significant reduction of the synaptic active zone length, paralleled by an increase of dendritic spines. We demonstrate that in limbic areas the MPH-induced reactive astrocytosis affects the glial glutamatergic uptake system that in turn could determine glutamate receptor sensitization. These processes could be sustained by NO production and synaptic rearrangement and contribute to MPH neuroglial induced rewiring. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Many computer simulations already exist for this task, mostly in neural networks. This article presents a new simulation approach, the first attempt to simulate the Stroop task using the properties of complexity and auto-adaptivity in a massive multi-agent system. Our approach allows us to simulate the time effects of cognitive impairment on the task, the adaptive cognitive behaviours involved, and is a first step for the simulation of cognitive disorders.

Efficacy and Safety of Dopamine Agonists in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Review						adult brain injury; dopamine agonists; traumatic brain injury	DOUBLE-BLIND; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ATTENTION DEFICITS; PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT; METHYLPHENIDATE TREATMENT; OUTCOME MEASURES; CLINICAL-TRIALS; VITAL SIGNS; PLACEBO; AMANTADINE	In the intensive care unit, dopamine agonists (DA) have been used in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients to augment or accelerate cognitive recovery and rehabilitation. However, the efficacy and safety of DA in this population is not well established. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the clinical efficacy and safety of DA in patients with TBI. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, comparing DA to either placebo, standard treatment, or another active comparator. There was no restriction for age, date, or language of publication. Sensitivity analyses were planned to evaluate the potential effect of timing of TBI, age, drugs, and year of publication on efficacy. Among the 790 citations identified, 20 RCTs evaluating methylphenidate, amantadine, and bromocriptine were eligible. Significant clinical heterogeneity was observed between and within studies, which precluded any pooling of data. Efficacy outcomes included mainly neuropsychological measures of cognitive functioning. A total of 76 different neuropsychological tests were used, but most of them (59%) only once. Only 5 studies systematically assessed safety. No trend could be drawn from the analysis of efficacy and safety. Important sources of bias in the studies were of major concern. Considering the absence of consensus regarding clinical outcome, the lack of safety assessment, and the high risk of bias in the included trials, more research is warranted before DA can be recommended in critically ill TBI patients.

Limited clinical information about HAEs is available. Methods We searched the FDA MedWatch database for TMZ and obtained all MedWatch reports on TMZ submitted to the FDA from November 1, 1997 to September 3, 2008. We defined major HAEs, namely agranulocytosis, aplasia, aplastic anemia (AA), leukemia (various), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and lymphoma, and several minor HAEs. Results A total of 5,127 reports on 3,490 patients were submitted to MedWatch. Among these, we identified 112 cases of major HAEs. Of the 44 reported deaths, the major HAE was considered the cause in 32 cases. The median duration of TMZ treatment was 6 weeks [0.5-108 weeks]. Seventy-six cases of AA or aplasia and 17 cases of leukemia represented the most common major HAE. Important minor HAEs were bone marrow failure and pancytopenia/pancytopenia-like with 325 combined cases; these reports are clinically similar to aplastic anemia. Conclusion The hematologic toxicity profile of TMZ differs from that of other alkylating agents. TMZ HAEs are emerging as significant concerns. Among alkylating agents, AA appears unique to TMZ, and the high rate warrants disclosure of patients. The duration of TMZ exposure prior to the development of AA may be quite short. The risk of AML/MDS is low, but the length of follow-up is insufficient to assess the true risk.	[Villano, J.

The term 'negative symptoms' has been scrutinized with regards to what it encompasses. Negative symptomatology has been categorized into distinct subdomains, including primary symptoms, secondary symptoms, deficit syndrome and, more recently, persistent negative symptoms (PNS). Although there have been some theories put forward with regards to negative symptoms, there are still discordant findings regarding PNS. Thus, this article aimed to review the structural, functional and cognitive correlates of PNS in an attempt to better understand these specific negative symptoms in schizophrenia. According to the reviewed literature, deficit syndrome appears to have similar neurocognitive and structural deficits as PNS; however, some minor distinctions may suggest that PNS are a separate subtype of negative symptoms. White matter decrements in the frontal lobe and gray matter reductions in the temporal lobe may be related more specifically to PNS. Furthermore, unlike deficit syndrome, structural abnormalities in the frontal and temporal lobe also appear to be related to PNS in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Cognitive domains, such as memory, are impaired and appear to be predominantly related to PNS. Hence, PNS do appear to have neuroimaging and neurocognitive correlates and warrant further research.

The efficiency of male fertility restoration is dependent on the recovery kinetics of spermatogonial stem cells after cytotoxic treatment with busulfan in mice	HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						spermatogonial stem cells; busulfan; fertility; GDNF	SELF-RENEWAL; SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES; CLONAL ORIGIN; IN-VITRO; TRANSPLANTATION; SPERMATOGENESIS; PROLIFERATION; COLONIZATION; TRANSCRIPTS; EXPRESSION	BACKGROUND: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the foundation of spermatogenesis and represent a crucial resource for male fertility restoration. It has not been well documented, however, whether the recovery of SSC population size after cytotoxic damage associates with the kinetics of male fertility restoration. We addressed this issue using the mouse as a model. METHODS: Following single injections of busulfan at 15, 30 or 45 mg/kg into male mice, we examined their ability to sire offspring at different times by natural mating and determined SSC numbers using spermatogonial transplantation. We measured testis physiological parameters (testis weights, sperm counts, serum and intratesticular testosterone levels, and histological assessments of spermatogenic recovery) and quantified the expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) transcripts. RESULTS: Regardless of busulfan doses, fertility was lost within 4 weeks after treatment, while more than 95% of SSCs were lost within 3 days. Fertility and SSC numbers gradually recovered with time, but the recoveries were delayed at higher busulfan doses. Interestingly, SSC numbers reached similar to 30% of before-treatment levels by 4 weeks prior to the time of fertility restoration, across the dose groups. Sperm counts were similar to 20% of before-treatment levels at the onset of fertility restoration, regardless of busulfan doses. We detected a significant increase in total GDNF mRNA per testis immediately after busulfan treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The loss and restoration of fertility after busulfan treatment are direct consequences of SSC loss and expansion. Our data suggest that there is a threshold in SSC numbers that allows for male fertility restoration and that the testicular somatic environment responds rapidly and temporarily to the loss of spermatogonia, including SSCs, by altering GDNF mRNA levels. This study provides fundamental information to clinically apply SSCs for male fertility restoration in the future.	[Zohni, K.; Zhang, X.; Tan, S. L.; Nagano, M.

Axonal Regeneration and Neuroinflammation: Roles for the Translocator Protein 18 kDa	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						translocator protein 18 kDa; etifoxine; neurosteroids; axonal regeneration; inflammation	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; RAT SCIATIC-NERVE; IN-VITRO; ANXIOLYTIC ETIFOXINE; BRAIN-INJURY; PROGESTERONE SYNTHESIS; CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; MYELIN FORMATION	After a traumatic injury of the nervous system or in the course of a neurodegenerative disease, the speed of axonal regeneration and the control of the inflammatory response are fundamental parameters of functional recovery. Spontaneous regeneration takes place in the peripheral nervous system, although the process is slow and often incomplete. There is currently no efficient treatment for enhancing axonal regeneration, including elongation speed and functional reinnervation. Ligands of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) are currently under investigation as therapeutic means for promoting neuroprotection, accelerating axonal regeneration and modulating inflammation. The mechanisms of action of TSPO ligands involve the regulation of mitochondrial activity and the stimulation of steroid biosynthesis. In the peripheral nervous system, TSPO expression is strongly up-regulated after injury, primarily in Schwann cells and macrophages, but also in neurones. Its levels return to low control values when nerve regeneration is completed, strongly supporting an important role in regenerative processes. We have demonstrated a role for the benzoxazine etifoxine in promoting axonal regeneration in the lesioned rat sciatic nerve, either after freeze-injury or complete transection. Etifoxine is already clinically approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders (Stresam (R), Biocodex, Gentilly, France). Daily treatment with etifoxine resulted in a two-fold acceleration in axonal regeneration, as well as in a marked improvement of both the speed and quality of functional recovery. The neuroregenerative effects of etifoxine are likely to be mediated by TSPO, and they may involve an increased synthesis of pregnenolone and its metabolites, such as progesterone. After freeze-injury of the sciatic nerve, administration of etifoxine also strongly reduced the number of activated macrophages and decreased the production of the inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1 beta. Thus, this drug offers promise for the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries and axonal neuropathies. It may also be used as a lead compound in the development of new TSPO-based neuroprotective approaches.

Translocator Protein (18 kDa) as a Target for Novel Anxiolytics with a Favourable Side-Effect Profile	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						TSPO; neurosteroid; anxiety disorder; GABAA receptor; benzodiazepine	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; DIAZEPAM-BINDING INHIBITOR; EXTRASYNAPTIC GABA(A) RECEPTORS; ADULT SEPARATION ANXIETY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; PANIC DISORDER; CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; SUBFULMINANT HEPATITIS	Anxiety disorders are frequent and highly disabling diseases with considerable socio-economic impact. In the treatment of anxiety disorders, benzodiazepines (BZDs) as direct modulators of the GABAA receptor are used as emergency medication because of their rapid onset of action. However, BZDs act also as sedatives and rather quickly induce tolerance and abuse liability associated with withdrawal symptoms. Antidepressants with anxiolytic properties are also applied as first line long-term treatment of anxiety disorders. However, the onset of action of antidepressants takes several weeks. Obviously, novel pharmacological approaches are needed that combine a rapid anxiolytic efficacy with the lack of tolerance induction, abuse liability and withdrawal symptoms. Neurosteroids are potent allosteric modulators of GABAA receptor function. The translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) plays an important role for the synthesis of neurosteroids by promoting the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is the rate-limiting step in neurosteroidogenesis. Etifoxine not only exerts anxiolytic effects as a TSPO ligand by enhancing neurosteroidogenesis, but also acts as a weak direct GABAA receptor enhancer. The TSPO ligand XBD173 enhances GABAergic neurotransmission via the promotion of neurosteroidogenesis without direct effects at the GABAA receptor. XBD173 counteracts pharmacologically-induced panic in rodents in the absence of sedation and tolerance development. Also in humans, XBD173 displays antipanic activity and does not cause sedation and withdrawal symptoms after 7 days of treatment. XBD173 therefore appears to be a promising candidate for fast-acting anxiolytic drugs with less severe side-effects than BZDs. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and TSPO ligands as a novel pharmacological approach in the treatment of these disorders.	[Nothdurfter, C.; Baghai, T.

Caprospinol: Discovery of a Steroid Drug Candidate to Treat Alzheimer's Disease Based on 22R-Hydroxycholesterol Structure and Properties	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						Alzheimer's disease; neurosteroids; oxysterols; caprospinol; translocator protein	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; REGULATORY PROTEIN STAR; AMYLOID-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; 18 KDA TSPO; NEUROSTEROID BIOSYNTHESIS; CHOLESTEROL TRANSPORT; RAT-BRAIN; A-BETA; DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE DHEA; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR	The overall ability of the brain to synthesise neuroactive steroids led us to the identification of compounds that would reproduce aspects of neurosteroid pharmacology. The rate-determining step in neurosteroid biosynthesis is the import of the substrate cholesterol into the mitochondria, where it is metabolised into pregnenolone via the intermediate 22R-hydroxycholesterol. The levels of translocator protein 18-kDa, mediating the import of cholesterol into mitochondria, correlated with increased pregnenolone formation and reduced levels of 22R-hydroxycholesterol in biopsies from Alzheimers disease (AD), but not age-matched control, brains. 22R-hydroxycholesterol was shown to protect against beta-amyloid (A beta 42)-induced neurotoxicity. In search of 22R-hydroxycholesterol stable analogues, we identified the naturally occurring heterospirostenol, (22R,25R)-20a-spirost-5-en-3 beta-yl hexanoate (caprospinol) and derivatives that protect neuronal cells against A beta 142 neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effect of caprospinol is the result of a combination of overlapping properties, including: (i) the ability to bind to A beta 42 and reduce plaque formation in the brain in vivo; (ii) interaction with components of the mitochondria respiratory chain resulting in an anti-uncoupling effect; (iii) the capacity to scavenge A beta 42 monomers present in mitochondria; and (iv) the property of being a sigma-1 receptor ligand. In vivo, caprospinol crosses the bloodbrain barrier, accumulates in the brain, and restores cognitive impairment in a pharmacological rat model of AD. Caprospinol is stable, does not bind to known steroid receptors, is devoid of mutagenic and genotoxic properties, and is devoid of acute toxicity in rodents. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of caprospinol were studied, and long-term toxicity studies are under investigation, aiming to develop this compound as a disease-modifying drug for the treatment of AD.

As such, it ensures the proper inheritance of both nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. Accomplishment of cytokinesis in eukaryotes is dictated by several key events: establishment of the division plane, furrow ingression through contraction of an actomyosin ring and abscission via membrane fusion. Most mammalian somatic cells are diploid. Polyploidy can result from cytokinesis failure and may contribute to the development of pathologies such as cancer. However, polyploidy is essential for cellular differentiation and function in some contexts (eg hepatocytes, megakaryocytes and others). Consequently, the degree of ploidy and the achievement of cytokinesis must be tightly regulated throughout an organism and among different cell types. In this review we will highlight several examples of normal and pathological polyploidy, focusing on those caused by a controlled failure or dysregulation of cytokinesis, respectively. Last, we propose therapeutic routes to control cytokinesis to restore or block cell division. Copyright (C) 2011 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The degree of axonal damage and absence of spontaneous repair are major determinants of long-term clinical outcome. While inflammation is a common feature of these conditions, the impact of particular immune cell subsets and their products on injured axons is not fully known. To investigate the impact of immune cells on neuronal viability and axonal repair, we developed an in vitro culture system in which neurons are exposed to mixed or distinct immune cell subsets. We find that total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have a significant inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth that is independent of apoptosis. Using isolated immune cells subsets, we demonstrate that activated CD4+ T cells enhance neurite outgrowth while activated NK cells and CD8+ T cells inhibit neurite outgrowth. We find that NK cell inhibition of neuronal outgrowth is dependent on MAPK activity. Our findings describe heterogeneous effects of individual immune cell subsets on neuronal growth and offer important insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may impact axonal repair in inflammatory CNS conditions.

To assess thalamocortical network pathology in TLE, we mapped pointwise patterns of thalamic atrophy and statistically related them to neocortical thinning. Methods: We studied cross-sectionally 36 patients with drug-resistant TLE and 19 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects using high-resolution MRI. To localize thalamic pathology, we converted manual labels into surface meshes using the spherical harmonic description and calculated local deformations relative to a template. In addition, we measured cortical thickness by means of the constrained Laplacian anatomic segmentation using proximity algorithm. Results: Compared with control subjects, patients with TLE showed ipsilateral thalamic atrophy that was located along the medial surface, encompassing anterior, medial, and posterior divisions. Unbiased analysis correlating the degree of medial thalamic atrophy with cortical thickness measurements mapped bilateral frontocentral, lateral temporal, and mesiotemporal cortices. These areas overlapped with those of cortical thinning found when patients were compared with control subjects. Thalamic atrophy intensified with a longer duration of epilepsy and was more severe in patients with a history of febrile convulsions. Conclusion: The degree and distribution of thalamic pathology relates to the topography and extent of neocortical atrophy, lending support to the concept that the thalamus is an important hub in the pathologic network of TLE.

The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but it may involve changes in social information processing. In a placebo-controlled study, we examined the influence of intranasal oxytocin on effortful and automatic attentional shifting in 57 participants using a spatial cueing task with emotional and neutral faces. For effortful processing, oxytocin decreased the speed of shifting attention to sad faces presented for 750?ms and facilitated disengagement from right hemifield sad and angry faces presented for 200?ms. For automatic processing, symptoms of depression moderated the relationship between drug and disengagement. Oxytocin attenuated an attentional bias to masked angry faces on disengagement trials in persons with high depression scores. Oxytocin's influence on social behavior may occur, in part, by eliciting flexible attentional shifting in the early stages of information processing.

A new grading for easy and concise description of functional status after spinal cord lesions	SPINAL CORD			English	Article						spinal cord injury; spinal cord lesion; SCIM; classification; k-medoids algorithm; multi-center study	INDEPENDENCE MEASURE; NEUROLOGIC FUNCTION; OUTCOME MEASURES; VERSION III; RECOVERY; VALIDITY; ISRAEL; INJURY	Background: Disability scales do not enable the transmission of concise, meaningful and daily function description for clinical purposes. Study design: Cross-sectional statistical analysis of 328 patients' Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III item scores (SIS). Objective: To develop a concise and clinically interpretable data-based characterization of daily task accomplishment for patients with spinal cord lesions (SCLs). Setting: Multi-center study at 13 spinal units in 6 countries. Methods: Patients were grouped into clusters characterized by smaller differences between the patients' SIS within the clusters than between their centers, using the k-medoides algorithm. The number of clusters (k) was chosen according to the percent of SIS variation they explained and the clinical distinction between them. Results: Analysis showed that k=8 SIS clusters offer a good description of the patient population. The eight functional clusters were designated as A-H, each cluster (grade) representing a combination of task accomplishments. Higher grades were usually (but not always) associated with patients implementing more difficult tasks. Throughout rehabilitation, the patients' functional grade improved and the distribution of patients with similar functional grades within the total SCIM III score deciles remained stable. Conclusions: A new classification based on SIS clusters enables a concise description of overall functioning and task accomplishment distribution in patients with SCL. A software tool is used to identify the patients' functional grade. Findings support the stability and utility of the grades for characterizing the patients' functional status.

Prior trials had few events and relatively short follow-up. There is a need for a large randomized, controlled trial with long-term follow-up to inform both the short-and long-term impact of the 2 approaches to CABG. Methods We plan to randomize 4,700 patients in whom CABG is planned to undergo the procedure on pump or off pump. The coprimary outcomes are a composite of total mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and renal failure at 30 days and a composite of total mortality, MI, stroke, renal failure, and repeat revascularization at 5 years. We will also undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis at 30 days and 5 years after CABG surgery. Other outcomes include neurocognitive dysfunction, recurrence of angina, cardiovascular mortality, blood transfusions, and quality of life. Results As of May 3, 2011, CORONARY has recruited >3,884 patients from 79 centers in 19 countries. Currently, patient's mean age is 67.6 years, 80.7% are men, 47.0% have a history of diabetes, 51.4% have a history of smoking, and 34.4% had a previous MI. In addition, 20.9% of patients have a left main disease, and 96.6% have double or triple vessel disease. Conclusions CORONARY is the largest trial yet conducted comparing off-pump CABG to on-pump CABG. Its results will lead to a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of off-pump CABG.

First published October 14, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00716.2011.-Scar formation following an ischemic insult to the heart is referred to as reparative fibrosis and represents an essential physiological response to heal the damaged myocardium. The biological events of reparative fibrosis include inflammation, the deposition of collagen by myofibroblasts, sympathetic innervation, and angiogenesis. Several studies have further reported that scar formation was associated with the recruitment of neural crest-derived cardiac resident nestin(+) cells that display characteristics consistent with a neural progenitor/stem cell phenotype. During the reparative fibrotic response, these nestin(+) cells participate in neural remodeling and represent a novel cellular substrate of angiogenesis. In addition, a subpopulation of nestin(+) cells identified in the normal heart expressed cardiac progenitor transcriptional factors and may directly contribute to myocardial regeneration following ischemic damage. Nestin protein was also detected in endothelial cells of newly formed blood vessels in the scar and may represent a marker of revascularization. Lastly, nestin was induced in a subpopulation of smooth muscle alpha-actin(+) scar-derived myofibroblasts, and the expression of the intermediate filament protein may provide a proliferative advantage. Collectively, these data demonstrate that diverse populations of nestin(+) cells participate in cardiac wound healing.

Specifically, an attenuated response of reward-related areas (e.g., the ventral striatum) to non-drug reward cues has been reported in addiction. One unanswered question is whether risk-taking preference is associated with striatal reward processing in the absence of substance abuse. Method: Functional and structural MRI was performed in 266 healthy young adolescents and in 31 adolescents reporting potentially problematic substance use. Activation during reward anticipation (using the monetary incentive delay task) and to gray matter density were measured. Risk-taking bias was assessed by the Cambridge Gamble Task. Results: With increasing risk-taking bias, the ventral striatum showed decreased activation bilaterally during reward anticipation. Voxel-based morphometry showed that greater risk-taking bias was also associated with and partially mediated by lower gray matter density in the same structure. The decreased activation was also observed when participants with virtually any substance use were excluded. The group with potentially problematic substance use showed greater risk taking as well as lower striatal activation relative to matched comparison subjects from the main sample. Conclusions: Risk taking and functional and structural properties of the reward system in adolescents are strongly linked prior to a possible onset of substance abuse, emphasizing their potential role in the predisposition to drug abuse.

Design: Cross-sectional, retrospective study. Setting: Hospital-based multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic. Patients: A total of 110 patients with untreated MS were recruited and studied from June 1, 1997, through June 30, 2003. Main Outcome Measures: Cube-rooted CWM-LL and EDSS-measured clinical disability scores. Results: We found a large, nonplateauing relationship between cube-rooted CWM-LL and concurrent EDSS scores, more so for T1-hypointense than T2-hyperintense lesions (r=0.619 vs 0.548). Correlations between the EDSS scores and CWM-LL diminished when, as typically done in clinical trials, only those patients with EDSS scores of 0 to 6.0 were studied(n=92; r=0.523 for T1-hypointense lesions and r=0.457 for T2-hyperintense lesions); more important, a series of boot-strapped correlations suggested that this decrease was not simply due to smaller sample size, and these relationships remained even after correcting for disease duration. Conclusion: A large, nonplateauing relationship exists between CWM-LL and EDSS-measured clinical disability when patients with MS are studied to examine the entire range of disability, minimize nonbiological sources of variability, and increase pathologic specificity.

Proteomic Changes in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Presymptomatic and Affected Persons Carrying Familial Alzheimer Disease Mutations	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							BIOMARKERS; OSTEOPONTIN; MARKERS; PROTEIN; EXPRESSION; DISORDERS; RECEPTOR	Objective: To identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein changes in persons who will develop familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) due to PSEN1 and APP mutations, using unbiased proteomics. Design: We compared proteomic profiles of CSF from individuals with FAD who were mutation carriers (MCs) and related noncarriers (NCs). Abundant proteins were depleted and samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry on a high-resolution time-of-flight instrument. Tryptic peptides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins differing in concentration between the MCs and NCs were identified. Setting: A tertiary dementia referral center and a proteomic biomarker discovery laboratory. Participants: Fourteen FAD MCs (mean age, 34.2 years; 10 are asymptomatic, 12 have presenilin-1 [PSEN1] gene mutations, and 2 have amyloid precursor protein [APP] gene mutations) and 5 related NCs (mean age, 37.6 years). Results: Fifty-six proteins were identified, represented by multiple tryptic peptides showing significant differences between MCs and NCs (46 upregulated and 10 downregulated); 40 of these proteins differed when the analysis was restricted to asymptomatic individuals. Fourteen proteins have been reported in prior proteomic studies in lateonset AD, including amyloid precursor protein, transferrin, alpha(1)beta-glycoprotein, complement components, afamin precursor, spondin 1, plasminogen, hemopexin, and neuronal pentraxin receptor. Many other proteins were unique to our study, including calsyntenin 3, AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) 4 glutamate receptor, CD99 antigen, di-N-acetyl-chitobiase, and secreted phosphoprotein 1. Conclusions: We found much overlap in CSF protein changes between individuals with presymptomatic and symptomatic FAD and those with late-onset AD. Our results are consistent with inflammation and synaptic loss early in FAD and suggest new presymptomatic biomarkers of potential usefulness in drug development.

All human death involves the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with the irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. Death then is a result of the irreversible loss of these functions in the brain. This paper outlines three sets of criteria to diagnose human death. Each set of criteria clearly establishes the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with the irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. The most appropriate set of criteria to use is determined by the circumstances in which the medical practitioner is called upon to diagnose death. The three criteria sets are somatic (features visible on external inspection of the corpse), circulatory (after cardiorespiratory arrest), and neurological (in patients in coma on mechanical ventilation); and represent a diagnostic standard in which the medical profession and the public can have complete confidence. This review unites authors from Australia, Canada, and the UK and examines the medical criteria that we should use in 2012 to diagnose human death.

The present paper reports brain volume data for 325 children, ages 4.5-18 years, from the first cross-sectional time point. Measures included volumes of whole-brain gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), left and right lateral ventricles, frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobe GM and WM, subcortical GM (thalamus, caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus), cerebellum, and brainstem. Associations with cross-sectional age, sex, family income, parental education, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. Key observations are: 1) age-related decreases in lobar GM most prominent in parietal and occipital cortex; 2) age-related increases in lobar WM, greatest in occipital, followed by the temporal lobe; 3) age-related trajectories predominantly curvilinear in females, but linear in males; and 4) small systematic associations of brain tissue volumes with BMI but not with IQ, family income, or parental education. These findings constitute a normative reference on regional brain volumes in children and adolescents.

Animal models of TBI demonstrated that impaired learning was related to persistent synaptic plasticity suppression in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). In humans, single and repeated concussive injuries lead to lifelong and cumulative enhancements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, which is known to suppress LTP/LTD plasticity. To test the hypothesis that increased GABAergic inhibition after repeated concussions suppresses LTP/LTD and contributes to learning impairments, we used a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol to induce LTP/LTD-like effects in primary motor cortex (M1) jointly with an implicit motor learning task (serial reaction time task, SRTT). Our results indicate that repeated concussions induced persistent elevations of GABA(B)-mediated intracortical inhibition in M1, which was associated with suppressed PAS-induced LTP/LTD-like synaptic plasticity. This synaptic plasticity suppression was related to reduced implicit motor learning on the SRTT task relative to normal LTP/LTD-like synaptic plasticity in unconcussed teammates. These findings identify GABA neurotransmission alterations after repeated concussions and suggest that impaired learning after multiple concussions could at least partly be related to compromised GABA-dependent LTP/LTD synaptic plasticity.

Methods: Intracerebral EEGs were recorded in 17 patients with intractable focal seizures and normal MRIs. The rates of interictal HFOs and spikes inside and outside the SOZ were analyzed as well as the specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of HFOs and spikes to determine the SOZ. Results: The mean rate of spikes, ripples and fast ripples (FR) was higher in the SOZ than in the non-SOZ channels. In regard to the identification of the SOZ the sensitivity was 91% for spikes, 91% for ripples and 66% for FR, the specificity was 30% for spikes, 42% for ripples and 80% for FR, and the accuracy was 44% for spikes, 54% for ripples and 76% for FR. Conclusions: The rates of spikes and HFOs were higher inside than outside the SOZ. However, HFOs are also more specific and accurate than spikes to delineate the SOZ. Significance: Analysis of interictal HFOs during 5-10 min of sleep recording is a good tool to localize the SOZ in patients with epilepsy and normal MRI, and could potentially reduce the duration of chronic intracerebral EEG recordings.

Visual marking of HFOs is highly time-consuming and inevitably subjective, making automatic detection necessary. We compare four existing detectors on the same dataset. Methods: HFOs and baselines were identified by experienced reviewers in intracerebral EEGs from 20 patients. A new feature of our detector to deal with channels where baseline cannot be found is presented. The original and an optimal configuration are implemented. Receiver operator curves, false discovery rate, and channel ranking are used to evaluate performance. Results: All detectors improve performance with the optimal configuration. Our detector had higher sensitivity, lower false positives than the others, and similar false detections. The main difference in performance was in very active channels. Conclusions: Each detector was developed for different recordings and with different aims. Our detector performed better in this dataset, but was developed on data similar to the test data. Moreover, optimizing on a particular data type improves performance in any detector. Significance: Automatic HFO detection is crucial to propel their clinical use as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue. Comparing detectors on a single dataset is important to analyze their performance and to emphasize the issues involved in validation. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Such drug transporters are expressed in brain cells and at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where they limit the entry and distribution of drugs in the brain. Perturbations in brain drug transporter equilibrium by CRF could lead to central drug toxicity. This study evaluates how CRF affects BBB drug transporters using a 5/6 nephrectomized rat model. Protein and mRNA expression of influx transporters [organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp), organic anion transporter (Oat)] and efflux transporters [P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-related protein (Mrp), breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp)] were measured in CRF and control rat brain. Intracerebral accumulation of radiolabeled benzylpenicillin, digoxin, doxorubicin, and verapamil was used to evaluate BBB drug permeability. Protein expression of the transporters was evaluated in rat brain endothelial cells (RBECs) and astrocytes incubated with control and CRF rat serum. We demonstrated significant decreases (30-50%) in protein and mRNA levels of Bcrp, Mrp2 to -4, Oat3, Oatp2 and -3, and P-gp in CRF rat brain biopsies, as well as in astrocytes and RBECs incubated with CRF serum. These decreases did not correlate with in vivo changes because BBB permeability of benzylpenicillin was decreased by 30% in CRF rats, whereas digoxin, doxorubicin, and verapamil permeabilities were unchanged. It thus seems that even with decreased drug transporters, BBB integrity and function is conserved in CRF.

Using these and other methods, complex gratings have been shown to activate the ventral visual stream, whereas moving stimuli preferentially activate the dorsal stream. In the current study, a first experiment assessed brain activations evoked by complex gratings using intracranial electroencephalography in 10 epileptic patients implanted with subdural electrodes. These stimuli of intermediate levels of complexity were presented in such a way that transformational apparent motion (TAM) was perceived. Responses from both the ventral and the dorsal pathways were obtained. The response characteristics of visual area 4 and the fusiform cortex were of similar amplitudes, suggesting that both ventral areas are recruited for the processing of complex gratings. On the other hand, TAM-induced responses of dorsal pathway areas were relatively noisier and of lower amplitudes, suggesting that TAM does not activate motion-specific structures to the same extent as does real motion. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activity evoked by TAM in comparison to the one produced by real motion in a patient implanted with the same subdural electrodes. Findings demonstrated that neural response to real motion was much stronger than that evoked by TAM, in both the primary visual cortex (V1) and other motion-sensitive areas within the dorsal pathway. These results support the conclusion that apparent motion, even if perceptually similar to real motion, is not processed in a similar manner.

NET liver metastasis has been shown to respond to Yttrium-90 microspheres therapy. The aims of the present study were to define factors that predict the response to radio-embolization in patients with NET liver metastases. Methods: From January 2006 until March 2009, all patients with NET liver metastasis that received radio-embolization using TheraSphere(R) (glass microspheres) were reviewed. The response was determined by a change in the percentage of necrosis (Delta N%) after the first radio-embolization based on the modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST) criteria. The following confounding variables were measured: age, gender, size of the lesions, liver involvement, World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the presence of extra-hepatic metastasis, octereotide treatment and previous operative [surgery and (RFA)] and non-operative treatments (chemo-embolization and bland-embolization). Results: In all, 25 patients were identified, with a median follow-up of 21.7 months. The median age was 64.6 years, 28% had extra-hepatic metastasis and 56% were WHO stage 2. Post-treatment, the mean Delta N% was 48.4%. Previous surgical therapy was a significant predictor of the response with a response rate of 66.7 Delta N% vs. 31.5 Delta N% (P = 0.02). Bilateral liver disease, a high percentage of liver involvement and large metastatic lesions were inversely related to the degree of tumour response although did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Radio-embolization increased the necrosis of NET liver metastasis mainly in patients with less bulky disease. This may imply that surgical therapy before radio-embolization would increase the response rates.

Subcutaneous injection of cell lines induced tumor formation only in NSG mice and was accompanied by metastasis to the liver, adrenal glands, skull and bone marrow. NSG mice injected intravenously showed a profile of distant metastatis that was not observed in nude mice. In addition, tumor growth rates and organ infiltration patterns associated with injected NB cell lines correlated with the in vitro proliferation properties and genetic markers of poor prognosis in NB patients. We also showed that cisplatin chemotherapy was able to inhibit tumor growth. These results clearly demonstrate the higher tumorigenic and metastatic potential of NB cells in NSG mice. Therefore, this xenograft NB model should prove useful in testing the efficacy of new therapeutic approaches for NB.

Vocal consistency, the degree to which the spectral properties (e. g. dominant or fundamental frequency) of song elements are produced consistently from rendition to rendition, has been highlighted as a biologically important aspect of vocal performance. Here, we synthesize functional, developmental and mechanistic (neurophysiological) perspectives to generate an integrated understanding of this facet of vocal performance. Behavioral studies in the field and laboratory have found that vocal consistency is affected by social context, season and development, and, moreover, positively correlated with reproductive success. Mechanistic investigations have revealed a contribution of forebrain and basal ganglia circuits and sex steroid hormones to the control of vocal consistency. Across behavioral, developmental and mechanistic studies, a convergent theme regarding the importance of vocal practice in juvenile and adult songbirds emerges, providing a basis for linking these levels of analysis. By understanding vocal consistency at these levels, we gain an appreciation for the various dimensions of song control and plasticity and argue that genes regulating the function of basal ganglia circuits and sex steroid hormones could be sculpted by sexual selection.

First published September 28, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00122.2011.-Hindlimb motoneuron excitability was compared among exercise-trained (E), sedentary (S), and spinal cord transected (T) Sprague-Dawley rats by examining the slope of the frequency-current (F/I) relationship with standard intracellular recording techniques in rats anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine. The T group included spinal transected and spinal isolated rats; the E animals were either spontaneously active (exercise wheel) or treadmill trained; and rats in the S group were housed in pairs. An analysis of motoneuron initial [1st interspike interval (ISI)], early (mean of 1st three ISIs), and steady-state (mean of last 3 ISIs) discharge rate slopes resulting from increasing and decreasing 500-ms injected square-wave depolarizing current pulses was used to describe rhythmic motoneuron properties. The steepest slope occurred in the S group (55.3 +/- 22.2 Hz/nA), followed by the T group (35.5 +/- 15.3 Hz/nA), while the flattest slope was found in the E group (25.4 +/- 10.9 Hz/nA). The steepest steady-state slope occurred in the S group but was found to be similar between the T and E groups. Furthermore, a spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) index revealed a slower adaptation in motoneurons of the E animals only (similar to 40% lower). Finally, evidence for a secondary range of firing existed more frequently in the T group (41%) compared with the S (12%) and E (31%) groups. The lower F/I slope and lower SFA index of motoneurons for E rats may be a result of an increase in Na(+) conductance at the initial segment. The results show that motoneuronal rhythmic firing behavior is plastic, depending on the volume of daily activation and on intact descending pathways.	[Gardiner, P.

Inhibitory responses in Aplysia pleural sensory neurons act to block excitability, transmitter release, and PKC Apl II activation. J Neurophysiol 107: 292-305, 2012. First published October 12, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00767.2011.-Expression of the 5-HT(1Apl(a)) receptor in Aplysia pleural sensory neurons inhibited 5-HT-mediated translocation of the novel PKC Apl II in sensory neurons and prevented PKC-dependent synaptic facilitation at sensory to motoneuron synapses (Nagakura et al. 2010). We now demonstrate that the ability of inhibitory receptors to block PKC activation is a general feature of inhibitory receptors and is found after expression of the 5-HT(1Apl(b)) receptor and with activation of endogenous dopamine and FMRFamide receptors in sensory neurons. Pleural sensory neurons are heterogeneous for their inhibitory response to endogenous transmitters, with dopamine being the most prevalent, followed by FMRFamide, and only a small number of neurons with inhibitory responses to 5-HT. The inhibitory response is dominant, reduces membrane excitability and synaptic efficacy, and can reverse 5-HT facilitation at both naive and depressed synapses. Indeed, dopamine can reverse PKC translocation during the continued application of 5-HT. Reversal of translocation can also be seen after translocation mediated by an analog of diacylglycerol, suggesting inhibition is not through blockade of diacylglycerol production. The effects of inhibition on PKC translocation can be rescued by phosphatidic acid, consistent with the inhibitory response involving a reduction or block of production of this lipid. However, phosphatidic acid could not recover PKC-dependent synaptic facilitation due to an additional inhibitory effect on the non-L-type calcium flux linked to synaptic transmission. In summary, we find a novel mechanism downstream of inhibitory receptors linked to inhibition of PKC activation in Aplysia sensory neurons.

Speech sounds alter facial skin sensation. J Neurophysiol 107: 442-447, 2012. First published October 19, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00029.2011.-Interactions between auditory and somatosensory information are relevant to the neural processing of speech since speech processes and certainly speech production involves both auditory information and inputs that arise from the muscles and tissues of the vocal tract. We previously demonstrated that somatosensory inputs associated with facial skin deformation alter the perceptual processing of speech sounds. We show here that the reverse is also true, that speech sounds alter the perception of facial somatosensory inputs. As a somatosensory task, we used a robotic device to create patterns of facial skin deformation that would normally accompany speech production. We found that the perception of the facial skin deformation was altered by speech sounds in a manner that reflects the way in which auditory and somatosensory effects are linked in speech production. The modulation of orofacial somatosensory processing by auditory inputs was specific to speech and likewise to facial skin deformation. Somatosensory judgments were not affected when the skin deformation was delivered to the forearm or palm or when the facial skin deformation accompanied nonspeech sounds. The perceptual modulation that we observed in conjunction with speech sounds shows that speech sounds specifically affect neural processing in the facial somatosensory system and suggest the involvement of the somatosensory system in both the production and perceptual processing of speech.

Clinical Clues to Differentiating Inherited and Noninherited Etiologies of Childhood Ataxias	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS			English	Article							ACUTE CEREBELLAR-ATAXIA; SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA; FRIEDREICHS-ATAXIA; TELANGIECTASIA; FEATURES; PATHOGENESIS; IDEBENONE; DIAGNOSIS; GENETICS	Objective To identify clinical features at presentation that differentiate inherited and noninherited etiologies of childhood ataxias. Study design A retrospective chart review analysis was conducted on 167 patients evaluated in neurology outpatient clinics for ataxia or ataxia-related symptoms. The frequency of clinical features, determined a priori, in the 2 groups was compared. Results A larger proportion of patients were diagnosed with a nongenetic cause than with a genetic cause (89% [148 patients] vs 11% [19 patients]). The majority of patients in the nongenetic group (56%[83/148]) presented early for medical evaluation, compared with 31% (6/19) in the genetic group. Consanguinity (16% vs 4%) and positive family history (16% vs 2%) were more frequent in the genetic group. Presenting symptoms of abnormal gait (95% vs 57%) and muscle weakness (47% vs 8%), including physical findings of abnormal muscle tone (63% vs 32%), abnormal reflexes (63% vs 16%), clonus (26% vs 9%), dysmetria (32% vs 5%), pes cavus (21% vs 1%), sensory deficits (16% vs 0%), and nonneurologic musculoskeletal abnormalities (58% vs 19%), were more prevalent in the genetic group. Conclusion Certain clinical features can help delineate between inherited and noninherited causes of childhood ataxia and thus guide physicians in the targeted evaluation of patients.

J	Krishnaswamy, A; Cooper, E				Krishnaswamy, Arjun; Cooper, Ellis			Reactive oxygen species inactivate neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors through a highly conserved cysteine near the intracellular mouth of the channel: implications for diseases that involve oxidative stress	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Review							SYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC GANGLIA; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CYTOCHROME-C RELEASE; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; CALCIUM PERMEABILITY; INWARD RECTIFICATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PC12 CELLS	An intriguing feature of several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on neurons is that their subunits contain a highly conserved cysteine residue located near the intracellular mouth of the receptor pore. The work summarized in this review indicates that a3 beta 4-containing and a4 beta 2-containing neuronal nAChRs, and possibly other subtypes, are inactivated by elevations in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review discusses a model for the molecular mechanisms that underlie this inactivation. In addition, we explore the implications of this mechanism in the context of complications that arise from diabetes. We review the evidence that diabetes elevates cytosolic ROS in sympathetic neurons and inactivates postsynaptic a3 beta 4-containing nAChRs shortly after the onset of diabetes, leading to a depression of synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia, an impairment of sympathetic reflexes. These effects of ROS on nAChR function are due to the highly conserved Cys residues in the receptors: replacing the cysteine residues in a3 allow ganglionic transmission and sympathetic reflexes to function normally in diabetes. This example from diabetes suggests that other diseases involving oxidative stress, such as Parkinson's disease, could lead to the inactivation of nAChRs on neurons and disrupt cholinergic nicotinic signalling.

They are crucial for the normal hardwiring of glutamatergic circuits but also fine tune synaptic strength by cycling into and out of synapses during periods of sustained patterned activity or altered homeostasis. AMPARs are grouped into two functionally distinct tetrameric assemblies based on the inclusion or exclusion of the GluA2 receptor subunit. GluA2-containing receptors are thought to be the most abundant AMPAR in the CNS, typified by their small unitary events, Ca2+ impermeability and insensitivity to polyamine block. In contrast, GluA2-lacking AMPARs exhibit large unitary conductance, marked divalent permeability and nano- to micromolar polyamine affinity. Here, I review evidence for the existence of a third class of AMPAR which, though similarly Ca2+ permeable, is characterized by its near-insensitivity to internal and external channel block by polyamines. This novel class of AMPAR is most notably found at multivesicular release synapses found in the avian auditory brainstem and mammalian retina. Curiously, these synapses lack NMDA-type iGluRs, which are conventionally associated with controlling AMPAR insertion. The lack of NMDARs suggests that a different set of rules may govern AMPAR cycling at these synapses. AMPARs with similar functional profiles are also found on some glial cells suggesting they may have a more widespread distribution in the mammalian CNS. I conclude by noting that modest changes to the ion-permeation pathway might be sufficient to retain divalent permeability whilst eliminating polyamine sensitivity. Consequently, this emerging AMPAR subclass need not be assembled from novel subunits, yet to be cloned, but could simply occur by varying the stoichiometry of existing proteins.

However, the relationship between cortical maturation and attention capacities in typically developing children is unknown. This study examines cortical thickness correlates of inattention symptoms in a large sample of healthy children. Method: Data from 357 healthy subjects (6.0-18.4 years of age) were obtained from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development. In cross-sectional analysis (first visit, n = 257), Child Behavior Checklist Attention Problems (AP) scores were linearly regressed against cortical thickness, controlling for age, gender, total brain volume, and site. For longitudinal data (up to three visits, n = 357/672 scans), similar analyses were performed using mixed-effects linear regressions. Interactions of AP with age and gender were tested. Results: A cross-sectional "AP by age" interaction was found in bilateral orbito-frontal cortex, right inferior frontal cortex, bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and several additional attention network regions. The interaction was due to negative associations between AP and thickness in younger subjects (6-10 years of age) that gradually disappeared over time secondary to slower cortical thinning. Similar trends were present in longitudinal analyses. Conclusions: Higher AP scores were associated with thinner cortex at baseline and slower cortical thinning with aging in multiple areas involved in attention processes. Similar patterns have been identified in ADHD, suggesting a dimensional component to the link between attention and cortical maturation. The identified association between cortical maturation and attention in healthy development will help to inform studies of neuroimaging biomarkers of ADHD. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

PVA-C is material widely used in medical imaging phantoms because of its mechanical similarities to soft tissues. Methods: The phantom was cast in a mold designed using the left hemisphere of the Colin27 brain dataset [C. Holmes et al., "Enhancement of MR images using registration for signal averaging," J. Comput. Assist. Tomogr. 22(2), 324 (1998)]. Marker spheres and inflatable catheters were also implanted to enable good registration comparisons and to simulate tissue deformation, respectively. Results: The phantom contained deep sulci, a complete insular region, and an anatomically accurate left ventricle. It was found to provide good contrast in triple modality imaging, consisting of computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple sets of multimodal data were acquired from this phantom. Conclusions: The methods for building the anatomically accurate, multimodality phantom were described in this work. All multimodal data are made available freely to the image processing community (http://pvabrain.inria.fr). We believe the phantom images could allow for the validation and further aid in the development of novel medical image processing techniques. VC 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Connecdenn 3/DENND1C binds actin linking Rab35 activation to the actin cytoskeleton	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL			English	Article							NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR; REGULATES NEURITE OUTGROWTH; CANINE KIDNEY-CELLS; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; DENN DOMAIN; EFFECTOR PROTEIN; EARLY ENDOSOMES; C-ELEGANS; N-WASP; RAB10	The small GTPase Rab35 regulates endosomal membrane trafficking but also recruits effectors that modulate actin assembly and organization. Differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells (DENN)-domain proteins are a newly identified class of Rab guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that are grouped into eight families, each activating a common Rab. The members of one family, connecdenn 1-3/DENND1A-C, are all GEFs for Rab35. Why Rab35 requires multiple GEFs is unknown. We demonstrate that connecdenn 3 uses a unique C-terminal motif, a feature not found in connecdenn 1 or 2, to directly bind actin. This interaction couples Rab35 activation to the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in dramatic changes in cell shape, notably the formation of protrusive membrane extensions. These alterations are specific to Rab35 activated by connecdenn 3 and require both the actin-binding motif and N-terminal DENN domain, which harbors the GEF activity. It was previously demonstrated that activated Rab35 recruits the actin-bundling protein fascin to actin, but the relevant GEF for this activity was unknown. We demonstrate that connecdenn 3 and Rab35 colocalize with fascin and actin filaments, suggesting that connecdenn 3 is the relevant GEF. Thus, whereas connecdenn 1 and 2 activate Rab35 for endosomal trafficking, connecdenn 3 uniquely activates Rab35 for its role in actin regulation.

The high degree of learning-dependent plasticity in these networks-combined with the availability of advanced computerized technology-suggests that we should be able to engineer very specific training programs that drive meaningful and enduring improvements in impaired neural systems relevant to neuropsychiatric illness. However, cognitive training approaches for mental and addictive disorders must take into account possible inherent limitations in the underlying brain 'learning machinery' due to pathophysiology, must grapple with the presence of complex overlearned maladaptive patterns of neural functioning, and must find a way to ally with developmental and psychosocial factors that influence response to illness and to treatment. In this review, we briefly examine the current state of knowledge from studies of cognitive remediation in psychiatry and we highlight open questions. We then present a systems neuroscience rationale for successful cognitive training for neuropsychiatric illnesses, one that emphasizes the distributed nature of neural assemblies that support cognitive and affective processing, as well as their plasticity. It is based on the notion that, during successful learning, the brain represents the relevant perceptual and cognitive/affective inputs and action outputs with disproportionately larger and more coordinated populations of neurons that are distributed (and that are interacting) across multiple levels of processing and throughout multiple brain regions. This approach allows us to address limitations found in earlier research and to introduce important principles for the design and evaluation of the next generation of cognitive training for impaired neural systems. We summarize work to date using such neuroscience-informed methods and indicate some of the exciting future directions of this field.

DAPTA, a HIV gp120-derived CCR5 entry inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit CCR5-mediated monocyte migration and to attenuate neuroinflammation. We report here that as a stabilized analog of DAPTA, the short peptide RAP-103 exhibits potent antagonism for both CCR2 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] 4.2 pM) and CCR5 (IC50 0.18 pM) in monocyte chemotaxis. Oral administration of RAP-103 (0.05-1 mg/kg) for 7 days fully prevents mechanical allodynia and inhibits the development of thermal hyperalgesia after partial ligation of the sciatic nerve in rats. Administered from days 8 to 12, RAP-103 (0.2-1 mg/kg) reverses already established hypersensitivity. RAP-103 relieves behavioral hypersensitivity, probably through either or both CCR2 and CCR5 blockade, because by using genetically deficient animals, we demonstrated that in addition to CCR2, CCR5 is also required for the development of neuropathic pain. Moreover, RAP-103 is able to reduce spinal microglial activation and monocyte infiltration, and to inhibit inflammatory responses evoked by peripheral nerve injury that cause chronic pain. Our findings suggest that targeting CCR2/CCR5 should provide greater efficacy than targeting CCR2 or CCR5 alone, and that dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonist RAP-103 has the potential for broad clinical use in neuropathic pain treatment.

Movement abnormalities and psychotic-like experiences in childhood: markers of developing schizophrenia?

Both involuntary dyskinetic movements and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are reported to be antecedents of schizophrenia that may reflect dysfunctional dopaminergic activity in the striatum. The present study compared dyskinetic movement abnormalities displayed by children with multiple antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz), including speech and/or motor developmental lags or problems, internalising/externalising problems in the clinical range, and PLEs, with those displayed by children with no antecedents (noASz). Method. The sample included 21 ASz and 31 noASz children, aged 9-12 years old. None had taken psychotropic medication or had relatives with psychosis. The antecedents of schizophrenia were assessed using questionnaires completed by children and caregivers. A trained rater, blind to group status, coded dyskinetic movement abnormalities using a validated tool from videotapes of interviews with the children. Results. ASz children reported, on average, 'certain experience' of 2.5 PLEs, while noASz children, by definition, reported none. The ASz children, as compared with noASz children, displayed significantly more dyskinetic movement abnormalities in total, and in the facial and the upper-body regions, after controlling for sex and age. Receiver operator characteristics analyses yielded high area under the curve values for the total score (0.94), facial score (0.91) and upper-body score (0.86), indicating that these scores distinguished between the ASz and noASz children with great accuracy. Conclusions. Brief questionnaires identified children with multiple antecedents of schizophrenia who displayed significantly more involuntary dyskinetic movement abnormalities than children without antecedents. The presence of PLEs and dyskinesias could reflect early disruption of striatal dopamine circuits.	[Laurens, K.

As in classical multiple-set canonical correlation analysis, computationally, the method solves a matrix eigen-analysis problem through the adoption of a basis expansion approach to approximating data and weight functions.

We performed activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses to define regions of interest based upon the mature action observation network of adults. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we then examined developmental trajectories of functional brain activity within these brain regions.

In contrast to FUS WT, which is concentrated in the nucleus, these mutants are abnormally distributed in the cytoplasm where they form inclusions and associate with stress granules. The data reported herein demonstrate the importance of protein arginine methylation in nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of FUS and abnormalities of ALS-causing mutants. Depletion of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1; the enzyme that methylates FUS) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts by gene knockout, or in human HEK293 cells by siRNA knockdown, diminished the ability of ALS-linked FUS mutants to localize to the cytoplasm and form inclusions. To examine properties of FUS mutants in the context of neurons vulnerable to the disease, FUS WT and ALS-linked FUS mutants were expressed in motor neurons of dissociated murine spinal cord cultures. In motor neurons, shRNA-mediated PRMT1 knockdown concomitant with the expression of FUS actually accentuated the shift in distribution of ALS-linked FUS mutants from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. However, when PRMT1 was inhibited prior to expression of ALS-linked FUS mutants, by pretreatment with a global methyltransferase inhibitor, ALS-linked FUS mutants were sequestered in the nucleus and cytoplasmic inclusions were reduced, as in the cell lines. Mitochondria were significantly shorter in neurons with cytoplasmic ALS-linked FUS mutants, a factor that could contribute to toxicity. We propose that arginine methylation by PRMT1 participates in the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of FUS, particularly of ALS6-associated mutants, and thus contributes to the toxic gain of function conferred by these disease-causing mutations.

It is typically measured by directly computing the amount of disagreement between ensemble classifiers at the decision level. This costly process usually involves evaluating output predictions of each classifier over some validation data set. Since most statistical and neural network classifiers can adjust internal learning dynamics by varying their hyperparameter values (corresponding to genotype values), this information can also provide an estimate of diversity. This paper measures the correlation between genotype and classifier diversity among an ensemble of fuzzy ART-MAP neural network classifiers applied to video face recognition. It is empirically shown that as genotype diversity increases within an ensemble, classifier diversity also significantly increases. This correlation can then be exploited to measure the diversity among base classifiers during ensemble design with a significantly lower computational cost.

More specifically, features extracted from sigma-lognormal representations of signatures are applied to the problem of brain stroke susceptibility assessment. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is used to evaluate the predictability of the most important modifiable brain stroke risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, cigarette smoking, cardiac problems) based on four different statistical modeling of the features' variation (random forest, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression and linear regression). Our preliminary results show a potential predictability (AUC of about 0.7-0.8) for every risk factor, except for cigarette smoking. Avenues for improving these results are discussed.

Traditionally, preference characterization has been quantified via questionnaires or subjective evaluations. Current advances in neurophysiological signal acquisition, however, have allowed for such "non-measurable" subjective parameters to be quantified objectively. In this pilot study, we explore the use of neurophysiological signals as correlates of image preference characterization. Experiments with seven participants have shown promising results and mental states associated with preferred and non-preferred images, as well as baseline neutral state could be classified with above-chance levels.

In the past decades, there has been a marked increase in overall survival of children with cancer. However, children whose treatment includes hematopoietic stem cell transplantation still represent a subpopulation with a higher risk of mortality. These improvements in mortality are accompanied by an increase in complications, such as respiratory and cardiovascular insufficiencies as well as neurological problems that may require an admission to the pediatric intensive care unit where most supportive therapies can be provided. It has been shown that ventilatory and cardiovascular support along with renal replacement therapy can benefit pediatric hemato-oncology patients if promptly established. Even if admissions of these patients are not considered futile anymore, they still raise sensitive questions, including ethical issues. To support the discussion and potentially facilitate the decision-making process, we propose an algorithm that takes into account the reason for admission (surgical versus medical) and the hemato-oncological prognosis. The algorithm then leads to different types of admission: full-support admission, "pediatric intensive care unit trial" admission, intensive care with adapted level of support, and palliative intensive care. Throughout the process, maintaining a dialogue between the treating physicians, the paramedical staff, the child, and his parents is of paramount importance to optimize the care of these children with complex disease and evolving medical status.

The pipeline system for Octave and Mat lab (PSOM): a lightweight scripting framework and execution engine for scientific workflows	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						pipeline; workflow; Octave; Matlab; open-source; parallel computing; high-performance computing; neuroimaging		The analysis of neuroimaging databases typically Involves a large number of inter-connected steps called a pipeline. The pipeline system for Octave and Matlab (PSOM) is a flexible framework for the implementation of pipelines in the form of Octave or Matlab scripts. PSOM does not introduce new language constructs to specify the steps and structure of the workflow. All steps of analysis are instead described by a regular Matlab data structure, documenting their associated command and options, as well as their input, output, and cleaned-up files. The PSOM execution engine provides a number of automated services: (1) it executes jobs in parallel on a local computing facility as long as the dependencies between jobs allow for it and sufficient resources are available; (2) it generates a comprehensive record of the pipeline stages and the history of execution, which is detailed enough to fully reproduce the analysis; (3) if an analysis is started multiple times, it executes only the parts of the pipeline that need to be reprocessed. PSOM is distributed under an open-source MIT license and can be used without restriction for academic or commercial projects. The package has no external dependencies besides Matlab or Octave, is straightforward to install and supports of variety of operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac). We ran several benchmark experiments on a public database including 200 subjects, using a pipeline for the preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI). The benchmark results showed that PSOM is a powerful solution for the analysis of large databases using local or distributed computing resources.

LORIS: a web-based data management system for multi-center studies	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						database; neuroimaging; longitudinal; multi-center; MRI; data querying; imaging data; behavioral data		Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System (LORIS) is a modular and extensible web-based data management system that integrates all aspects of a multi-center study: from heterogeneous data acquisition (imaging, clinical, behavior, and genetics) to storage, processing, and ultimately dissemination. It provides a secure, user-friendly, and streamlined platform to automate the flow of clinical trials and complex multi-center studies. A subject-centric internal organization allows researchers to capture and subsequently extract all information, longitudinal or cross-sectional, from any subset of the study cohort. Extensive error checking and quality control procedures, security, data management, data querying, and administrative functions provide LORIS with a triple capability (1) continuous project coordination and monitoring of data acquisition (2) data storage/cleaning/querying, (3) interface with arbitrary external data processing "pipelines." LORIS is a complete solution that has been thoroughly tested through a full 10 year life cycle of a multi center longitudinal project(1) and is now supporting numerous international neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration research projects.

Evidence is emerging that qualitatively and quantitatively different processes may be involved in risky decision-making for gains and losses. We start by reviewing behavioral work by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and others, which shows that risk-taking differs for potential gains and potential losses. We then turn to the literature in decision neuroscience to support the gain versus loss distinction. Relying in part on data from a new task that separates risky decision-making for gains and losses, we test a neural model that assigns unique mechanisms for risky decision-making involving potential losses. Included are studies using patients with lesions to brain areas specified as important in the model and studies with healthy individuals whose brains are scanned to reveal activation in these and other areas during risky decision-making. In some cases, there is evidence that gains and losses are processed in different regions of the brain, while in other cases the same region appears to process risk in a different manner for gains and losses. At a more general level, we provide strong support for the notion that decisions involving risk-taking for gains and decisions involving risk-taking for losses represent different psychological processes. At a deeper level, we present mounting evidence that different neural structures play different roles in guiding risky choices in these different domains. Some structures are differentially activated by risky gains and risky losses while others respond uniquely in one domain or the other. Taken together, these studies support a clear functional dissociation between risk-taking for gains and risk-taking for losses, and further dissociation at the neural level.

Bursting neurons and ultrasound avoidance in crickets	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						burst; feature extraction; insect flight; phonotaxis; predator-avoidance; sensory coding		Decision making in invertebrates often relies on simple neural circuits composed of only a few identified neurons. The relative simplicity of these circuits makes it possible to identify the key computation and neural properties underlying decisions. In this review, we summarize recent research on the neural basis of ultrasound avoidance in crickets, a response that allows escape from echolocating bats. The key neural property shaping behavioral output is high-frequency bursting of an identified interneuron, AN2, which carries information about ultrasound stimuli from receptor neurons to the brain. AN2's spike train consists of clusters of spikes - bursts - that may be interspersed with isolated, non-burst spikes. AN2 firing is necessary and sufficient to trigger avoidance steering but only high-rate firing, such as occurs in bursts, evokes this response. AN2 bursts are therefore at the core of the computation involved in deciding whether or not to steer away from ultrasound. Bursts in AN2 are triggered by synaptic input from nearly synchronous bursts in ultrasound receptors. Thus the population response at the very first stage of sensory processing - the auditory - receptor already differentiates the features of the stimulus that will trigger a behavioral response from those that will not. Adaptation, both intrinsic to AN2 and within ultrasound receptors, scales the burst-generating features according to the stimulus statistics, thus filtering out background noise and ensuring that bursts occur selectively in response to salient peaks in ultrasound intensity. Furthermore AN2's sensitivity to ultrasound varies adaptively with predation pressure, through both developmental and evolutionary mechanisms. We discuss how this key relationship between bursting and the triggering of avoidance behavior is also observed in other invertebrate systems such as the avoidance of looming visual stimuli in locusts or heat avoidance in beetles.

J	Shizgal, P				Shizgal, Peter			Scarce means with alternative uses: Robbins' definition of economics and its extension to the behavioral and neurobiological study of animal decision making	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						behavioral economics; neuroeconomics; decision making; opportunity cost; psychophysics; reward; brain stimulation; dopamine		Almost 80 years ago, Lionel Robbins proposed a highly influential definition of the subject matter of economics: the allocation of scarce means that have alternative ends. Robbins confined his definition to human behavior, and he strove to separate economics from the natural sciences in general and from psychology in particular. Nonetheless, I extend his definition to the behavior of non-human animals, rooting my account in psychological processes and their neural underpinnings. Some historical developments are reviewed that render such a view more plausible today than would have been the case in Robbins' time. To illustrate a neuroeconomic perspective on decision making in non-human animals, I discuss research on the rewarding effect of electrical brain stimulation. Central to this discussion is an empirically based, functional/computational model of how the subjective intensity of the electrical reward is computed and combined with subjective costs so as to determine the allocation of time to the pursuit of reward. Some successes achieved by applying the model are discussed, along with limitations, and evidence is presented regarding the roles played by several different neural populations in processes posited by the model. I present a rationale for marshaling convergent experimental methods to ground psychological and computational processes in the activity of identified neural populations, and I discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and complementarity of the individual approaches. I then sketch some recent developments that hold great promise for advancing our understanding of structure function relationships in neuroscience in general and in the neuroeconomic study of decision making in particular.

A comparative, developmental, and clinical perspective of neurobehavioral sexual dimorphisms	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						sexual differentiation; adolescence; schizophrenia; depression; bipolar disorders; posttraumatic disorders; addiction; animal models		Women and men differ in a wide variety of behavioral traits and in their vulnerability to developing certain mental disorders. This review endeavors to explore how recent preclinical and clinical research findings have enhanced our understanding of the factors that underlie these disparities. We start with a brief overview of some of the important genetic, molecular, and hormonal determinants that contribute to the process of sexual differentiation. We then discuss the importance of animal models in studying the mechanisms responsible for sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., drug dependence) with a special emphasis on experimental models based on the neurodevelopmental and "three hits" hypotheses. Next, we describe the most common brain phenotypes observed in vivo with magnetic resonance imaging. We discuss the challenges in interpreting these phenotypes vis-a-vis the underlying neurobiology and revisit the known sex differences in brain structure from birth, through adolescence, and into adulthood. This is followed by a presentation of pertinent clinical and epidemiological data that point to important sex differences in the prevalence, course, and expression of psychopathologies such as schizophrenia, and mood disorders including major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Recent evidence implies that mood disorders and psychosis share some common genetic predispositions and neurobiological bases. Therefore, modern research is emphasizing dimensional representation of mental disorders and conceptualization of schizophrenia and major depression as a continuum of cognitive deficits and neurobiological abnormalities. Herein, we examine available evidence on cerebral sexual dimorphism to verify if sex differences vary quantitatively and/or qualitatively along the psychoses-depression continuum. Finally, sex differences in the prevalence of posttraumatic disorder and drug abuse have been described, and we consider the genomic and molecular data supporting these differences.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains elusive. Here we used the expression of Nur77, a transcription factor of the orphan nuclear receptor family, as readout to explore the role of dopamine, glutamate, and adenosine receptors in the effect of a dopamine D-2 antagonist in the striatum. First, we investigated D-2 antagonist-induced Nur77 mRNA in D-2L receptor knockout mice. Surprisingly, deletion of the D-2L receptor isoform did not reduce eticlopride-induced upregulation of Nur77 mRNA levels in the striatum. Next, we tested if an ibotenic acid-induced cortical lesion could block the effect of eticlopride on Nur77 expression. Cortical lesions strongly reduced eticlopride-induced striatal upregulation of Nur77 mRNA. Then, we investigated if glutamatergic neurotransmission could modulate eticlopride-induced Nur77 expression. A combination of a metabotropic glutamate type 5 (mG1u5) and adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists abolished eticloprideinduced upregulation of Nur77 mRNA levels in the striatum. Direct modulation of Nur77 expression by striatal glutamate and adenosine receptors was confirmed using corticostriatal organotypic cultures. Taken together, these results indicate that blockade of postsynaptic D-2 receptors is not sufficient to trigger striatal transcriptional activity and that interaction with corticostriatal presynaptic D-2 receptors and subsequent activation of postsynaptic glutamate and adenosine receptors in the striatum is required. Thus, these results uncover an unappreciated role of presynaptic D-2 heteroreceptors and support a prominent role of glutamate in the effect of D-2 antagonists.

J	Menard, C; Quirion, R				Menard, Caroline; Quirion, Remi			Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor function and its regulation of learning and memory in the aging brain	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						metabotropic glutamate receptors; aging; learning; memory; synaptic plasticity		Normal aging is generally characterized by a slow decline of cognitive abilities albeit with marked individual differences. Several animal models have been studied to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and its receptors have been closely linked to spatial learning and hippocampus-dependent memory processes. For decades, ionotropic glutamate receptors have been known to play a critical role in synaptic plasticity, a form of adaptation regulating memory formation. Over the past 10 years, several groups have shown the importance of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) in successful cognitive aging. These G-protein-coupled receptors are enriched in the hippocampal formation and interact physically with other proteins in the membrane including glutamate ionotropic receptors. Synaptic plasticity is crucial to maintain cognitive abilities and long-term depression (LTD) induced by group 1 mGluR activation, which has been linked to memory in the aging brain. The translation and synthesis of proteins by mGluR-LTD modulate ionotropic receptor trafficking and expression of immediate early genes related to cognition. Fragile X syndrome, a genetic form of autism characterized by memory deficits, has been associated to mGluR receptor malfunction and aberrant activation of its downstream signaling pathways. Dysfunction of mGluR could also be involved in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, beta-amyloid, the main component of insoluble senile plagues and one of the hallmarks of AD, occludes mGluR-dependent LTD leading to diminished functional synapses. This review highlights recent findings regarding mGluR signaling, related synaptic plasticity, and their potential involvement in normal aging and neurological disorders.

In addition, numerous extrasynaptic mechanisms provide a flexible platform for the local regulation of synaptic signals. For example, peri- and extra-synaptic signaling through the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can be involved in the highly compartmentalized regulation of dendrite ion conductances, the induction of input-specific synaptic plasticity, and the local release of retrograde messengers. Therefore, extrasynaptic mechanisms appear to play a key role in the local tuning of dendritic computations. Here, we review recent findings on the role of group I mGluRs in the dendritic signaling of inhibitory interneurons. We propose that group I mGluRs provide a dual-mode signaling device that integrates different patterns of neural activity. By implementing distinct forms of intrinsic and synaptic regulation, group I mGluRs may be responsible for the local fine-tuning of dendritic function.

The clinical intractability of many brain tumors and their distinct biology are implicitly linked to the unique microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS) and cellular interactions within. Among the most intriguing forms of cellular interactions is that mediated by membrane derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Their biogenesis (vesiculation) and uptake by recipient cells serves as a unique mechanism of intercellular trafficking of complex biological messages including the exchange of molecules that cannot be released through classical secretory pathways, or that are prone to extracellular degradation. Tumor cells produce EVs containing molecular effectors of several cancer related processes such as growth, invasion, drug resistance, angiogenesis, and coagulopathy. Notably, tumor-derived EVs (oncosomes) also contain oncogenic proteins, transcripts, DNA, and microRNA (miR). Uptake of this material may change properties of the recipient cells and impact the tumor microenvironment. Examples of transformation-related molecules found in the cargo of tumor derived EVs include the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRy111), tumor suppressors (PTEN), and oncomirs (miR-520g). It is postulated that EVs circulating in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of brain tumor patients may be used to decipher molecular features (mutations) of the underlying malignancy, reflect responses to therapy, or molecular subtypes of primary brain tumors [e.g., glioma or medulloblastoma (MB)]. It is possible that metastases to the brain may also emit EVs with clinically relevant oncogenic signatures. Thus, EVs emerge as a novel and functionally important vehicle of intercellular communication that can mediate multiple biological effects. In addition, they provide a unique platform to develop molecular biomarkers in brain malignancies.

Here we show that a functional magnetic resonance imaging measure of activity in the TVAs predicts individual performance at a separately administered voice memory test. This relation holds when general sound memory ability is taken into account. These findings provide the first evidence that the TVAs are specifically involved in voice cognition.

Little is known yet, however, about the "informational correlates" of consciousness i.e., which low-level information correlates with brain activation during conscious vs. non-conscious perception. Here, we investigated this question in the spatial frequency (SF) domain. We examined which SFs in disgusted and fearful faces modulate activation in the insula and amygdala over time and as a function of awareness, using a combination of intracranial event-related potentials (ERPs), SF Bubbles (Willenbeckel et al., 2010a), and Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS; Tsuchiya and Koch, 2005). Patients implanted with electrodes for epilepsy monitoring viewed face photographs (13 x 7) that were randomly SF filtered on a trial-by-trial basis. In the conscious condition, the faces were visible; in the non-conscious condition, they were rendered invisible using CFS. The data were analyzed by performing multiple linear regressions on the SF filters from each trial and the transformed ERP amplitudes across time. The resulting classification images suggest that many SFs are involved in the conscious and non-conscious perception of emotional expressions, with SFs between 6 and 10 cycles per face width being particularly important early on. The results also revealed qualitative differences between the awareness conditions for both regions. Non-conscious processing relied on low SFs more and was faster than conscious processing. Overall, our findings are consistent with the idea that different pathways are employed for the processing of emotional stimuli under different degrees of awareness. The present study represents a first step to mapping how SF information "flows" through the emotion-processing network with a high temporal resolution and to shedding light on the informational correlates of consciousness in general.

We trained 10 human listeners to discriminate micromelodies (consisting of smaller pitch intervals than normally used in Western music) and measured covariation in blood oxygenation signal to increasing pitch interval size in order to dissociate global changes in activity from those specifically associated with the stimulus feature that was trained. A psychophysical staircase procedure with feedback was used for training over a 2-week period. Behavioral tests of discrimination ability performed before and after training showed significant learning on the trained stimuli, and generalization to other frequencies and tasks; no learning occurred in an untrained control group. Before training the functional MRI data showed the expected systematic increase in activity in auditory cortices as a function of increasing micromelody pitch interval size. This function became shallower after training, with the maximal change observed in the right posterior auditory cortex. Global decreases in activity in auditory regions, along with global increases in frontal cortices also occurred after training. Individual variation in learning rate was related to the hemodynamic slope to pitch interval size, such that those who had a higher sensitivity to pitch interval variation prior to learning achieved the fastest learning. We conclude that configural auditory learning entails modulation in the response of auditory cortex to the trained stimulus feature. Reduction in blood oxygenation response to increasing pitch interval size suggests that fewer computational resources, and hence lower neural recruitment, is associated with learning, in accord with models of auditory cortex function, and with data from other modalities.

Biological motion provides information about a walker, from gender and identity to speed, direction, and distance. In our natural environment, as someone approaches us (closer distances), the walker spans larger areas of our field of view, the extent of which can be underutilized with age. Yet, the effect of age on biological-motion perception in such real-world scenarios remains unknown. We assessed the effect of age on discriminating walking direction in upright and inverted biological-motion patterns, positioned at various distances in virtual space. Findings indicate that discrimination is worse at closer distances, an effect exacerbated by age. Older adults' performance decreases at distances as far away as 4 m, whereas younger adults maintain their performance as close as 1 m (worse at 0.5 m). This suggests that older observers are limited in their capacity to integrate information over larger areas of the visual field and supports the notion that age-related effects are more apparent when larger neural networks are required to process simultaneous information. This has further implications for social contexts where information from biological motion is critical.

In a recent study, we investigated the neural substrates for depth and rivalry processing with these plaid patterns, when either a depth or rivalry task was performed (Buckthought and Mendola 2011, Journal of Vision 11 1-15). However, the extent to which perception of the two stimulus aspects was truly simultaneous remained somewhat unclear. In the present study, we introduced a new task in which subjects were instructed to perform both depth and rivalry tasks concurrently. Subjects were clearly able to perform both tasks at the same time, but with a modest, symmetric drop in performance when compared to either task carried out alone. Subjects were also able to raise performance levels for either task by performing it with a higher priority, with a decline in performance for the other task. The symmetric declines in performance are consistent with the interpretation that the two tasks are equally demanding of attention (Braun and Julesz 1998, Perception & Psychophysics 60 1-23). The results demonstrate the impressive combination of binocular features that supports coincident depth and rivalry in surface perception, within the constraints of presumed orientation and spatial frequency channels.

Our framework automatically evaluates the efficacy of many possible electrode orientations to optimize the interplay between the extracellular electric field, created from distinct arrangements of active contacts, and anatomical structures responsible for therapeutic and potential side effects. Experimental results on subthalamic DBS cases suggest bipolar configurations provide more flexibility and control on the spread of electric field and, consequently, are most robust to targeting imprecision. Visualization of predicted efficacy maps provides surgeons with complementary feedback that can bridge the gap between insertion safety and optimal therapeutic efficacy. Overall, this work adds a new dimension to preoperative DBS planning and suggests new insights regarding multi-target stimulation.	[Beriault, Silvain; Xiao, Yiming; Bailey, Lara; Collins, D.

However, many of the enhancing voxels are associated with normal structures (i.e. blood vessels) or noise in the MRI, making the detection of gad-enhancing lesions a challenging task. Furthermore, these lesions are typically small and in close proximity to vessels. In this paper, we present an automatic, probabilistic Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) framework for detection of gad-enhancing lesions in brain images of patients with MS. In the first level, a CRF with unary and pairwise potentials is used to identify candidate lesion voxel. In the second level, these lesion candidates are grouped based on anatomical and spatial features, and feature-specific lesion based CRF models are designed for each group. This lesion level CRF incorporates higher order potentials which account for shape, group intensities and symmetries. The proposed algorithm is trained on 92 multimodal clinical datasets acquired from Relapsing-Remitting MS patients during multi-center clinical trials and is evaluated on 30 independent cases. The experimental results show a sensitivity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 66% and an average false positive count of 1.55, outperforming the CRF and MRF frameworks proposed in [1].

We propose a self-similarity weighted graph-based implementation of alpha-mutual information (alpha-MI) for nonrigid image registration. The new Self Similarity alpha-MI (SeSaMI) metric takes local structures into account and is robust against signal non-stationarity and intensity distortions. We have used SeSaMI as the similarity measure in a regularized cost function with B-spline deformation field. Since the gradient of SeSaMI can be derived analytically, the cost function can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient descent. We show that SeSaMI produces a robust and smooth cost function and outperforms the state of the art statistical based similarity metrics in simulation and using data from image-guided neurosurgery.

Nonlinearities are quantified with biophysical models. Supranormal oxygen consumption from epileptic spikes is inferred. In one recording, interictal spikes followed an almost periodic pattern. Such rhythmic spiking is a well-documented phenomenon in electrophysiological studies, but the hemodynamics correlates have been less studied. Spikes occurred every 12.5 +/- 1.0 s. Peaks in total hemoglobin (HbT), a proxy for regional cerebral blood volume, followed spikes by 2.6 +/- 0.3 s. Troughs in HbT preceded spikes by 1.68 +/- 1.2 s. The narrowness of this distribution is surprising. From it, one may derive a significant but paradoxical fall in HbT several seconds before the spikes, but which this decrease in HbT is better interpreted as being due to the interictal spike that occurred before.

An optimization algorithm coupled with three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) analysis is used to determine the optimum film cooling configuration. The VKI blade with two staggered rows of axially oriented, conically flared, film cooling holes on its suction surface is considered. Two design variables are selected; the coolant to mainstream temperature ratio and total pressure ratio. The effect of varying these coolant flow parameters on the film cooling effectiveness and the aerodynamic loss is analyzed using an optimization method and three dimensional steady CFD simulations. The optimization process involves a genetic algorithm and a response surface approximation of the artificial neural network type to provide low-fidelity predictions of the objective function. The CFD simulations are performed using the commercial software CFX. The numerical predictions of the aerodynamics and wall heat transfer are validated against experimental data. The optimization objective consists of maximizing the spatially averaged film cooling effectiveness and minimizing the aerodynamic penalty produced by film cooling. The results of this optimization are reported in terms of the aerodynamic loss and adiabatic cooling effectiveness.

This hypothesis is based on animal studies carried out in naive normal animals but not in animal models of depression, including the olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rat. The OBX rat produces a wide array of symptoms that mimic several aspects of human depression and anxiety disorders. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of sustained (2 weeks) intracerebroventricular administration of NPY Y-1 and Y-2 agonists and antagonists in a battery of behavioral tests including the open field, forced swim test (FST) and social interaction (SI) tests in OBX rats. The levels of Y-1 and Y-2 receptors in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala (BLA) were also evaluated. Treatment with the Y-1-like receptor agonist, [Leu(31)Pro(34)]PYY, decreased both depressive- and anxiogenic-like behaviors. The Y-2 receptor antagonist, BIIE0246, decreased the immobility time in the FST in OBX animals and increased active contacts in the SI test in sham rats. The Y-2 agonist, PYY3-36, increased the immobility time in the FST in OBX rats. Additionally, increased levels of Y-2 receptor binding were quantified in the dorsal hippocampus and BLA in OBX rats. Taken together, the autoradiographic results add further evidence that the NPYergic system is altered in disturbed emotional states. Moreover, we demonstrate a differential role for NPY Y-1 and Y-2 receptors in emotional processes under control and challenged conditions.

Objectives: To review the current organisation of genetic services, mostly in Europe, North America and Australia, explore emerging service delivery models, and probe challenges inherent in the transition process. Methods: We conducted a literature review of genetics in clinical practice: testing, diagnosis, counselling, and treatment. We examined the basic structures of genetic services, examples of integrated networks, and existing professional resources. We investigated services belonging traditionally in medical genetics as well as those developed for more common diseases. Results: Multidisciplinary specialist clinics and coordinated services appeared to be key to delivering proper care in rare genetic disorders. For oncogenetics, neurogenetics and cardiogenetics, interprofessional collaboration between geneticists and other specialists seemed to be favoured. On the other hand, there was also a tendency toward the integration of genetic services directly into primary care. Among the most pressing challenges was the morphing of paediatric care into adult care. Conclusion: The coordination of activities between professionals in first-, second-, and third-line medical care is a primary objective calling for the reconfiguration of professional roles and responsibilities. This entails the forging of new relationships as well as an enhanced sharing of expertise and genetic information, including information regarding services. Barriers to overcome include the redistribution of roles, sharing of data and databases, and the lack of preparedness of non-genetics professionals and of the health care system in general.

Since new data may become available over time, an important feature of an ADS is the ability to accommodate newly acquired data incrementally, after it has originally been trained and deployed for operations. In this paper, a system based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is proposed to efficiently adapt ensembles of HMMs (EoHMMs) in response to new data, according to a learn-and-combine approach. When a new block of training data becomes available, a pool of base HMMs is generated from the data using a different number of HMM states and random initializations. The responses from the newly trained HMMs are then combined to those of the previously trained HMMs in ROC space using a novel incremental Boolean combination (incrBC) technique. Finally, specialized algorithms for model management allow to select a diversified EoHMM from the pool, and adapt Boolean fusion functions and thresholds for improved performance, while it prunes redundant base HMMs. The proposed system is capable of changing the desired operating point during operations, and this point can be adjusted to changes in prior probabilities and costs of errors. Computer simulations conducted on synthetic and real-world host-based intrusion detection data indicate that the proposed system can achieve a significantly higher level of performance than when parameters of a single best HMM are estimated, at each learning stage, using reference batch and incremental learning techniques. It also outperforms the learn-and-combine approaches using static fusion functions (e.g., majority voting). Over time, the proposed ensemble selection algorithms form compact EoHMMs, while maintaining or improving system accuracy. Pruning allows to limit the pool size from increasing indefinitely, thereby reducing the storage space for accommodating HMMs parameters without negatively affecting the overall EoHMM performance. Although applied for HMM-based ADSs, the proposed approach is general and can be employed for a wide range of classifiers and detection applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PRMT5 is functionally involved in a variety of biological processes including embryo development and circadian clock regulation. However, the role of PRMT5 in oligodendrocyte differentiation and central nervous system myelination is unknown. Here we show that PRMT5 expression gradually increases throughout postnatal brain development, coinciding with the period of active myelination. PRMT5 expression was observed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. siRNA-mediated depletion of PRMT5 in mouse primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells abrogated oligodendrocyte differentiation. In addition, the PRMT5-depleted oligodendrocyte progenitor and C6 glioma cells expressed high levels of the inhibitors of differentiation/DNA binding, Id2 and Id4, known repressors of glial cell differentiation. We observed that CpG-rich islands within the Id2 and Id4 genes were bound by PRMT5 and were hypomethylated in PRMT5-deficient cells, suggesting that PRMT5 plays a role in gene silencing during glial cell differentiation. Our findings define a role of PRMT5 in glial cell differentiation and link PRMT5 to epigenetic changes during oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Investigations of the neural correlates of emotional memory in schizophrenia patients are scarce in the literature. The present study aimed to compare cerebral activations in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during memory retrieval of emotional images that varied in both valence and arousal. In a study with functional magnetic resonance imaging, 37 schizophrenia patients were compared with 37 healthy participants while performing a yes/no recognition paradigm with positive, negative (differing in arousal intensity) and neutral images. Schizophrenia patients performed worse than healthy controls in all experimental conditions. They showed less cerebral activation in limbic and prefrontal regions than controls during retrieval of negatively valenced stimuli, but had a similar pattern of brain activation compared with controls during retrieval of positively valenced stimuli (particularly in the high arousal condition) in the cerebellum, temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex. Both groups demonstrated increased brain activations in the high relative to low arousing conditions. Our results suggest atypical brain function during retrieval of negative pictures, but intact functional circuitry of positive affect during episodic memory retrieval in schizophrenia patients. The arousal data revealed that schizophrenia patients closely resemble the control group at both the behavioral and neurofunctional level. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

An interference effect was observed at the behavioral level: the mismatched condition was performed more slowly than the matched condition. ERP analyses revealed a more negative component between 400 and 600 ms in the mismatched condition than in the matched condition. Dipole source analysis of the difference wave (mismatched minus matched) indicated that two generators localized in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) contributed to this cross-modal interference effect. These results provided the electrophysiological evidence of interference during the extraction of taste information from memory and conflict control during the incongruent taste-visual information processing.

MITOCHONDRIAL ABNORMALITY IN SENSORY, BUT NOT MOTOR, AXONS IN PACLITAXEL-EVOKED PAINFUL PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY IN THE RAT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						chemotherapy neuropathy; mitotoxicity; neuropathic pain; sensory neuropathy	ACETYL-L-CARNITINE; DEPENDENT ANION CHANNEL; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLIA; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LANGERHANS CELLS; SUPPORTING CELLS; SCIATIC-NERVE; NEURONS; TAXOL; FIBER	The dose-limiting side effect of the anti-neoplastic agent, paclitaxel, is a chronic distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy that produces sensory dysfunction (hypoesthesia and neuropathic pain) but little or no distal motor dysfunction. Similar peripheral neuropathies are seen with chemotherapeutics in the vinca alkaloid, platinum-complex, and proteasome inhibitor classes. Studies in rats suggest that the cause is a mitotoxic effect on axonal mitochondria. If so, then the absence of motor dysfunction may be due to mitotoxicity that affects sensory axons but spares motor axons. To investigate this, paclitaxel exposure levels in the dorsal root, ventral root, dorsal root ganglion, peripheral nerve, and spinal cord were measured, and the ultrastructure and the respiratory function of mitochondria in dorsal roots and ventral roots were compared. Sensory and motor axons in the roots and nerve had comparably low exposure to paclitaxel and exposure in the spinal cord was negligible. However, sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion had a very high and remarkably persistent (up to 10 days or more after the last injection) exposure to paclitaxel. Paclitaxel evoked a significant increase in the incidence of swollen and vacuolated mitochondria in the myelinated and unmyelinated sensory axons of the dorsal root (as seen previously in the peripheral nerve) but not in the motor axons of the ventral root. Stimulated mitochondrial respiration in the dorsal root was significantly depressed in paclitaxel-treated animals examined 2-4 weeks after the last injection, whereas respiration in the ventral root was normal. We conclude that the absence of motor dysfunction in paclitaxel-evoked peripheral neuropathy may be due to the absence of a mitotoxic effect in motor neuron axons, whereas the sensory dysfunction may be due to a mitotoxic effect resulting from the primary afferent neuron's cell body being exposed to high and persistent levels of paclitaxel.

Neurexins are a highly polymorphic family of synaptic receptors diversified by extensive alternative splicing. Neurexin variants exhibit distinct isoform-specific biochemical interactions and synapse assembly functions, but the mechanisms governing splice isoform choice are not understood. We demonstrate that Nrxn1 alternative splicing is temporally and spatially controlled in the mouse brain. Neuronal activity triggers a shift in Nrxn1 splice isoform choice via calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV signaling. Activity-dependent alternative splicing of Nrxn1 requires the KH-domain RNA-binding protein SAM68 that associates with RNA response elements in the Nrxn1 pre-mRNA. Our findings uncover SAM68 as a key regulator of dynamic control of Nrxn1 molecular diversity and activity-dependent alternative splicing in the central nervous system.

We showed that astrocytes secrete Sonic hedgehog and that BBB ECs express Hedgehog (Hh) receptors, which together promote BBB formation and integrity during embryonic development and adulthood. Using pharmacological inhibition and genetic inactivation of the Hh signaling pathway in ECs, we also demonstrated a critical role of the Hh pathway in promoting the immune quiescence of BBB ECs by decreasing the expression of proinflammatory mediators and the adhesion and migration of leukocytes, in vivo and in vitro. Overall, the Hh pathway provides a barrier-promoting effect and an endogenous anti-inflammatory balance to CNS-directed immune attacks, as occurs in multiple sclerosis.

Multifocal Attention Filters Targets from Distracters within and beyond Primate MT Neurons' Receptive Field Boundaries	NEURON			English	Article							MULTIPLE-OBJECT TRACKING; CORTICAL AREA MT; ZOOM LENS MODEL; TEMPORAL VISUAL AREA; FOCAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SURROUND MODULATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; V4; CORTEX	Visual attention has been classically described as a spotlight that enhances the processing of a behaviorally relevant object. However, in many situations, humans and animals must simultaneously attend to several relevant objects separated by distracters. To account for this ability, various models of attention have been proposed including splitting of the attentional spotlight into multiple foci, zooming of the spotlight over a region of space, and switching of the spotlight among objects. We investigated this controversial issue by recording neuronal activity in visual area MT of two macaques while they attended to two translating objects that circumvented a third distracter object located inside the neurons' receptive field. We found that when the attended objects passed through or nearby the receptive field, neuronal responses to the distracter were either decreased or remained unaltered. These results demonstrate that attention can split into multiple spotlights corresponding to relevant objects while filtering out interspersed distracters.

However, the common mechanisms underlying the neuropathy and FSGS remain unknown. Mutations in INF2 were recently identified in patients with autosomal dominant FSGS. INF2 encodes a formin protein that interacts with the Rho-GTPase CDC42 and myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL) that are implicated in essential steps of myelination and myelin maintenance. We therefore hypothesized that INF2 may be responsible for cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy associated with FSGS. METHODS We performed direct genotyping of INF2 in 16 index patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and FSGS who did not have a mutation in PMP22 or MPZ, encoding peripheral myelin protein 22 and myelin protein zero, respectively. Histologic and functional studies were also conducted. RESULTS We identified nine new heterozygous mutations in 12 of the 16 index patients (75%), all located in exons 2 and 3, encoding the diaphanous-inhibitory domain of INF2. Patients presented with an intermediate form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy as well as a glomerulopathy with FSGS on kidney biopsy. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong INF2 expression in Schwann-cell cytoplasm and podocytes. Moreover, we demonstrated that INF2 colocalizes and interacts with MAL in Schwann cells. The INF2 mutants perturbed the INF2-MAL-CDC42 pathway, resulting in cytoskeleton disorganization, enhanced INF2 binding to CDC42 and mislocalization of INF2, MAL, and CDC42. CONCLUSIONS INF2 mutations appear to cause many cases of FSGS-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, showing that INF2 is involved in a disease affecting both the kidney glomerulus and the peripheral nervous system. These findings provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms linking formin proteins to podocyte and Schwanncell function. (Funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche and others.)

Sensitivity to C-target stimuli (optotypes) was measured for four age groups: 18-34, 35-49, 50-64, and 65+ years. Participants indicated optotype gap-opening orientations (up, down, left, or right) at different levels of luminance or texture contrast. Although sensitivity did not differ across age group for the luminance-defined optotypes, sensitivity for texture-defined optotypes for the 65+ years age group was significantly decreased relative to that of the youngest group (18-34 years). Results suggest that age-related changes in visual function can be dissociated at different levels of processing, and may be better defined using stimuli that necessarily depend on higher levels of neural functioning to be perceived.

White matter integrity and math performance in pediatric multiple sclerosis: a diffusion tensor imaging study	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						arithmetic ability; diffusion tensor imaging; fractional anisotropy; pediatric multiple sclerosis; white matter	WORKING-MEMORY; CHILDREN; SPECIALIZATION; DIFFICULTIES; REGISTRATION; CHILDHOOD; ABILITY; MRI	Multiple sclerosis is associated with reduced white matter integrity and deficits in key cognitive processes important for arithmetic. This study examined the relationship between white matter microstructure and academic ability in 31 youths with multiple sclerosis (aged 11-19 years) and 34 demographically matched controls. Using diffusion tensor imaging, fractional anisotropy was calculated in corpus callosum and in lateralized hemispheric lobes. Difficulties with written arithmetic ability were observed in 26% of patients. Arithmetic ability correlated with fractional anisotropy values across all segments of the corpus callosum and in right frontal and parietal regions, controlling for age (r values >0.5, P<0.005). Findings highlight the functional impact of compromised white matter microstructure across diffuse regions of the brain on mathematical ability.

PKM zeta is essential for spinal plasticity underlying the maintenance of persistent pain	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article						nociception; protein kinase C; central nociceptive sensitization	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; INTRADERMAL INJECTION; TACTILE ALLODYNIA; EPSILON-ISOZYME; DORSAL-HORN; RAT; SENSITIZATION; CAPSAICIN	Background: Chronic pain occurs when normally protective acute pain becomes pathologically persistent. We examined here whether an isoform of protein kinase C (PKC), PKM zeta, that underlies long-term memory storage in various brain regions, also sustains nociceptive plasticity in spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) mediating persistent pain. Results: Cutaneous injury or spinal stimulation produced persistent increases of PKM zeta, but not other atypical PKCs in SCDH. Inhibiting spinal PKM zeta, but not full-length PKCs, reversed plasticity-dependent persistent painful responses to hind paw formalin and secondary mechanical hypersensitivity and SCDH neuron sensitization after hind paw capsaicin, without affecting peripheral sensitization-dependent primary heat hypersensitivity after hind paw capsaicin. Inhibiting spinal PKM zeta, but not full-length PKCs, also reversed mechanical hypersensitivity in the rat hind paw induced by spinal stimulation with intrathecal dihydroxyphenylglycine. Spinal PKM zeta inhibition also alleviated allodynia 3 weeks after ischemic injury in rats with chronic post-ischemia pain (CPIP), at a point when allodynia depends on spinal changes. In contrast, spinal PKM zeta inhibition did not affect allodynia in rats with chronic contriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, or CPIP rats early after ischemic injury, when allodynia depends on ongoing peripheral inputs. Conclusions: These results suggest spinal PKM zeta is essential for the maintenance of persistent pain by sustaining spinal nociceptive plasticity.

Subjects completed, in random order, symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise tests under control (CTRL) and DSL (500 ml) conditions. Compared with CTRL, DSL decreased exercise tolerance by 20-25%; increased exertional dyspnea intensity ratings in direct proportion to concurrent increases in EMGdi%max, Pes,tida%P(Imax) and (V)over dotE; and had little/no effect on the inter-relationships between EMGdi%max, Pes,tidal%P(Imax) and (V)over dotE during exercise. In conclusion, DSL was associated with an earlier onset of intolerable dyspnea; however, neuromuscular and neuro-ventilatory coupling of the respiratory system remained relatively preserved during exercise in the presence of an increased external dead space. Under these circumstances, DSL-induced increases in exertional dyspnea intensity ratings reflected, at least in part, the awareness of increased neural respiratory drive, contractile respiratory muscle effort and ventilatory output.

The novel MT2 receptor partial agonist, N-{2-[(3-methoxyphenyl) phenylamino] ethyl} acetamide (UCM765), is here shown to selectively promote non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in rats and mice. The enhancement of NREMS by UCM765 is nullified by the pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of MT2 receptors. MT2, but not MT1, knock-out mice show a decrease in NREMS compared to the wild strain. Immunohistochemical labeling reveals that MT2 receptors are localized in sleep-related brain regions, and notably the reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt). Microinfusion of UCM765 in the Rt promotes NREMS, and its systemic administration induces an increase in firing and rhythmic burst activity of Rt neurons, which is blocked by the MT2 antagonist 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin. Since developing hypnotics that increase NREMS without altering sleep architecture remains a medical challenge, MT2 receptors may represent a novel target for the treatment of sleep disorders.

Here, we report that the lack of PKR enhances learning and memory in several behavioral tasks while increasing network excitability. In addition, loss of PKR increases the late phase of long-lasting synaptic potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal slices. These effects are caused by an interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-mediated selective reduction in GABAergic synaptic action. Together, our results reveal that PKR finely tunes the network activity that must be maintained while storing a given episode during learning. Because PKR activity is altered in several neurological disorders, this kinase presents a promising new target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. As a first step in this direction, we show that a selective PKR inhibitor replicates the Pkr(-/-) phenotype in WT mice, enhancing long-term memory storage and L-LTP.

Methods and Materials: Between March 2000 and March 2009, 27 patients (male to female ratio, 1.25) with PMA underwent SFRT (median dose, 50.4 Gy). Mean age of the patients was 56.5 years (range, 20.3 - 77.4). In all but one patient, SFRT was administered for salvage treatment after surgical resection (transphenoidal resection in 23, transphenoidal resection followed by craniotomy in 2 and multiple transphenoidal resections in another patient). In 10 (37%) patients, the PMAs were functional (3 ACTH-secreting, 3 prolactinomas, 2 growth hormone-secreting and 2 multiple hormone-secretion). Three (11.1%) and 9 (33.3%) patients had PMA abutting and compressing the optic chiasm, respectively. Mean tumor volume was 2.9 +/- 4.6 cm(3). Eighteen (66.7%) patients had hypopituitarism prior to SFRT. The mean follow-up period after SFRT was 72.4 +/- 37.2 months. Results: Tumor size decreased for 6 (22.2%) patients and remained unchanged for 19 (70.4%) other patients. Two (7.4%) patients had tumor growth inside the prescribed treatment volume. The estimated 5-year tumor growth control was 95.5% after SFRT. Biochemical remission occurred in 3 (30%) patients with functional PMA. Two patients with normal anterior pituitary function before SFRT developed new deficits 25 and 65 months after treatment. The 5-year survival without new anterior pituitary deficit was thus 95.8%. Five patients with visual field defect had improved visual function and 1 patient with no visual defect prior to SFRT, but an optic chiasm abutting tumor, had a decline in visual function. The estimated 5-year vision and pituitary function preservation rates were 93.2% and 95.8%, respectively. Conclusions: SFRT is a safe and effective treatment for patients with PMA, although longer follow-up is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes. In this study, approximately 1 patient with visual field defect out of two had an improved visual	[Weber, Damien C.] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Radiat Oncol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Momjian, Shahan] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Neurosurg, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Pralong, Francois P.] CHU Vaudois, Dept Endocrinol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Meyer, Patrick] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Endocrinol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Villemure, Jean Guy] Univ Montreal, Dept Neurosurg, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Pica, Alessia] CHU Vaudois, Dept Radiat Oncol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pica, Alessia] Univ Bern, Inselspital, Dept Radiat Oncol, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland	Weber, DC (reprint author), Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Radiat Oncol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.

Age-Related Changes in Right Middle Frontal Gyrus Volume Correlate with Altered Episodic Retrieval Activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; MEMORY RETRIEVAL; OLDER-ADULTS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; NEURAL ACTIVITY	Age-related deficits in episodic retrieval have been associated with volume reductions in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). However, it remains unclear how this age-related reduction in MFG volume correlates with neural activity during retrieval. To address this, we conducted in vivo volumetry of the frontal cortex in young and older human adults and found more volume loss on the right than on the left MFG with age. We then examined how left and right MFG volume correlated with fMRI activity during successful retrieval of item, spatial context, and temporal context information in both age groups. In young adults, larger right MFG volume was positively correlated with greater activity in a commonly found episodic retrieval network that included bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral inferior parietal cortex. Within this network, left DLPFC and right inferior parietal cortex activity predicted memory performance. In older adults, a positive structure-function association in DLPFC for either left or right MFG/DLPFC was not observed. Instead, right MFG volume was negatively correlated with activity in several regions in older adults, including the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and anterior cingulate. Less activity in the PHC region predicted better item memory, and less activity in the anterior cingulate predicted better spatial context accuracy in older adults. We conclude that age-related change in the structure-function association in MFG/DLPFC impacts retrieval activity and performance, and those older adults with larger right MFG volume attempt to compensate for this change by modifying activity in other brain regions to help retrieval performance.

Until now, these results have been limited to the organization principles of early visual cortex (V1). While the middle temporal area (MT) has been the first identified extra-striate visual area shown to exhibit a columnar organization in monkeys, evidence of MT's columnar response properties and topographic layout in humans has remained elusive. Research using various approaches suggests similar response properties as in monkeys but failed to provide direct evidence for direction or axis of motion selectivity in human area MT. By combining state of the art pulse sequence design, high spatial resolution in all three dimensions (0.8 mm isotropic), optimized coil design, ultrahigh field magnets (7 Tesla) and novel high resolution cortical grid sampling analysis tools, we provide the first direct evidence for large-scale axis of motion selective feature organization in human area MT closely matching predictions from topographic columnar-level simulations.

SCI is caused by trauma, although it can also result from myelopathy, myelitis, vascular disease or arteriovenous malformations and multiple sclerosis. Patients with complete lesions of the spinal cord between spinal cord level T6 and S2, after they recover from spinal shock, generally exhibit involuntary bladder contractions without sensation, smooth sphincter synergy, but with detrusor striated sphincter dyssynergia (DESD). Those with lesions above spinal cord level T6 may experience, in addition, smooth sphincter dyssynergia and autonomic hyperreflexia. DESD is a debilitating problem in patients with SCI. It carries a high risk of complications, and even life expectancy can be affected. Nearly half of the patients with untreated DESD will develop deleterious urologic complications, due to high intravesical pressures, resulting in urolithiasis, urinary tract infection (UT!), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), hydronephrosis, obstructive uropathy, and renal failure. The mainstay of treatment is the use of antimuscarinics and catheterization, but in those for whom this is not possible external sphincterotomy has been a last resort option. External sphincterotomy is associated with significant risks, including haemorrhage; erectile dysfunction and the possibility of redo procedures. Over the last decade alternatives have been investigated, such as urethral stents and intrasphincteric botulinum toxin injection. In this review, we will cover neurogenic DESD, with emphasis on definition, classifications, diagnosis and different therapeutic options available.

In this study, we demonstrate that exposure to a running wheel environment, in the absence of running, is sufficient to regulate specific aspects of hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult mice were provided with standard housing, housing enriched with a running wheel or housing enriched with a locked wheel (i.e., an environment comparable to that of running animals, without the possibility of engaging in running). We found that mice in the running wheel and locked wheel groups exhibited equivalent increases in proliferation within the neurogenic niche of the dentate gyrus; this included comparable increases in the proliferation of radial glia-like stem cells and the number of proliferating neuroblasts. However, only running animals displayed increased numbers of postmitotic neuroblasts and mature neurons. These results demonstrate that the running wheel environment itself is sufficient for promoting proliferation of early lineage hippocampal precursors, while running per se enables newly generated neuroblasts to survive and mature into functional hippocampal neurons. Thus, both running-independent and running-dependent stimuli are integral to running wheel-induced hippocampal neurogenesis. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mutations occurring in genes encoding RNAses cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS). AGS mutations silence RNAse activity, thus inducing accumulation of endogenous RNAs, mainly consisting of short RNAs and microRNAs. Overload of intracellular RNA triggers Toll like receptor-dependent interferon-alpha production in the brain, which in turn activates neurotoxic lymphocytes and inhibits angiogenesis thus inducing the typical clinical phenotype of AGS. However, these pathogenic mechanisms are attenuated after three years of age by the endogenous production of DNAJP58IPK and Cystatin F, which arrest AGS progression. Because RNAses are involved in microRNA turnover, we evaluated the expression of 957 microRNAs in lymphocytes from AGS patients and control patients. Our results indicate that microRNA overload occurs in AGS patients. This upregulation inhibits microRNA turnover impeding the synthesis of the novel microRNAs required for the differentiation and myelination of the brain during the initial period of postnatal life. These pathogenic mechanisms result in AGS, a neurological syndrome characterized by irritability, mild hyperpyrexia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, and spastic-dystonic tetraplegia. Typical cerebrospinal fluid alterations include lymphocytosis and elevated interferon-alpha levels. Brain imaging demonstrates cerebral calcifications, white matter abnormalities, and progressive cerebral atrophy.

The emergence of psychiatric uses for DBS combined with the fact that it is an invasive and expensive procedure creates important ethical and social challenges in the delivery of care that need further examination. We endeavored to examine health care provider perspectives on ethical and social challenges encountered in DBS. METHODS: Health care providers working in Canadian DBS surgery programs participated in a semistructured interview to identify and characterize ethical and social challenges of DBS. A content analysis of the interviews was conducted. RESULTS: Several key ethical issues, such as patient screening and resource allocation, were identified by members of neurosurgical teams. Providers described challenges in selecting patients for DBS on the basis of unclear evidence-based guidance regarding behavioral issues or cognitive criteria. Varied contexts of resource allocation, including some very challenging schemas, were also reported. In addition, the management of patients in the community was highlighted as a source of ethical and clinical complexity, given the need for coordinated long-term care. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the complexity of ethical challenges that providers face in the use of DBS across different neurosurgical centers. We propose actions for health care providers for the long-term care and postoperative monitoring of patients with DBS. More data on patient perspectives in DBS would complement the understanding of key challenges, as well as contribute to best practices, for patient selection, management, and resource allocation.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis in enamelin null mice	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Development, Properties and Pathology of Tooth Enamel	JUN 12-18, 2011	N Utica, IL			amelogenesis imperfecta; enamel crystals; LacZ knockin; mineralization front; Tomes' process	DOMINANT AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA; 32 KDA ENAMELIN; NEURAL CREST; TOOTH GERM; GENE; AMELOBLASTS; MUTATION; DIFFERENTIATION; EPITHELIUM; EVOLUTION	Enamelin is a secreted glycoprotein that is critical for dental enamel formation. Ameloblasts in enamelin (Enam) null mice develop atypical features that include the absence of a Tomes' process, expanded endoplasmic reticulum, apparent loss of polarity, and pooling of extracellular matrix in all directions, including between ameloblasts and the stratum intermedium. We hypothesized that ameloblast pathological changes may be associated with increased cell apoptosis. Our objective was to assess apoptotic activity in maxillary first molars of wild-type, Enam(+/-), and Enam(-/-) mice at postnatal days 5, 7, 9, 14, and 17. Mouse maxillae were characterized by light microscopy after terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) or 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) staining. Following the initial deposition of dentin matrix, ameloblasts became highly dysplastic and no enamel crystal ribbons were deposited. Ameloblast apoptosis was observed in the Enam null mice starting in the secretory stage and with no apparent alteration in cell proliferation. We conclude that in the absence of enamelin and subsequent shutdown of enamel formation, ameloblasts undergo pathological changes early in the secretory stage that are evident as radically altered cell morphology, detachment from the tooth surface, apoptosis, and formation of ectopic calcifications both outside and inside the dystrophic enamel organ.

The aim was to describe the mechanism and injuries of severely injured geriatric patients and to identify risk factors associated with mortality. Methods: The Trauma Registry at a Canadian Level I trauma center was queried for all trauma patients older than 65 years and injury severity score >15 from 2004 to 2006, resulting in a retrospective chart review of 276 patients. The data were subsequently analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Average age was 81.5 years (mean injury severity score of 25). Most common comorbid illness was hypertension (57.3%) and most frequent mechanism of injury was falls (72.3%). The overall mortality was comparable with the US National Trauma Data Bank (26.8% vs. 32.0%, confidence interval, 0.00-0.10). Geriatric patients requiring intubation, blood transfusions, or suffering from head, C-spine, or chest trauma had an increased likelihood of death. In-hospital respiratory, gastrointestinal, or infectious complications also had higher likelihood of death. Conclusions: Falls continue to be the most frequent mechanism of injury in severely injured geriatric patients. Risk factors associated with a higher likelihood of death are identified. More research is needed to better understand this important and increasing group of trauma patients.

In this study, a genetic approach using the murine intraperitoneal cysticercosis caused by the related cestode Taenia crassiceps was employed to identify host factors that regulate the establishment and proliferation of the parasite. A/J mice are permissive to T. crassiceps infection while C57BL/6J mice (B6) are comparatively restrictive, with a 10-fold difference in numbers of peritoneal cysticerci recovered 30 days after infection. The genetic basis of this inter-strain difference was explored using 34 AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains derived from A/J and B6 progenitors, that were phenotyped for T. crassiceps replication. In agreement with their genetic background, most AcB strains (A/J-derived) were found to be permissive to infection while most BcA strains (B6-derived) were restrictive with the exception of a few discordant strains, together suggesting a possible simple genetic control. Initial haplotype association mapping using >1200 informative SNPs pointed to linkages on chromosomes 2 (proximal) and 6 as controlling parasite replication in the AcB/BcA panel. Additional linkage analysis by genome scan in informative [AcB55xDBA/2]F1 and F2 mice (derived from the discordant AcB55 strain), confirmed the effect of chromosome 2 on parasite replication, and further delineated a major locus (LOD = 4.76, p<0.01; peak marker D2Mit295, 29.7 Mb) that we designate Tccr1 (T. crassiceps cysticercosis restrictive locus 1). Resistance alleles at Tccr1 are derived from AcB55 and are inherited in a dominant fashion. Scrutiny of the minimal genetic interval reveals overlap of Tccr1 with other host resistance loci mapped to this region, most notably the defective Hc/C5 allele which segregates both in the AcB/BcA set and in the AcB55xDBA/2 cross. These results strongly suggest that the complement component 5 (C5) plays a critical role in early protective inflammatory response to infection with T. crassiceps.

However, prescription rates for this medication remain among the lowest of all atypical antipsychotics. Objective: The present meta-analysis examined premature study discontinuation (PSD) and dose-response associated with ziprasidone. Furthermore, a systematic review of the clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of ziprasidone was conducted to explain the meta-analytic findings. Methods: A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE using the key words ziprasidone, randomized, positron emission tomography, pharmacokinetic, and tolerability. This search looked for open-label or blinded studies of oral ziprasidone use in patients with psychoses (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and/or bipolar mania) published between January 1, 1992, and February 1, 2011. Comparisons with antipsychotics for which there were <3 studies in total were excluded. PSD (all causes) was used as a measure of overall effectiveness. Results: Thirty-one studies were included in the final analysis. The rates of PSD were significantly higher with ziprasidone compared with olanzapine (inefficacy and all causes, P < 0.001) and risperidone (all causes, P = 0.004). In contrast, the rates of PSD due to inefficacy and adverse events were significantly lower with ziprasidone compared with quetiapine (P = 0.03) and haloperidol (P = 0.03), respectively. On dose-response analysis, the rate of all-cause PSD was significantly lower with combined 120-160 mg/d compared with placebo (P = 0.001). Low levels of hyperprolactinemia and weight gain/metabolic adverse events, and moderate extrapyramidal symptoms and corrected QT-interval prolongation were reported with ziprasidone use. Ziprasidone exposure was increased when the medication was administered with food, irrespective of fat content. Ziprasidone 120-160 mg/d was correlated with 60% to 80% occupancy in studies of D-2 binding with the administration of multiple doses. However, the same occupancy was achieved with single-dose administration at much lower doses (20-60 mg/d). Conclusions: The findings from this meta-analysis and review suggest that ziprasidone 120-160 mg/d is a less effective treatment for psychotic disorders compared with olanzapine and risperidone, but that the low levels of hyperprolactinemia and weight gain/metabolic adverse events associated with ziprasidone may make it a useful option in patients in whom antipsychotics are poorly tolerated for these reasons.

The present study tested a large group of amusics (n = 17) and provided evidence that their pitch deficit affects pitch processing in speech to a lesser extent: Fine-grained pitch discrimination was better in spoken syllables than in acoustically matched tones. Unlike amusics, control participants performed fine-grained pitch discrimination better for musical material than for verbal material. These findings suggest that pitch extraction can be influenced by the nature of the material (music vs speech), and that amusics' pitch deficit is not restricted to musical material, but extends to segmented speech events.

However, the benefit may be either due to clearer acoustic correlates to linguistic structures, or simply increased attention from infants induced by IDS exaggerated prosody. This study investigated the pure effect of IDS pitch on lexical tone learning, with attentional/ affective factors removed by using artificial neural networks. Following training with the pitch of Mandarin tones in IDS versus adult-directed speech, the networks yielded equal tonal categorization for both registers. IDS pitch produced no additional linguistic support. IDS pitch appears to strictly play the non-linguistic role of attention/affect, which may indirectly benefit learning.
